(PTC) justification for the increase in bus and MRT fares

during  such  difficult times, when  there  are  expected

tax  and when the transport companies are still reporting

very  decent profits and (b) whether deferring the  PTC's

if  he  (a)  is  satisfied that the transport  companies'

justification  for fare hike is to meet rising  operating

corporate tax, reasonably stable oil prices, cut-back  in

Government  charges  and  lower  unit  labour  cost,  the

factors  causing the operating cost to increase; and  (c)

if  he will consider liberalising the transport sector to

allow  for  more service providers to come in to  further

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Second Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Yock Suan) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs):</b> Mr

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

resignation on Singapore-Malaysia relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comments to the media on 1st July 2002, DPM Dr

Tony Tan and DPM Lee Hsien Loong had both emphasised that

Dr  Mahathir's  decision to step down in 2003  would  not

affect  our bilateral relations with Malaysia.   I  fully

agree.  The three previous leadership changes in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia had been smooth and orderly.  There is no reason

to expect that this transition will be any different.  Dr

Mahathir  remains  Prime Minister  until  after  the  OIC

Meeting  in  Kuala  Lumpur  in  October  2003.   He   has

confirmed  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Datuk  Seri  Abdullah

Badawi as his successor.  DPM Badawi is well known to us.

We  see no reason for any significant change in bilateral

relations  either immediately or in the  long-term.   The

fundamentals  of  Singapore-Malaysia  relations  are  not

dependent on personalities.  As close neighbours, we will

work with whoever is in charge.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRONIC AND INTERNET BANKING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Enhancement of security of depositors' accounts)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what steps will the

Government  take to enhance security of bank  depositors'

accounts   and  to  prevent  erosion  of  confidence   in

electronic  and on-line banking in the light  of  several

recent  hacking incidents and (b) whether the  Government

will  introduce  harsher penalties as deterrent  to  such

acts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MAS has

promulgated   security  guidelines  on   electronic   and

internet  banking for the banking industry.  The security

standards which banks have to comply will include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) maintaining robust risk management controls and

security practices;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) deploying strong cryptography to protect

customer data; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) enhancing surveillance, incident response and

systems recovery capabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the audit and internal monitoring

process, auditors have a duty to evaluate bank compliance

with  these security guidelines.  MAS also maintains  its

own   programme  of  on-site  inspections  and   off-site

reviews.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks are required to assess the risks relating to

their  on-line  banking  products and  adopt  appropriate

security  control  measures to address and  mitigate  the

risks  involved.  They are directly responsible  for  the

safety  and  soundness of the services and  systems  they

provide to their customers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet banking, as with other forms of on-line

banking,  is  not  without risks. These  risks  generally

relate  to impersonation, stealing ID or PIN information,

computer   hacking,  forging  access  to   accounts   and

fraudulent  transactions.  The safety of on-line  banking

is  dependent on the security systems of the bank and the

precautions that customers take to safeguard  their  User

ID  and PIN, as well as protecting the PCs they use.  For

example, customers should install firewall and anti-virus

software on their PCs to block out hackers, and  log  off

their computers when not in use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the recent hacking incident, which

affected a number of DBS customers, the Police are  still

carrying out their investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to DBS, which has been conducting its own

internal investigation, its findings were that the bank's

own  Internet system had not been hacked, but it was  the

customers'  PCs which had been hacked.  By accessing  the

customers'  PCs, the hacker(s) had been able  to  capture

the  PINs and IDs of these customers.  The hacker(s) then

used  the  captured customer information to access  their

accounts to make fraudulent withdrawal transfers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police and DBS have advised the public on

certain  precautionary measures to take and good security

practices to adopt when conducting on-line banking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties for hacking into bank systems are already

prescribed  in the Computer Misuse Act.  These  penalties

have been designed to take account of the severity of the

offence  and the actual or potential damage caused.   For

example, if it can be proved that a hacker broke  into  a

"protected computer system" relating to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



banking and financial services, the Act provides  for  an

enhanced maximum penalty of a $100,000 fine, or 20 years'

imprisonment  or  both.   In  addition  to  the  criminal

penalties,  the court may order a convicted  offender  to

pay  monetary compensation for any damage caused  by  the

offence to the computer system or data.

<div align="center"><b>CONSUMER CREDIT BUREAU</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use of customers' personal financial data)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Deputy

Prime  Minister  and Minister for Finance  what  are  the

conditions imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore

for  the  use of personal financial data of customers  in

the  setting  up  and  operation of the  Consumer  Credit

Bureau by the Association of Banks in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been

an  active  public  debate on the  establishment  of  the

credit  bureau  and,  particularly,  on  confidentiality.

Many  Singaporeans are concerned that the  credit  bureau

will  lead  to a dilution in confidentiality  of  banking

information.  They fear that commercial banks,  with  the

help   of  the  bureau,  will  have  access  to  client's

information  about the state of his or her finances  that

they  were  not  privy to before.  These  are  reasonable

concerns and deserve to be addressed squarely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Act provides the legal framework on the

use of customer information.  This provision is found  in

paragraph  7 of Part II of the Sixth Schedule. Banks  are

only permitted to disclose credit-related information  to

the  recognised  credit bureau such as personal  details,

the   type  and  number  of  credit  facilities  granted,

repayment trends and bankruptcy records.  Banks  are  not

allowed  to disclose deposit information.  This  includes

any   funds,   safe   deposit  boxes  or   safe   custody

arrangements of a customer under management  by  a  bank.

This  is  an important distinction between credit-related

information  and deposit information.  The credit  bureau

and other MAS approved institutions participating in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



bureau  will  only  have access to  a  customer's  credit

history.   The  purpose for such access is restricted  to

the  assessment  of credit-worthiness of  customers,  and

further disclosure to any other person is prohibited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a credit bureau that the banks want to

use  must  demonstrate its ability to  address  financial

privacy  concerns competently, and to discharge its  role

effectively in providing accurate reports.  MAS will only

recognise and gazette the credit bureau when the concerns

are  adequately  addressed, possibly in  the  form  of  a

written code of conduct for the bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a credit bureau fail to maintain the high

standards expected of it, MAS will not hesitate to cancel

its  recognition  of the bureau. Once  this  happens,  it

becomes illegal for banks to provide customer information

to the credit bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS recognises that the Consumer Credit Bureau has

an  important  role  to play in the  financial  industry.

With  the establishment of a credit bureau, members  will

have  more information to anticipate potential  bad  debt

situations before they occur. They will be able to better

manage  their  overall level of bad debts.  Studies  have

also  shown  that credit bureaus in other countries  have

enabled   credit   providers  to  differentiate   between

customers, and manage and price them accordingly.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, can

the   DPM  assure  all  credit  card  members  that   the

information  that  they have supplied to  these  agencies

will not be disclosed without proper safeguards, such  as

their  identity  would not be disclosed?   And  if  their

credit  worthiness is disclosed, their transaction record

should not be disclosed, but rather whether they were  in

good  credit or bad credit.  In other words,  whether  or

not they can afford to pay for their charges, but not the

specifics of what and how they are spending, because many

credit  agencies  have been selling such information,  so

that people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



can  build  shopping profiles and so on  of  credit  card

users.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

purpose  of  the credit bureau is not to sell information

so  that  people  can  build  your  profile.   It  is  to

establish  your borrowing track record, whether  you  are

paying  back  on  time, whether you  have  defaulted,  or

whether  you are bankrupt.  You have to provide the  name

because if you do not provide the name, you cannot  start

to  retrieve data.  But what is associated with that name

is not your deposit information, it is not how much money

you  have,  it  is what accounts you have.   It  is  only

things  like  the  number and type of  credit  facilities

granted,  the repayment trends, whether you are repaying,

bankruptcy  records,  and  whether  you  have  ever  gone

bankrupt or not.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> But what about

transaction records?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I do not believe that

transaction records will be covered.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BUSINESS FEDERATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Mandatory membership)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Ms Indranee Rajah</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry (a) why is there a need for local companies

with  a  paid up share capital of S$500,000 or  more  and

foreign  companies with an authorised  share  capital  of

S$500,000  or  more  to be compelled  by  law  to  become

members of the Singapore Business Federation and  to  pay

subscription fees, and (b) why have they been deprived of

the option to choose whether or not to become members  of

the said Federation.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the

Singapore  Business Federation with mandatory  membership

was  proposed  by  the  former  Singapore  Federation  of

Chambers of Commerce and Industry (SFCCI), as a new  apex

organisation to represent Singapore's business  interests

more  effectively, both locally and abroad.  In  response

to SFCCI's recommendation and after many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



months  of  consultation with members of  the  local  and

international   business  community  in  Singapore,   the

Government  introduced the Singapore Business  Federation

Bill,  providing for mandatory membership of the  SBF  of

all  local  companies  with a  paid-up  capital  of  $0.5

million   and  above,  and  foreign  companies  with   an

authorised capital of $0.5 million and above.   The  Bill

was  passed by this House in October last year,  and  the

SBF was formed in April this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained to this House last year during the

debate   on  the  SBF  Bill  that  we  supported  SFCCI's

recommendation  that  membership of  the  SBF  should  be

mandatory as the earlier practice of voluntary membership

by  business  chambers  and  associations  had  not  been

effective.    The   business   community   had   remained

fragmented despite our best efforts, and lacked a  strong

and   united   private   sector  umbrella   organisation.

Compulsory  membership would ensure that the  SBF  has  a

strong membership base, and has the mandate of the entire

business community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory membership of business chambers can also

be  found  in  other countries.  In France,  Germany  and

Brazil,   for   example,  chambers   of   commerce   have

legislative  rights to collect fees from businesses.   To

ensure  that this requirement will not be unduly  onerous

on  our  companies,  we  have exempted  small  companies,

partnerships and sole proprietorships from having to join

and  contribute to the SBF.  Hence, only local  companies

with   paid-up   capital  and  foreign   companies   with

authorised capital of $0.5 million and above are required

to be members of the SBF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use paid-up capital because it is a simple

criterion  and  generally  correlated  with  size.   MTI,

together  with  the pro-tem committee  of  the  SBF,  did

consider   other  criteria  like  profitability,   annual

turnover  and employment size, but came to the conclusion

that,  whatever  criterion or set of  criteria  we  used,

there  would be difficulties wherever the line was drawn.

In the end, we decided on paid-up capital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



as   the   simplest  and  least  contentious   criterion.

Recognising,  however,  that exemptions  may  be  clearly

justified  based on this criterion, the Act  enables  the

Minister  to allow them.  To date, SBF has preferred  not

to recommend any exempted category because such exemption

might  cause many others not exempted to feel  that  they

too  should  be  exempted.  As the SBF has only  recently

been  formed,  it is still collecting feedback.   If  SBF

decides  that there should be exemptions based  on  clear

criteria and recommends them to me, I will consider  them

carefully.



<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> What would be

the  position  with  regard to companies  which  are  not

trading,   for  example,  investment  holding  companies?

Would this be an appropriate category for an exemption?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I would prefer that such

feedback be given to SBF and for SBF to look at the  full

implications and then put up its recommendations  to  me.

I  should not go behind the SBF to second guess what  its

recommendations should be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Minister to consider that for companies

which  have  a paid-up capital of $500,000, but  actually

became defunct or dormant because their business dealings

are  no  more  active,  should be  exempted  from  paying

subscription fees.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, if these companies

are   de-registered,  then,  obviously,  the   compulsory

membership will not apply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> These companies may not have

been de-registered, but they are active companies with no

real  trading  or  activities going on.   They  are  just

dormant companies.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, it is not easy to

establish  criteria for dormancy.  But if such  criterion

can    be    established   and   the    dormant    status

incontrovertibly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



defined,  then  I  am  sure  SBF  would  recommend  these

companies to me, and I will consider them appropriately.

<div align="center"><b>NEW ELECTRICITY MARKET</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang</b> asked the Minister for

Trade and Industry whether the new electricity market  to

be   launched   later   this  year   will   attract   the

participation  of  a  sufficient  number  of   generation

companies so as to avoid an oligopolistic market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have four generation

licensees selling into the pool at the moment.  Two other

generation  licensees  have  indicated  that   they   are

planning to commission their plants sometime in 2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the number of generation licensees, about

90%  of  the  total installed capacity in our  system  is

concentrated  in  three big generation  companies.  These

companies will have market power for about 12 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies can use this market power to bid up

pool  prices.  To  prevent this, we will  impose  vesting

contracts  on  the  generation companies  to  curb  their

market  power.  Vesting contracts place an obligation  on

the  generation companies to sell part of their  capacity

into  the pool at a specified price. Generation companies

will  have  to  compete to sell the rest of the  capacity

that  is  not  vested into the pool.  With  market  power

removed, the pool price is likely to be competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also prohibit the large gencos from

expanding beyond their current licensed capacity so  long

as vesting contracts are in place. This is to ensure that

the  concentration of capacity and market  power  in  the

generation companies is not perpetuated.  New capacity to

meet demand growth will have to be met



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>

companies.

installed capacity of about 11,000 megawatts of power and

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Education  in  view  of the Ministry's  proposal  to  use

Scholastic  Assessment  Test  (SAT)  scores  besides  the

traditional "A" level grades as an additional measure  of

eligibility for admission into the universities (a)  what

is  the  weightage being given to SAT scores relative  to

entry  requirements, (b) what are the admission  criteria

of  our local universities; and (c) what is the rationale

for instituting SAT.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Education in light of the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



that  several prominent American universities  are  doing

away  with  SAT as a criterion for admission  into  their

universities,  has the Ministry (a) given second  thought

about  the  adoption of SAT as a measure of  a  student's

potential and abilities, (b) obtained any information why

these  universities  are doing  away  with  SAT  and  (c)

consider whether their concerns are also our concerns.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question

Nos. 11 and 12 together, as they are both related to  the

SAT?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> In 1998, the Committee on

University Admission System was convened by the  Ministry

of  Education to examine the present admission system and

propose  changes  where necessary,  taking  into  account

linkages to the rest of the education system and  related

changes  to  the  universities.   In  June  1999,   after

extensive consultation, the Committee submitted a  report

to the Government recommending a new university admission

system.  These proposals were also debated in this  House

during  the Committee of Supply.  The Government accepted

the  recommendations of the Committee.  With effect  from

2003,  SAT  I  will  account for 25%  of  the  university

admission    criteria   for   students   with   `A'-level

qualifications.    `A'-level   results   constitute   the

remaining   75%.    Co-curricular  activities   will   be

allocated  up to 5% as bonus points.  From 2005,  project

work will account for 10%, reducing the weightage of  the

`A'- level results to 65%.  SAT I will remain at 25%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the minimum criteria for admission to NUS or

NTU,  `A'-level students must have passes in at  least  2

subjects  at `A'-level, have taken the General  Paper  at

the  same sitting, have taken a Mother Tongue paper,  and

have  taken  SAT  I.  Of course, these  are  the  minimum

criteria.   Admission,  of course,  is  based  on  merit.

Therefore,  whether  an  applicant  is  successful  in  a

particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



course  will  depend  on his or her results  relative  to

other  applicants  for  the  places  available  on   that

particular course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommended that a reasoning test be

included  as  one component of the admission criteria  to

complement   the  content-based  `A'-level  examinations.

Such  a  test  will enable the universities to  assess  a

candidate's  analytical skills, as well as his  potential

and  ability to deal with generic and new problems.   The

SAT  I  was  chosen  as  it  is  a  well-established  and

internationally recognised reasoning test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question that Mdm Ho raised is with regard

to  the  proposal  last  year by  the  President  of  the

University of California to do away with the SAT I as its

admission  criteria.   This  has  been  well  publicised.

Despite  this, it would be an overstatement to  say  that

"several  prominent American universities are doing  away

with  the  SAT I".  Indeed, according to the  US  College

Board,  about  80% of the US's 1,800 4-year  universities

are currently using SAT I scores in their admissions, and

these universities include prominent institutions such as

Harvard, Stanford and Yale.  They find the SAT I a useful

standardised means of measuring the applicant's readiness

to undertake the university course of study.  And this is

particularly so in the United States where  they  do  not

have  any  standardised examinations at the  high  school

level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a number of suggested reasons as to

why the University of California has proposed to drop the

SAT  I.  According to the President of the University  of

California, it was because the SAT I by itself  does  not

predict  college achievement well.  The UK magazine,  The

Economist,  in commenting on the SAT and the decision  of

the  University of California, suggested that the problem

might  not have been with the reliability or accuracy  of

the  test, but that for political or social reasons,  the

University wanted a different mix of students  than  what

would  have resulted from using the SAT I.  If  so,  such

reasons are not relevant in our context.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assessment is that the current SAT I is a

suitable reasoning test for our purposes.  We use  SAT  I

as   a   complement   to   the  content-based   `A'-level

examinations.   Furthermore,  our  universities   receive

applications from those with other qualifications, eg, we

have   polytechnic  diploma  candidates,  and   we   have

candidates   with  foreign  high  school  qualifications.

Broadening  the basket of admission criteria  allows  the

universities to gain a fuller picture of the student, and

gives  students more opportunities to exhibit their range

of talents and potential for university education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US College Board recently announced a number of

changes  to  SAT  I, to be implemented  from  2005.   The

Ministry  of  Education  and  our  universities  will  be

reviewing  the  implications  of  these  changes  on  our

university admission criteria.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Minister whether it is true  that  some

elements  of  the SAT are coachable; in other  words  the

kids  can be drilled to sit for it.  If this is so, would

the usage of the SAT for admission criteria to university

encourage  the kind of attributes that we are  trying  to

move  our kids away from, which is learning by rote,  and

taking  away  what we wanted out of SAT,  which  is  pure

reasoning skills?



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, some practice with the SAT

I  tests  will be useful for students because  they  will

acquire  certain  familiarities with the  rubric  of  the

examination  paper and the types of questions  that  come

up.  But the content level of these papers is about where

our  students would be if they had completed  their  `O'-level  English and Mathematics.  So, any further  efforts

required  will really not be necessary, because  if  they

have  got their `O'-level Mathematics and Language,  that

should really be sufficient as content material for  them

to  take the SAT I, and, after that, it is really a  test

of their reasoning and critical thinking abilities.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT SITUATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Update)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

if he will provide an update on the employment situation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

line  with  the improvement in the economy,  retrenchment

moderated in the first quarter of 2002.  A total of 4,857

workers were laid off during this period.  This level was

close to half that in each of the preceding two quarters.

However,  job  creation  continues  to  be  weak.   Total

employment  has  declined by about 14,000  in  the  first

quarter  this year for the third successive  quarter,  as

the  lagged  effects of the economic downturn  last  year

continued to affect demand for manpower. The losses  were

concentrated  in  the construction sector,  about  10,000

jobs,  due  to  persistent declines in both  private  and

public  building  activities.   Manufacturing  employment

fell  by  about 2,000, less sharply than in the preceding

three  quarters, owing to some recovery in  manufacturing

activities.    Services   producing    industries    also

experienced cut-backs in employment, about 2,000 jobs, in

the quarter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the seasonally adjusted overall

unemployment  has reached a high of 4.5%  in  March  this

year.   The  rate is expected to rise to about 5-5.5%  in

the  later half of this year, as there is usually  a  lag

between the economic recovery and employment growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If recovery continues, we can expect more creation

of  new  jobs particularly in favour of those with higher

skills and knowledge.  However, many of the jobs lost  in

this  downturn  are unlikely to return as companies  that

have   moved  out  or  down-sized  their  operations   in

Singapore  are unlikely to restart such activities  here.

This is especially so for the low-end manufacturing jobs.

Hence,  workers  must  acquire skills  for  new  jobs  in

different industries and be prepared to move to where new

jobs  can  be  found and not wait for  familiar  ones  to

return.  Only then can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



we expect unemployment to come down next year.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND CONTRIBUTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Waiver of interest for late payment by employers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  whether he will consider waiving  the  interest

chargeable  on  employers  for late  payment  of  Central

Provident  Fund  contributions  during  this  period   of

recession.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, currently, the CPF Board already  provides

employers with a grace period of 14 days after the end of

the  month when contributions are due.  Penalty  interest

is  charged after the grace period so that members  would

not  lose  out on the interest that is due  to  them  had

their  employers been prompt in their payment.   This  is

also to deter employers from delaying CPF payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers have the obligation to pay the full

amount   of  their  employees'  CPF  promptly.   CPF   is

considered as part of the employees' wages and  employers

should not delay CPF payment, just as they must not delay

payment of wages when wages are due.  Moreover, many  CPF

members   use   their  CPF  monies  for  their   housing,

healthcare,  children's education  and  insurance  needs.

Late  payment  of  CPF  contributions  would  affect  the

employees' usage of their CPF for these on-going needs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in these

difficult  times, is the Minister willing  to  waive  the

interest if the member consents to it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the CPF Board takes no

pleasure in imposing penalty on employers who are late in

their  CPF payments.  We are sympathetic to the employers

and  to  companies that have cash flow difficulties,  and

are  not able to meet the payments on time.  That is  why

we  give  them a grace period of two weeks  to  make  the

adjustment.  We do not impose a penalty immediately.  But

if we were to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



take  Mr  Chiam's  suggestion, and take  a  very  relaxed

approach and say "Well, if you cannot pay, do not  worry,

you  pay  when you can", then we must look at  the  other

side of the coin - the impact of such a policy on the CPF

members could be quite tremendous.  We will have to  bear

in  mind, as I said in my main answer, CPF members depend

upon  timely  crediting of their CPF  contributions  into

their  accounts  so  that  they can  meet  their  housing

mortgage repayments.  They may have to pay hospital bills

for themselves or for their dependants.  They may have to

withdraw money to pay for their children's education,  if

they  have  taken out a loan against their CPF under  the

Education Scheme.  So, if we allow employers to delay the

payment  and  if  we do not have any measures  that  will

encourage,  and, in fact, compel employers to meet  their

statutory  obligations  on time,  we  will  end  up  with

questions in Parliament by other Members asking why is it

that the Board is not recovering or helping employees  to

have  their CPF credited on time.  And, we will  have  to

answer those other questions instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to have a balanced policy. Where we can,

if  there  are  really  genuine reasons,  the  Board  can

consider  giving  some extension/grace period.   But  the

Board cannot say it will not impose penalties or it  will

just  overlook late payments and allow employers  to  get

off  scot-free,  because if we adopt that  approach  then

many  more employers may choose not to pay their  CPF  on

time  and  then we can run into hundreds of thousands  of

workers, CPF members, having difficulties.  And who  will

answer to them?  Certainly, Mr Chiam would not be here to

answer  to  all  these  people who find  that  their  CPF

accounts  are  not credited on time and they  have  great

difficulties meeting their financial obligations.  So,  I

suggest  that Mr Chiam look at the issue from both  sides

of the coin - from the employers, we are sympathetic, but

we  cannot  ignore  the  needs  and  the  rights  of  the

employees.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of policy on 3-room flats)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether there is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



need to review the HDB policy on 3-room flats in view  of

the demand now for such flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB stopped building 3-room flats

since  1985 because there was already a sufficient number

of  3-room units in the resale market to meet the  demand

from  Singaporeans, who increasingly preferred the larger

flat types.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, to meet the housing needs of lower-income families and to ensure that there are smaller

flats  available to them at affordable prices, HDB has  a

scheme to buy back 3-room flats.  Under this scheme,  HDB

buys  3-room flats from the open market at market  prices

and  offers them for sale at discounted prices,  so  that

they are affordable to 90% of Singaporean households.  On

average,  about 90 of the 150 units of 3-room flats  that

HDB offers for sale each month are taken up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are not eligible for the buy-back

scheme and want a 3-room flat, they can opt for one  from

the  open market, where there are more than 200,000  such

units available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of 3-room flats in the market.

The  volume of resale transactions for 3-room  flats  has

remained  healthy  and  steady in  the  last  few  years.

Hence, my Ministry does not intend to change HDB's policy

on  3-room  flats.   We  will  nevertheless  continue  to

monitor the supply and demand for 3-room flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> The Minister said

earlier that HDB stopped building 3-room flats in 1985 as

a  result of lower demand for smaller flats.  Was it  not

announced  then that HDB was ready to build 3-room  flats

again if demand rose?  Is the demand for 3-room flats not

escalating  as  a  result of more  families  downgrading,

singles  buying 3-room flats and JTC's purchase to  house

its foreign workers under the SHIFT Scheme?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> We do not detect that there is a

major  increase  in the demand for 3-room  flats.   As  I

indicated  in  my reply just now, in fact, we  have  more

than  sufficient 3-room flats in the market, both resale,

for  those who want to buy a resale flat, as well as new,

meaning the buy-back flats.  HDB buys back and sells at a

discounted price something like 150 such flats  a  month.

Not  all  of them are taken up.  So, I do not agree  with

the  Member  that there is a very sharp increase  in  the

demand for 3-room flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, am I right to say that 3-room

flats  are selling at least $20,000 above valuation,  and

one  was even sold at $50,000 above valuation?  Does this

not  indicate that demand outstrips supply?  Is this  not

causing  unhealthy  and inflated public  housing  prices?

And  will  this not affect other types of public  housing

prices  in  the end?  How would the Minister  respond  to

this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> HDB does monitor 3-room resale flat

prices.   So  far, the indications are that there  is  no

such  sharp increase in 3-room flat prices.  The examples

that the Member mentioned just now may well be true.  But

I would suggest that they are probably anecdotal, because

we  do monitor 3-room flat prices on a regular basis, and

they  have  been steady over the last few  quarters,  and

they  have  been  rising or falling  marginally,  but  in

tandem  with  the  rest of the resale  market.   So,  our

figures do not suggest that there is this sharp spike  in

3-room resale flat prices.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it

is  not  the  Government's present  policy  to  encourage

Singaporeans not to over-invest in property?   Therefore,

will  this  demand for smaller flats be increasing?   And

why  is the Minister not promoting and facilitating  this

policy,  and  instead choking the supply of these  3-room

flats?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> No, we are not choking the supply.

In fact, as I took pains to explain, the supply is there.

If  one wants a 3-room flat tomorrow, he just walks  into

an HDB sale office and he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



would  be  able  to  get one.  So,  there  is  really  no

question of a shortage of supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, does the

Minister agree that whilst the HDB buys back 3-room flats

and  sells them to eligible applicants, it will mean that

applicants  cannot apply directly to HDB for  new  flats?

For those who wish to downgrade but do not want to buy  a

flat from the open market, they cannot apply directly  to

HDB  for  a 3-room flat, because HDB is not building  any

more  new 3-room flats.  The Minister mentioned that  the

HDB cannot detect any demand for HDB 3-room flats.  Can I

suggest  that HDB announce its intention to build  3-room

flats and open it to applicants?  Then, the Minister  can

see the demand and justify his statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> As for the last part of the

question, as I said, we have got 200,000 3-room flats  in

the  open  market,  and we are buying back  3-room  flats

regularly.   Then  we  re-sell  these  3-room  flats   at

discounted prices.  So, anybody, as he suggested  in  the

first  part  of his question, who wants to buy  a  3-room

flat at a discounted price, not at resale flat price, can

go  to HDB and apply.  And if he is eligible, he can  get

one.   There  are  many  3-room flats  available  in  the

market.  So, where is the shortage?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am talking about a new 3-room flat built by the HDB for sale, rather than a flat

which was bought back by the HDB from the open market and

for sale.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I really do not see why HDB should

build  new  3-room flats when there are so many available

in  the  market,  whether it is for sale at  open  market

prices or for sale at discounted prices.  I think  it  is

quite ridiculous for HDB to start building new flats  and

then  gauge the demand.  It does not make economic  sense

at  all.  We stopped building in 1985 precisely for  that

reason.  The demand was no longer there.  Now that  there

is  a  demand for 3-room flats - I am not denying that  - there  is  a way for us to satisfy that demand in  a  way

which is most sensible for the total housing market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister saying that if

the HDB is going to build 3-room flats, the selling price

will  be  the same or higher than the current  discounted

price  that the HDB bought the flat from the open  market

for sale to applicants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, HDB does not build new 3-room

flats.  So there is no comparison.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The Minister just said earlier that

there  is  a  demand for 3-room flats.   May  I  ask  the

Minister  whether  it  was not his  assurance,  announced

during the Budget Statement debate, that his Ministry had

made  it a policy to make housing more responsive to  the

needs  of  people and enable Singaporeans to  purchase  a

flat  according to their budget?  May I now call on  this

to be fulfilled?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, we have made that commitment

and  we fully intend to meet that commitment.  We did not

say  that affordable housing has to be a new 3-room flat.

A  resale 3-room flat, which is bought back from the open

market  and sold at an affordable price, will  also  make

such  housing available to people who want a 3-room flat.

There are other choices, of course.  But since the Member

is  concentrating  on 3-room flats, my answer  refers  to

such  flats.    There are also 4-room  and  5-room  flats

which  are  affordable.  But if a person so  chooses  and

wants  to  have a 3-room flat for whatever  reason,  such

flats  are readily available.  So, I do not see what  the

problem is.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he

would  consider allowing singles to also purchase  4-room

HDB  flats, instead of just 3-room HDB flats,  so  as  to

ease  the demand for 3-room flats and, at the same  time,

giving more choices to singles for purchase of a flat?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Neo, I think that is a different

question  altogether.  I do not think you need to  answer

that question, Mr Mah.  It is on 4-room flats.  It is not

on 3-room flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, talking about buy-back policy, I just want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



to confirm with the Minister whether HDB can now buy back

any 3-room flat from the market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is not a new policy. It is

a  policy which has been in place for quite a while.  HDB

has  been buying back 3-room flats from the open  market.

So  this  is not a new policy.  It is a policy which  HDB

has  followed  consistently.   They  have  actually  been

selling such flats in the open market for quite some time

as well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, can I seek your

indulgence?   My question earlier was related  because  I

was  referring to how to address the shortage  of  3-room

flats.   Therefore,  I  asked  about  whether  HDB  would

consider allowing singles to buy 4-room flats as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I relent this time. She asked a

question, Mr Mah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I was going to answer the question,

Mr Speaker, because I think there is some relation.  But,

really,  the question pertains to our policy on  allowing

singles  to purchase HDB flats, whether it is 3-room,  4-room  or 5-room.  We do not, at the moment, allow singles

to   purchase  4-room  flats  unless  they  are   jointly

purchasing  with another single under the  Joint  Singles

Scheme.   But  if they are on their own,  they  can  only

purchase a 3-room flat.  So, that is the singles policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other limb of the Member's question about

shortage  of 3-room flats, as I tried to explain earlier,

I do not believe that there is a shortage of 3-room flats

in  the  market.  Of course, if the question  is  whether

there  is  a  shortage of new 3-room flats,  the  answer,

obviously,  is yes, because we have not been building  3-room flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, can I seek your patience for one

more  question?  Can the Minister assure this House  that

the scheme to help the lower-income families to own their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>

3-room HDB flats will not be further disadvantaged?   Can

he  assure this House on that, and that the prices of the

3-room HDB flats are not increasing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, I can assure the Member that

we will continue to make 3-room buy-back flats affordable

to the lower-income households.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, in my

constituency,  there are a lot of 3-room flat  residents.

When  they  upgrade to 4-room flats, they  find  it  very

difficult to sell their 3-room flats.  At the end of  the

day,  HDB  buys them back and rents them to  Jurong  Town

Corporation  (JTC),  and  JTC, in  turn,  rents  them  to

foreign  workers.   My  residents  have  complained  that

sometimes  there were so many foreign workers staying  in

their  block.  All these were unsold 3-room flats.  Could

certain regulations be imposed on 3-room flats rented  to

JTC?   We  should  not rent all these  flats  to  foreign

workers.   Maybe we could rent these flats to  those  who

really need 3-room flats at a further discount.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think the Member is referring to

the SHIFT programme, which is administered by Jurong Town

Corporation.  Under this scheme, what JTC does is that it

rents, on long lease, a certain number of flats from HDB,

and  then  after  that, it subsequently  sub-rents  these

flats  to  people who come here to work in Singapore,  on

either work permit or on employment pass.  So, who  these

people  are, we leave it to JTC.  But whoever  they  rent

the  flats  to  must continue to abide by the  rules  and

regulations  of  HDB, whether it is in  noise  standards,

keeping of cats, or sub-letting of flats, etc.  So  I  do

not  see  what the problem is.  So long as we  make  sure

that the sub-tenants of JTC comply with the HDB rules and

regulations,  then I do not think that  we  ought  to  be

unduly worried.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for

National Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



whether  he will consider helping the HDB lessees  repair

the spalling concrete in their flats.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

spalling   concrete   is  the   result   of   a   natural

deterioration  process  called  carbonation.   When   the

surface  concrete is carbonated, corrosion of  the  steel

bars within the slab sets in. The corroded steel expands,

thus  causing the concrete surrounding the steel bars  to

crack.   This  problem may affect flat  owners  as  their

flats become older.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Lease agreement, HDB flat owners are

responsible for the repair of spalling concrete in  their

flats.   HDB flat owners who encounter spalling  concrete

problems  in  their flats can, however,  report  them  to

their respective HDB Branch Offices.  HDB can assist  the

flat  owners  to  investigate the problem  and  recommend

appropriate  remedial action.  For flat owners  who  have

difficulties  in finding a suitable repair contractor  on

their  own,  HDB can also assist to provide them  with  a

list  of repair contractors, whom they can negotiate with

on a strictly private basis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I

ask  the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary, when  does  HDB

expect a new flat to have spalling concrete problem?  Can

he give us the number of years?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, there is what we

know  as  a  defect  liability  period.   For  new  flats

selected  by  the buyers within a year, the HDB  will  be

obliged to ask the contractor to come back to repair  any

defects.   So,  if  the flat is within the  one-year  old

period,  then the spalling concrete, if it occurs,  would

be a workmanship problem.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> I would like a

clarification  from  the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary.

Currently,  for  flats that are above 20 years  old,  ie,

those  built in the early 1980s, there are about  450,000

flats, and there was a scheme of three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



years,  and  only about 2%, ie, 17,000 flats  were  given

assistance.   In 1987, there was a change in the  quality

of  concrete,  from 20 to 30.  And because  of  that,  we

notice  that  there  is a difference  in  the  degree  of

spalling  concrete in the newer flats,  but  not  in  the

older  flats.  So, I would like to appeal to the Ministry

to  consider helping those flats that are above 20  years

old in the IUP or the MUP.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first

of  all,  under  the MUP programme, HDB repairs  spalling

concrete  defects  on a goodwill basis,  for  the  simple

reason  that these flats would be very old.  In order  to

qualify  for MUP, the flats would be way above  10  years

old.  Spalling concrete is a problem of an aging process.

Flats  need maintenance.  As flats age, problems set  in.

So spalling concrete is a maintenance problem.  It is not

a  design  or workmanship problem.  New flats have  fewer

problems.  That is the reason why the Member pointed  out

that  flats  built after 1990s, for example,  have  fewer

problems  because they are young.  When we are young,  we

have  no  problems.  We have no arthritis, or rheumatism.

As  we  grow  older, problems set in.  So we will  see  a

specialist or a doctor.  It is not true that flats  built

in  the  early  80s  have  a high incidence  of  spalling

concrete.   They  have high incidence  because  they  are

older.   You  ask  any  doctor, he will  say  that  older

patients have more problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB conducted two goodwill repairs over two periods.

In  1988,  HDB conducted a goodwill repair, and  repaired

flats  with spalling concrete defects.  75,000 households

benefited  from  that goodwill repair  and  it  cost  the

Government  $30 million - big money in those days.   Then

in  1995  to 1998, HDB conducted another goodwill  repair

scheme  for  something like 27,000 households.   So  with

these  two  goodwill repair schemes completed, HDB  feels

that there are very few spalling concrete defects left in

the  flats.  Those that come on-stream now would be taken

care of during the MUP programme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I ask the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary,  based on natural deterioration  of  concrete,

which he mentioned as carbonation, how many years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



does  he  think  a  new flat built by  HDB  will  have  a

spalling  concrete  problem?  My  understanding  is  that

concrete,  if  properly constructed, can last  60  years.

Maybe he can let us know how long it can last.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

concrete,  if well maintained, can last for a long  time,

longer  than 60 years.  But during the durability period,

there will be minor repairs here and there.  The spalling

concrete  needs  routine maintenance, which  we  need  to

cater for flats which are way above 10 years old.  So  in

our environment which is high in moisture, and in certain

places which is high in carbon dioxide, carbonation takes

place faster.  For example, in the kitchen area which  is

heavily used for cooking, then we will find that spalling

concrete may occur faster than in the living room.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the

Senior Parliamentary Secretary to give us some statistics

to  show that spalling concrete only happens in the older

flats  and not the newer flats, especially in 1987,  when

there was a change in the grade of concrete.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

done some studies on the correlation between the age of a

building  and the instances of spalling concrete  defects

per  thousand flats.  For flats built before 1983,  flats

which  are  about  18 years old, the number  of  spalling

concrete  defects is 39.3 per thousand  households.   For

flats  built between 1983-1986, the number of defects  is

25.9  per  thousand households.  For flats built  between

1987-1990, the number of defects is very low, ie, 1.8 per

thousand households because they are very young.  And for

very  new  flats built between 1991-2002, the defects  of

course   is   miniscule,  1.5  incidents   per   thousand

households.   So Members can see that the correlation  is

very  simple.   When the flats are young, there  are  few

problems.  When they are old, there are lots of problems.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I clarify with the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary?  He said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



that after 10 years, we can expect spalling concrete.  Am

I correct in saying that?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> If it is not maintained.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> All HDB flats are properly

maintained by the town councils.  May I say to the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary that it is not true  that  it  is

just   a   maintenance  problem.   It  is   the   design,

construction  and  maintenance  that  will   affect   the

durability of the concrete structure.  So, the design and

construction are important.  We have many new flats built

in  the  1990s  using grade concrete,  and  yet  we  have

spalling concrete problems.  Does it mean that the HDB is

going to repair all these spalling concrete problems  for

flats built in the 90s?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> For these cases, perhaps

the  Member  would  like to highlight  to  the  Ministry.

Basically, spalling concrete happens within the flat, and

it is outside the purview of the town council.  I am sure

all  town  councils  in Singapore maintain  their  common

property very well.  The spalling concrete is an internal

matter.   It is between the flat owner and his  property.

A  simple maintenance like repainting, for example,  will

prevent  carbon dioxide from penetrating the outer  layer

of the concrete, thereby corroding the steel bars.  As  I

said,  if the flat is within one year old, we are obliged

to  repair.   If it is outside one year, we will  take  a

look,  but the flat owner must repair.  Spalling concrete

is  a  slow  process.   It  is easily  detected.   It  is

inexpensively  repaired.  One can do it  himself  if  the

repair area is small, meaning 1.5 square metres.   If  it

is  larger, he can always contact a contractor.  HDB has,

through the two goodwill programmes, trained hundreds  of

contractors  who are competent in repairing the  spalling

concrete.  And the cost is very cheap, ranging  from  $50

to a few hundred dollars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

whether   the   Senior   Parliamentary   Secretary    has

statistical data on spalling concrete, so as  to  compare

the older Tiong Bahru estate at Seng Poh Road area, built

before the HDB, with flats that were built



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



in  the 80s.  And does he honestly believe that the grade

of  concrete that was used in the construction, and  also

the  workmanship in which the steel bars were  placed  at

the  correct  interval, are important factors  that  will

decide  whether  or not there is spalling  concrete?   He

also  said  that when one gets old, he is more  prone  to

sickness  and he compared it to spalling concrete.   Does

he  also  agree  that if a person is born  with  a  wrong

genetic  heritage, he may not live that old but  can  get

sick very fast?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I think I am

qualified to speak about the conditions of flats in Tiong

Bahru,  being  the  MP for the last 10  years.   Spalling

concrete does occur in Tiong Bahru flats, like all flats.

In  all concrete buildings, spalling concrete will occur.

It  is a matter of when.  If the flat is maintained well,

spalling concrete appears much later down the road.   The

design  of  the flat, as well as the grade  of  concrete,

does affect the occurrence of spalling concrete.  At  any

one  time, HDB flats are designed according to the latest

building  codes.   So  there is no  question  of  cutting

corners in the construction of the HDB flats.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> The Senior Parliamentary

Secretary stated that it is the owner's responsibility to

maintain  and  repair  spalling concrete.   But  spalling

concrete  always happens at the slab that is between  two

flat  units.  And the leakage of the moisture  is  always

from  the upper unit going down to the slab and into  the

lower  unit itself.  In such a case, it is difficult  for

the owner of the lower flat to maintain that slab that is

affecting  the  owner  below.   So  would  the   Ministry

consider  helping  the owner in the  repair  of  spalling

concrete?   I  would like to appeal to  the  Ministry  to

seriously look into this under the IUP.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

spalling concrete is a symptom of a ceiling leak  between

the  upper  and the lower households, then the  HDB  will

take a look at it and give advice accordingly.  If it  is

a  case  of pure spalling concrete, then it is simple  to

repair, because the owner has absolute control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



over his ceiling.  He does not need to interfere with the

neighbour  upstairs.   If  it is  a  case  of  a  ceiling

leakage,  ie, water seeping through the toilet,  then  it

needs  the  cooperation of two parties - the upper  floor

neighbour  and  the lower floor neighbour.   The  law  is

quite   clear   that   both  parties   must   share   the

responsibility.  Sometimes, both parties cannot  come  to

an  agreement, either because of the timing or the nature

of  the repair, in which case HDB will step in and be the

expert counsel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary has put the blame of  maintenance

on  the real cost of spalling concrete.  I would like  to

explain  to my residents what does maintenance  mean  and

what   it   takes  to  maintain.   So,  can  the   Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary make available  a  list  to  the

public on the maintenance that is necessary and, if  they

do  the maintenance, how many more years they would  earn

before spalling concrete sets in?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The simplest form of

maintenance is to repaint the ceiling of the flat, as and

when is required.  If we use good water-proof paint,  for

example,  then  it should last between 5-7  years.   Some

paints  are  moisture  resistant.  So,  by  painting  the

ceiling of the flat, it will prevent carbon dioxide  from

penetrating  the  surface of the  concrete.   The  carbon

dioxide  reacts with the alkaline on the steel  bars  and

therefore  reduces  the rust-proof nature  of  the  steel

bars.   So  Members  should advise the flat  dwellers  to

paint their flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I take

exception  to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary's  reply

that  the problem of spalling concrete is not due to poor

workmanship.  Is he not aware that poor workmanship  has,

in  fact,  been stated as the cause of spalling  concrete

problem  in this House, maybe not by his present Minister

but  by previous Ministers in the House?  Why is it  that

residents  are made to pay for repair to a problem  which

is,  in  fact,  inherent?  Is he not  aware  that  in  my

constituency,  and  in  many other  constituencies,  this

problem has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



evident since the day the flats were completed, and  this

is  particularly true in my constituency when  the  flats

were  built  in the 1980s?  So, is it not time  that  HDB

dealt  with the problem, instead of now just telling  the

people to paint their ceilings?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

mentioned earlier on that the Government carried out  two

goodwill  programmes, one in 1988 and  another  in  1995-1998.  With these two programmes, the flats in Bedok, for

example,  would have been completely taken care  of.   If

any spalling concrete did occur because of workmanship, I

do not agree.



<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, Mdm Phua

mentioned about the goodwill repairs during the  IUP.   I

have  flats which have gone through the IUP and they have

the  accelerated programme.  After the IUP, the  spalling

concrete  persists.   Maybe  the  HDB  can  consider  the

goodwill repairs to start for these flats.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> I believe that if

spalling concrete did occur after IUP, it could be a case

of  ceiling  leakage,  in which case,  the  Member  could

advise his residents to appeal to him, and he could  then

write  in to the Ministry.  It could be a case of ceiling

leakage.   The early stage of spalling concrete makes  it

difficult  for contractors to decide whether it  is  pure

spalling concrete or a case of ceiling leakage.   But  in

any case, as I said earlier on, during the MUP period, we

will  do  a major goodwill repair.  After IUP,  there  is

MUP.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior

Parliamentary   Secretary  whether  it   is   the   HDB's

responsibility   to  design  flats   according   to   the

respective  uses in the flat?  If it is the kitchen,  and

we know there are cooking activities, we have to design a

ceiling  that  can withstand the smoke and  oil,  and  it

should  last.  But spalling concrete occurs  in  bedrooms

also.  So, how do we maintain the ceilings of bedrooms?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  know  about spalling concrete in the bedrooms.   For

spalling  concrete to occur, basically,  carbon  dioxide,

moisture and oxygen need to penetrate the surface  layer.

I  am  sure  these  are exceptional cases.   We  will  be

interested to take a look at them.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, I am utterly confused.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mdm Phua, let the Minister reply first.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> All right. I am sorry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two

issues  here.  The first issue is: what is the  cause  of

the  spalling  concrete?  If the cause  of  the  spalling

concrete  is  due to the design, as some Members  allege,

and  it can be proven as such, then obviously it is HDB's

responsibility  to fix it, either in  the  flat  that  is

currently affected by spalling concrete or to fix  it  in

future designs.  But if it is a matter of deterioration - natural   wear   and   tear  -   then,   obviously,   the

responsibility lies with the owner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if any Member of the House here feels that

flats  in  his  constituency or estate  are  affected  by

spalling  concrete  due  to design  or  poor  workmanship

problems, then, by all means, please take it up with  the

Ministry and, if we can establish the cause, we will take

the  necessary measures.  There is no point in trying  to

lump the two issues into one because, obviously, there is

a limit to the kind of maintenance that HDB can carry out

in  the  flats.  HDB flats are 10, 15, 20, 30 years  old.

Wear  and  tear takes place, and some of the repairs  and

maintenance  must be undertaken by the owners themselves.

This  is  perfectly normal.  If the wear and  tear  takes

place  after 10-15 years, to expect the HDB to  undertake

repairs is obviously not fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, of course, we spend a

considerable amount of money going back to the flats  for

interim  upgrading, main upgrading, goodwill repairs  and

so on and so forth.  So, I do not think it is fair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



for  Members to suggest that HDB, after selling the flats

to  our residents, just walks away and forgets about  it.

In  fact,  on  the contrary, our after sales  service  is

probably  far  superior to any private sector  developer.

Members  can ask a private sector developer - whether  it

is City Developments, Far East Organisation or whoever  - after  five  years of living in your flat  and  something

goes  wrong, ask them to come back and look at your flat,

I think Members here will know what the answer is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mdm Phua, do you want to ask your

question?



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, the Minister has clarified.

I would like to thank the Minister for agreeing to handle

the exceptions.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I make a suggestion, or  maybe  it  is

already  being  done  at  the HDB?   Perhaps,  some  best

practices ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ms Braema, you can only ask a

supplementary question.  You cannot make suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Or I can turn it ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let us try.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, where private high-rise buildings are concerned, I would like to know, for

the  same  time  span,  what is the  number  of  spalling

concrete  defects  as  compared to those  in  HDB  flats.

Perhaps from here there are some learning points.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

obviously,  we  do  not  compile  statistics  of  private

dwellings,  but  we do receive feedback  from  buyers  of

private  condominiums that they suffer the same problems.

But  these  problems are not highlighted  in  the  public

domain like HDB flat defects are.  Having said that,  the

Building  and Construction Authority (BCA) does  what  we

call  a  CONQUAS  survey.  CONQUAS  is  the  acronym  for

Construction Quality Assessment System.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



We found that the quality of HDB flats is the same as the

quality  of private condominiums, by and large.  And,  as

the  Minister has rightly pointed out, HDB does a lot  of

goodwill repairs.  They do a lot of follow-up.  They give

expert consultations.  They try to rope in contractors to

repair and, sometimes, they even bargain on behalf of the

consumers to get a low price from the contractor.

National  Development  (a)  why  is  there  a  need   for

residents  to pay a privatisation fee when their  Housing

and  Urban  Development Company flats are privatised  and

(b)  what is the basis for setting the amount payable  by

the residents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> First of all, let me thank Mr Chiam for

raising a question which has caused some confusion on the

ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flats in HUDC Phases III & IV were sold under

the  Housing and Development Act.  Like HDB flat lessees,

these  lessees own neither the land on which their  flats

are  built, nor the car parks and common areas  of  their

estate.  They are thus required to pay about $25,000  per

flat  for the conversion of their flat leases into strata

titles.  Most of this cost - about $20,000 per flat -  is

the cost of purchasing the common property from HDB.  The

residents have to pay this sum because they did  not  pay

for  this common property, such as the car parks, at  the

point  of  original  purchase.  The cost  of  the  common

property is computed taking into account the net car park

income  forgone for the remaining period  of  the  lease.

The  remaining $5,000 comprises costs incurred by HDB for

survey  fees, legal fees and construction works necessary

to  comply  with  statutory building  control  and  other

requirements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, for lessees in HUDC estates in

Phases  I  &  II, these are governed by the HUDC  Housing

Estates Act.  I want to emphasise that they were sold  on

different terms.  In particular, these lessees would  pay

lower  conversion  costs, because they  already  own  the

common  areas  of  the estate.  For  these  lessees,  the

privatisation process involves mainly the land and strata

subdivisions and the transfer of the legal title  of  the

land from HDB to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By paying conversion costs, these flat owners would

be  able to own the common property as tenants-in-common.

Through  privatisation,  they  would  also  enjoy   other

benefits,  such  as  the autonomy to manage  and  upgrade

their  estates according to their needs and  aspirations,

and  will  no longer be subject to HDB's restrictions  on

the use, ownership and resale of their flats.

<div align="center"><b>(Classification of Singapore as "Tier 2" country)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs if he will comment on the report released by  the

United States State Department classifying Singapore as a

"Tier  2"  country, alongside countries such  as  Angola,

Bangladesh,  Burkina  Faso,  Ethiopia,  Haiti,   Nigeria,

Pakistan and Sierra Leone, in not doing enough to  combat

human trafficking across borders.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, since 2001, the US State Department is

obliged  by  law to issue an annual report on trafficking

in  persons.  The legislation that obliges the  US  State

Department   to   issue   this   report   requires    the

classification of countries into three tiers.  Mr Tan Soo

Khoon  referred  to  the  recent  US  State  Department's

Trafficking  in  Persons  Report 2002,  which  classified

Singapore as a "Tier 2" country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I detect Mr Tan's surprise with Singapore's

classification.  Indeed, so am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



I.   The  criteria  used by the US  State  Department  to

determine  which tier a country should be  placed  under,

include  the  government's efforts to, firstly,  prohibit

trafficking and punishing acts of trafficking;  secondly,

prescribe punishment commensurate for grave crimes,  such

as forcible sexual assault, for the knowing commission of

trafficking in some of its most reprehensible forms,  eg,

trafficking for sexual purposes and trafficking involving

rape or kidnapping; thirdly, prescribe punishment that is

sufficiently  stringent  to  deter  and  that  adequately

reflects  the  offence's heinous nature;  and,  fourthly,

make   serious   and  sustained  efforts   to   eliminate

trafficking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, "Tier 1" countries are those which the US

considers  to  have fully met these criteria.   "Tier  2"

countries  are those which the US considers to be  making

significant  efforts  towards  meeting  these   criteria.

"Tier 3" countries are those which the US considers to be

the  worst offenders.  These are countries which  do  not

meet  these  criteria  and  are  not  making  significant

efforts towards meeting them.  But of note is what the US

Under  Secretary  of State for Global Affairs,  Ms  Paula

Dobriansky, who, in Congress, admitted on 19th June that,

"Honest  people  can disagree on the tier  placements  of

certain countries."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the second year the US State Department

has  issued  a  Trafficking in Persons Report.   In  last

year's  report,  the US State Department also  classified

Singapore   as   a   "Tier   2"  country,   despite   the

acknowledgement  in  the report that  Singapore  met  the

minimum  standards set out in the criteria I have listed.

We did not agree with this classification, as we were the

only  country  in  "Tier  2"  to  have  met  the  minimum

standards but still placed in "Tier 2" instead  of  "Tier

1".  We pointed out inaccuracies in the report to the  US

Embassy here in Singapore but some continued to appear in

this  year's report.  Sir, we will continue to point  out

inaccuracies  in  this annual report to  the  US  Embassy

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House and Singaporeans know very well

Singapore's  tough  stance,  as  reflected  in   concrete

measures against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



illegal  immigration, including trafficking  of  persons.

Our  laws  protect  women  and  children,  and  meet  all

international  norms pertaining to the security  and  the

safe   passage   of  visitors  to  this   country.    Our

enforcement agencies remain vigilant to the potential for

Singapore   to  be  used  as  a  destination  for   human

trafficking.  Tough legislation, coupled with  stepped-up

enforcement  on  land  as  well  as  the  waters   around

Singapore, and the further tightening of border  controls

at the land, air and sea checkpoints are but only some of

the  ways  that  we deter illegal immigration  and  human

trafficking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no country, not even the US, can claim to be

completely  immune to the problems of human  trafficking.

Indeed, some will say that the US has problems of its own

in  this  area  and  falls short  of  its  own  criteria.

Singapore  has its own laws and procedures to  deal  with

the  matter  in a realistic and practical way which  work

for  us.  We will continue to improve our approach as  it

suits us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, given our very strict laws

and our vigilance on this matter, may I just say that not

only  was  I  surprised at our inclusion as  a  "Tier  2"

country,  but I was very unhappy.  Can I ask  the  Senior

Minister  of State what is the response of the  US  State

Department or the US Embassy to the disagreement that  we

have lodged with them?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think it is a

continuing dialogue.  For example, when we received  last

year's  report,  we  corresponded  with  the  US  Embassy

setting  out the inaccuracies, eg, for stating  Singapore

to  be a destination country for trafficking of women for

sexual exploitation.  We said that this was not so.   But

this  inaccuracy  was  again  reflected  in  this  year's

report.   So  it is a matter of continuing dialogue.   We

will  continue to point out these inaccuracies to the  US

Embassy and, over time, to convince them that we are  not

what  they say we are.  But what is more important,  Sir,

is  that  Singaporeans here know of the  tough  laws  and

measures, and our position on this matter.  For  example,

even in the US Congress, the Under Secretary herself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



said  that  people  can debate about  the  criteria  and,

indeed, they are looking at so many countries.  It is not

a  matter  of science.  But, of course, we disagree  with

the  classification and we have said so very clearly, and

we will continue to point out inaccuracies in the report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, in the dialogue that we are

having  with the US Embassy, have they pointed to  us  in

which areas we are supposed to have failed?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, for example, on the

question  of foreign women coming to Singapore  to  offer

commercial  sex  services, it is a  matter  of  different

countries'  approach,  whether  this  amounts  to   human

trafficking for sexual exploitation.  As far as Singapore

is  concerned, we are very clear.  We have answered  this

question  before  in  this House  a  few  times,  ie,  in

Singapore, we take an approach that is pragmatic and that

works  for  us.   The Minister himself  and  myself  have

responded on how things are done in Singapore.   We  know

that  there  is prostitution.  Women do come  here.   But

what is important is that the women who come here are not

coerced, forced or tricked into prostitution.  They  come

here  voluntarily.  That is important.  So it could be  a

matter  of definition and approach.  But it is a dialogue

that we must continue.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, trafficking of human

beings   is   a  growing  global  problem.    From   that

perspective,  what  is  Singapore  doing  regionally   to

contain this problem?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Singapore also takes

part   in  many  regional  conferences  on  this  matter.

Indeed, it is true that human trafficking is perceived by

the  UN  and by other international agencies as a growing

problem.  So we play an active part, together with  other

countries,  in determining the extent of the problem  and

what measures to take to curb the problem.  In short,  we

are  an active participant with other countries to tackle

this problem regionally and globally.

(a)  what  is  the  rationale behind the  Singapore  Land

Authority's requirement for 3 months' rental deposits  or

security  in  lieu  from  charitable  voluntary   welfare

their respective Ministries; and (b) this being the case,

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would

like to declare my interest as the Medical Director of  a

voluntary welfare organisation.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, like other prudent landlords, the Singapore Land

Authority  requires a security deposit to be  paid  by  a

voluntary welfare organisation renting State premises for

the following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to ensure that the tenant complies with the

conditions of the tenancy agreement;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to ensure payment of rental; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to recover the cost of repairs and

rectifications  in  the event of  any  damages  when  the

tenant vacates the property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general practice, SLA collects rental payments

directly  from  the  VWO.  However, in  some  cases,  the

parent  agency  overseeing the VWO requests  to  pay  the

rentals  directly  to  the SLA to  avoid  incurring  late

payment  charges.   Even for these  cases,  the  security

deposit is still required to ensure that the VWO complies

with  the conditions of the tenancy agreement as well  as

to  cover the cost of repairs and rectifications  arising

from any damage to the property.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the Singapore Land Authority

that  have  secured a guarantee from a parent  agency  or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br><i>Role of Polytechnic Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our polytechnics play a vital role in providing

the  key  manpower for our economy.  They provide future-oriented practical training of high quality, relevant  to

the  needs of industry.  They constantly keep abreast  of

the  latest  developments in technology and the  changing

needs  of our economy in order to adequately prepare  the

students for the job market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polytechnic students are trained in a wide variety

of  practice-oriented  areas.  They  include  courses  in

engineering,  media  and design, information  technology,

health  sciences,  chemical and life  sciences,  maritime

studies, building and construction, and business, finance

and  law.   To meet the changing demands in our  economy,

the   polytechnics  constantly  update   their   existing

courses.  Where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



necessary,  new courses are introduced, for  example,  in

areas   such  as  mobile  and  wireless  computing,   and

biomedical engineering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polytechnic graduates are highly valued as practice-oriented and knowledgeable middle-level professionals,

managers   and  technologists.   In  the  2001   graduate

employment  survey  conducted by the  four  polytechnics,

about  75% of fresh graduates found jobs within the first

three  months  of graduation. The average  gross  monthly

salary of fresh graduates was about $1,500.  Despite  the

economic  downturn,  a good majority of  our  polytechnic

graduates  were  able to find jobs quickly.   This  bears

testimony to the quality of the training provided by  the

polytechnics, and its relevancy to the needs of industry.

<br><br><i>Rationale for a Fifth Polytechnic</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first polytechnic, the Singapore Polytechnic,

was  established almost 50 years ago in  1954,  to  train

middle-level  professionals to support the  technological

and  economic development of Singapore.  Since  then,  we

have  established  three  more polytechnics  -  Ngee  Ann

Polytechnic  in  1963, Temasek Polytechnic  in  1990  and

Nanyang   Polytechnic  in  1992.  Together,  these   four

polytechnics  have  spearheaded the training  of  skilled

manpower to meet the needs of our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the improvements in our education

system, about 40% of each primary one cohort are admitted

to  polytechnics, compared with 28% 10  years  ago.   The

average  primary one cohort has also risen  significantly

in  size,  from  a low of about 40,000 in the  1980s  and

early 1990s, to about 50,000 since 1995.  The first batch

of  these  larger primary one cohorts, which is the  1988

"Year  of the Dragon" cohort, came to our primary schools

in  1995, and is expected to reach the polytechnic  level

in  the  year  2005.  The four polytechnics  are  already

operating at full capacity.  To cater to the increase  in

the  cohort  size eligible for polytechnic education,  we

need  about 4,000 additional polytechnic places  for  our

pre-employment training every year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the provision of pre-employment training,

the  polytechnic sector is also expected  to  shoulder  a

significant share of skills renewal and upgrading for our

workforce.  The polytechnics have established close links

with  industry and are therefore well-placed  to  provide

continuing education and training in a diverse  range  of

practice-oriented programmes.  Graduates  from  the  ITE,

polytechnics  and even universities who  require  further

training or specialist skills upgrading now turn  to  the

polytechnics  for their training needs.   Such  continual

upgrading   and   renewal  of  skills  ensure   life-long

employability for our workforce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has therefore decided to set up a fifth

polytechnic,  the Republic Polytechnic, to cater  to  the

need  for increased capacity for pre-employment training.

The Republic Polytechnic, together with the four existing

polytechnics, will also cater to the increase  in  demand

for  continuing  education  and  training.   Furthermore,

building  a new polytechnic offers us the opportunity  to

inject new ideas and introduce innovations into a crucial

sector  of  our  education system.   This  will  catalyse

improvements and the introduction of new ideas  into  the

entire polytechnic sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of the new economy brings with it new

challenges  for  our  economy  and  the  workforce.   The

Republic  Polytechnic's vision, mission  and  educational

philosophy   will   be  geared  towards   meeting   these

challenges,  which  are characterised  by  globalisation,

global competition, rapid technological advancements  and

changing business models.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic Polytechnic will offer three core

programmes  of  study  in  Engineering,  Information  and

Communications Technology (ICT) and Applied Sciences with

a  focus on Biomedical Sciences.  In the new economy, the

Engineering industry continues to play an important  role

in   providing   critical   services   to   support   the

manufacturing  sector.   ICT  continues   to   remain   a

strategic  resource  in  business  and  Government.   The

Biomedical Sciences industry is poised for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



rapid  growth  as Singapore aims to be a world-class  hub

for  the  life  sciences  industry  with  total  business

capabilities  for manufacturing, and R&D of  high  value-added biomedical sciences products and services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic Polytechnic will adopt a new approach

of  integrating  Business  models  into  the  three  core

programmes  of  study as well as offer hybrid  programmes

that  will  combine Business with any one of these  three

programmes.   Such an approach will be in line  with  the

increasing  need by the industries for graduates  trained

in a multi-disciplinary way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic Polytechnic will commence operations in

the year 2003 with a pioneer intake of 800 students.   It

will  increase  its  intake  gradually,  admitting  1,200

students in 2004, and 1,800 in 2005, the latter being the

"dragon"  cohort.  The steady-state enrolment is expected

to be 13,200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the URA are considering a site in

the  Woodlands area for the permanent campus, which would

be  within walking distance of the Woodlands MRT station.

Accessibility is an important consideration in attracting

students and working adults for Continuing Education  and

Training   (CET) to the new polytechnic.   The  permanent

campus is expected to be completed in 2006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the Republic

Polytechnic Bill itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to establish the Republic

Polytechnic  as a body corporate comprising  a  Board  of

Governors,  a Senate, members of the academic  staff  and

other  officers of the Polytechnic.  The Bill also  makes

provisions  for the establishment of Schools  within  the

Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution of the Republic Polytechnic is set

out in the Schedule to the Bill. The Constitution defines

the  composition,  powers and duties  of  the  Board  and

Senate,  as well as other details which will be  governed

by statutes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic Polytechnic Bill is similar in

substance  and  intent  to the Nanyang  Polytechnic  Act.

The   Republic   Polytechnic,  like  the  existing   four

polytechnics,  will be established as a  statutory  board

under the purview of the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br>2.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to enable Singapore

to  become  a  member  of  the International  Development

Association  (IDA).  IDA was established in  1960  as  an

integral  part  of the World Bank Group to provide  long-term  loans at zero interest to the poorest of developing

countries  which  have  little or  no  access  to  market

financing.   IDA's  lending  helps  to  build  the  human

capital,  infrastructure, institutions and policies  that

developing countries need to achieve sustainable economic

growth.  IDA is funded largely by contributions from  the

governments  of  member countries.   There  are  162  IDA

member  countries today, out of 183 World  Bank  members.

This Bill paves the way for Singapore to join the 88%  of

World Bank members already in IDA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is already a member of the four other

institutions  under  the  World Bank  group,  namely  the

International  Bank for Reconstruction  and  Development,

the  International Finance Corporation, the Multi-Lateral

Investment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



Guarantee   Agency,  and  the  International  Centre   of

Settlement of Investment Disputes.  IDA is the key multi-lateral  development  assistance  institution,  and   our

membership is simply doing what is expected of  us  as  a

responsible member of the family of nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA lendings support US$11/2-2 billion worth of

development  projects in South Asia, East  Asia  and  the

Pacific,  annually.   This helps to  promote  growth  and

stability   in  the  Asia-Pacific  region.    Singapore's

participation  in IDA will also enable our companies  and

consultants to share their expertise through IDA financed

projects.   Singapore's  IDA membership  subscription  is

US$410,159.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for this  sum

to  be charged to the Consolidated Fund and for Singapore

to  subscribe to future increases in authorised  capital,

provided that the total subscription does not exceed US$1

million.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Companies Act was last amended in January

2001.   Since  then, three private sector led  Committees

set  up  by  my  Ministry,  the  Monetary  Authority   of

Singapore, and the Attorney-General's Chambers, have been

active in reviewing Singapore's corporate governance  and

regulatory framework.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Committees was the Disclosure and

Accounting   Standards  Committee   (DASC).    The   DASC

submitted its final report to the Government in September

2001,   with   a  set  of  recommendations   to   improve

Singapore's   accounting   standards   setting   process,

disclosure    requirements   and   rules    on    auditor

independence.  The Government has accepted all  the  DASC

recommendations.  This Bill seeks to implement  the  DASC

recommendations that require amendments to the  Companies

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Registry of Companies and

Businesses  has also embarked on several key  initiatives

to  further  its  mission of making  Singapore  best  for

business.    This   includes  the  introduction   of   an

electronic  filing  system called  BizFile,  which  would

allow  round  the clock filing and information  retrieval

services  over  the Internet for RCB's  customers.   This

Bill  seeks  to introduce legislative changes that  would

facilitate  the  implementation of an  electronic  filing

system  for  companies in Singapore.  It  also  seeks  to

simplify  the incorporation process and reduce  the  time

required  to  incorporate a company in  Singapore.   This

Bill also contains other amendments which are intended to

update  and  streamline certain procedures and provisions

in the Companies Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments

proposed  in the Bill, starting with those to effect  the

DASC's recommendations.



<br><br><i>Compliance with Accounting Standards</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To position Singapore as the key business and

financial   centre,  we  need  to  give   investors   the

confidence that companies registered in Singapore present

true and fair financial statements that are in accordance

with   internationally  accepted  accounting   standards.

Incidents  such  as  Enron and Worldcom  have  shown  the

dangers  of misrepresenting financial statements.   While

the  Government cannot ensure the integrity of  financial

reporting, we can put in place a regulatory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



framework that facilitates proper disclosure.  Currently,

there  are  no  statutory requirements for  companies  in

Singapore to comply with prescribed accounting standards.

Clause 37 amends section 201 to require all companies  to

comply  with  prescribed accounting standards.   This  is

similar to the practice in the UK and Australia.  Similar

to  the  approach  in  UK, we would  allow  companies  to

deviate from the prescribed accounting standards if,  and

only  if,  such  deviations are  necessary  for  them  to

present a true and fair set of financial statements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 also requires companies to make full and

detailed   disclosures  in  their  financial   statements

regarding    the    nature,   financial    effect,    and

justifications,  for such deviations.  As  an  additional

safeguard,  the  directors'  decision  to  deviate   from

prescribed   accounting  standards  would   require   the

concurrence of the companies' external auditor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 61 repeals the Ninth Schedule. The Ninth

Schedule  contains a listing of items to be disclosed  in

the companies' accounts and was included in the Companies

Act during a time when accounting standards were not well

developed.    Today,  the  situation  is  different,   as

accounting  standards have become much  better  developed

over the years.  With the move towards a disclosure-based

regime  and  a legislation of compliance with  prescribed

accounting standards, it is no longer necessary  for  the

Companies Act to contain additional provision relating to

financial    reporting   and   disclosure   requirements.

Instead,  companies would comply with the  reporting  and

disclosure  requirements  that  are  prescribed  in   the

accounting  standards, or by market intermediaries,  such

as the Stock Exchange.  These requirements are more up-to-date  and  they can better reflect the changing needs  of

the market place.



<br><br><i>Council on Corporate Disclosures and Governance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, accounting standards in Singapore are set

by  the  Institute  of  Certified Public  Accountants  of

Singapore  (ICPAS), which is a professional  organisation

of accountants.  ICPAS has done a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



good  job over the years.  To improve the efficiency  and

rigours  of its accounting standards setting process,  it

has  also  aligned many of our accounting standards  with

those  issued  by the International Accounting  Standards

Board.    However,  as  compliance  with  the  accounting

standards would be made a legal requirement, it would not

be  appropriate  for  the  accounting  standards  setting

authority  to  reside  with a professional  organisation.

And,  in  leading  jurisdictions  such  as  the  UK   and

Australia,  accounting standards are set  by  independent

bodies   comprising  representatives   from   businesses,

professional  organisations,  academic  institutions  and

government.  This allows the key stakeholders to  have  a

more  direct  say on how accounting standards  should  be

set.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36 introduces a new section 200A which

provides for the establishment of an independent panel to

prescribe  accounting standards for Singapore  companies.

The  proposed  panel would be known  as  the  Council  on

Corporate  Disclosure  and  Governance.   Under  the  new

arrangements, the ICPAS would continue to play a  pivotal

role  to  support  the  new  Council  in  the  accounting

standards  setting  process.   In  addition  to   setting

accounting  standards, the new Council  would  also  make

recommendations  to  the Government  on  the  review  and

enhancement  of  Singapore's  corporate  governance   and

disclosure  policies.   The new  Council  would  comprise

members   from  businesses,  professional  organisations,

academic   institutions  and  Government.   The   Council

Members  would be appointed by the Minister for  Finance.

Moving   forward,  the  new  Council  would   provide   a

collaborative  mechanism  for  the  private  and   public

sectors  to  continuously review and improve  Singapore's

corporate governance and regulatory framework.  We expect

to  set up the new Council in August this year, after the

legislative amendments have been approved.



<br><br><i>Directors' Report</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 201 of the Act currently requires all

companies to include a report by the Directors  in  their

Annual  Report.   The  DASC has felt  that  some  of  the

disclosure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



requirements  in  the Directors' Report,  such  as  those

pertaining to the company's financial position do not add

much value as they essentially repeat information that is

already  provided  in the company's financial  statement.

As  a result, Directors' Report becomes overly cluttered.

Clause  37 removes the requirement from section  201  for

Directors  to disclose such details in their  report.   A

statement by Directors as required under section  201(15)

of the Companies Act would be retained as it requires the

Directors to confirm that the company is solvent and that

the  financial  statements presented to shareholders  are

true and fair.



<br><br><i>Introduction of BizFile</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we strive to improve Singapore's regulatory

framework, we also need to ensure that our processes  are

efficient  and business-friendly.  RCB has been  actively

working with the private sector on ways to streamline its

processes  so  as to bring about greater convenience  and

lower   cost  to  its  customers.   One  of   RCB's   key

initiatives is the introduction of a web-based electronic

filing   system   called  "BizFile".    BizFile   enables

businessmen  and  professionals  to  perform  filing  and

information  retrieval on-line at any time  of  the  day.

BizFile  also  enables RCB to reduce  business  cost  and

expedite  the  turn  around time  for  incorporation  and

filing.   The  introduction of BizFile would raise  RCB's

service  standards  and  align  its  practices  with  its

counterparts  in  the  US, UK  and  Australia.   RCB  has

launched  the  first phase of BizFile, which  deals  with

incorporation  of  companies in January  this  year.   It

plans to launch the second phase of BizFile by the end of

the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the amendments in the Bill that

would facilitate the implementation of BizFile.  With the

move   to   an  electronic  filing  system,   RCB   would

consolidate  its existing hardcopy forms into  electronic

forms.  Currently, a person who wants to file information

with  RCB  has  to  fill in several hardcopy  forms  that

capture  some duplicate data items.  BizFile also removes

the  need  for  manual data entry by  the  RCB  officers,

thereby reducing the time and cost required for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



processing  the application.  BizFile further  simplifies

the  filing and incorporation process by doing away  with

hardcopy   certificates,   statutory   declarations   and

affidavits.  There are several clauses in the Bill,  such

as clauses 8, 16, 19 and 24, that amend the Act to remove

the  need for statutory declarations or affidavits.   RCB

would verify the user's identity online, using his unique

national  pin,  which  is also the  CPF  PAL  pin  before

allowing    the   user   to   submit   his    declaration

electronically.  Singaporeans who do not have CPF PAL pin

would  be  assigned an ID and password by RCB  for  their

BizFile transactions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends section 17 to replace the issue of a

hardcopy  certificate  of  incorporation  via  electronic

notification.   Any member of the public  who  wishes  to

check  the  registration status of a company  can  do  so

online, at no charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 also provides for the issue of a hardcopy

certificate of incorporation upon the payment of  a  fee.

This is to cater to companies that still require hardcopy

incorporation  certificates for other purposes,  such  as

for submission to overseas regulators.



<br><br><i>Removal of Pre-Incorporation Checks for Similar Names</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of registering company names,

jurisdictions  such  as the US, UK,  Australia  and  Hong

Kong,  do  not conduct any pre-incorporation  checks  for

similar  names.  These jurisdictions have found that  the

checking  for similar names only delays the incorporation

process  and increases business cost.  They only  conduct

pre-incorporation checks for identical,  undesirable  and

gazetted  names.   This enables same  day  incorporation,

which  has  become the service standards that businessmen

would  expect.   To benchmark our service  standards  for

incorporation to that of the US, UK, Australia  and  Hong

Kong,  we  propose  to  align RCB's practice  with  these

jurisdictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill removes the requirement under

section 27 for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



Registrar  to  do  pre-incorporation checks  for  similar

names.   Under  the  new arrangements, an  applicant  who

wishes to register a company name can first perform  some

preliminary checks from BizFile to see if the name he  is

applying for is similar to that of an existing company or

business.  Bizfile would alert the applicant if there  is

an existing company or business with a similar name.  The

applicant  can  then decide whether he wants  to  proceed

with  the  application or select another name.   The  law

would  continue  to provide protection  and  avenues  for

redress  for  incumbent  companies  and  businesses.   An

aggrieved  party can lodge a complaint to  the  Registrar

against  the  company or business, with a  similar  name,

within  twelve  months from the date of  registration  of

that  company  or  business.   After  twelve  months,  an

aggrieved party can still bring the matter to the  court.

This is similar to the practice in the UK.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the proposed

amendments  in  this  Bill are part  of  a  comprehensive

exercise to review our company legislation and to enhance

Singapore's competitiveness as a global business centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another private sector led Committee, called the

Companies Legislation and Regulatory Framework Committee,

is  in  the  process  of reviewing our  company  law  and

regulatory  framework.   This Committee  has  posted  its

draft report on the Internet for public consultation, and

is   expected  to  submit  its  recommendations  to   the

Government  later this year.  If its recommendations  are

accepted,  we  will be making further amendments  to  the

Companies Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

express  my  support for this Bill.  The  Bill  seeks  to

implement the major recommendations of the Disclosure and

Accounting Standards Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is establishing itself as a major

financial   centre  in  the  world,   we   should   adopt

internationally   recognised  and   accepted   accounting

standards  and practices.  However, recent  instances  of

major corporate disclosure failings, like Enron, Worldcom

and  Xerox  in  USA, have shown that no  amount  of  good

corporate  governance  regulations or  strict  accounting

standards  can guard against management bent  on  crooked

reporting.   This  is  particularly  glaring   as   these

incidents  occur in the USA which prides  itself  as  the

motherland    of    good   corporate   disclosures    and

transparency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the record, Sir, I support the creation of the

proposed  panel  of Council on Corporate  Disclosure  and

Governance.  If its role is only to serve as  a  body  to

make  recommendations, then there must be  retained  some

teeth in the regulatory framework for existing Government

agencies  to  police and fine offenders who  flout  these

rules.   I read in the newspapers that in the USA itself,

they  are  thinking of charging the dishonest  management

responsible  for making untruthful disclosures  in  their

companies' accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with my disappointment that no amount of

good   corporate  governance  regulations  can  safeguard

against  dishonest management, I would like to raise  the

issue  of  quarterly reporting.  Quarterly  reporting  is

required from next year onwards for listed companies.   I

had supported this idea in the past in the hope that more

regular    reporting   would   enable   better   business

information and transparency.  However, I now come to the

view  that  quarterly  reporting may  have  some  serious

disadvantages.    As  evident  in  the   USA,   quarterly

reporting  has caused top management of companies  to  be

very  short-term  focused  on quarterly  results.   Share

prices  jump  or plummet on every piece of  good  or  bad

news.   Management's attention becomes distracted by  the

need  to report good results every quarter, year in  year

out,  which is not an easy thing to achieve, even by  the

best of management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I, therefore, have come to the conclusion that

quarterly  reporting has severe disadvantage  of  forcing

companies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



and  market  analysts to be too short-term  and  narrowly

focused.   Hence,  I would like to ask the  DPM  and  the

Minister  for  Finance to reconsider the  requirement  to

introduce  quarterly reporting by listed  companies  from

next year onwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two issues relating to

the  on-going  holding  costs of  companies.   Currently,

about  75%  of Singapore's 100,000 companies are  dormant

and  tax-exempt  companies.   The  reason  is  that  many

Singaporeans  wish to incorporate companies in  readiness

to  start  a business.  However, most of these  companies

remain   dormant   for  a  long  time.   Meanwhile,   the

shareholders  have  to  incur some  unnecessary  on-going

costs, such as to appoint a qualified accounting firm  to

prepare audited accounts, and to appoint a professionally

qualified company secretary to file accounts.  These  two

requirements add to operating costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to

consider  whether  the  above  two  requirements  can  be

reduced  or simplified, especially for dormant  or  small

companies.  The total cost could amount to a few thousand

dollars,  which  are  not truly necessary  for  small  or

dormant companies.  While we encourage companies to adopt

good international reporting and accounting practices,  I

agree  with the private sector's Company Legislation  and

Regulatory  Framework  Committee in  its  recommendations

that  these requirements should not be proscribed by law,

especially  for small and dormant companies.   Naturally,

active  companies of certain size and activity should  be

required  to  adopt  these  practices  for  good   public

disclosure reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Mr Leong Horn Kee raised

two   points.   First  is  on  the  quarterly   reporting

requirement,  and the second is on the audit  requirement

for dormant companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quarterly reporting requirement, this issue

had  been  brought up last year when the  Disclosure  and

Accounting Standards Committee (DASC) issued its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



draft   report  for  public  consultation.   Some  listed

companies  felt  that the requirement for  more  frequent

reporting  would add to cost and could lead to short-term

focus,  as  Mr  Leong pointed out.  However,  there  were

other  respondents, such as investors, who supported  the

DASC's proposal, because they would like listed companies

to   be   more  transparent  and  to  have  more   timely

disclosures.  America, Canada, Thailand and Malaysia  all

have quarterly reporting for listed companies.  Quarterly

reporting is also required for companies listed  on  Hong

Kong's Growth Enterprise Market (the GEM market) and  the

Tokyo's  Stock  Exchange's mother market  for  start-ups.

Hong  Kong  and  Tokyo are considering  having  quarterly

reporting  for all listed companies, in other words,  for

their   main   boards.   Australia  and  United   Kingdom

currently  require six-monthly reports for  their  listed

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an issue where there are trade-offs. But, on

balance,  the  DASC felt that quarterly  reporting  would

benefit  the  listed  companies  in  the  long  run,   as

investors   would  gravitate  towards  more   transparent

companies.   In addition, quarterly reporting would  also

help to improve Singapore's transparency and standing  as

a world-class business and financial centre.  To give the

listed  companies enough time to prepare themselves,  the

DASC  has  recommended a transition  period,  before  the

quarterly  reporting requirement is  imposed,  which  has

been accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not expect compliance cost to increase

significantly  with  quarterly  reporting,  because   the

financial results that are used for the quarterly  report

do  not need to be audited.  Many listed companies  would

submit  regular  financial  reports  to  their  Board  of

Directors, and the additional cost involved in presenting

these reports to the public should not be too high.  Some

listed companies in Singapore have already started  doing

quarterly  reporting.   Drawing from  the  experience  of

these   companies  and  countries  which   have   started

quarterly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



reporting, listed companies in Singapore should not  face

too   much   difficulties   in   implementing   quarterly

reporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong's second point has to do with statutory

audit   for   small   and  dormant  companies   and   the

recommendation  to remove the statutory  requirement  for

private  companies  to  appoint professionally  qualified

company  secretaries.  I thank Mr Leong for his comments.

In fact, the Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework

Committee  has  received  similar  feedback  on  the  two

proposals  from the business community.  The  Committee's

review  is still on-going.  The Committee has posted  its

draft report on the Internet for public feedback.  Public

consultation ends on 31st of July.  I would look  forward

to  Mr  Leong making his comments to the Committee  which

will  take  them into consideration, together with  other

comments  from the public consultation, before submitting

its final recommendations to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Business Registration Act provides the

basic  framework  of governance for sole  proprietorships

and partnerships in Singapore.  The Business Registration

Act was last amended in April 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have highlighted in the Second Reading of the

Companies (Amendment) Bill that the Registry of Companies

and Businesses ("RCB") is working on an electronic filing

system called BizFile.  As in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



case  of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, this Bill  seeks

to  introduce  legislative changes that would  facilitate

the   implementation  of  BizFile   for   businesses   in

Singapore.   This  Bill also seeks to streamline  certain

procedures  and  provisions in the Business  Registration

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments

proposed in the Bill.



<br><br><i>Removal of the Need for Physical Signatures, Certificates of Registration, Statutory Declarations and Affidavits</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of companies, BizFile would simplify

the   process  for  business  owners  to  register  their

businesses and update their records with RCB.   The  user

need  not  submit  any hardcopy forms,  declarations  and

affidavits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 9 to dispense with the need

to   issue  hardcopy  certificates  of  registration   as

evidence of registration.  The hardcopy certificate would

be  replaced  by an electronic notification.   Section  9

would  also be amended to remove the requirement for  the

business  owner  to  display a  hardcopy  certificate  of

registration.  Any member of public who wishes  to  check

the  registration status of a business can do so  online,

at  no  charge.  However, if a business requires hardcopy

certificates of registration for other purposes, such  as

for  submission  to  overseas regulators,  it  can  still

obtain hardcopy certificates from RCB upon the payment of

a fee.



<br><br><i>Removal of Pre-Registration Checks for Similar Names</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Second Reading of the Companies

(Amendment)  Bill,  I have explained  the  rationale  for

removing  the requirement for the Registrar  to  do  pre-incorporation  checks for similar  names.   I  have  also

explained  how  the  proposed removal would  benefit  the

business  community  and how there  would  be  sufficient

safeguards to protect the interest of incumbent companies

and  businesses.   Clause 8 of the Business  Registration

(Amendment) Bill aligns the provision in section 11  with

the corresponding provision in the Companies (Amendment)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



Bill.   Under the new section 11, the Registrar  will  no

longer do pre-registration checks for similar names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments in this

Bill are expected to benefit business owners in terms  of

lower   costs,   more  efficient  service   and   greater

convenience.   It would also align RCB's  practices  with

its  counterparts in the US, UK and Australia, and  allow

RCB to provide better service to its customers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak

in  support  of this Bill.  As the Deputy Prime  Minister

has    explained,   the   Bill   will   facilitate    the

implementation  of  electronic filing for  companies  via

BizFile   and  simplify  some  procedures  for   business

registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly support the intent and trend adopted

by  the  Government to make business registration easier,

cheaper and faster. This is the basic purpose of BizFile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with this approach, I would like to

raise two suggestions to the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first suggestion is with regard to the

registered  address  of  a  business.   At  present,  the

requirement  is that businesses must be registered  in  a

business address.  A company is not allowed to register a

residential  address as the registered business  address.

We know that many Singaporeans have formed companies with

the  intent to eventually start a business.  Pending  the

start of the business, these companies are dormant.   The

need  to  be registered in a business address means  that

companies  often  have  to  be registered  with  business

addresses  of  law  firms  and audit  companies.   Though

small,  often there is a fee to be paid.  For  the  firms

whose  addresses are being used as the business  address,

this  requirement adds to unnecessary administrative  and

correspondence work.  Hence, I would like to suggest that

the Government consider allowing residential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



addresses  to  be  used as registered and  correspondence

addresses of firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the present residential addresses are

not  permitted  to  be  used for  conducting  businesses,

except  for  certain approved purposes, such as  IT-based

start-ups.   So  as  to  foster  the  growth  of  a  more

entrepreneurial  climate  and  a  more  business-friendly

environment,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister to consider liberalising the restriction on  the

use of residential addresses for the conduct of business.

Of  course,  the allowed businesses should not  create  a

disamenity  to the residential neighbourhood.   Singapore

does  not  have many houses with garages,  so  we  cannot

boast  that many bright ideas from Singaporeans germinate

from  garages.  But many Singaporeans live in HDB  flats.

Therefore,  we should be proud to say that  many  of  our

great  businesses sprouted from the living rooms  of  HDB

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion, Sir, is with regard to

liquidation  of companies. We can now claim  that  it  is

very easy to form a company in Singapore, especially with

the  advent of BizFile.  I am not sure whether we can say

the  same  for the liquidation of companies.  As  I  have

said   earlier,  many  Singaporeans  form  companies   in

preparation  to  start a business.  However,  several  of

these  businesses remain dormant and may  never  see  the

daylight of a day of business.  Finally, they have to  be

closed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that the relevant

bodies  study  the  procedures and  requirements  in  the

liquidation  or closing of companies.  I  am  told  that,

typically, liquidation of a company costs between $5,000-$15,000.  For a small or dormant company, this would be a

large sum.  I concede that regulations on liquidation  of

companies should require more careful handling so  as  to

protect  creditors.   I would like to  request  that  the

procedures  should  be simplified and  made  cheaper,  if

possible.    One  suggestion  is  to  use   BizFile   for

electronic filing of closing of dormant companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong

raised  two  points.   First, using  home  addresses  for

businesses to register their addresses.  We have,  as  Mr

Leong  pointed  out, a Technopreneur  Home  Office  (THO)

Scheme.  The Technopreneur Home Office Scheme was started

in  1999  to allow a businessman who qualifies under  the

Scheme  to  register  his  residential  address  as   his

business   address,   and  the  idea   was   to   promote

technopreneurship by reducing start-up cost.  There is  a

good  reason  for  separating commercial activities  from

residential  areas. We need to ensure  that  the  use  of

residences   to  conduct  businesses  will  not   disturb

neighbours and affect the living environment.  Therefore,

only  certain types of business activities, for  example,

those that are not noisy and do not cause pollution,  are

allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong mentioned dormant companies. With the new

BizFile  arrangement with the Registry of  Companies  and

Businesses,  one  can  set up  a  company  within  a  few

minutes.  So the need to set up a dormant company well in

advance,  before a person actually starts business,  will

be  substantially reduced.  I think that problem will  be

solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for which business we should allow to operate

within a residential premise, this is something which  we

will  have  to  study.   If  we are  satisfied  that  the

business  does  not cause problems to the  neighbours,  I

think we can consider allowing it.  It may or may not  be

a  technopreneurship type of business.  But I would  urge

Mr  Leong to consider the point of view of neighbours  of

people  who do business at home.  Because if they have  a

business  where  there are lots of customers  coming  and

going,  or where there is noise, smoke or smell -  as  an

MP,  I am sure Mr Leong would have met many such cases  - then  he has to answer to the neighbours as well  as  the

person who wants to do the business.  A balance will have

to be struck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked about simplifying process of

liquidation.  Here, I agree with Mr Leong that we need to

strike a balance between having safeguards to protect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



creditors  and  employees and, on  the  other  hand,  not

imposing unnecessary business cost.  To encourage  people

to  start businesses, we must not make it too onerous and

costly  for those who have failed and have to  exit.   In

recent  years, the Government has reviewed the bankruptcy

law to make it easier for people who have failed in their

business ventures to come back and try again.  As part of

the  review  of our Company Law, the Company  Law  Review

Committee  (CLRC) is also looking at ways  to  streamline

our  insolvency  legislation  and  lower  the  costs   to

companies that are going through judicial management  and

liquidation.  The CLRC has also recommended that we study

and   learn   from   the  developments   in   the   major

jurisdictions.  For example, the UK has recently  started

its review on its insolvency regime.  The UK's review was

prompted by the need to promote an enterprise culture and

to  encourage entrepreneurs who have failed  honestly  to

try  again.   At the same time, the law will continue  to

provide  sufficient  safeguards  for  the  protection  of

creditors and employees.  So, this is something which the

CLRC  will  have  in  mind  as  it  comes  out  with  its

recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>PARLIAMENTARY PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Parliamentary Pensions Act, a

political office-holder from Political Secretary to Prime

Minister serves on pensionable terms.  The post of  Mayor

is  a  recent  creation.   Hence,  it  is  currently  not

included in the Parliamentary Pensions Act.  We now  have

five Community Development Councils, each led by a Mayor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



who   carries  substantial  responsibility.   A   Mayor's

remuneration and its position in the Table of  Precedence

are   between  the  Minister  of  State  and  the  Senior

Parliamentary    Secretary    commensurate    with    the

responsibilities of his office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends section 2(1) of the Act such that

service in the office of Mayor, regardless whether it  is

before  or after the commencement of this Bill,  will  be

reckonable for the purposes of qualifying for an  office-holder's pension.  Under the Parliamentary Elections Act,

Sir,  the  holder of any political office  who  does  not

serve  long  enough before retirement to qualify  for  an

office holder's pension but who is otherwise eligible for

a  Member  of Parliament's pension may have the whole  or

part  of  the office-holder's service reckonable  towards

the  Member's pension eligibility.  Section 6(2)  of  the

Parliamentary Pensions Act is amended such that  a  Mayor

who is similarly eligible for a Member's pension, but who

has  not  served  long enough to qualify for  an  office-holder's  pension may add two-thirds of  his  service  as

Mayor to his Member's pension eligibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

the  explanatory note to the Bill, the amendment will  in

fact  allow  the time served by a Mayor to count  in  two

ways.   First,  it can be counted as service  towards  an

office-holder's  pension.   Secondly,  if  he  does   not

qualify for an office-holder's pension, then his years of

service  as  a  Mayor can also count  as  his  period  of

service towards a Member's pension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment seeks to put the position of Mayor

together  with  office-holders, such as  Prime  Minister,

Deputy Prime Minister, Speaker and Ministers.  Sir, these

are  public  officers  under  the  Constitution  and   it

requires its holders first to be elected into Parliament.

I   believe   this  is  why  their  pensions  are   under

Parliamentary Pensions Act, rather than under  the  civil

service Pensions Act.  These officials direct and oversee

matters affecting national security, foreign affairs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



and  other policy matters, and they should be recognised.

The  question is whether the appointment of Mayor can  be

considered  as  public office in the same category.   The

Mayor is not appointed under the Constitution, or any law

passed  by  Parliament.  Rather, the Mayor  is  appointed

under  the rules of the People's Association Act.   These

rules  are designated by the Board of PA, and Members  of

the  House did not have a chance to consider whether such

Mayors are required in the first place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the House is being asked to consider allowing

public  funds to be used to give pension to  Mayors.   Is

the  People's Association expecting the House to  rubber-stamp  their  plans, which will be put in place,  without

consulting  Parliament?   Does  this  make  sense,  since

Parliament  was not involved in approving or disapproving

the creation of such an appointment in the first place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, should service as a Mayor count as

additional  service  to qualify for a  Member's  pension?

Under  the current Act, a Member should serve a total  of

nine  years  as  an MP before qualifying for  a  Member's

pension.   This  amendment will allow time  served  as  a

Mayor to count as additional years to be added on to  his

service  as  an  MP.   Why does the  Government  see  the

necessity  to  do this?  Is the Government not  confident

that the Mayors can chalk up nine years as an MP?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the People's Association CDC Rules, the

criteria for the appointment of Mayor have changed twice.

In the most recent amendment on 24th November 2001, there

is no longer a requirement for a Mayor to be the Chairman

of  a  town  council.  In other words,  so  long  as  the

potential  Mayor is Chairman of CDC, he will qualify  for

appointment  as a Mayor.  Why was this change  made?   It

must be because I believe the Board of the PA, headed  by

the  Prime Minister, considers that there would be Mayors

who  may  not be Town Council Chairmen, ie, they are  not

elected  Members  of  Parliament.   Is  it  correct,   in

principle, to give them a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



Member's  pension when they have not served enough  years

as  a  Member?   I  am  of the view  that  to  allow  the

amendment will make the term "Member's pension" under the

Act meaningless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, it makes a mockery of Parliament by

asking  Parliament  to  provide  pensions  for  such   an

appointment   without  consulting  Parliament   for   the

appointment in the first place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the break

<div align="center"><h4>PARLIAMENTARY PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Pensions Act was  enacted

in  1978  to  provide  for  the  grant  of  pensions  and

gratuities in respect of service as Members of Parliament

and as holders of ministerial and other offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that over the last decade or

two,  the emphasis has been to convert the pension scheme

and  encourage the granting of Central Provident Fund for

our   civil  servants  and  employees.   Of  course,   as

volunteer employers, one can make voluntary contributions

towards   their  respective  CPF  accounts.   Would   it,

therefore, not be in line with the general policy of  the

Government  to  also  convert  pensions  for  Members  of

Parliament,  ministerial and other offices,  to  keep  in

line  with  the rest of the working people in  Singapore?

In  this  way, our citizens would observe that Parliament

has not introduced in any way any form of discrimination,

as  perceived  by  them, in favour of MPs,  Ministers  or

other officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



connected  to  Parliament,  eg,  Mayor,  that  is   being

introduced through this proposed amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding Mr Low

Thia  Khiang's point on why we did not come to Parliament

to  seek approval for the creation of the post of  Mayor,

and  the  formation  of  Community  Development  Councils

(CDCs),  it  is  the prerogative of the  Government,  the

Prime  Minister  in particular, to decide  what  sort  of

structure  of government he wishes to have.  Since  1997,

we  have  created Community Development Councils to  help

the Government to carry out and implement the policies of

some   of  our  Ministries.   Hence,  we  have  Community

Development Councils.  In the past, because we had  small

Community Development Councils, we therefore required the

Chairman,  if he is to be appointed as a Mayor,  to  also

become  the Chairman of a Town Council, apart from  being

the Chairman of a Community Development Council.  But for

those Chairmen of Community Development Councils who  are

not  Chairmen of Town Councils at the same time, then  we

say  that  they will carry on and be called  Chairmen  of

Community Development Councils, and not Mayors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, we had two Mayors, in Tanjong Pagar and

Marine Parade GRCs, because both Mr Eugene Yap and Dr  Ow

Chin  Hock  were  Chairmen of both Councils  -  the  Town

Council as well as the Community Development Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last General Election, we thought that,

for  better organisation, efficiency and for synergy,  we

should  enlarge  the  Community Development  Councils  by

reducing the number of CDCs from nine to five.  By  doing

so,    therefore,    we   increased   tremendously    the

responsibilities of the Chairmen of Community Development

Councils,  if they were required to be Chairmen  of  Town

Councils,   and  they  may  be  loaded  with  unnecessary

implementation  and operational duties.  So,  we  decided

that  we  make an amendment to the rules to only  require

him  to  be  the  Chairman of the  Community  Development

Council in order to become the Mayor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so doing, we also recognise that this is a very

important  position and, obviously, we  will  not  simply

appoint  anyone  unelected to  be  the  Chairman  of  the

Community Development Council or as Mayor.  That will not

serve  the  objectives of the Government.  We could  just

have  General  Managers.  In fact, for the administrative

details  and implementation, we have the General Managers

of  the CDCs running the day-to-day operations.  When  it

comes  to  direction,  strategy,  policy  and,  in   some

instances, even talking to the Ministers concerning  what

the  CDC  should do, we needed the Mayors to do the  job.

Hence,  the  post  of  Mayor  was  created,  and  he  has

substantial responsibilities and, therefore, he shall  be

an elected person.  There will be no occasion that we can

think of that will make us appoint an unelected person to

be  a Mayor.  I think Mr Low can be assured of that.   In

the  same way, we have made the Town Council Chairman  an

elected MP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether it is fair to compare the

Mayor to other appointments in the Parliamentary Pensions

Act,  eg,  the  Prime Minister, Ministers,  Ministers  of

State,   Parliamentary  Secretaries  and  the   Political

Secretary,  are they of the same level or why  should  we

put  a  Mayor  in  the  same category as  office-holders,

office-holders  are  important  political   appointments,

because   they   help  the  Government  carry   out   its

objectives,  and these appointments are  decided  by  the

Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said that the Prime Minister, Ministers and

Parliamentary Secretaries are defined in the Constitution

and,  therefore,  the  power  is  derived  from  what  is

provided  for  in the Constitution.  In the Constitution,

we  do  not  have posts such as Ministers  of  State  nor

Political Secretary, and yet we have these posts  in  our

Parliamentary  Pensions Act.  In the  case  of  Political

Secretary,  he  does not even need to be an  elected  MP.

The  Prime Minister, with his prerogative and powers, can

appoint any person to be a Political Secretary, and he is

fully   entitled  to  pension  under  the   Parliamentary

Pensions Act, albeit not being an elected person.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no reason why Mayors should not be

considered  in  the same category and be eligible  for  a

pension in the same way as other office-holders.   For  a

Mayor  who  is  a new Member - a "new Member"  means  any

Member  of  Parliament elected after 1995  -  he  is  not

eligible for an MP pension.  He is eligible for CPF.  So,

for  a  Mayor who is a new Member, he needs to accumulate

eight years of service as Mayor in order to qualify for a

pension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an old Member who has got reckonable

pensionable  service as an MP, then  his  time  spent  as

Mayor,  if  it is less than eight years, can be  computed

for   the   purpose  of  considering   his   MP   pension

eligibility.  Hence, two-thirds of his service  as  Mayor

is counted as an MP's service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among our present Mayors, we have both examples - those who are old Members and those who are new Members.

But,  for new Members, they need to serve long enough  in

order to qualify for a pension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have, in a way, dealt with Mr Low Thia

Khiang's questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Chandra Mohan's question, I was quite

curious  as  to  why  he is interested  in  Parliamentary

pension when the subject does not really concern him.   I

now  understand  he is talking about a  different  issue,

like   why   do   we  want  to  consider  office-holders'

appointments even as pensionable.  He says that the trend

has  been  towards CPF.  Yes, indeed, it  has  been,  but

there  are certain key appointments that we have kept  as

pensionable  service,  eg,  the  Administrative  Service,

Foreign  Service  and  Intelligence  Service  are   still

pensionable services.  There are good reasons  for  this.

Similarly,  for  office holders,  we  think  that  it  is

important  that they remain on pensionable  service  and,

hence, we keep them on pensionable service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Members of Parliament, we have made a

decision way back in 1995 that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



all  new Members of Parliament, elected henceforth, shall

be paid CPF.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to seek a

clarification  from the Minister. The  Minister,  in  his

answer,  said  that the appointment of office-holders  is

the  prerogative of the Prime Minister.  It seems  to  me

that the Minister is saying that the job of Parliament is

just to approve the spending of public funds for whatever

appointments  that  have  been  created  by   the   Prime

Minister.  Should that be the role and job of Parliament?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It is definitely not the role of

Parliament  to decide on what posts to create.   That  is

the prerogative of the Prime Minister and the Government.

As  to whether the post should be pensionable or not,  in

certain  instances,  like in the  civil  service,  it  is

totally the prerogative of the Government to decide which

post  should be pensionable and which post should not  be

pensionable.  In the case of office-holders, because they

are  elected Members, we have the Parliamentary  Pensions

Act.   That  is why we have come to Parliament  to  amend

this   Act   to  include  the  post  of  Mayor   in   the

Parliamentary Pensions Act, for qualification of pension.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir.

Does the Minister consider Mayor as a public officer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Can Mr Low explain what is the

meaning of "public officer"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

that there is a Constitution of the Republic of Singapore

(Mayor)  Order  2002  which  says  that  "Mayor  is   not

considered  as  holding  public  office".   Pensions  are

supposed  to  be  given to public  officers.   Would  the

Minister clarify that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me explain the confusion

that  Mr  Low seems to have.  The Mayor's post is created

and  appointed by the Prime Minister.  We  have  to  make

sure  and  be  clear that the post is not  an  office  of

profit, just like Ministers' posts are not considered  as

office  of  profit. Therefore, the latter are already  in

the  Constitution.  But in the case of Mayor, it is  not.

Therefore,  under  Article 2(5) of the Constitution,  the

President has made an order to consider the post of Mayor

as  not being an office of profit.  That is the answer to

his question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Bill

is to give effect to the International Convention for the

Suppression  of the Financing of Terrorism  (CSFT)  which

Singapore  signed on 18th December 2001  and  the  United

Nations Security Council Resolution 1373.  As a member of

the Financial Action Task Force, Singapore had adopted  a

set of Eight Special Recommendations, one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



which was to take immediate steps to ratify and implement

the Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the terrorist threat that Singapore and the

rest  of  the world are facing today is like  nothing  we

have  ever encountered before. The recent events  of  the

past  year  have  shown  that  terrorism  has  become   a

transnational phenomenon, one that no country  is  immune

to.   Given the indigenous resources and extensive  reach

of  these  groups, the threat of terrorism will  continue

for a long time to come.  It is widely believed that many

terrorist activities are funded through a series of money

laundering  operations.  Hence, targetting the  financial

aspect of these transnational groups will be an effective

way   to  cripple  and  disrupt  their  operations.   The

integrity of our financial systems must be prevented from

being used by terrorist organisations. We already have  a

vigorous  system of checks to detect and counter criminal

use  of the financial system.  The Terrorism (Suppression

of Financing) Bill will further strengthen our ability to

monitor  such transactions and take appropriate  actions.

Let me now deal with the key provisions of the Bill.



<br><br><i>Prohibition against dealing with Terrorist Property (Part II of the Bill)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill covers prohibition against

terrorist   property.   Specifically,   we   can   target

properties that may be used in connection with  terrorist

acts.  Clause 2 of the Bill defines property as assets of

every  kind, whether tangible or intangible,  movable  or

immovable,  including bank credits,  travellers  cheques,

bank  cheques,  money orders, shares, securities,  bonds,

drafts and letters of credit.  Clauses 3 to 6 of the Bill

make  it  an  offence to provide or collect property  for

terrorist   acts,  provide  property  and  services   for

terrorist purposes, use or possess property for terrorist

purposes,  and  deal with property of terrorists.   These

prohibitions apply to every person in Singapore  and  any

Singapore  citizen outside Singapore who is dealing  with

terrorist property.  These clauses give effect to Article

2(1)  of  the Convention.  Besides giving effect  to  the

Convention, these clauses also give effect

to  the United Nations Security Council Resolution  1373.

Clause  7  of the Bill empowers the Minister to exempt  a

person   from   the  prohibition  against  dealing   with

terrorist property.



<br><br><i>Disclosure (Part III of the Bill)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill imposes a duty of disclosure.

The Convention obligates Singapore to identify and detect

terrorist  property for purposes of possible  forfeiture.

To  meet  this, clause 8 of the Bill imposes  a  duty  on

every  person  in  Singapore and every Singapore  citizen

outside  who  has  possession,  custody  or  control   of

terrorist   property,   or   information   regarding    a

transaction  in  terrorist  property  to  disclose   such

information  to the Police.  Clause 10 of the  Bill  also

provides   that  every  person  in  Singapore   who   has

information  which  can  prevent  the  commission  of   a

terrorism   financing   offence,   or   assist   in   the

apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person for a

terrorism  financing  offence  to  immediately  inform  a

police officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, clause 9 of the Bill empowers the Minister,

by  order in the Gazette, to require any person or  class

of  persons to continually determine whether they possess

terrorist property. However, let me assure the House that

this  will not be invoked unnecessarily.  We foresee that

this  provision  would  be  used  for  a  person  who  is

suspected  of having dealings with terrorist property  or

persons  who  had  previously had such  dealings  without

their knowledge.



<br><br><i>Seizure,  Freezing and Confiscation of Terrorist Property (Part IV of the Bill)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Part IV of the Bill also spells out

in detail the manner in which a terrorist property may be

seized, frozen or confiscated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, application for search and seizure. Clause

11  of  the  Bill  empowers a High Court Judge  to  issue

warrants for search and seizure of any terrorist property

and  restraint  orders in respect of terrorist  property.

Clause 20 of the Bill provides



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



that   such   warrants  and  restraint  orders  generally

continue for six months but may be extended. Clause 14 of

the  Bill  makes it an offence for a person to  whom  the

order  has been served contravene with a restraint order.

Clause  21  of  the Bill allows the Court  to  order  the

forfeiture of terrorist property. Clauses 12  and  22  of

the  Bill  provide that the affidavit in support  of  the

application  for  warrants  for  search  and  seizure  of

terrorist property, and for order of forfeiture,  may  be

made by the investigating officer on his information  and

belief.   Personal knowledge by the investigating officer

that  the property is terrorist property is not required.

Clause 18 of the Bill further provides that the Attorney-General  may apply to revoke or vary warrants or  orders.

Clause  24  of  the Bill provides that if  the  Judge  is

satisfied  that the property is linked to  terrorists  or

that  it  will  be  used to facilitate  or  carry  out  a

terrorist  act, the Judge shall order the  forfeiture  of

the property.  Where the Judge refuses an application for

forfeiture, clause 26 of the Bill provides that the Judge

shall  also  identify the property and declare  that  the

property is not subject to forfeiture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, management of terrorist property. Clauses 15

to  17  set  out  the appointment of  a  manager  of  the

terrorist property who can be the public trustee.  Clause

28  of  the  Bill  also provides that  the  property  may

continue  to  be  seized, restrained or  managed  by  the

appointed person, pending any appeal.  This is to prevent

the  property from being scurried away.  Clause 29 of the

Bill  also empowers the Judge to nullify any transactions

that  have  occurred  after the property  was  seized  or

restrained,  except where such transactions were  carried

out in good faith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, safeguards. Clause 13 of the Bill provides

that the Judge may require undertakings from the Attorney-General  with respect to the payment of damages or  costs

for the warrant or restraint order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, clauses 19 and 27 of the Bill provide recourse

for a person who has an interest in the property that was

seized, restrained or forfeited, to apply to revoke



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



or  vary the warrant or order, or set aside the order  of

forfeiture within 60 days of the order of forfeiture.



<br><br><i>Mutual Assistance and Extradition (Part V of the Bill)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill provides that the International

Convention  for  the  Suppression  of  the  Financing  of

Terrorism  can  be used as a basis for mutual  assistance

and   extradition  with  another  state  party   to   the

Convention  without  the  need for  a  bilateral  treaty.

Specifically, clause 32 of the Bill empowers the Minister

for  Law  to make an order to apply the Mutual Assistance

in   Criminal  Matters  Act  to  a  state  party  to  the

Convention  so as to allow assistance to be  rendered  in

respect  of  investigation or prosecution of a  terrorism

financing  offence.   Hence,  all  the  requirements  for

Mutual  Assistance  in Criminal Matters  Act  will  apply

except  for  the requirement of a treaty.  The assistance

that  is  rendered  may  be  subject  to  conditions   or

exceptions  in  the order that is made under  the  Mutual

Assistance  in Criminal Matters Act.  The Convention  can

also  be  treated as an extradition treaty in respect  of

terrorism   financing  offences  between  Singapore   and

another  state party to the Convention.  This is  similar

to  the  Hijacking of Aircraft and Protection of Aircraft

and International Airports Act.



<br><br><i>Jurisdiction (Part VI of the Bill)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, terrorism is essentially a transnational crime.

We  cannot deal with terrorism effectively if we  do  not

cooperate  with other nations, or if we have powers  only

to  deal  with offences committed within Singapore.   The

Convention  thus  requires states to prosecute  offenders

who  cannot  be extradited.  Part VI of the  Bill  covers

extra-territorial jurisdiction.  Specifically, clause  34

provides  for extra-territorial jurisdiction for offences

under  clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill that are  committed

outside Singapore by Singaporeans or any person.  Where a

Singapore  citizen  commits an offence  relating  to  the

dealing  with terrorist property or failure  to  disclose

information, he may be dealt with as if the  offence  had

been committed in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Miscellaneous (Part VII of the Bill)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill also covers other

miscellaneous  areas  under Part VII  of  the  Bill,  eg,

clause 35 which is a standard provision on the commission

of  an  offence by a corporation to prevent  anyone  from

seeking refuge behind corporations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 of the Bill empowers the Minister to amend

the  Schedule by an order published in the Gazette.   The

Bill  contains  a  Schedule on actions  which  constitute

terrorist  acts, such as an act constituting  an  offence

under  the  Hijacking  of  Aircraft  and  Protection   of

Aircraft  and  International Airports Act.  Singapore  is

not  yet  a signatory to all the treaties and Conventions

relating to terrorism.  As and when we become a party  to

these  treaties and Conventions, we can  add  on  to  the

Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 of the Bill allows that the Minister may

also make regulations for the purpose of carrying out  or

giving  effect  to  the provisions  of  the  Bill.   This

provides  the  Minister  the flexibility  to  take  quick

action against terrorist financing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 39 makes a related amendment to the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore Act to  repeal  and  re-enact section 27A so as to empower the Authority to  make

regulations concerning any financial institution or class

of  financial  institutions in  order  to  discharge  any

obligation  binding on Singapore by virtue of a  decision

of the Security Council of the United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is testimony of

Singapore's commitment to the international fight against

terrorism.  Once the Bill is passed, we will take actions

in  accordance  with it.  We are playing a  cat-and-mouse

game  with  the  terrorists; they  will  be  looking  for

loopholes  to  exploit, even as we take measures  against

them.  We will monitor the effectiveness of the Bill, and

fine tune it further if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, terrorism has to

be fought on many fronts, not least of all, the financial

front.   To  deprive terrorists of funds would ultimately

lead  to  the saving of lives and properties.   There  is

undoubtedly  a great public interest to be  served  here,

and  I therefore strongly support this Bill.  At the same

time,  there must be some care to ensure that  people  or

institutions  are  not  wrongly  accused  of   supporting

terrorism.   Such accusations must only be  made  on  the

strongest  evidence,  as  the  consequences  of  a  wrong

accusation  may have severe repercussions on  individuals

or  institutions.  This Bill must therefore be  carefully

scrutinised in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even defining what is a terrorist is not an easy

thing.  I would start by looking first at the definitions

of  "terrorist" and "terrorist act" in this  Bill.   Sir,

the   definition  of  a  "terrorist"  in  clause   2   is

tautologous,  ie, the definition of "terrorist"  contains

the  word  itself.  Thus, a "terrorist"  is  someone  who

commits  or  attempts to commit any terrorist  act.   The

true meaning of a terrorist therefore has to be found  in

what  he does or threatens to do, and why he wants to  do

such acts.  This is defined in sub-clause 2.  It involves

nine types of actions and two types of intents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, with regard to the type of actions. They

involve  the  use of the word "serious"  as  in  "serious

violence against a person", "serious damage to property",

or  "serious  risk  to the health or the  safety  of  the

public".   I  wonder  whether this  is  too  restrictive.

Anyone  planning a criminal act that would  amount  to  a

seizable  offence, with the appropriate intent should,  I

would  have thought, be enough to trigger this provision.

The  key  difference between a criminal act and one  that

amounts to a terrorist act seems to be in the intent.  If

the  act  is one of the nine, done with the intention  to

influence  or  compel  any  government  or  international

organisation to do or not do something, or to  intimidate

the  public or a section of the public, it amounts  to  a

terrorist  act.   This  is  a good  attempt  at  defining

terrorist acts, but it requires a great deal of  care  in

interpreting or using it.  To take one example,  where  a

gunman robs a goldsmiths shop,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



and  puts all those around him in fear - shop assistants,

members of the public nearby, customers - he can actually

qualify as a terrorist under that definition, because  he

threatens serious violence to persons with the intent  to

intimidate  a section of the public under the definition.

Does  that  mean that his property can be forfeited?   Of

course,  if  he  robs the shop, intending  to  benefit  a

terrorist  entity, he is within the definition.   I  hope

the  Minister  will  ensure that the definition  will  be

applied with care, and not misused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the fundamental principles in criminal

justice  is  the burden and standard of proof.   Everyone

knows  that the burden on the prosecution is to  prove  a

case  beyond reasonable doubt.  The standard  of  "beyond

reasonable doubt" is to ensure the public's confidence in

the  administration  of criminal  justice,  that  no  one

should  be subjected to punishment without strong  proof.

The  Bill  has some provisions that seem to  affect  this

fundamental principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me say that I agree with the careful

drafting   of   clauses  3  to  7,  providing   for   the

prohibitions    against   the   collection,    provision,

possession or dealing of property to aid terrorist  acts.

Here,  the burden on the prosecution is a heavy  one,  to

prove  beyond reasonable doubt.  There are various  types

of  intent  - to collect, provide, possess or  deal  with

property  to support or facilitate terrorist acts.   This

is as it should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I would like to make two other

references to the standard of proof that may give rise to

concerns.  The first relates to the power of the Judge to

forfeit property.  The Judge only has to be satisfied, on

a balance of probabilities, that the property is one that

is  owned or controlled by the terrorist entity, or  that

it  is used or about to be used by terrorists, given  the

seriousness of forfeiture orders, should the standard  of

proof not be higher?  Forfeiture orders may result in the

closure  of  businesses or the eviction of  occupants  in

properties  so forfeited.  I would like the  Minister  to

assure  this  House  that the relevant  authorities  will

ensure  that  the  best  proof  be  provided  before   an

application for forfeiture is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



made.  This is especially so as the application can be ex

parte.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I wish to raise is that clause 35

provides  that a partner, director or manager, and  other

types  of employees such as the secretary, may be  guilty

of  one  or more of the offences if his company, firm  or

society,  is  proved  to  have  committed  one   of   the

prohibition offences set out in the Bill.  Sir, clause 35

provides  that the accused then has to exonerate  himself

by  proving  that the offence was committed  without  his

consent or connivance, and that he had exercised all  due

diligence to prevent such an offence.  Sir, this reversal

of  the  burden of proof is a serious one, affecting  the

presumption of innocence that our criminal justice system

is  based  on.   Departures from this principle  must  be

fully  justified.  I would ask the Minister what are  the

reasons  for  imposing on directors, managers,  partners,

secretaries  and  the like, this burden  of  exoneration.

Again,  we  would  want to be extra careful  in  accusing

anyone  of  aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation.

I  hope that we will receive assurances from the Minister

that  the  utmost care will be taken to obtain  the  best

evidence  against  individuals  or  institutions   before

proceedings under this Bill are commenced against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the September 11 incident has changed the

world,   and  significantly  affected  the  attitude   of

everyone  when  talking about the  dangers  of  terrorist

attacks.   We must however not be paranoid, and  we  must

guard  against  those  who might take  advantage  of  the

current  fear  and  paranoia  to  harm  others  by  false

accusations.   I regret that while there  is  a  duty  on

everyone  to  disclose what they suspect to be  financial

operations  in  aid of terrorism, there is  no  provision

that  would  make it a criminal offence  for  someone  to

falsely   and   maliciously  accuse   another   of   such

activities.  The Bill does provide for the protection  of

those  who  made genuine disclosures, even  if  mistaken.

But  it does not provide for sanctions against those  who

might  maliciously  accuse their neighbours  or  business

opponents of such activities.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



would  like to know what the Minister intends to do about

such cases, if they do occur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now live under the shadow of the terrorists.

This  Bill  is  a necessary measure in the  global  fight

against terrorism.  I am sure that this Bill will  be  an

important  addition  to the armoury of  laws  that  would

protect Singapore from the terrorists and ensure that  we

are  not  a  safe harbour for those who are  involved  in

supporting or financing such activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, September 11,

2001  has  left  an  indelible impact  in  the  minds  of

everyone  of the evils posed by acts of terrorism.   That

terrorism has gone global is a fact and its very  act  is

indeed a crime against humanity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorist threats to the public in Singapore are as

real  as the recent discovery of the network in Singapore

and the neighbouring countries has shown.  All these acts

of violence can only operate with financial backing.  The

bigger   the   destruction,  the  bigger  the   financing

involved.   To deal with terrorism effectively,  we  must

therefore  strike at its very core, ie, the financing  of

terrorism.   The  financing  of  terrorist  act  is   the

lifeline  that  we  will have to  choke  to  disable  any

opportunity  for  such acts to be initiated.   This  Bill

represents our contribution to global efforts  to  combat

terrorism.  I have no doubt that the Bill will  have  the

support  of the House.  However, in making laws for  this

purpose,  we  need to balance the need for  security  and

preservation of civil liberties.  While in favour of  the

Bill,  there  are certain clauses that seem too  wide  or

unclear.    The   Bill  imposes  strict   guidelines   on

disclosures  in  two  areas, and I  would  like  to  seek

clarifications  as  they  have  implications  on  persons

related to one another or to suspect.  Take clause  8(1),

accordingly, anyone in Singapore or outside Singapore who

has information pertaining to any transaction or intended

transaction belonging to a terrorist suspect  is  obliged

to disclose such information. What this means is that any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



member  of  the terrorist's immediate family  is  charged

with  the obligation of disclosure.  Such family members,

like  the spouse, children, parents or siblings, are more

likely  than  not  to have knowledge of  the  terrorist's

affairs.  Would such persons therefore be more likely  to

be  subject  to  prosecution for breach of  the  duty  of

disclosure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds us of the chaos created during the

Cultural  Revolution in China, where family members  were

obliged to tell on one another.  The distrust and discord

sown  as  a  result of such legislation could lead  to  a

breakdown  of  the  family system.   Would  Singapore  be

heading  towards such an eventuality if  this  Bill  were

passed  without a review on its implications?   Would  it

not  be  better for us to work on the responsibility  and

conscience of persons to be discerning in these areas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other concern is that imposing a duty of

disclosure on any Singapore citizen outside Singapore may

be  stretching  the  clause too  wide.   Would  Singapore

citizens  overseas be exposed to peril?  If  a  terrorist

knew that a particular Singapore citizen, say, in London,

had   information  about  his  transaction  or   proposed

transaction regarding any property belonging  to  him  or

his  terrorist organisation, what would the terrorist  do

with this Singapore citizen in light of this clause?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 on `Search and Seizure' raises a concern.

The  proviso permits a Judge, upon the application of the

Attorney-General,  to  issue a  warrant  authorising  any

person  (usually a Police Officer) to search any building

and  seize  any  property  which  the  authorised  person

reasonably  believes may be the subject of  an  order  of

forfeiture.   What  is  worrying is  that  the  Attorney-General  may  make  such  an application  based  on  mere

information and belief.  The question is, to what  extent

can  the  Attorney-General rely on mere  information  and

belief?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proviso in clause 21 authorises the Attorney-General to apply to a Judge to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



forfeit any property owned or controlled by or on  behalf

of  a  terrorist  or  a  terrorist organisation,  or  any

property  that has been or will be used to facilitate  or

carry out a terrorist act.  The concern here is that  the

Judge  orders  the  property  to  be  forfeited  to   the

Government   if  he  is  satisfied,  on  a   balance   of

probabilities,  that  the property  falls  within  clause

21(a)  or  21(b).  One would have thought that  a  higher

standard  of  proof of beyond reasonable doubt  would  be

adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an intervening period from the moment a

property is seized, pursuant to clause 11(1), till it  is

forfeited,   pursuant  to  clause  24(1).    During   the

intervening  period,  a  Judge, at  the  request  of  the

Attorney-General, may appoint a person  to  take  control

of,   manage   or   deal  with  the  forfeited   property

accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disturbing to note that the person so

appointed  has  the power to destroy property  which  has

little or no value.  Whilst we can appreciate the need to

sell  property  that is perishable, I am of  the  opinion

that no one should have the power to destroy property  of

little  or no value unless it is ordered by the Judge  to

do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16(5) empowers a Judge to order the

destruction of any property if he is satisfied  that  the

property  has little or no financial or other  value.   I

beg  to  ask what constitutes the extent of satisfaction.

Also,  what  constitutes a balance of probabilities  and,

for  that  matter,  what is meant by  "beyond  reasonable

doubt"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose an amendment to clause 28 as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sub-clause (c), perhaps we could add a new sub-clause (d) as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(d) any property seized, restrained or controlled

in  accordance  with sub-sections (a) to (c),  which  may

bear  interest  shall  be  held in  an  interest  bearing

account; and the interest accruing on the property  shall

be added to it on its release or forfeiture."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the basic objectives of the

proposed Bill are admirable and deserving of our support.

However, we must not in our enthusiasm to deal with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



terrorism  fail  to  guard against any  provisions  which

impinge on the protection for the common folks.  In other

words, we ought to ensure that the provisions in the Bill

must also give adequate protection to the common man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one of the most important aspects of the

Bill  is the definition of the word "terrorism" or,  more

specifically,  "terrorist act".  Prof. Chin  had  earlier

alluded  to  the definition and explained the meaning  of

the  two limbs encapsulated under clause 2(2)(a).  I take

it  from  his comments, and even among us, that  we  have

different ideas of what a terrorist act is.  But I  think

we  should not let this difficulty prevent us from making

a  decision, at least for the moment, on what we mean  by

terrorist act and what we should do about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all do not condone terrorism. If I may say

so,  even  as  of now, a less severe form of terrorism  - extortion   -  is  an  offence  under  our  Penal   Code.

Terrorism,  as defined in the Bill, is not  the  way  any

civilised entity promotes itself.  If any of us wishes to

compel a government to do something, we do it through the

legitimate  political process.  If we seek  to  sway  the

opinion of people, then we have to appeal to their hearts

and minds, not by using fear of harm or violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, successful civilisations and nations are those

which  are  able  to muster the support of  their  people

through  a  commonly  accepted  political  process.   The

Mongols  in  the 12th century, for instance, were  united

under the leadership of Genghis Khan.  As a nation,  they

shared  a  common vision for themselves, and maybe  their

common  desire for power led them to conquer others.   It

would  have  been, I believe, very difficult for  Genghis

Khan  to  achieve  so  much,  if  he  merely  relied   on

instilling  fear in his own people to achieve  his  aims.

But,  did he instill fear in other people?  Yes  and  no.

But the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



result  showed the difference.  By the time his grandson,

Kublai  Khan,  reigned, the Mongol Empire covered  almost

the  whole of mainland Asia and parts of Eastern  Europe.

In  places  where  the Mongols embraced  local  political

cultures,  like China and in Northern India,  the  people

continued  to  make progress.  However, in  places  where

they merely plundered in order to subdue, like in Baghdad

or  Central Europe, the contribution of Mongol  rule  was

either  miniscule  or negative.  If  the  people  do  not

willingly  accept a certain rule or ideology,  very  soon

that rule will crumble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of force and fear, Sir, to instill

compliance is not mere ancient history.  The totalitarian

regime in the previous USSR was known to have used, quite

extensively,  force incursion so as to ensure  acceptance

of  its ideas.  Dissenters were sent either to the  gulag

or  some  other remote places or made to simply disappear

from  the records.  More significantly, the fear of  such

reprisals  caused  a terror among the people.   For  some

time, the people bowed and followed but, within 70 years,

the USSR crumbled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control by the state must be pursuant to genuine

consensus,  not the other way round, where  consensus  is

pursuant  to  genuine control.  There may  be  groups  of

people  who  behave  in a manner so  repugnant  to  one's

beliefs  and  values.  But no one has a sacred  right  to

impose forcibly on them one's own values and laws by  the

use of fear and threat of serious harm.  Even if one does

so,  the  effect  is always superficial, as  history  has

shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Sir, terrorism has no place in promoting any

civilisation  or  the  cause of  any  ideology  or  major

religion  in  the  world.   There  is  thus  a  need   to

distinguish terrorism from other legitimate acts  of  war

which,  I  think, the Bill seeks to do in its  definition

section.   The  Bill  excludes  from  the  definition  of

terrorist  act,  legitimate acts of war  as  governed  by

international law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, war too has its rules. And if we look at

Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Han



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



Wu Ti, Mohamed, Charlemagne, the wars fought by them were

in   accordance  with  rules  accepted  by  the   peoples

involved.   That  is  why no one  ever  accused  them  of

terrorism  before  or  now.   For  instance,  acts  which

definitely  would  harm women, children  and  other  non-military  civilians were and are not legitimate  military

acts  by  the standard of any civilised society.   It  is

therefore  important  that we do  not  allow  any  group,

religious  or otherwise, to be inspired or encouraged  by

terrorism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the greater part of humanity abhors terrorism,

and  must seek ways to curtail it.  I see that this  Bill

seeks  to do just that, at least in contributing  towards

our common campaign towards terrorism.  Though it may  be

argued  that  the  cause of terrorism  is  political  and

social, one of the engines of terrorism is finance.   Our

effort to deal with the financial aspect of terrorism  is

one of the many prongs that we, as a nation, should apply

to  effectively  deal  with  this  issue.   The  Internal

Security   Act   deals  mainly  with  security   aspects,

particularly  with the individuals directly  involved  in

terrorist    acts.    But   terrorism   today    involves

international network.  Funds and goods are transacted in

the process.  The ISA and existing legislation do not say

much  about  this.  So this Bill seeks  to  address  this

problem.   In  this  regard,  I  suggest  that  the  Hon.

Minister  and  this House continue to formulate  ways  to

address  the  political and social  elements  that  breed

terrorism,  while  we support this Bill  to  address  the

issues as promulgated therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for Singapore to act on suppressing the

financing  of terrorists' activities.  Without access  to

funds  or  financial support, it would be more  difficult

for  terrorists  to  conduct or  sustain  their  acts  of

terror.   We  will be tightening the noose  around  their

activities,  which  are  most  likely  to  involve   mass

destruction and hurt innocent lives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill should pose as a deterrence to potential

would-be  terrorists  who  intend  to  use  Singapore  to

transfer funds or finance terrorists here or elsewhere in

the  world.   Through this Bill, we will  send  a  strong

signal to those terrorists not to mistake Singapore as  a

safe  haven  for their funds.  The Bill also reminds  all

Singaporeans  to  remain  vigilant  and  not   contribute

innocently to any terrorist acts indirectly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go into the definition of

"terrorism", which my learned colleague has so eloquently

covered  already.  However, I agree with his  definition.

May I highlight that terrorist activities usually involve

long-term planning and patience.  Their activities may go

unnoticed for years, and they are masters of substitutes,

and  might have assimilated into our society as  tenants,

neighbours,  colleagues  or friends.   Singaporeans  must

realise that that is the playing field today, and be more

vigilant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need not change our lifestyle, but it is

important   that   we  bring  home   the   message   that

Singaporeans  must  not  be complacent.   Terrorism  does

strike  at close range, in the region, and right here  in

Singapore.   For  example, it  took  years  to  plan  the

September 11 disaster that saw the collapse of  the  twin

towers  of  the  World  Trade Center,  and  the  loss  of

thousands  of lives in the United States.  Unfortunately,

the  culprits  had  gone unnoticed and undetected  for  a

while  prior to September 11.  There must be hundreds  of

innocent people who are now, on hindsight, regretting not

paying more attention to the hijackers who had led  lives

along theirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years that terrorists planned their acts

of  terrorism,  many innocent people may  have  concluded

business dealings with them or may even have rented their

properties or have contributed to their acts unknowingly.

These   innocent   people  should  not  be   unreasonably

classified  as  terrorist sympathisers,  and  have  their

properties confiscated under this Bill.  They should  not

be  penalised if they were ignorant of the on-going.   In

enforcing this law, Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



that  we have to be firm and professional, so as  not  to

unduly put stress on the business community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Prof. Chin

suggested  that the use of the word such as "serious"  in

the  definition of "terrorist act" in the Bill may be too

restrictive.  The reasons for this restrictive definition

are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this is a Bill which gives effect to the

International  Convention  for  the  Suppression  of  the

Financing  of Terrorism.  As such, the Bill's  definition

of  "terrorist act" therefore adopts the wording  of  the

Convention, and they are totally consistent with what  is

being  used in other countries as well.  The Convention's

definition of "terrorist act" includes an act intended to

cause  death or serious bodily injury to a civilian  when

the  purpose of such act is to intimidate the  population

or to compel a government to do or refrain from doing any

act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singapore is not alone in adopting such a

definition.  Our definition is also consistent  with  the

definition  used in other countries' similar  legislation

on  terrorism in the Commonwealth countries, such as  the

United  Kingdom's  Terrorism  Act  2000,  Canada's  Anti-Terrorism  Act  and  the Australia's Suppression  of  the

Financing of Terrorism Bill.  Since this Bill is to  give

effect to an International Convention, there is no reason

for  us  to  deviate  from  the  international  standards

adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this is also to maintain consistency with

the  definition of "terrorist acts" used in our own  law,

and  that  law  is  the  United  Nations  (Anti-Terrorism

Measures)  Regulations.  So, all those words we  find  in

this  particular  Bill are exactly the same  as  what  we

already   have  in  our  United  Nations  (Anti-Terrorism

Measures)   Regulations.   We  are  not  doing   anything

different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has suggested that anyone planning a

criminal act which amounts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



to  a seizable offence should be caught by the definition

of  "terrorist  act".  In my view, to  define  "terrorist

act" to include any seizable criminal offence may be  too

wide  and  over-inclusive.  We  should  target  our  laws

against   offences  which  clearly  have  a  nexus   with

terrorism.   Seizable offences, with  reference  to  non-Penal  Code  offences, are offences which are  punishable

with imprisonment for a term of three years or more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has also raised the example of a gunman

who  had  robbed  a  goldsmith shop,  and  asked  if  his

property  can  be seized or forfeited.  Let me  reiterate

that   the   main  focus  of  this  Bill  is  not   about

criminalising terrorist acts, but about criminalising the

financing  of  terrorist  acts.   As  such,  whether  the

robber's  property  will  be  forfeited  will  depend  on

whether   a  person  who  has  committed  any  of   those

provisions  relating to the financing of terrorist  acts.

A mere commission of a robbery will not make his property

liable to seizure or forfeiture under the law even if  he

had,  in  carrying out robbery, intimidated a section  of

the people around the shops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a real life example of this. On 18th

May  2001,  members  of the Kumpulan Mujahideen  Malaysia

(KMM),   staged  a  robbery  of  the  Southern  Bank   in

Peninsular  Malaysia.   They were initially  regarded  as

robbers.   But investigations subsequently revealed  that

their actions were in support of the KMM, which aimed  to

wage  a  holy  war  against the Malaysian  government  to

establish  a purist Islamic state.  Obviously, then  they

were  more  than  just  ordinary  robbers.   So,  by  our

definition,  they  will be regarded as  terrorists.   And

this is not the only example that happened last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-1970s, three gunmen robbed a bank of

RM122,000  in  Petaling Jaya.  Later, it was  found  that

they  were  also responsible for two murders.   If  these

were  all,  then,  of course, those who  were  found  and

convicted  subsequently will be convicted as robbers  and

murderers.   But when it was established that  they  were

actually members of the CPM Marxist-Leninist Faction  and

had robbed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



to  augment the CPM's funds, then, obviously,  they  were

more  than just ordinary robbers and murderers.  The  two

persons  they  murdered under the CPM's instruction  were

the Inspector General of Police, Tan Sri Abdul Rahman  in

1974, and the Chief Police Officer of Perak, Tan Sri  Koo

Chong  Kong in 1975.  So, again, by definition under  our

Bill, we will consider them as terrorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is correct in asserting that the key

difference  between a purely criminal act  and  one  that

amounts to a terrorist act lies much in the intent or the

motive  established.   But this  is  not  unique  to  the

current   Bill.    Intent  is  the  key   ingredient   in

determining culpability, even in purely criminal  actions

and  offences.   Often,  in  criminal  cases,  there  may

potentially  be more than one offence in the  laws  which

can  apply  to  the  same action  and  the  same  set  of

circumstances.   Which one to proceed with  requires  not

only  interpretation, but commonsense and judgment.   Let

me  assure  Prof.  Chin that there is  no  lapse  in  the

handling  of  such  situations  in  criminal  cases.   In

determining offences under this particular Bill, the  law

will  always be applied with care and due diligence.   We

will  always  be very careful, and not simply  abuse  the

powers provided for in the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of burden, there is indeed a high

burden  on the prosecution, because the offences  created

by  the  Convention  and the Bill  are  very  serious  in

nature.   For example, any person convicted of  providing

or   collecting  property  for  terrorist  acts  can   be

sentenced  to imprisonment for up to 10 years,  or  to  a

fine  of  up to $100,000.  Since the offences are serious

in  nature,  then we have deliberately only targeted  the

provisions   against  persons  who  have   knowingly   or

intentionally committed such acts.  This will ensure that

the   innocent  persons  are  not  prosecuted  for   such

offences.   But  if there is evidence to  show  that  the

person  has turned a blind eye to the commission of  such

acts, then the same provisions will allow us to prosecute

him, as these provisions also contain a lower threshold



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



of  "having reasonable grounds to believe" in cases where

it  is not possible to prove that the person has wilfully

or  knowingly committed such acts.  So I think  there  is

enough  flexibility built into the legislation to  enable

us   to  deal  effectively  with  the  various  types  of

offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and Mdm Ho, I believe, also expressed

concern on the order of forfeiture and the Judge  has  to

be  satisfied on the balance of probability, and also the

question  about  ex  parte.  Let me first  clarify  Prof.

Chin's point on ex parte.  The application for the  issue

of  warrant of seizure or restraint order under clause 11

is  made ex parte because there is a need to ensure  that

the  offenders do not have a chance to dispose  of  their

properties.    But  once  the  property  is   seized   or

restrained  under clause 11, the forfeiture  application,

which is made under clause 24, is not made ex parte.  The

owner  of  the  property will have a right  to  be  heard

before the Judge orders forfeiture of the property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the use of balance of probability as a

standard  of proof for forfeiture, this is not  something

new  that we are doing.  The same standard is also  found

under  the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious

Crimes  (Confiscation  of Benefits)  Act  in  respect  of

forfeiture of proceeds derived from drug trafficking  and

other  serious crimes.  The Bill therefore maintains  the

same  standard  of proof for the purpose  of  forfeiture.

Further,  this standard on the balance of probability  is

also  used in the Canada Anti-Terrorism Act.  So, let  me

assure the House that, in conducting investigations  into

these  offences, the enforcement agencies will strive  to

obtain the best evidence to support the allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the onus imposed on corporate bodies,

which  is also a question raised by Mr Andy Gan, to  make

sure that we do not unnecessarily restrict the businesses

of  our companies, clause 35, as we have put it there, is

a  standard provision commonly found in the existing Acts

as well.  It is not something that we just created out of

nowhere.   A  body  corporate can only  act  through  its

officers.  It is not unreasonable therefore to expect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



officers  of a body corporate to be responsible  for  the

acts  of  a company, such that the officers must give  an

account  of themselves if the company commits an offence.

Let  me  give  Members examples of similar provisions  in

other  legislation.  They are the Electricity  Act  2001,

the  Gas  Act  2001, the Planning Act, the Civil  Defence

Act, the Building Control Act, the Control of Vectors and

Pesticides  Act and, finally, the Fire Safety  Act.   So,

this  question of duty of the corporate officers is  also

clearly defined in other similar legislation that I  have

just cited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is concerned about people who make

malicious     complaints,    leading    to    unnecessary

investigations  and the accused party  suffering  anxiety

and  stress.  Although the Bill does not provide for  the

offence  of  malicious accusation, this is not  different

from,  say, defaming a person.  The person so defamed  or

accused  can always sue the person making the  defamatory

statement or accusation.  If the accusation is made to  a

police  officer,  then the accuser can  also  be  charged

under  the Penal Code.  For example, section 182  of  the

Penal  Code makes an offence for any person to  give  any

public  servant  any  information to  cause  such  public

servant  to  use  the  lawful powers  to  the  injury  or

annoyance of any person.  A person who is convicted under

section 182 can be sentenced to imprisonment, as well  as

to  a  fine.   So,  if  a person falsely  or  maliciously

reported his neighbour for committing a terrorist act  or

activity to a police officer, he can be dealt with  under

the  Penal  Code,  and  there is  no  need  to  put  this

provision  in  the Bill.  The Penal Code is  adequate  to

deal with such offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some of the points raised by Mdm

Ho.   Mdm Ho's view is that we are placing too much  onus

on the family members, like the spouse, children, parents

or siblings, because, she says, they are more likely than

not  to have knowledge of the terrorist affairs.   But  I

think  this is debatable.  Let me give an example of  the

Jemaah  Islamiyah  group.  Many of their  family  members

actually  claimed that they did not know.  So  I  do  not

think it is fair to say that their spouse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



or  immediate  family members will definitely  know,  and

therefore  if they report the matter, it may  lead  to  a

break-up  of  families,  like  in  the  case  during  the

Cultural Revolution.  I think the problem of the Cultural

Revolution is a totally different one.  I do not think we

should  just simply leave things be and leave it  to  the

conscience and the sense of responsibility of individuals

to  report a terrorist act or financing of such act,  and

not  put  this  into the law.  If everybody  does  behave

responsibly and acts with conscience, I think we  do  not

need any laws.  We will then be living in utopia.  But we

know  that  we are living on the earth.  So it cannot  be

done.   Therefore, it is better that we provide for  this

in  the  legislation to ensure that if family members  do

know,  and  it can be seen and shown that they  do  know,

then  it  is  their duty to make such  a  report  to  the

Police.   But, of course, in the investigation, we  shall

be thorough about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho's suggestion to exempt information received

because  of  privileged information, eg, in the  case  of

lawyers, I do not think this is necessary because  clause

8(4) of the Bill provides that it shall be a defence  for

a  person  charged  for  failure to  prove  that  he  has

reasonable  excuse for not making the disclosure  and  it

shall  be  left to the court to decide on the  merits  of

each case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho also asked what extent the Attorney-General

rely  on  information and belief to apply to a  Judge  to

issue  seizure and search warrants, and she asked if  the

burden  of  proof should be higher than  the  balance  of

probability, and whether a conviction of terrorism should

be  made first before forfeiture should take place.   Her

view  is  that  no one should have the power  to  destroy

property  of little or no value unless it is  ordered  by

the  Judge  to  do  so.   She also proposes  that  seized

property  which may bear interest be held in an interest-bearing account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address her questions in sequence. Clause 12

of  the Bill provides that an affidavit in support of the

application  for  a  warrant of  search  and  seizure  of

terrorist  property  may  be  made  by  an  investigation

officer  based  on his information and belief,  and  such

information



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



and belief are the result of investigations conducted  by

the  investigation officer, who would most likely be  the

police officer or a Commercial Affairs officer.  He would

not  act just because he had a dream the night before and

said, "I believe and, therefore, I act."  They do not act

like  that.  I do not think we can allow him to act  like

that  too.  So he must conduct an investigation and  show

that there are indeed reasonable grounds for his belief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General, therefore, does not rely on

hearsay  or mere information received.  He will  ask  the

investigation  officer,  "What  have  you  found  in  the

investigation?" and satisfy him before he applies to  the

court for the issuance of a search and seizure warrant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may wish to note that clause 11 of the

Bill provides that the court may require undertakings  to

be  given  in  respect  of application  for  warrants  or

restraint order, and the undertaking is a form  of  check

to  prevent  any  abuse of powers.  The indemnity  is  to

ensure that the law enforcement agencies investigating  a

case  must have sufficient grounds before applying for  a

warrant for seizure or a restraint order.  So he does not

just act on impulse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof based on the balance of probability is the

standard  employed under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking

and  Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits)  Act

for the forfeiture of properties or proceeds derived from

drug  trafficking  and other serious crimes.   The  Bill,

therefore, maintains the same standard of proof  for  the

purpose of forfeiture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 of the Bill allows a Judge to order

forfeiture  of  property owned or  controlled  by  or  on

behalf  of any terrorist or terrorist entity.  The  order

of  forfeiture may also be made if the property has  been

or  will  be used to facilitate or carry out a  terrorist

act.   There is no requirement to have a conviction first

of  the offences of providing or collecting property  for

terrorist  acts,  providing  property  and  services  for

terrorist purposes, use or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



possession of property for terrorist purposes and dealing

with  property  of  terrorists.   This  is  because   the

intention is to ensure that terrorist properties  can  be

confiscated by the Government.  But let me assure Members

that strong evidence will be adduced before the Attorney-General applies to a Judge for such a forfeiture order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 of the Bill also allows a person appointed

to  destroy  seized  properties that have  little  or  no

value.  But the person must first apply to the Judge  for

the  destruction order.  In other words,  he  cannot  say

that,  "I  do not like this thing lying on my desk",  and

then  he starts to destroy it.  He will have to apply  to

the court for such an order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho's suggestion that property which may bear

interest  should  be held in an interest-bearing  account

may  not  reap practical gains.  We may not  seize  large

assets or properties which may bear interest.  If a legal

requirement  is  then imposed to subject  all  properties

which  bear  interest  to  be  held  in  interest-bearing

accounts,   this   may   result   in   generating    more

administrative work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have dealt with all the points

raised by the Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>TRADE DEVELOPMENT BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>4.35 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board (TDB) was established in

1983, with the mission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



of  promoting  and  developing Singapore's  international

trade.  TDB fulfills its mission primarily through broad-based  programmes, such as organising trade missions  and

fairs,  and  helping companies navigate  through  foreign

bureaucracies via its overseas trade offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore is the 16th largest trading nation

in  the  world.   Our exports have quadrupled  from  S$50

billion  in 1985 to S$218 billion in 2001.  Our  external

trade  is  three  times the size of  our  GDP.   We  have

successfully  evolved from an entrepot base  serving  the

region, to an international hub for trade and commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore embarks on a new phase of economic

development,  we  can  no longer rely  solely  on  inward

foreign investments to propel our economic growth.   Many

of   our   competitors  have  begun  adopting  the   same

strategies  to  attract investments, and  they  are  fast

narrowing  the lead we enjoy.  At the same time,  we  are

encumbered by the tarnishing of Southeast Asia's image as

an  attractive investment destination, and  its  loss  of

investor mind-share to the economies of Northeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome these challenges, we need to broaden and

strengthen  our  base  of local enterprises,  to  provide

added  ballast to our economy.  We need to build  vibrant

and  robust  local  companies  which  can  serve  as  our

additional  engines  of growth.  In order  to  grow,  our

companies must venture overseas, given our small domestic

market.   We  should  therefore  help  them  develop  the

capabilities, connections and access to capital that they

need to spread their wings overseas.  In other words, our

aim  should  be  to  develop  a  corps  of  enterprising,

competitive International Singapore Companies (ISCs)  who

will  have  their  home  bases and core  capabilities  in

Singapore,  while  expanding and  establishing  a  strong

presence in the region and beyond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this objective, TDB has been given a new

mission  to  help  Singapore-based  companies  grow   and

internationalise successfully.  To reflect this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



new mission, it has been renamed International Enterprise

Singapore  or "IE Singapore", since 1st April  2002.   IE

Singapore  is now the primary economic agency  overseeing

the  growth of our external wing.  It will help our local

enterprises   upgrade  their  capabilities   to   compete

internationally,  develop their access to  marketing  and

distribution networks, and help them gain deep  knowledge

and  intelligence about overseas markets.   It  will  re-engineer  its major activities, from offering basic-level

market information to providing value-adding intelligence

and  capability development programmes;  from  organising

broad-based  programmes to providing customised  help  to

enterprises;   and  from  generating  trade   volume   to

strengthening enterprises' home bases in Singapore  while

they develop their overseas markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IE Singapore has also taken over from SPRING

Singapore  the responsibility of helping our SMEs  expand

overseas.   As  part  of  this effort,  it  will  promote

Singapore  as  an SME-hub by attracting enterprises  from

the  US, European Union, Japan and other countries to  be

based here, so that they can collaborate with Singapore's

ISCs to venture into the region.  These new functions  go

beyond  the  former  TDB's  traditional  role  in   trade

promotion.  However, as trading is the first step towards

internationalisation,  IE  Singapore  will  continue   to

promote  and  develop  the trade  sector,  including  hub

services like shipping, marketing and distribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the TDB Act thus reflect the new

name,  and  the  enlargement of the mandate,  powers  and

functions of IE Singapore. Let me now move on to the  key

aspects of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill renames the Trade Development

Board  as  the International Enterprise Singapore  Board,

and  enables  it  to  carry out its functions  under  the

business  name  of "IE Singapore", or any other  business

name  as  the Minister may specify.  This will  give  the

Board the flexibility to change its business name as  and

when circumstances require, without having to change  its

legal name - International Enterprise Singapore Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 expands the functions and duties of IE

Singapore.  The new functions include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) promoting or developing a business environment

in Singapore that makes Singapore a preferred centre from

which  ISCs can create, develop or expand their  business

in foreign markets;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) developing programmes and activities to assist

ISCs to do so; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) fostering and developing business networks and

linkages between ISCs and foreign businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 empowers IE Singapore to collect, compile

and  analyse information or commission surveys,  research

or   studies,  relating  to  Singapore-based  enterprises

conducting  business in foreign markets.  It also  allows

IE Singapore to enter into memoranda of understanding and

other  similar arrangements with foreign partners.   This

will  enable  the  Board  to gather  and  share  valuable

information  about overseas markets with the ISCs,  which

is crucial to aiding their expansion abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the TDB

Act  will  allow IE Singapore to expand its  work  beyond

trade  promotion,  and  to  focus  on  the  three  Cs   - Competency, Connections and Capital needed by  companies.

IE  Singapore  will help companies build competencies  in

business    processes   like   strategy   and   planning,

international marketing, manpower development,  financial

management,  as well as market information and  analysis.

IE   Singapore   will  provide  companies  the   business

opportunities   through   its   extensive   network    of

international  connections.  It will also help  companies

gain  access  to a wider range of financing  options  for

them  to  venture abroad.  Through all these initiatives,

IE  Singapore  aims to help many of our  promising  local

companies  become  tomorrow's world-class  champions,  so

that  they  can  contribute to a strong  and  sustainable

growth in the next phase of our economic development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the change

of  name to International Enterprise Singapore Board from

Trade  Development Board reflects the true nature of  the

Board  -  that of enhancing Singapore's competitive  edge

over   other  countries,  assisting  Singapore  companies

moving  abroad,  and building up of an extensive  network

linking    Singapore   businesses   to   their    foreign

counterparts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International trade normally takes place when there

are competitive advantages in doing so.  For example,  if

country  A  can produce electrical products cheaper  than

country  B,  it would be logical for trade to take  place

between  the  two countries.  However, if country  B  has

entrepreneurs  who  can invest in country  A  to  produce

those electrical goods and export them back to country  B

and other parts of the world, then country B will benefit

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, IE Singapore Board should expand its role and

do this beyond just assisting Singapore-based enterprises

find  new  markets  abroad  and compete  internationally.

However,  I  am  glad  to  hear  the  Minister  has  just

mentioned   that  we  are  also  assisting   in   capital

provision,  which  is  of  great advantage  to  companies

moving abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IE Singapore should also assist Singapore companies

identify  potential  areas  of development  in  different

countries,  taking  advantage of that country's  strength

and  exporting  these goods back to Singapore  and  other

places in the world.  It could perhaps play the role of a

match-maker and marry related Singapore enterprises so as

to  make  strategic investments in a second country  with

the purpose of securing a line of supply for a series  of

products that Singapore needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are all well aware, China is an emerging

market.   Its  vastness means that there  are  sufficient

opportunities  for everyone.  However, China's  emergence

has   also   altered  the  dynamics   of   the   business

environment.  We cannot ignore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



these  changes.   We  need to bring on  a  new  corporate

mindset as we compete with some of the best in the  world

to  carve  out a niche of our own.  I read with  interest

the success story of Singapore media group SNP Panpac  in

Liaoning province in China published in the Straits Times

on  6th July 2002.  In less than two years, it has opened

up  a market for its bilingual teaching books.  With  the

new  defined  role  of  the  IE  Singapore  Board,  I  am

confident  that  there  will be many  more  such  success

stories.   Perhaps,  IE Singapore can  look  at  how  the

networks  built  up  by Panpac in Liaoning  educationists

could   further  be  capitalised  and  introduce  related

services linked to those existing partnerships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major functions of IE Singapore is to

promote,  facilitate  and regulate  forward  and  futures

trading  in  rubber  and other commodities.   It  may  be

timely  now  to  rethink Singapore's role in  rubber  and

commodity trading.  As most local rubber dealers are  not

large  enough  to be market makers, and as  producers  of

latex  and  rubber sheets are bypassing  them  and  going

direct  to buy, say, for example, the tyre makers,  would

it  then  be  necessary now for Singapore  to  invest  in

rubber plantations abroad?  It is indeed necessary, as  I

can  see  it,  so  as to ensure a steady supply  of  good

quality   rubber   for  our  rubber  traders   to   quote

competitive  prices,  and  for Singapore  to  expand  its

investment  abroad  in  plantations,  instead   of   just

investing  the  money  in the Singapore  rubber  fund  on

securities.    To   distinguish   Singapore   from    our

competitors,  it  is necessary for us  to  re-focus,  and

perhaps accept more risks in our ventures abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Andy

Gan  brought  up two points, ie, in terms  of  capability

development  and cluster developments.  I  would  address

the  first  one,  which is on capability development.  IE

Singapore   would  groom  ISCs  by  offering   customised

assistance  at  each  stage  of the  internationalisation

process.  IE Singapore has created a new department known

as  the Capability Development Group which will focus  on

the following areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, building up companies' business

capabilities.  This is to support companies in developing

market    entry    strategies,   marketing    techniques,

appropriate  product  designs  and  manpower  development

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, international partnership. To support the

internationalisation of companies to successful partners,

IE Singapore would create and facilitate on-line and off-line  international networking platforms.   IE  Singapore

would  also  encourage foreign enterprises to  locate  in

Singapore   for  business  partnerships  with   Singapore

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, helping companies to raise funds for

overseas  ventures  and manage the financial  risks.   IE

Singapore would provide programmes to raise awareness  on

various  financing  options and  help  companies  develop

financial strategies to venture abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the clusters specifically, in terms of industry

clusters,  IE  Singapore  is currently  focusing  on  the

following  six technology business:  lifestyle  business,

infrastructure business, business services, international

trading and trade logistics.  I would stress however that

this  list  is  not exhaustive and will  be  periodically

reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE PRODUCTIVITY AND STANDARDS BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity and Standards Board (or PSB) was

formed  in April 1996 through the merger of the  National

Productivity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



Board (NPB) and the Singapore Institute of Standards  and

Industrial Research (SISIR), with the mission of  raising

Singapore's  productivity.  Its focus then was  on  three

key  areas:  productivity; standards and  metrology,  and

small and medium enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 20 years, PSB has spearheaded the

nation-wide  Productivity Movement as a key part  of  our

economic  strategy.  Going forward, there is a  continued

need  to champion productivity, as it will determine  how

competitive we are, and how fast our living standards can

rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Singapore progresses from an investment-driven to an innovation-driven economy, we should refocus

our  productivity strategy.  The emphasis has  to  be  on

increasing  Total  Factor Productivity  (TFP),  in  other

words, getting increases in output through better use  of

resources  and  better  ways  of  organising  firms'  and

industries' operations. There is a limit to how  much  we

can    raise   productivity   through   greater   capital

investments  alone.   While  capital  investments  remain

critical for economic growth, gains in productivity  will

increasingly   come   from   new   ideas   and    quality

improvements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB has thus revised its mission to focus on

increasing our TFP by promoting innovation.  It will help

our  workers  and enterprises build up their capabilities

to  innovate  and  create higher value.   PSB  will  help

upgrade  our domestic non-tradable sectors to  make  them

more   productive  and  resilient.   It  will  also   pay

particular  attention  to the development  of  our  local

SMEs,  whose productivity lags significantly  behind  the

larger companies in Singapore, as well as that of SMEs in

the  developed countries. In addition, PSB will  continue

to promote standards and quality to enhance productivity,

to   ensure   product  safety,  and  to  promote   market

recognition and acceptance of our products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB's new name, SPRING Singapore, encapsulates these

changes in its mission and functions.  SPRING stands for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



Standards,  Productivity and Innovation for  Growth.   It

connotes  innovativeness,  dynamism  and  renewal  -  all

attributes needed for future competitiveness and economic

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the PSB Act reflect this new name,

and  the enlargement on the mandate, powers and functions

of  SPRING  Singapore.  Let me now move  on  to  the  key

aspects of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill renames the Productivity and

Standards  Board  as  the  Standards,  Productivity   and

Innovation  Board,  and  enables  it  to  carry  out  its

functions under the business name "SPRING Singapore",  or

any  other  business  name as the Minister  may  specify.

This  will  give the Board the flexibility to change  its

business name as and when circumstances require,  without

having to change its legal name - Standards, Productivity

and Innovation Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 expands the functions and duties of SPRING

Singapore.  The new functions include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) raising total factor productivity through the

promotion of innovation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) promoting the development of the domestic

sector;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) being Singapore's national accreditation

authority to accredit conformity assessment bodies; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) administering the Weights and Measures Act,

which  PSB  took  over  from  the  previous  Weights  and

Measures Office in April 1999.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 provides for wider representation in the

constitution of the Board.  Section 5(1) of  the  current

Act  stipulates that the Board shall consist  of  members

representing the interests of the Government,  employers,

trade  unions,  professional and academic  staff  of  the

institutions of higher learning in Singapore.   Clause  6

amends  this section to allow Board members to  come  not

only  from these bodies, but also from any other  sectors

or  classes  of persons, such as the business  community.

This will provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



greater  flexibility in the selection and appointment  of

Board members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 42(3) to increase the

maximum penalty for offences under regulations made under

the  Act.   It  raises the maximum fine  from  $5,000  to

$10,000, and the maximum imprisonment term from 6  months

to  2  years.  This is principally aimed at aligning  the

penalty  for  non-compliance  (by  conformity  assessment

bodies)  in  the  testing  and assessment  of  controlled

goods, with the penalty under the Consumer Protection Act

for  the supply of non-registered controlled goods.  Both

offences  result in the same consequence,  that  is,  the

supply  of  unsafe controlled goods, but at  present  the

penalties  under  the PSB Act are much  less  than  those

under the Consumer Protection Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the PSB

Act  address  the  fundamental  need  for  Singapore   to

progress  up  the  innovation ladder in order  to  remain

competitive.  We need to help local SMEs, in  particular,

to  anticipate  and  adapt  to emerging  trends,  discard

models and practices that have outlived their usefulness,

and  reinvent  themselves.  We need to  usher  in  a  new

SPRING  of  fresh  ideas, new capabilities  and  creative

initiatives   in  the  workplace  and  in  the   business

environment,  in order to propel our economy  to  greater

heights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Animals and Birds Act was enacted in 1965 to

consolidate the various legislation relating to  animals.

It  contains legislation to prevent the introduction  and

spreading  of  animal and bird diseases, to  control  the

import  and  export  of  animals and  birds,  to  prevent

cruelty  to animals, control livestock products,  and  to

regulate the use of veterinary biologics.  This  Act  has

not  undergone any major review since its enactment.   My

Ministry  has  proposed this Bill for  the  purposes  of,

firstly, to enhance the prevention and control of animal,

bird  and  fish diseases; secondly, the strengthening  of

the  provisions for the prevention of animal cruelty; and

thirdly, improving the operational efficiency of the Agri-Food  and  Veterinary  Authority  in  administering   the

provisions  of  this  Act.  I shall now  go  through  and

explain the rationale of the main features of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Enhance  the  prevention and control of animal  and  bird diseases</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is always a potential risk, although

generally remote, for a disease agent present in animals,

birds and fishes, to develop an ability to infect humans.

In  recent  years, there have been reports world-wide  of

outbreaks  of  animal  diseases that  can  be  passed  to

humans,  such as the Mad Cow Disease, the Avian Bird  Flu

and  the  Nipah  Virus  Disease  found  in  pigs.   These

diseases  pose  a threat to public health.   Also,  there

have  been  outbreaks of other animal diseases,  such  as

Foot  and Mouth Disease, which do not affect humans,  but

could nevertheless have a significant impact on trade  in

animals,   birds  and  their  products.    Singapore   is

currently  free from such diseases, but  we  need  to  be

vigilant  and  alert  to keep these  and  other  emerging

threats at bay.  This Bill strengthens the provisions for

disease  prevention,  control and  detection,  so  as  to

enable the AVA to deal with animal-related diseases  more

effectively  and  promptly.  Let me  elaborate  on  these

amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a major international trading hub for

aquatic animals, such as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



ornamental  fish,  with its trade  valued  at  about  $75

million annually.  Currently, the Act does not cover fish

diseases.  Clause 3 of this Bill proposes to include fish

into  the  definition  of  "Animal"  in  this  Act.   The

definition of "fish" covers fishes, crustaceans, mollusks

and  other aquatic animals.  This amendment will  provide

the  necessary  protection for  the  health  of  fish  in

Singapore and the regulation of trade in aquatic  animals

in accordance with international requirements.  Clause  3

also allows for the Minister to expand the definitions of

"animal"   and   "disease"  through  an   order   and   a

notification in the Gazette respectively, should diseases

transmitted by other organisms currently not  covered  in

this Act subsequently become significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the AVA can deny diseased animals or

birds  being  imported into Singapore.  The amendment  in

clause  8  of  the  Bill will further enhance  the  AVA's

powers  by  allowing the AVA to prevent  the  entry  into

Singapore of any vehicle, ship or aircraft, suspected  of

carrying diseased animals or birds, without the need  for

the  animals  or birds to be inspected and  found  to  be

diseased.  For instance, the animals or birds may not  be

showing  signs  of a disease when they  left  the  source

country,  but  it  is  later known that  they  have  been

exposed  to the disease and therefore pose a risk.   This

proposed  power would be exercised only  if  the  AVA  is

satisfied that the suspected diseased animals or birds on

board   the  vehicle,  ship  or  aircraft,  can  pose   a

significant risk to the health of our population, or  our

animals or birds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 11 of the Act currently requires imported

dogs and cats to be confined on board a ship, unless  the

AVA  authorises  their landing.  This is to  prevent  the

introduction  into Singapore of any diseases  that  these

dogs  and cats may carry.  Any animals and birds imported

or  transhipped  by  sea via Singapore could  potentially

introduce diseases into Singapore.  Clause 9 of the  Bill

therefore expands the scope of section 11 to enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



the AVA to confine to the ship, any animal and bird being

imported or transhipped by sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 13 and 14 of the Bill enhance AVA's

powers  to  examine and deal with animals and birds  that

are diseased or suspected of being diseased.  Animals and

birds to be imported or exported out of Singapore can  be

detained  at  a  quarantine station  for  examination  to

ensure that they are free from disease.  They can also be

destroyed  if they are found to be a disease  risk.   AVA

can  also  examine  animals or birds suspected  of  being

diseased  to make a disease diagnosis.  This can  include

taking  environmental  samples, such  as  their  feed  or

bedding  materials, or destroying the animals and  birds,

if  indeed  that  is necessary to diagnose  the  disease.

Animals  or  birds  which have been in contact  with,  or

exposed  to,  diseased animals or  birds,  or  which  may

perpetuate the disease, can also be destroyed to  prevent

further spread of the disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an animal or bird disease outbreak, the

movement  of  people  and vehicles  into  and  out  of  a

diseased  area  may  become the means for  spreading  the

disease  around  Singapore.  By virtue of the  amendments

under  clause 16 of the Bill, the Minister may order  the

restriction  of  movement  of  people  and  vehicles   in

diseased areas in order to contain the problem.  I  would

like  to  assure  the House, however, that  the  Minister

would  exercise  this  power only  in  serious  cases  of

diseases that can affect humans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 of the Bill updates the provisions for

establishing quarantine stations for animals and birds in

veterinary centres.  It provides for the AVA to establish

or designate more quarantine stations if the AVA assesses

that this is necessary for disease control.  The AVA  can

also  license veterinary centres to ensure that they  are

properly  managed  and  equipped  for  the  treatment  of

animals and birds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology has progressed globally to a level where

there  are genetically modified organisms and GMO derived

products which have been commercialised or are in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



the  process of being commercialised.  Clause 30  of  the

Bill  provides for the regulation of the import  and  the

possession of animal-related GMOs in order to ensure that

there  is  no  inadvertent  introduction  of  undesirable

animal-related  GMOs  or GMO-derived  products  that  can

compromise  the  health  of our  population,  or  of  our

animals and birds.



<br><br><i>Strengthen  provisions for animal welfare and  prevention of animal cruelty</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the abandonment of animals, besides being a

cruel act, also contributes to the proliferation of stray

animals.  Over the years, the AVA, unfortunately, has not

seen  any reduction in the rate of abandonment of animals

by  owners.  Each year, the AVA and SPCA have to put down

about 9,000 dogs and 12,000 cats.  The AVA and SPCA  also

impound  around 200 and 1,000 pure breed dogs  each  year

respectively.   Clauses 20-22 of the Bill strengthen  the

AVA's  power  to  deal  with  cruelty  to  animals.   The

abandonment of animals without reasonable cause  is  made

an  offence.   This  is to serve as a  deterrent  against

irresponsible   pet  owners.   In  addition,   the   Bill

increases the maximum penalty for animal cruelty offences

from  the  current $500 fine and/or a jail  term  of  six

months  to  a  proposed $10,000 fine or a  jail  term  of

twelve months.  The Bill also provides AVA with the power

to  enter and search any premises with suspected  cruelty

cases.   Animals subjected to cruelty can be  taken  away

from  their  owners  and can be medically  treated  by  a

licenced veterinarian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 of the Bill provides for a new section to

regulate the keeping and breeding of animals and birds to

ensure  public  health and safety, and to prevent  animal

cruelty.   It  also regulates the feeding of animals  and

birds  to  keep  in  check  the  proliferation  of  stray

animals,  which  in  turn  can  help  in  preventing  and

controlling the spread of animal and bird diseases.



<br><br><i>Improve AVA's operational efficiency</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 6, 8, 13-15, 25 and 28 of the Bill

include amendments to give AVA the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



flexibility to outsource some of its functions to augment

its  own  services.   The Director-General  of  the  AVA,

subject  to  any  general or special  directions  of  the

Minister,  can designate suitably qualified persons  from

the private sector, such as authorised examiners in order

to  carry out inspections, examinations, tests, treatment

and  certification of animals and birds  for  import  and

export,   and   for  the  diagnosis  of   disease.    The

impoundment  of strays and identification of animals  and

birds,  eg,  through  micro-chipping,  can  similarly  be

outsourced  to  private entities.  The  AVA  will  direct

these  authorised examiners on the functions  to  perform

and  specify  the  procedures and  conditions  for  these

authorised  examiners  to comply  with.   The  authorised

examiners will not be given enforcement powers.  The  AVA

will  still retain overall control and accountability  in

the  final  judgment  on disease  control  based  on  the

findings   and   recommendations  of   these   authorised

examiners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 of the Bill re-enacts the existing section

57  to  make clearer the procedure for the forfeiture  of

items.   The revised provisions are similar to  those  in

the  Wholesome Meat and Fish Act.  Clauses 24 and  31  of

the  Bill  enhance the AVA's powers of investigation  and

enforcement  and  facilitate the AVA  to  carry  out  the

functions  of  this Act more effectively.  This  includes

powers to suspend or revoke licences and permits, require

the  production  of  documents,  remove  obstructions  to

entering   a  premise  or  vehicle,  to  facilitate   the

examination  of  any animal or bird, and  compound  minor

offences.  These provisions will allow for more effective

enforcement of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum penalties for offences committed under

the  Act are also increased under clause 34 of the  Bill.

This  is  to  maintain the level of deterrence  as  these

penalties have not been revised since the Act was enacted

in  1965.  Offences that present a lower risk of  disease

spread will incur penalties not more than $5,000 in  fine

and/or jail term of up to six months.  Offences that have

a higher risk of disease spread and a greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>

impact  on  animal  and public health will  incur  higher

maximum penalties of a $10,000 fine and/or a jail term of

up to twelve months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the Animals and Birds

(Amendment) Bill will strengthen the existing  provisions

to  prevent the introduction into, and control the spread

of   diseases  of  animals  and  birds,  including   fish

diseases, in Singapore.  It will better enable the AVA to

deal  with  the  animals, birds and  fish  diseases  more

effectively and promptly in order to protect  the  health

of   Singaporeans   from   transmissible   animal-related

diseases.   It  will also strengthen provisions  for  the

prevention of animal cruelty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.

The  Bill  will address concerns on the spread of  animal

and  bird  diseases  and  provide better  protection  for

consumers  in  Singapore.  With the growing awareness  on

animal   welfare,  it  is  also  timely  to  revise   the

provisions  of  the  Animals and  Birds  Act  to  prevent

cruelty to animals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a civilised society, acts of cruelty should be

prevented, not only to humans, but also to animals.   The

recent  incidents  on  cruelty  to  animals  have  raised

concerns  on  how we can address cruel acts  on  animals.

But,  Sir,  we must be careful to achieve a fair  balance

between  protecting animals and protecting human  rights.

Although  stringent penalties will serve as a  deterrent,

it  may impose unfair punishment to some who infringe the

Act,  especially first-time offenders, or those who  were

provoked by animals to act recklessly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the following specific

provisions   in   the   Bill  to  seek   the   Minister's

clarifications.   One,  inconsistent  provisions  in  the

Bill.   There seems to be inconsistencies in the proposed

Bill  with  regard  to  the mode  of  transportation  for

animals and birds into Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



Clause  7  of the Bill amends section 9 of the  principal

Act  by  empowering an authorised officer  to  board  any

ship,  aircraft, or train, for the purpose  of  examining

any  animal  or  bird.   But it  has  not  empowered  the

authorised  officer  to  board any  vehicle  transporting

animals or birds into Singapore. This provides a loophole

for  the importation of animals or birds by land.  I hope

the  Minister can explain why the authorised  officer  is

not  empowered to examine animals or birds on  board  any

vehicle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 8 of the Bill, section 10 provides the

power  for  the  Director-General to deal  with  diseased

animals   and   birds  being  imported  into   Singapore.

However,  section 10(1) only specifies animals and  birds

on  board vehicle, aircraft or ship.  There is no mention

of   train.   Thus,  the  Director-General  is  also  not

empowered  to  deal  with animals and birds  imported  by

trains.  This provision is also inconsistent with  clause

7,  as  the mode of transportation is not comprehensively

spelt  out.   Similarly, clause 16 of the  Bill  has  not

empowered  the  Minister  to  restrict  the  movement  of

animals  and birds by train into, within or  out  of  any

disease infected area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inconsistent provisions in the Bill will

not  provide  a watertight system to prevent and  control

the spread of animal and bird diseases into Singapore.  I

hope the Minister can address these concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, clause 3 of the Bill adopts a different

definition for animals as compared to section 42  of  the

Animals and Birds Act.  The definition in clause  3  does

not include reptiles and insects.  May I clarify with the

Minister  whether  the  proposed  Bill  will  cover   the

importation  of  reptiles  and  insects?   Reptiles   and

insects  can  also  be  potential disease  carriers  into

Singapore.



<br><br><i>Balance  between protecting animals and protecting  human rights</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree that more should be done to

protect the welfare of animals, we must also consider the

rights of human beings.  Clause 20 amends section 43



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



which  deals  with cruelty to animals.  It has  increased

the  maximum penalty for a fine not exceeding $500  or  a

term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or both, to

a  fine  not  exceeding $10,000 or a term of imprisonment

not  exceeding 12 months or both.  We need to  address  a

fundamental  question.   Is cruelty  to  animals  such  a

serious   criminal  offence  that  warrants  a   12-month

imprisonment term for the offenders?  This is  especially

so  for first-time offenders.  According to section 42 of

the  Animals  and Birds Act, the definition  of  "animal"

includes  any  beast,  bird,  fish,  reptile  or  insect,

whether  wild or tame.   Therefore, technically speaking,

if  a  mosquito, which is an insect, bites you,  and  you

kill  the  mosquito by cruelly beating  it,  you  may  be

imprisoned for such an act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think this is the intention of the

proposed  Bill.  We need a clearer definition on  cruelty

to animals, as spelt out in section 42.  By enhancing the

powers  of  the  court, we may send a wrong  signal  that

offenders  of  cruelty  to  animals  should  be  severely

punished.   I  am concerned about the recent imprisonment

sentences  served on animal abusers.  To achieve  a  fair

balance  between protecting human rights  and  protecting

animals,  I  propose  that we should  adopt  a  graduated

punishment  system whereby first-time offenders  will  be

fined,  and repeat offenders may be fined or jailed.   In

this  way,  we not only deter acts of cruelty to  animals

but  also protect human rights.  Sir, we must not readily

send  our people to jail, just because of cruel  acts  on

animals.



<br><br><i>Operational efficiency of AVA</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to achieve greater operational efficiency in

enforcing the Animals and Birds Act, we need to  adopt  a

holistic  approach to control animals in Singapore.   All

pet  animals  must  be  licensed and  tagged,  so  as  to

facilitate the traceability of owners and animals.   This

will  improve the effectiveness of enforcing the Act with

regard  to  the  abandonment of animals  by  owners.   We

should also strengthen the Act to instill a greater sense

of  responsibility  among pet owners.   At  present,  any

person can purchase or adopt an animal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



as  a pet without undergoing any training to care for the

animal.   As  a result, some animal owners may  encounter

difficulties  in  keeping  their  pets,  thus  losing  or

abandoning  their pets.  This will consequently  increase

the  population  of  strays and pose  a  higher  risk  of

disease spread in our society.   I would suggest  to  the

Minister to include specific provisions on responsibility

of pet owners in the Animals and Birds Act.



<br><br><i>Licensing of veterinary centres</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 29, section 65 sets out a new provision to

license  veterinary centres.  I support this measure.   I

would  like to raise a concern on its impact on  business

costs.  I hope the licensing procedures and fees will not

impose  an  undue cost burden on the veterinary  centres,

which might result in the closure of these centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act was enacted in 1965 for, inter alia, the

prevention of cruelty to animals and birds, for  measures

pertaining  to  the  general welfare and  improvement  of

animals  and birds in Singapore.  The proposed amendments

are  timely  and  to  be welcomed.  There  was  a  recent

newspaper  report that the Housing and Development  Board

does  not  allow the keeping of cats in HDB flats.   Dogs

are allowed.  The relevant non-governmental organisations

have voiced their disappointment and made submissions  to

the  HDB  to  review their position with  regard  to  the

prohibition against cats.  It may be argued that this  is

discriminatory in nature.  HDB may well have good reasons

for  their  current  position.   Perhaps  the  HDB  could

further   review,   together  with  interested   parties,

including relevant NGOs, to see if their rules  could  be

modified  to allow one cat per household as a pet  for  a

start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also encourage our children and adults to

promote  in schools, homes and workplaces, the prevention

of cruelty to animals and birds.  They must be encouraged

to promote the general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



welfare  and  improvement of animals and birds,  both  at

home and in the environment as a whole, and, I would  add

also, prevention of cruelty to animals in the zoo.   This

will,  I  believe, make us, as human beings, more  caring

and  compassionate and, hopefully, less selfish and self-centred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or more of our polytechnics and/or universities

should  also consider, if found practicable, to introduce

veterinary science as a discipline, either as  a  diploma

or  degree course, to encourage our young boys and  girls

to  take up this course, so that in the process, it  will

improve the welfare and care for animals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring up another point. As I read

section   69H  in  clause  31  of  the  Bill,  it   says,

"Protection  from  liability", and  this  is  actually  a

general  principle that needs to be considered, not  just

this  particular  Bill but also quite a lot  of  statutes

that would be relevant.  It says in section 69H:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No suit or other legal proceedings shall lie

against  the  Authority,  the  Director-General  or   any

authorised officer, police officer, officer of customs or

any  other  person  acting under  the  direction  of  the

Authority  or Director-General for anything which  is  in

good  faith done in the execution or purported  execution

of this Act or any rules made thereunder."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, this is a provision to exculpate the

State  from any form of liability.  On the whole, it  may

be  a  good provision.  But it may be timely to note that

if  you look at the legal entity called the "Republic  of

Singapore"  or the State, it is the richest legal  entity

in  Singapore.  It has also, arguably, the most number of

civil   servants,  staff  and  legal  officers  who   are

competent and well informed to carry out the duties under

the  Act.   Therefore, should they  be  given  the  extra

privileges  of immunity from legal suits, ie,  not  being

able  to  be  sued  at  all?   Unlike  private  citizens,

companies  or  NGOs,  it  is  something  to  be  reviewed

perhaps, although one can well understand the State needs

to be protected as much as possible from legal liability.

But  there  must come a time when there  is  a  sense  of

responsibility and fear of potential legal action for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



damages or other legal remedy by which then, there would,

in    all    probability,   be   higher   standards    of

professionalism, and this surely must  be  good  for  the

State as a whole in the long term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge, therefore, maybe in futuro, that this

provision, and provisions of a like nature, be considered

in  the  various  statutes  of  Singapore  that  we  have

currently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

reply  to Dr Teo Ho Pin's points first and then cover  Mr

Chandra Mohan's.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to start by commending Dr Teo for

having obviously gone through this Bill with a fine-tooth

comb,  and  for detecting what he felt were  inconsistent

provisions in the Bill.  I am even more happy  to  report

that  my civil servants have gone through this Bill  with

an  even  finer tooth comb.  I would like to  assure  him

that  there  are  no loopholes.  Let me  deal  with  them

specifically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo was worried about inconsistent definition of

the  means  of transport referred in section 9.   Let  me

first  bring  him back to sections 7 and 8  of  the  Act.

Section  7  provides that no one can import an animal  or

bird into Singapore without a licence.  In section 8,  if

and when that person does import such a live organism, he

has to report to the AVA.  Section 9, which Dr Teo refers

to,  places an additional burden upon the captain  of  an

aircraft,  a  ship, or the guard of a train.   These  are

modes  of  transport  which are  large  and  require  the

officers  specifically  to  board  and  conduct  a   more

detailed  examination and in which we want to  place  the

onus  of notification, not just on the importer of  these

animals or livestock, but on the person in charge of that

aircraft,  ship  or train.  This is also related  to  the

fact  that  in certain cases, livestock may not  even  be

imported  into  Singapore.  They may be  transhipped  via

Singapore.  And such a person may say, "Look,  I  am  not

importing this animal or bird, and I do not feel  that  I

need to apply for an import licence."  Section 9 gives us

the specific



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



authority to require that the master or captain  of  this

transportation means will specifically inform us that  he

has  on board such livestock.  And if we feel that  there

are  public health concerns, we may then decide  that  we

may need to board to conduct an inspection or, indeed, to

confine the animal to that ship, aircraft  or train.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next section where he was worried about is the

apparent exclusion of the word "train" from vehicle.   We

have  just  checked with the Attorney-General's  Chambers

and  I  have  been  informed that when they  refer  to  a

vehicle,   they   mean  a  conveyance  or   transmission,

especially  a  structure with wheels in which  things  or

people  are  transported by land.   And  I  am  therefore

assured  that  this  includes trains.   So  there  is  no

loophole in that respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move on, he brought up the issue of a balance

between  human rights and animal rights.  Let me,  first,

assure  Members  of the House that there  are  no  animal

rights.   We  are not conferring any rights  on  animals.

However,  the issue of cruelty has got everything  to  do

with  humanity and with social norms.  When an animal  is

abandoned,  hurt  or  stolen,  the  emotional  pain   and

distress  which the owner of that animal  feels  is  very

much  a  human issue.  It is not simply an  issue  of  an

animal right.  Similarly, when a dog is cooked alive with

an  acetylene torch, as has indeed happened in Singapore,

even  though that dog is a stray, it offends  our  social

norms, our sensitivities as to what is appropriate in our

culture.   So I want to reassure the House that  when  we

are  talking about cruelty to animals, we are not talking

about stomping on a cockroach or killing a mosquito.   We

are  talking  about  the  need to  have  the  ability  to

intervene  when people indulge in acts which  go  against

our  social norms, or indulge in acts which will actually

cause distress and pain to fellow human beings.  So,  let

me  assure  the House that it is all about human  beings.

It is not about animal rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to talk about the operational

efficiency  of the AVA and how we need it.  He  suggested

that all pet animals be licensed and tagged.  Let me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



first  tell  him  that we license all  dogs  and  we  tag

imported  dogs.   We  do  not tag  rabbits,  chinchillas,

guinea  pigs  and all the other things.  In fact,  if  we

were  to  indulge in that, it will surely raise our  fees

and  it would be something which, I am sure, will not  be

popular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand is that we will do only what is necessary

and  what  is  reasonable.   And  having  put  all  these

licensing  requirements in place, the  AVA  will  operate

only  on a cost recovery basis.  We do not intend to make

money  from  this,  and  we  will  not  indulge  in   any

unnecessary tests, licensing or any other procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to move on to the points raised by Mr

Chandra Mohan.  The issue of cats in HDB flats is  not  a

new  issue.  Again, I want to stress that it is not about

cats.   It is about human beings, social norms and public

acceptance.    To-date,  there  has  been  a  difference,

whether you like it or not, in terms of public acceptance

of  dogs  vis-a-vis cats.  It is not a matter of what  is

right, or what is wrong.  There is a difference.  In  the

past,  the HDB has incessantly received complaints  about

cats  from  other  residents who obviously  are  not  cat

lovers.  There is a difference between a cat and  a  dog.

Cats  are  nomadic by nature.  A cat is not  some  animal

which normally takes kindly to a leash.  A cat is not  an

animal  which  you  can leave in a flat.   The  moment  a

window  or  any opening is available, that cat will  move

out.   The  cat  is  nomadic  by  nature.   The  cat  has

defecation   or   urinary  habits  which  may   aggravate

neighbours.   The caterwauling of cats is part  of  their

mating ritual, and the veterinarians in the AVA have told

me  that cats caterwaul in post-coital agony - not  post-coital  ecstasy  - it is also a source of irritation  for

neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that it is a never, never situation

with  cats.   I  am  just pointing  out  that  there  are

problems.   What  the  HDB has to do  is  to  strike  the

appropriate balance between the needs and desires of all,

if  not most, of the residents.  Nevertheless, I am aware

that  the  Cat Welfare Society has submitted a re-appeal,

and the Ministry will examine the re-appeal for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



fresh grounds.  And if indeed there is merit in this,  or

there  are ways in which we can be more flexible  in  our

implementation, we will certainly look at it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he talked about the zoo, I hope he was not

implying that there was any cruelty in our zoo.   Because

I  am  very,  very certain that our zoo is,  in  fact,  a

showcase  of how animals should be treated and kept  and,

in  fact, looked after in the most appropriate way.  And,

in  fact, it is exactly the educational value of the  zoo

which,  I  think,  will  actually bring  about  a  better

attitude  of  human  beings to the  proper  treatment  of

animals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion of the university running a

veterinary science course, this, obviously, is  something

which  the  Ministry of Education will  have  to  decide.

But,  from  my perspective, I do not think this  will  be

necessary.   Members of this House may be  keen  to  note

that it is harder to get into a veterinary school than it

is   to  get  into  a  medical  school.   The  number  of

veterinarians we need in Singapore is much, much  smaller

than  the  number of doctors we need.  And if we  do  not

have  the  critical mass to conduct a good, high  quality

course,  we  are  better  off sending  people  with  this

ability and aptitude to appropriate overseas centres  for

their training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point he made is about protection from

liability.   I  think  those  are  generic  points,   not

specific to this Bill itself.  But the only thing which I

would  like  to  say in reply is that this  protects  the

Authority, the Director-General and public officials  who

are performing their duties pursuant to directions of the

legislation,  or  to rules passed by Parliament,  or  the

appropriate  Executive, and that they are doing  this  in

good faith.  If these officers do not perform the task in

good  faith, they are liable to prosecution, not only  by

the  public,  but  even internally, subject  to  our  own

disciplinary  processes and indeed criminal  prosecution.

I think, as a lawyer, he would agree with that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If members of the public feel that laws are unfair,

the appropriate forum for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



that   is  this  Parliament,  and  that  is  why  Members

scrutinise all legislation which is passed down here, and

all rules and subsidiary legislation emanating from that.

If  the  laws have been misapplied, members of the public

have a recourse to the legal system.  And that is why  we

have  more  than  adequate lawyers in  Singapore.   So  I

think,  contrary to your premise, it would  be  wrong  to

assume  that  the  State  and its public  officials  and,

indeed, outsourced agents, acting on behalf of the State,

are suddenly being given a licence to behave in an unfair

manner, in an unjustified manner, in a capricious manner.

I do not think that is the state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Vivian Balakrishnan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, plumbers who are registered with PUB

are  allowed to carry out plumbing works.  There are  two

types  of  plumbers, namely, sanitary plumbers and  water

service  plumbers.  Sanitary plumbers carry out  sanitary

works,  such as the installation of sanitary fittings  in

toilets  and  laying of sanitary pipe work,  while  water

service plumbers carry out plumbing works for the  supply

of  drinking  water.   Both sanitary  and  water  service

plumbers are regulated by PUB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sewerage and Drainage (Amendment) Bill seeks to

abolish  the  registration of  sanitary  plumbers.   This

deregulation, however, applies only to sanitary plumbers.

Water  service plumbers will continue to be regulated  by

PUB.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the registration scheme for

sanitary  plumbers was started in 1976.  The  scheme  was

introduced  to  build  up  a  pool  of  experienced   and

qualified sanitary plumbers.  Today, there are about  550

sanitary  plumbers registered with PUB.  To  qualify  for

registration, they must pass the relevant skills  courses

conducted by the Construction Industry Training Institute

and  the Institute of Technical Education.  However,  not

all   sanitary  works  require  the  skills  of  a  fully

qualified  plumber to do the job.  There are two  aspects

of  works  carried  out by registered sanitary  plumbers.

One  is  to  carry  out  minor sanitary  works,  such  as

changing and relocating toilet bowls.  The other  is  the

construction  of the sanitary pipe work in new  buildings

and developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, minor sanitary works are not difficult in

nature.   A  normal renovation contractor will  have  the

skills  to  do a good job.  But, currently, a  renovation

contractor cannot undertake any sanitary work  unless  he

possesses the full qualifications and is registered  with

PUB.   This  has resulted in a protected market  for  the

qualified  sanitary  plumbers even  for  works  that  are

relatively  simple and straightforward.   Abolishing  the

registration of sanitary plumbers will open up the market

for  other contractors to undertake minor sanitary  works

and lower the cost of such services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the construction of sanitary pipe work in new

buildings and developments, the Sewerage and Drainage Act

has  a  provision to require the developer  to  engage  a

qualified architect or engineer to be responsible for the

proper  design  and construction of the  sanitary  works.

This  aspect  of  sanitary  works  will  continue  to  be

regulated by PUB which will continue to conduct checks on

completed  sanitary works.  This provision is  sufficient

to  ensure  the sanitary facilities in new buildings  and

developments are properly installed.  There is  therefore

no  need for PUB to continue with the registration scheme

for sanitary plumbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, PUB has been in discussion with the

Singapore   Plumbing  Society  (SPS)  on   its   proposed

deregulation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



registered  sanitary plumber scheme.  SPS  has  indicated

that it will put up an accreditation scheme for qualified

sanitary  plumbers.  This would allow qualified  sanitary

plumbers  to  be recognised and engaged for more  complex

sanitary  piping  work  required for  new  buildings  and

developments.   SPS  will encourage  existing  registered

sanitary  plumbers to become its members.  It  will  also

take  steps to promote and market their plumbers to serve

the  public  and  work  with the training  institutes  to

continue to upgrade the skills of the sanitary plumbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now move on to the main

provisions in this Bill.  The main provision of the  Bill

is  clause 6.  It repeals sections 36 and 37, and removes

the  requirement  for registration of sanitary  plumbers,

hence, opening up sanitary work to other contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses make consequent and minor changes

to  the  Act to effect the deregulation of the Registered

Sanitary Plumbers Scheme.  The deregulation will  benefit

house  owners  and  developers,  as  they  will  not   be

restricted to engaging only registered sanitary  plumbers

to  carry out sanitary works.  The deregulation will give

house owners and developers a wider choice of contractors

or  plumbers.  This will result in lower cost for them to

carry out sanitary works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the  proposed  amendment to remove the need  to  register

plumbers.  May I add that this is long overdue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanitary plumbers have been defined just now. I am

glad that the definition was clarified.  They are neither

involved  in  the  design of plumbing systems,  including

gas,  water  or sanitary systems, nor in certifying  work

done.   In  most  cases,  architects  and  engineers  are

responsible   for  the  design  of  these  systems   and,

ultimately, responsible for the completed jobs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doing away with having to pay for a licensed

plumber  would save cost for property owners,  especially

private  property owners.  However, the concern would  be

the  flooding of the market by untrained persons claiming

to  be  qualified  plumbers.  This will disadvantage  the

genuine tradesmen and put the public at risk.  To further

safeguard  the interests of the public, the trade  should

be   encouraged  to  implement  self-checks  from  within

itself,  to  ensure quality work provided.  This  can  be

done  through the setting up of trade associations.   For

example,  the  Singapore  Plumbing  Society,  established

since  1959, with members in the plumbing trade,  can  be

encouraged   to   provide   training   opportunities   to

continuously upgrade members of the plumbing trade.  Such

a  set-up  would also serve as a forum to  keep  existing

tradesmen  abreast of new products and new  skills.   The

training  programmes can be conducted  jointly  with  the

Construction Industry Development Board or the  Institute

of  Technical  Education, and I am glad the Minister  has

also  mentioned that there will be courses to  train  new

plumbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Society can also be tasked to register plumbers

who abide by their codes of ethics.  More emphasis should

be  placed on plumbers who are qualified members of  such

an   association.   Only  these  should  be  allowed   to

practise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

Plumbing Society is in support of this Bill.  My Ministry

has  consulted  them.  SPS will set up  an  accreditation

scheme  similar  to the current PUB registration  scheme.

The  existing registered plumbers will be invited to join

SPS and be included in the accreditation scheme.  For new

applicants,  SPS  will  set  up  a  committee  to  select

candidates, conduct oral examinations, issue certificates

and  maintain a register of sanitary plumbers.  SPS  will

use  the same qualification requirements to accredit  its

sanitary plumbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the deregulation, SPS will post a list of its

plumbers on the website.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the local media play an important nation-building role in our multi-racial and multi-religious

society.  They need to have a deep appreciation for local

sensibilities  and sensitivities, and a  clear  sense  of

responsibility and commitment to Singapore.  This is  why

we  have  rules on shareholding limits to ensure that  no

one  can  manipulate  our local media  to  undermine  our

society.  However, since the shareholding controls in the

Newspaper  and  Printing Presses Act  (NPPA)  were  first

introduced in 1977, there have been many changes  in  the

investment,    financing   and   corporate   environment.

Investment options, like trust funds, futures  and  stock

options,   are  now  common.   New  corporate  structures

involving  holding, subsidiary and sister companies  have

also  sprung up.  Such changes can have an impact on  the

ownership and control of newspaper companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing legislation does not cater adequately

for  these  changes.  It is therefore possible  for  some

entities  to  exploit these grey areas to circumvent  the

shareholding provisions and other controls  in  the  Act,

thereby   exercising  undue  influence  over  our   media

companies.  This Bill, therefore, proposes amendments  to

the  Newspaper  and Printing Presses Act  to  update  the

shareholding controls in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



Act.   We are also taking this opportunity to update  the

penalty scheme in the NPPA and to make other revisions to

the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now speak on these issues in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1999, Capital Group Companies

Incorporated  (or  "Capital" in short), an  international

fund manager, acquired more than 5% of ordinary shares in

Singapore Press Holdings (SPH).  Technically, Capital did

not  breach the 3% shareholding limit in the NPPA.   This

was  because, as currently worded, the NPPA only  applies

to  beneficial owners, and not nominee shareholders  like

Capital.  However, certain nominee shareholders can  vote

on  behalf  of  their clients and, therefore,  can  exert

influence over a company.  But the policy intent  of  the

ownership  limit in the NPPA is to ensure that no  single

person  or  company  can exercise undue  control  over  a

newspaper  company.   The  shareholding  limits   should,

therefore,  also  apply  to fund managers  who  have  the

discretion to exercise voting rights of shares on  behalf

of the beneficial owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that this policy intent is carried out,

the Government stated in October 1999 that we would amend

the   NPPA   ownership  provisions  to  adopt  the   same

definition as the ownership provisions in the Banking Act

(BA),  but  retain the 3% figure.  This  is  because  the

ownership provisions in the BA are more comprehensive, as

they  are  based  on  the concept of interest  in  voting

shares.   This  covers  any person,  other  than  a  bare

trustee,  who  has an interest in a share, such  as  fund

managers  like  Capital.   As the Singapore  Broadcasting

Authority  Act contains ownership provisions that  mirror

those in the NPPA, corresponding changes would be made to

the SBA Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the Bill, we noted that as the new

definition   of  "shareholding  interest"   covers   more

parties,  retaining the original 3%  figure  may  be  too

restrictive.   Such  a low limit could  affect  the  fair

value  of  the  shares of a listed media company  in  the

stock  market  by limiting buyers from acquiring  a  more

substantial stake for their portfolios.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



Taking   into   account  feedback  from  the   investment

community  and  industry players that  we  consulted,  we

decided  to raise the shareholding threshold figure  from

3% to 5%.  This 5% figure will address our concerns about

undue   influence  over  a  media  company,  while  still

providing leeway for investors to take a larger stake  in

a listed media company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the new provisions on

shareholding  controls.  Clause 3  of  the  Bill  repeals

section  10  and inserts new sections 10A  to  10H.   The

current   3%  shareholding  limit  is  aligned   to   the

definition of "substantial shareholding" in the Companies

Act and the Banking Act, which refer to a 5% interest  in

voting  shares.   A  new shareholding threshold  at  12%,

which  mirrors that in the BA, has also been  introduced.

It addresses aggregated shareholdings of a person and his

associates, where "associates" includes close  relatives.

This  will address the loophole in the current Act, which

does   not   take  into  account  relationships   between

shareholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sections will also address passive increases

in  shareholdings,  and shareholders acting  in  concert.

Legislative powers will be introduced for the Minister to

direct   the   transfer  and  disposal  of,  and   attach

conditions to, excess shareholdings and impose  penalties

for breach of shareholding limits.  The maximum penalties

for  contravening the shareholding provisions  are,  upon

conviction,  a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment

for  a  term  not exceeding three years or  both.   As  a

deterrent to recalcitrant offenders, a further  fine  not

exceeding $5,000 will be imposed for every day  that  the

offence continues after conviction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the update of the penalty

system in the NPPA.  Currently, the substantive penalties

for  publishers  consist of revoking  their  licences  or

charging  them in court.  These penalties are too  severe

for lesser offences, for example, when publications carry

pictures that go beyond acceptable norms.  To provide  an

appropriate  penalty  for  lesser  offences,  clause   12

inserts new section 33A to empower the Minister to impose

composition fines instead, which are out-of-court



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



settlements  for  offences  chargeable  in  court.    For

consistency  across the NPPA and other  legislation,  the

Bill  also introduces amendments to update the  scale  of

fines  in  the NPPA, as there has not been an across-the-board  review of the penalties since the Act was  enacted

in  1975.  The maximum fine under the NPPA will generally

be raised from $10,000 to $50,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the other amendments to the

Act.   Currently,  the receipt of funds  from  a  foreign

source  for  purposes other than commercial  purposes  is

prohibited,  so  that no person can  subvert  our  media.

However, in today's networked global economy, it  is  not

uncommon  or difficult for foreign parties to register  a

company  in  Singapore  or work through  a  local  agent.

Clause  4  of the Bill, therefore, amends section  11  to

broaden  the current definition of a "foreign source"  to

include  foreign funds channelled through a local  agent.

The  Minister  can  also declare any  local  incorporated

company or association as a foreign source if it has  any

foreign directors or members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 13 of the Bill updates the exemption

clause  in  section  34  to  be  consistent  with   other

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Sir, the print media

constitutes an integral part of our daily lives.  I  need

not  dwell  on the importance and the critical  role  the

print media plays in helping to shape Singapore.  We hold

in  respect the power of the pen held in the hands of our

editors,  journalists  and  columnists.   Therefore,  our

control  over  ownership is important  in  providing  the

direction as required by society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The print media has a role to play in the promotion

of  community values and the arts.  We have always spoken

of a gracious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



living  society.   Enhancement in arts  appreciation  and

community  outreach  efforts require constant  nurturing.

The  print  media is able to fulfil this role well.   The

print media can be a strong link in a chain of efforts to

nurture   the   arts   and  promote  community   outreach

programmes.  They can provide more coverage on  the  arts

and  community.  They can give insights, invoke passions,

enhance  appreciation, and thus push  the  arts  and  the

community to greater heights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arts and community supplement, like the Computer

Times supplement distributed with the Straits Times, will

be  a  welcome gesture of the print media.   Let  us  pay

tribute  to the talents and fashion of our arts community

and  the  tens  of thousands of volunteers  in  community

service.  Let us give them a pat on their backs.  Let  us

help  them spread their passion and volunteerism  to  the

thousands who have been moved by the power of the pen  to

follow in their footsteps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Newspaper

and  Printing Presses (Amendment) Bill, together with the

SBA  (Amendment) Bill, is clear evidence of  Government's

control  over  the  media.   Control  comes  by  way   of

empowering  the Minister to decide who should be  allowed

to  own a substantial number of shares.  New section  10A

of  the Bill prohibits any person to become a substantial

shareholder  without approval of the Minister.   It  also

prohibits   shareholders  to  act  together  with   other

shareholders to exercise their voting rights if  together

they hold more than 5% of the voting shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 10B further prohibits an indirect

controller, by way of having 12% of the shares, or voting

power  of the company with its associates unless,  again,

the Minister approves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is interesting that in this section, it

defines   in   detail  what  relationship  is  considered

associate.  I think we could also use the same  principle

to examine, in the future, whether there is a conflict of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



interest  in  holding  positions in  public  offices,  in

private  companies and GLCs.  The control by the Minister

would  also  now  empower him to compel  shareholders  to

dispose  of  their shares.  New section 10E empowers  the

Minister  to  do  so if, for example, he finds  that  the

shareholder is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) not a fit and proper person; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) he is a person whose likely influence is to

lead  the newspaper or broadcasting company to no  longer

conduct its business prudently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder what does this Bill mean by "a person who

is not fit and proper" to hold such shares.  Does it mean

only  persons  who  are  associated  with  the  PAP   are

considered  as  fit and proper?  I also  wonder  what  is

meant  by  "no  longer  conduct its business  prudently?"

What  does  this  refer to?  Does it refer  to  financial

prudence or political prudence, or prudence in reports on

the Opposition?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do we believe in an open society, market

economy  and a free exchange of ideas?  Or do we  believe

in  control?   On the one hand, the PAP Government  talks

about market economy but requires shareholders, newspaper

and  broadcasting companies to be subject to approval  to

own  shares.   In  one breath, the PAP  Government  talks

about openness and transparency.  In the same breath, the

PAP  is empowering Ministers with the wide discretion  to

control  the media by controlling who can own shares  and

have  voting  rights in the companies.  This  effectively

ensures that the management of a media company is  firmly

in  the  hands  of  the Government.  It echoes  what  the

Government says and toes the Government's line.  This,  I

believe,  Sir,  would be the underlying  cornerstones  of

remaking Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Act

was  enacted  in  1974  for the  licensing  of  newspaper

companies.  Newspaper companies are private in nature and

not  state-owned.   There should, therefore,  be  liberal

market  forces  at  play,  with regard  to  ownership  of

shareholdings in these companies.  Take precedents like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



in  USA, England, India and Australia, I wonder if  there

are  similar provisions restricting the shareholdings  of

shareholders and directors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, Mr Speaker, Sir, a democratic nation and

there  must be freedom of the press and ownership of  the

press.   The Government is here to govern and  should  be

less   involved  with  newspaper  companies   and   about

shareholders  of such companies, just like other  private

and  public  companies, where the  Government  should  be

least  involved. There should be, preferably, a hands-off

approach  as  the  years go by.  And let  there  be  more

liberal  ways so that we have a more vibrant and  dynamic

newspaper  and  printing presses  industry  in  the  days

ahead.     If  there  is  abuse or danger  posed  to  the

security  or well-being of our nation, there  are  enough

laws  in Singapore to deal with such potential offenders.

Having   read  the  provisions,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   the

provision under clause 12, relating to the compounding of

offences,  is  most welcome, and the Hon.  Minister  will

have  the  discretion  to allow compounding  of  relevant

cases  and  that will avoid the necessity for prosecution

in a court of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the newspaper industry, Mr Speaker, Sir,

may I be permitted also to say that since Independence in

1965,  we,  in  Singapore, I understand, cannot  purchase

Malaysian    newspapers   in   Singapore.      Similarly,

Malaysians   cannot  purchase  Singapore  newspapers   in

Malaysia.   We  in Singapore and Malaysians in  Malaysia,

have free access to the Internet, foreign newspapers  and

magazines  from  all over the world, but  not  from  each

other's   countries.   Information   is   available   and

accessible very easily. Then why this restriction between

Singapore  and  Malaysia  on  the  availability  of   our

respective newspapers?  There may be political reasons in

the  1960s,  and perhaps 1970s and 1980s.  It  shows  how

suspicious our politicians and Malaysian politicians were

and  still  are,  but  our citizens may  look  at  things

differently. I for one do.  We need a set of new thinking

amongst  our  political leaders and  Malaysian  political

leaders.  It is about time political leaders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



from  both countries revisited these rules with a genuine

interest  in  building  more  trustworthy  and  practical

approaches to dissemination of information and  political

and social issues between our two nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political leadership must venture to close the

gap  and  create  the right ambience and  environment  to

learn  from each other, to respect each other and  create

positive  rapport between the citizens of  Singapore  and

Malaysia.   And once the citizens of both countries  read

each other's newspapers, both sides would appreciate each

other's  political arguments and rationale for political,

economic  and  social decisions made  by  our  respective

leadership.  Let us all be more enlightened and  progress

on  with  accurate facts, critical arguments and  various

arguments,  and  let  the citizens  and  people  of  both

countries decide for themselves and respond genuinely and

more  positively  based on ideas and  thoughts,  and  not

manouverings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a side note relating to the newspapers' ability

to  educate  their  readers, may  I  also  encourage  our

newspapers to cite in their articles or stories, all  the

relevant  websites and articles and Government  materials

and  their  websites  being  relied  on  by  journalists,

politicians  and civil servants so that the reader  would

be  aware where the sources came from.  So, at the end of

each   article,   there  must  be,  almost  compulsorily,

websites  and articles that were relied on, so  that  the

discerning  reader would move on to read those  articles,

and  we would find better debates, not just in Parliament

but  in  Singapore  as a whole.  Our  citizens  are  more

intelligent, I would say, and more discerning these days,

and let them decide, after analysing the facts and issues

as they perceive it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the speakers

who  have  spoken  in support of the Bill.  A  number  of

issues  have  been  raised, some  of  them  not  directly

related  to the amendments, but let me take them  in  any

case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan has asked that the media encourage the

arts by giving it greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



coverage.  I leave this to the media to follow up on this

suggestion.   I  also  hope  that  they  will  give  more

coverage to the arts, since I wear the other hat of being

the Minister in charge of the arts in Singapore.  But  to

be  fair, I think the coverage of arts has increased over

the  years,  and  some of the newspapers  are  publishing

supplements  from time to time.  Some  of  them  do  have

enhanced coverage of arts events in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan has raised a number of issues and

also  some  suggestions for newspaper companies  to  cite

websites when they write their articles. Again,  I  leave

this   to  the  newspaper  companies  to  take   up   his

suggestion.  The power of web technology really is in the

connectivity, and I think there are already many  of  the

hyperlinks provided on the news sites that one can  visit

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial issues raised about this particular

Bill  concern  control over the media.  Mr Chandra  Mohan

asked  whether  other  countries  have  also  limits   on

ownership.    Indeed,  they  do.   As  I  know,   foreign

ownership  of newspapers is capped at 20% in  the  United

States.   Likewise, in Canada, it is capped at  25%.   In

France,  foreign ownership is not allowed.  And I believe

there  are  also ownership restrictions in Australia  and

UK,  although  in Australia these are being  reviewed  at

this  point  in  time.  So we are not  alone  in  setting

ownership  restrictions for foreign owners.   The  reason

for  this  is  that it is important that we do  not  have

undue foreign influence in our local media.  The controls

are  put  in  place so that Singaporeans can  decide  for

themselves  what  kind of a life they  want  to  have  in

Singapore,  and  we  can  decide for  ourselves  how  our

society will develop and grow.  The controls are not  put

in place to silence anyone, nor are they put in place for

the  Government to tell the media what they can or cannot

write.   The Government does not tell editors  what  they

should write in their editorials.  Journalists can  write

op-ed  pieces and, from time to time, they do write op-ed

pieces  that  are critical of Government policies.   They

report on the news, sometimes to the chagrin of Ministers

or Backbenchers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



as  they do not quite get the message they want reported.

So  there  is no attempt here to determine how the  media

should  report the news.  But our objective is to  ensure

that  we  have  a  credible, a strong and  a  responsible

media.  And for this reason, we have put in controls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control that Mr Low Thia Khiang referred to, as

to who can own shares, and why this is up to the Minister

to decide, refers only to substantial shareholdings.  And

there  is a big difference here.  Mr Low Thia Khiang,  Mr

Speaker, or any other Member in this House, or any  other

person  in  Singapore  or elsewhere  can  buy  shares  in

newspaper  companies without any restriction and  without

any permission from the Minister.  But when his aggregate

of  shares exceeds 5%, then he requires the permission of

the  Minister.   This is to ensure that  no  one  person,

company or entity holds a large amount of shares  and  is

therefore  able  to  exercise undue  influence  over  the

operations of that newspaper company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe, I have dealt with the issues that

Members have raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Minister saying

that  this Bill only restricts foreign ownership,  as  he

just  now cited examples of other countries?  I think  he

has  not  responded to me on what is meant  by  "fit  and

proper person" and "prudent" in the running of a company.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, can I ask Mr Low Thia

Khiang exactly which clause he is referring to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is referring to new section 10E, there it says

that the Minister may serve a written notice of objection

on  any  person referred to in section 10A or 10B if  the

Minister is satisfied that the person ceases to be a  fit

and  proper person.  Is that the clause he was  referring

to?  I am not quite sure of the question, Mr Speaker.   I

think  a  person  who is "fit and proper"  has  a  proper

definition under the Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am referring to new

section   10F  which  says  that  if  "any   person   has

contravened section 10A, 10B



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



or  10C, ." that he would be directed to dispose  of  his

shares.   And it says on many occasions that  the  person

should be a fit and proper person.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, the intent of clause 10F is to

ensure  that if a person exceeds the provisions of clause

10A  and 10B, that is if they exceed the 5%, and the 12%,

then  the  Minister should direct that  they  dispose  of

those shares.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What do you mean by "fit and

proper person"?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Let me read new section 10F for the

Member's benefit.  It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without prejudice to section 10G, if the Minister

is satisfied that any person has contravened section 10A,

10B,  [these two sections are the sections that refer  to

the  5% control and the 12% control] 10C(4) or 10E(5)  or

any  condition imposed under section 10C(2),  [which  are

basically elaborations of those sections earlier]  or  if

the  Minister  has served a written notice  of  objection

under section 10E, the Minister, may by notice in writing

-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) direct the transfer or disposal of all or any of the shares in the newspaper company held by the person or any of his associates.. within such time and subject to such conditions as the Minister considers appropriate;"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think what Mr Low Thia Khiang is perhaps

alluding to is whether "fit and proper person" refers  to

a  particular  political affiliation.   I  give  him  the

assurance that it does not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a short while ago, at the Second Reading of the

Newspaper  and  Printing  Presses  (Amendment)  Bill,   I

explained  the changes to the shareholding provisions  of

the  NPPA  to align them with the Banking Act.  I  stated

that corresponding changes would be made to the Singapore

Broadcasting  Authority Act (SBA Act)  as  its  ownership

provisions   mirror  those  in  the  NPPA.    This   Bill

introduces those changes to the shareholding controls  in

the SBA Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the principle of safeguarding against undue

influence,  the Bill also proposes amendments  to  extend

the provisions on broadcasting companies to their holding

companies and make other updates to the Act.  As  I  have

already  spoken  in  some detail on the  changes  to  the

shareholding  controls in the NPPA, which are  paralleled

in  this Bill, I propose to now concentrate on the  other

changes to the SBA Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to first explain that our regulatory

regime   for   media  companies  takes  a  differentiated

approach.    Stricter  controls  apply  to   broadcasting

companies, because broadcast is a more emotive media than

print.   In  the  wrong hands, it can be easily  used  to

manipulate  audience's opinion and  undermine  our  hard-earned social harmony and stability.  It is with this  in

mind  that  we have put in place ownership and management

controls for broadcasting companies.  However, changes to

corporate structures can circumvent this intent.  Let  me

illustrate.   In  the media business, a  holding  company

with  several  media subsidiaries is a  common  ownership

structure nowadays, eg, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation

is  a  holding company of subsidiary media companies like

Fox  News  Channel  and Fox Broadcasting  Company.   Such

holding companies may, and in many instances do,  have  a

large influence over the operation of their subsidiaries.

However,  the  SBA Act currently does not apply  to  such

holding companies.  This is unlike the Banking Act  where

the   shareholding   provisions  extend   to   designated

financial holding companies.  We therefore need to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



amend  the  SBA  Act to ensure that no single  person  or

foreign   party  can  buy  up  majority   stakes   in   a

broadcasting  holding company and unduly influence  their

broadcast  subsidiaries.  Clause 4 of the Bill  therefore

amends  section  43  to  extend  the  definition   of   a

broadcasting  company, to include  its  holding  company.

The  shareholding and management provisions in Part X  of

the  Act  will  thus  also apply to broadcasting  holding

companies.   For existing broadcasting companies,  MITA's

intention is to grant approval to their holding companies

upon application, for the relevant provisions in the Act.

Depending on the situation, the Minister may also  exempt

certain holding companies from the provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go through the other changes to the

Act.   Clause  3  amends section 20 to  provide  that  no

person shall provide a licensable broadcasting service in

or  from  Singapore without a broadcast  licence  granted

under section 20 or a class licence granted under section

21.  This corrects the current legal loophole relating to

the  class  licence scheme, where the continued operation

of a licensable broadcasting service by a person or group

after  the  application of his or its class  licence  has

been  suspended, is not addressed.  The changes will  not

affect  the  light  touch nature  of  the  class  licence

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 44 to clarify

that  the  full  Board of Directors, Board  Chairman  and

Chief  Executive Officer, of a broadcasting company,  are

to  be  approved by the Singapore Broadcasting Authority.

It  also  provides  an  updated definition  of  a  "Chief

Executive Officer".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 47 to clarify

that  the  49% foreign ownership limit for a broadcasting

company  applies  to  the aggregate of  shareholdings  by

foreign sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, sections 46 and 73 of the Act are amended to

broaden the definition of foreign source and to widen the

exemption  clause  in  the Act  respectively.   As  these

provisions are parallel to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



Newspaper  and Printing Presses Act I shall not elaborate

any further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree

with  the  amendments to limit foreign ownership  in  the

broadcasting  industry and the powers  empowered  to  the

Minister.  This will ensure that the local media, and  in

particular  the broadcasting media, will not be  used  by

foreign influences and provide necessary checks to  avoid

undesirable outcomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as in the Newspaper and Printing Presses

(Amendment)  Bill, I would like to ask  the  Minister  to

urge the broadcasting companies to place more emphasis on

the  promotion of the arts.  The recent Arts Festival has

drawn  to  a  close.   It has been  touted  as  the  best

festival in its history.  But may I ask how many of these

programmes,    including   both   local   and    overseas

productions, will reach the households in the heartlands?

Some  of  these  productions  are  extremely  rare,   and

considered  gems  in  the  arts  community.    They   are

performed  by leading and outstanding masters, directors,

artistes,  musicians, conductors and choreographers.   We

are indeed privileged to have them perform right here  in

Singapore, yet it is regrettable that not enough is being

done to maximise their presence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more regular basis, local professional arts

companies,  like Singapore Symphony Orchestra,  Singapore

Chinese  Orchestra  and  Singapore  Dance  Theatre,  have

regular performances.  These are considered national arts

companies.  It is unfortunate that their performances and

hard work are not telecast in its entirety on television,

the  reason being broadcasting companies fear  they  will

compromise profitability and viewership.  We should  ride

on  well-known personalities and excellent productions to

enhance arts appreciation and arts viewership.  I am sure

that I have the support of the National Arts Council that

the media bears a moral responsibility and obligation to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



promote arts in Singapore.  We should encourage the media

to  increase the broadcast time made available  for  arts

programme   and   telecast  such  productions   live   to

households, if not at least a delayed telecast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to look at the programmes on local

television  channels,  arts programmes  are  almost  non-existent.   In  a  week's television programme  schedule,

only  about 5.5 hours of programmes broadcast on  Central

Channel  are  arts related programmes.  This  constitutes

about  4.7% of the channel's total broadcast  time  in  a

week.   If  we look at all the local channels,  including

Channel NewsAsia, Suria, Channels 5 and 8, and Channels I

and  U,  arts programmes make up less than 1%.  We should

cultivate  our  local  media to broadcast  selected  arts

programmes,  especially local productions, bringing  them

to the heartlanders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent exchange of letters in the media between

MediaCorp   Singapore   and  Singapore   Press   Holdings

(MediaWorks)  on the amount of subsidy each receives  has

drawn widespread concern on public service broadcasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public service broadcasting is television meant to

meet  diverse needs and interests, including that of  our

minorities.    The  society  gains  as  one.    Increased

broadcast time of arts programmes will act as a  catalyst

to  boost the arts scene and enhance appreciation  level.

The  arts  is  a  sector justifiable as a public  service

broadcasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see revenue derived by the Singapore

Broadcasting  Authority be put to good use, as  subsidies

given to broadcasting companies are to encourage them  in

their efforts to boost our local arts scene.  We need  to

re-position  the  arts  and make  it  accessible  to  the

heartlanders.   I  believe the media  has  an  undeniable

responsibility in helping Singapore realise that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Act

was  passed in 1994 to regulate dealing in, operation of,

and ownership in broadcasting services and broadcasting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



apparatus.   Our Government should, as far  as  possible,

let  market  forces decide on ownership  of  broadcasting

companies.   We  should have a more liberal  approach  to

ownership  of broadcasting in Singapore and  open  up  to

internationalised    broadcasting,    in    line     with

internationalisation of businesses, professions, cultural

activities  and  sports.   The need,  therefore,  to  get

approval to appoint the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman

or  Director  from  the Singapore Broadcasting  Authority

seems  to go against normal market forces.  And I  wonder

if  there have been any negative appointments recently to

introduce this strict rule in this proposed Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Broadcasting Authority may also wish to consider

and  be allowed to have more liberal ways of broadcasting

programmes  from abroad, especially ASEAN countries.   We

should  broadcast  more  ASEAN countries'  programmes  on

radio and television, so that we become more educated and

enlightened about our neighbours.  What do we know  about

Myanmar, Kampuchea or even Thailand?  I will be the first

one  to  admit  that  I  know very little.   Perhaps  the

Broadcasting Authority and the printing presses  likewise

have a national duty to educate our citizens and leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet and modern communication systems

traversed by our people abroad would certainly allow them

to  have  more  access to broadcasts of these  countries.

Let us, as Singaporeans, take the initiative of promoting

ASEAN  broadcasts in Singapore.  We could  perhaps  start

with  their channels involving culture, songs and sports.

In this way, other ASEAN countries too would do likewise.

It is important that locally, amongst our people and also

in  the  international arena, we  are  seen  to  be  more

liberal,  just like in our other walks of life, including

trade,  business, professional work, cultural  works  and

sports.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me deal

with what Mr Chandra Mohan has raised on the question  as

to why we need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



to  approve the appointments of Chairman, CEO  and  other

directors of the Board for broadcasting companies.   This

has   been  the  policy  intent  all  along.   There  are

provisions  under the Newspaper and Printing Presses  Act

(NPPA)  to  ensure that we appoint people  whom  we  feel

would take on the responsibility of running the newspaper

company.   Likewise, we should do so for the broadcasting

companies.   There  is no particular  reason  or  trigger

point, as Mr Mohan is suggesting, as to why we are  doing

the amendment at this point in time, except that it is  a

policy  intent, and that we are making the amendments  to

the Act, and so we have put it in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained earlier the reasons for doing so

when  I  spoke  on the NPPA.  I emphasised in  my  Second

Reading speech that television broadcast, as a media,  is

especially potent in the way it arouses emotions.  It  is

one  thing  to read about a fiery speech in a  newspaper,

but  that  only appeals to those with a certain intellect

who  can  absorb the meaning of the words.  But when  you

see this on television, whether or not you understand the

words, you read the facial expressions, you read the body

language, you see whether the person is animated or  not,

and  you  see  how the crowd reacts.  And  all  that  can

create an emotive response.  For that reason, we want  to

be  particularly careful about how broadcasting companies

operate.   And  for  this reason, we  have  put  in  this

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Andy Gan has appealed for the

broadcast  media to play a broader role in promoting  the

arts, and Mr Chandra Mohan has appealed for the promotion

of  greater  understanding within ASEAN.  Both  are  good

suggestions, and it is commendable that we should want to

try  to do more in these areas.  Again, I would leave  it

to the broadcast companies to consider these suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would just say that while we can put on

programmes  on the arts or on ASEAN, at the  end  of  the

day,   it  is  whether  people  watch  these  programmes.

Broadcast companies are commercial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



entities.   If  we subsidise them with a  lot  of  public

funds,  then  we  must be sure that the  subsidies  bring

about  a  certain benefit.  As it is, there  are  already

questions about whether we should collect as much  TV  or

radio  licence  fees as we do now, and we have  explained

why  this  is necessary, why this is important,  and  how

this   does   benefit  society  through  public   service

broadcasting  on channels such as Suria or Arts  Central.

The  fact  that  we can enjoy a certain  degree  of  arts

programming  in  Arts  Central is because  we  have  such

public service broadcast funds.  To do more means that we

have  got to raise more fees.  And, again, I do not think

that will be popular or acceptable at this point in time.

But  within  the  limits, I think  we  can  take  up  the

suggestions  of  both Mr Andy Gan and Mr  Chandra  Mohan.

But we just need to bear in mind that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



one  thing to produce a stage; it is quite another  thing

to produce the audience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>(Security deposit from voluntary welfare organisations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</b> asked the Minister for Law

(a)  what  is  the  rationale behind the  Singapore  Land

Authority's  requirement for 3 months rental deposits  or

security  in  lieu  from  charitable  voluntary   welfare

organisations (VWOs) since the rentals are being paid  by

their respective ministries; and (b) this being the case,

will the Minister consider having this requirement waived

as  the 3 months' deposits are quite substantial and  can

be better utilised by the VWOs.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other prudent landlords, SLA requires a

security  deposit  to  be paid by  a  VWO  renting  state

premises for the following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) firstly, to ensure that the tenant complies

with the conditions of the tenancy agreement,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) secondly, to ensure payment of rental, and,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) thirdly, to recover the cost of repairs and

rectifications  in  the event of  any  damages  when  the

tenant vacates the property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general practice, SLA collects rental payments

directly  from  the  VWO.  However, in  some  cases,  the

parent  agency  overseeing the VWO requests  to  pay  the

rentals  directly to SLA to avoid incurring late  payment

charges.   Even for these cases, the security deposit  is

still  required to ensure that the VWO complies with  the

conditions of the tenancy agreement as well as  to  cover

the  cost of repairs and rectifications arising from  any

damages to the property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the Singapore Land Authority

requires  a security deposit, currently set at 3  months.

SLA  is prepared to waive the deposit for VWOs that  have

secured a guarantee from a parent agency or ministry.  In

addition,  to  ease  the cashflow of VWOs,  SLA  is  also

prepared  to accept other forms of guarantee, such  as  a

banker's  or an insurance guarantee, in lieu  of  upfront

cash deposit.

<div align="center"><b>SEXUAL OFFENDERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Law

whether  he will direct the prosecutor not to reveal  the

name  of  the person who is charged with a sexual offence

until he/she is proven guilty by a court of law.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had responded to a similar query at the

Committee of Supply debate in 1996.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law does not have the powers to

direct the Public Prosecutor not to disclose the names of

accused  persons.  Indeed, there are no legal  provisions

specifically  prohibiting the disclosure  of  an  accused

person's identity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons accused of sexual offences are not more

vulnerable  than  persons  accused  of  other  types   of

offences.   Hence,  if we introduce a  measure,  say,  by

amending the law, to suppress the identity of an  accused

person in a molest or rape case until he is found guilty,

then,  we  should  similarly adopt the same  measure  for

other  types  of  offences.  A person,  whether  male  or

female,  charged  with, say, murder,  assault,  theft  or

criminal breach of trust, will potentially face the  same

sort of embarrassment as a person charged with committing

a sexual offence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a more fundamental level, it is a basic principle

of   our  legal  system  that,  except  in  extraordinary

circumstances, the courts are open to the  public.   This

ensures  that  court  proceedings  are  transparent   and

subject  to  public  scrutiny.   Hence,  the  media  must

generally be free to report what goes on in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a trial is covered by the media, it will

usually  follow  up with a report of  the  verdict.   The

publication that a defendant has been acquitted ought  to

set the record straight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positions adopted by other countries, for

example,  the  United  Kingdom  and  Canada  are  largely

similar to Singapore's.

<div align="center"><b>HAWKER CENTRE OPENING HOURS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr R. Ravindran</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  what are the steps taken by his Ministry  to

ensure  that  hawker centre stalls are open  for  regular

daily periods to serve customers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For stalls on subsidised rental, ENV, HDB and JTC

conduct periodic checks on stallholders to see that  they

operate  their  stalls  regularly to  serve  the  public.

Generally,  stallholders are expected  to  operate  their

stalls  for at least a few hours a day for 5 to 6 days  a

week  to  serve  the public.  Those found  not  operating

their stalls regularly or for a prolonged period of  time

will  be asked to resume business, unless they have  good

reasons  for  not doing so, for example, due  to  medical

reasons or if they were on overseas trips.  Action may be

taken  to have the tenancy agreements terminated and  the

stalls  repossessed for stallholders who persist  in  not

opening their stalls regularly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, 170 stallholders were found to have not

operated  their  stalls regularly.  All of  them  resumed

business at their stalls, after they were asked to do so.

In  the  last  3  years,  only one subsidised  stall  was

repossessed  in  1999  because the  stallholder  did  not

operate the stall regularly, after repeated reminders and

warnings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For stalls paying market rental, the stallholders

would normally terminate their tenancy agreements if they

are unable to operate their business viably.

Transport  (a)  if  he  will  give  an  update   on   the

preparation  of the Airport Logistics Park  of  Singapore

which  will  operate as a free trade  zone  in  the  near

future and (b) whether Changi Airport will be seeking  to

increase  its  income through business  cooperation  with

other airports around the world.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Airport Logistics Park of Singapore, or "ALPS"

for  short,  is  being developed by CAAS and  JTC  within

Changi  Airport's  Free  Trade  Zone  (FTZ).   ALPS   was

launched  in November 2000 to allow Third Party Logistics

service  providers  (or  3PLs) to export  and  distribute

goods  from local and regional manufacturers to the Asia-Pacific market in a cost-effective and timely manner.  By

siting their operations at ALPS, 3PLs can customise their

operations   to  achieve  rapid  turnaround  time   while

enjoying  an exemption from various Government procedures

for goods that do not leave the FTZ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAAS is responsible for the land and infrastructure

works for ALPS.  These works will be completed by January

2003.   One company has started work on its own  building

which  is  expected to be completed by end of this  year.

Another  MNC logistics company has also decided to  build

its  facilities in ALPS.  EDB is discussing with  several

others.   With the gradual upturn of the global  economy,

CAAS, EDB and JTC are stepping up their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



marketing efforts to attract key logistics players to set

up operations in ALPS.  When fully operational, ALPS will

enhance  Singapore's position as a leading transport  and

logistics hub in the Asia-Pacific region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan also asked about CAAS' overseas investments.

CAAS  is  investing in overseas airports  as  part  of  a

business  strategy  to  diversify  its  revenue  streams.

Through   its   subsidiary,  Singapore   Changi   Airport

Enterprise  (or "SCAE"), CAAS has a 50% equity  stake  in

Alterra   Partners,  a  London-based  airport  investment

company  with  Bechtel as the other shareholder.  Alterra

presently  operates airports in London,  Costa  Rica  and

Lima.   It  is actively pursuing airport development  and

operation  projects  in Europe, Latin  America  and  Asia

including China and India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCAE also provides consultancy services to airports

in  the  Asia-Pacific  region such  as  airports  in  the

Philippines, Fiji, India and China.  Earlier this  month,

it  signed  an  MOU  with Hangzhou Airport  in  China  to

provide consultancy services.

Development  whether  the HDB will consider  implementing

free  parking  on  Saturdays at  HDB  estates  so  as  to

encourage family members and friends to visit one another

and to strengthen bonds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free parking scheme on Sundays and public

holidays  operates  from 7.00 am to  10.30  pm.   It  was

introduced  in  1986  to promote social  interaction  and

foster family ties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is aware that weekends and public holidays are

usually  the time when families and friends get together.

At  the  same time, HDB has to be mindful of the  parking

needs  of  residents. With the current  scheme,  HDB  has

received complaints from season ticket holders that  they

are  unable  to find parking lots on days when  the  free

parking scheme is in operation.  Where there is a  severe

shortage  of  parking lots, the free  parking  scheme  on

Sundays and public holidays has been withdrawn to  ensure

that the parking needs of the residents are met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB currently has no plans to extend the free

parking scheme to Saturdays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has appointed a panel of 5 marketing agents to

help  lease out its former premises at Bukit Merah, which

are  currently  unoccupied.  HDB expects demand  for  the

office  space at its former premises in the near term  to

be weak. However, HDB will, through its marketing agents,

actively market the vacated premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has approached various Government agencies to

take  up  the  office space at the HDB  Centre  at  Bukit

Merah.   These  agencies are currently considering  HDB's

offer.  HDB  will also consider renting  out  the  office

space    to   community,   social-civil   or   non-profit

Minister  and Minister for Defence (a) why was  a  United

States  Air  Force pilot allowed to fly our  Republic  of

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Singapore has an agreement with

the   United  States  Government  to  base  Republic   of

Singapore  Air Force (RSAF) F-16 aircraft in  Continental

United  States to facilitate the training of RSAF  pilots

and  technical crew. This arrangement allows the RSAF  to

overcome  Singapore's lack of airspace  and  provides  an

opportunity  for  RSAF to benchmark  itself  against  the

United States Air Force (USAF). Such an arrangement  also

allows  the  RSAF to draw on the experience of  qualified

USAF  personnel during routine training. For this reason,

a  selected class of USAF pilots is allowed to fly our F-16  aircraft under the agreement. The USAF pilot involved

in  the  incident is an experienced Instructor Pilot  who

trains with our RSAF pilots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of claims will depend on the outcome of

ongoing  investigations to determine  the  cause  of  the

crash.

<div align="center"><b>WALL TILES AT MRT STATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Transport  (a)  why  are the wall  tiles,  which  are  in

perfect condition at various MRT stations, such as  those

at  Commonwealth, Buona Vista and Clementi, being  hacked

off  and  replaced by a coating of cement and paint;  (b)

what  is the purpose of these works and the amount spent;

and  (c)  will  these works add to the  rising  cost  and

ultimately in higher fares to be borne by commuters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy-duty ceramic tiles were used for the

architectural finish of the exterior of the MRT  stations

at  Redhill,  Queensway, Commonwealth,  Buona  Vista  and

Clementi.  This  was  an acceptable  method  of  external

finishing when the stations were built more than 14 years

ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, over the past 10 years and as a result of

normal wear and tear, some of the tiles have been falling

off.  To prevent any risk of falling tiles causing injury

to  commuters,  SMRT erected safety  nettings.   It  also

carried  out  a  study to determine  the  extent  of  the

problem  and reviewed the possible solutions.  The  study

concluded  that  the most cost-effective solution  is  to

completely  remove  the tiles and  replace  them  with  a

coating  of  cement and paint. SMRT estimated  that  this

will  cost  about $900,000. Works have been  in  progress

since mid-2001.

<div align="center"><b>SPALLING CONCRETE IN HDB FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  what is the extent of  the  problem  of

spalling  concrete in HDB flats, especially  those  flats

built  during  the "accelerated programme" years  in  the

1980s;  (b)  what are the plans, if any, to help  rectify

the  affected  flats; and (c) whether his  Ministry  will

consider extending the HDB grant to subsidise the  repair

cost of spalling concrete.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spalling concrete is the result of a deterioration

process   called   carbonation  whereby  carbon   dioxide

diffuses into the concrete and forms carbonates  when  it

reacts  with  the  alkalis in the concrete.   Carbonation

reduces  the  level of alkalinity in the  concrete,  thus

allowing the steel bars in the concrete to corrode.   The

corrosion  causes  the steel bars to expand  forcing  the

concrete  surrounding  the  steel  to  crack  and  spall,

exposing the steel bar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spalling concrete is a natural phenomenon and it

occurs  in  all  concrete buildings as the buildings  age

over  time.  It is not peculiar to any flat type or flats

which  were  built in certain years or during  a  certain

period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flat owners who encounter spalling concrete

problems  in  their  flats  can  report  them  to   their

respective HDB Branch Offices.  HDB will assist the  flat

owners  to  investigate  the cause  of  the  problem  and

recommend  appropriate remedial action.  For flat  owners

who   have  difficulty  in  finding  a  suitable   repair

contractor on their own, HDB will also assist to  provide

them  with  a  list  of repair contractors  for  them  to

negotiate with on a private basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lease, HDB flat owners are responsible for

the repair of spalling concrete in their flats.  As such,

the  Government  cannot subsidise  the  repair  cost  for

spalling concrete problems.

<div align="center"><b>DRY HEAT STERILISATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a) whether his Ministry will allow Dry Air Steriliser to

be   used   as   a  form  of  sterilization  at   general

practitioners'  clinic;  and, if  not  (b)  what  is  the

rationale for not allowing this use.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steam autoclaving is recommended by the Ministry's

Advisory  Committee on Infection Control as a method  for

sterilisation  of  all heat-stable surgical  instruments.

Dry  heat  using  a hot-air oven is only recommended  for

materials that might be damaged by moist heat.   Examples

of  such  materials include powder and  fine  instruments

used for microsurgery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry heat sterilisation process is more difficult to

control and monitor because of the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the long duration of time taken to reach

recommended temperatures to achieve optimum sterilisation

(time taken may vary from 1/2 hour to 1 hour depending on

the make of the hot air oven);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) uneven distribution of heat, and therefore

proper sterility cannot be assured unless other

monitoring devices, such as biological indicators, are

used to show that sterility has been achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's primary concern is patient safety and

infection  control.  Health care institutions should  use

the  recommended method to sterilise reusable heat stable

instruments.   Alternatively,  they  could  use   sterile

disposable instruments.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b> asked the Minister for Health

what  is  the  Government's  subsidy  per  attendance  at

polyclinics  for  (i) acute illnesses  and  (ii)  chronic

illnesses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b> asked the Minister for Health

what  is  the amount of his Ministry's payment to general

practitioners  under  the Primary Healthcare  Partnership

Scheme   as  compared  to  the  subsidy  given   to   the

polyclinics.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether the Primary Healthcare Partnership Scheme  covers

chronic  illnesses such as hypertension, and if not,  why

not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government provides 50% subsidy for adult

patients  and 75% subsidy for child and elderly  patients

who  seek  medical treatments at polyclinics.  In  dollar

terms,  an adult would receive $10 subsidy per attendance

for  acute  illness  and $36 subsidy per  attendance  for

chronic  illness.   For child and elderly  patients,  the

Government's subsidy is higher, at $15.50 per  attendance

for  acute  illness  and $54 per attendance  for  chronic

illness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General practitioners (GPs) contracted under the

Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS) are subsidised  on

the  same  basis as elderly attendance at the polyclinics

to  cover their operating costs, rental and GST.  GPs are

paid $18.50 for each elderly patient that they see.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCPS covers common outpatient medical services and

dental  services.   It does not cover chronic  conditions

such  as  hypertension. This is because proper management

of  chronic conditions requires a multi-disciplinary team

of  healthcare  professionals to achieve  good  treatment

outcomes.   Polyclinics  are  in  a  better  position  to

provide such comprehensive care.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a)  whether the removal of Miss  Raja's  decayed

tooth  was  necessary before she could  go  for  a  liver

transplant operation; (b) if so, could the decayed  tooth

be  extracted under anaesthesia; (c) how and when was the

information  that  the decayed tooth could  be  extracted

under anaesthesia communicated to her and her family; and

(d)  as  her condition was already critical and  she  had

finally  decided to go for the extraction,  why  was  she

made to wait for another two days for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Attorney-General's Chambers have advised that it

is  not appropriate to release patient information to the

public.    As   these  questions  pertain   to   specific

information  in  a  patient's personal  and  confidential

medical  records, it would not be appropriate to  provide

detailed  replies to all the questions as we do not  have

the  consent  of  the  patient or the  next-of-kin.   The

following  reply provides general information  about  the

necessity  of performing dental extractions for  patients

who  are scheduled to undergo liver transplants.  In  any

event,  Ms  Raja was a patient of the National University

Hospital,  not  the Ministry of Health.   The  NUH  is  a

restructured hospital and is independently managed.   MOH

does  not  have  access  to  NUH  records  except  as   a

regulator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to liver transplantation, it is good clinical

practice to treat or remove infected teeth, as these  may

become  potential  sources of infection  in  the  patient

after the transplant procedure.  However, this is not  an

essential medical requirement, and, as was the  case  for

Ms  Raja,  would  not  delay  transplantation  should   a

suitable liver become available before the affected teeth

are treated.

<div align="center"><h4>$388 MILLION COMPENSATION TO SINGTEL</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Acting

Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts why

his  Ministry did not carry out a simple check  with  the

Inland  Revenue Authority of Singapore regarding the  tax

of  S$388  million before paying out the compensation  to

SingTel  and who is going to be responsible for the  loss

to the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 compensation to Singapore

Telecommunications (SingTel) was for the  premature  loss

of   its  monopoly  rights.   Deloitte  and  Touche,   an

international  accounting  firm,  was  engaged   by   the

Telecommunications Authority of Singapore (now the  Info-communications  Development Authority  of  Singapore)  to

work  out  the  compensation amount.  They  computed  the

compensation  based on the loss of future earnings  as  a

result of the early expiry of SingTel's monopoly rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review committee of civil servants endorsed the

sum  recommended.  As it was based on loss  of  earnings,

and  as  earnings would normally be subject to  tax,  the

committee  worked on the basis that the compensation  was

taxable.   As  this  was a natural assumption,  it  never

occurred  to  the  committee to ask  the  Inland  Revenue

Authority  of Singapore (IRAS) for a specific  ruling  on

tax.   Unfortunately, subsequent events showed  that  the

committee was mistaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chronology confirms that the error was an honest

mistake  arising  from  a wrong assumption  by  the  1997

review committee. While a lesson has been learnt from the

error,  it  would be inappropriate to punish  the  review

committee  or any of its members for it. To do  so  would

only  encourage a culture where civil servants  shy  away

from  taking responsibilities, and avoid making decisions

for fear of committing mistakes.  This is the opposite of

what  we  are  trying to achieve, not just in  the  civil

service  but  in  Singapore society. However,  it  is  no

excuse  for civil servants not to endeavour to get  their

facts  right, and to check and double-check  details  and

assumptions.
