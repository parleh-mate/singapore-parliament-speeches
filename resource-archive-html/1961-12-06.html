<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Amendment

[21st  November,  1961]  to Question  [20th  November,

1961],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it has always been the avowed

objective of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve the

reunification  of  Singapore with  the  Federation  of

Malaya  and to remove the artificial division  created

by  the  British by their policy of "divide and rule",

this   House  affirms  and  declares  that  the  first

objective of all true patriots of Malaya is to achieve

the reunification of these two territories in a merger

of  Singapore  with the Federation of Malaya.".-(The

Minister for Labour-Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To leave out from "a" in the second last line to

the end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation as  the

twelfth  State and with all its Citizens automatically

becoming  Federal citizens on Merger  Day".'-(Dr  Lee

Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when

the adjournment was taken last night, I was on the

question of citizenship and Singapore citizens. To put

the matter in its proper perspective, perhaps you

might allow me to go into the question of Singapore

citizenship and how Singapore citizenship is acquired,

because one of the difficulties that the people of

Singapore are facing over the question of merger is

what will happen to them as Singapore citizens when

these so-called constitutional arrangements have been

effected. It is not only an important constitutional

issue, but even more important from the public point

of view, it seems to be an emotional issue. Therefore,

it is only fair that this question is completely and

fully ventilated in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand Singapore citizenship. Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is possible to acquire it under four heads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) You become a Singapore citizen by birth;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) You become a Singapore citizen by descent;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) You become a Singapore citizen by registration; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) You become a Singapore citizen by naturalization.





<br><br>Once a person has acquired Singapore citizenship under

any  of  these categories, he is a Singapore  citizen,

and  so  far  as  he is concerned and so  long  as  he

remains  a Singapore citizen, he has absolutely  equal

rights.  Singapore citizens all have absolutely  equal

rights  one  with  the other. There is  absolutely  no

question  that  there  is  any  difference  between  a

Singapore citizen by birth and a Singapore citizen  by

registration, descent, or naturalization.  There  is

only  one difference between these four categories  of

citizens.  First, Mr Speaker. Sir, I  would  like  to

emphasize  the word "categories" of citizens  and  not

"classes"  of  citizens. They  are  not  "classes"  of

citizens,  but "categories" of citizens, depending  on

the  manner  in which citizenship is acquired.  Having

acquired  it, they are equal and the same in the  eyes

of the law, constitutionally or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



otherwise. But there is one important distinction

between a citizen by birth and a citizen by descent on

the one hand, and a citizen by registration and a

citizen by naturalization on the other. Whereas it

would be impossible for the Government to deprive a

citizen by birth or by descent of his citizenship, it

would be possible for the Government to deprive a

citizen by naturalization or by registration if the

citizen in these latter categories should behave

himself in a manner contrary to the interests of the

State. That is not a provision peculiar to Singapore.

It is a provision which every civilised country has in

its laws, because it is only right that when a person

is given the privilege of becoming a citizen of a

State, he should continue to behave in a manner which

will not be to the detriment of the State. Therefore,

quite rightly, every civilised State has reserved unto

itself the right to deprive a citizen by naturalization

or by registration of his citizenship if he should

misbehave. That, Mr Speaker, Sir, does not make him a

second-class citizen nor a third-class citizen. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am a Singapore citizen by registration,

having been born in the Federation. I do not, for one

moment, consider myself a second-class citizen. My

status in the eyes of the law and so far as my rights

are concerned are absolutely co-equal with those of a

person born in Singapore or of a person whose parent

was a Singapore citizen and who was born outside

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having sketched that, Mr Speaker, then the question

arises  whether  amongst Singapore citizens  themselves

there is inequality. There is absolutely no inequality.

If  anybody in Singapore is putting out the proposition

that   although  there  are  different  categories   of

citizens by virtue of the fact that there are different

categories   of  citizenship,  therefore,   there   are

different  classes of citizenship, that is an  absolute

lie  calculated  to do a great deal of emotional  harm,

and the motives behind putting out such a proposition

cannot be strictly honourable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these constitutional arrangements go through,

Singapore citizens will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



remain Singapore citizens, and there can be no question

that  I  am  going to be a second class citizen.  I  am

absolutely convinced of that. My category is  the  same

as  the category of citizens who were born in China  or

India  or  Ceylon or any other part of the  world,  and

who, by virtue of adequate residence in Singapore,  has

acquired  citizenship by registration. What happens  to

me  and  to  people like me who were not  born  in  the

Federation but outside the Federation, say,  in  China,

or  India or Ceylon or any other part of the world, is

this -  that  we will all remain Singapore citizens  and

exercise  our  rights  as  Singapore  citizens  in  any

constitutional arrangements that will have been arrived

at  between  the  Federation Government and  ourselves.

What  will  then be the net result so far as  Singapore

citizenship is concerned after -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - merger, as the Minister for Finance likes

to  call  it?  Mr  Speaker, Sir, as I  understand  the

position, it will be this, that when the State Assembly

elections are conducted, I will be allowed a vote;  and

when  the Federal elections are conducted - and for  that

purpose, I take it, if it is going to be 15 seats,  the

island  of  Singapore will be divided into 15 electoral

divisions, or wards as the case may be - and if I  should

so  desire,  I can offer myself for election.  What  is

more,  I  can vote for myself, if I choose to stand  in

the  ward where my name appears on the register.  Where

then  does  the proposition propounded by  the  Barisan

Sosialis come in about second-class citizenship? If the

proposition  is  that  a Singapore  citizen  becomes  a

second-class citizen by virtue of the fact that  he  is

not  allowed to vote in the Federation or to stand  for

election  in the Federation, and if that and that  only

is   the  reason  for  stating  the  proposition   that

Singapore  citizens  are  second-class  citizens,  then

might  I suggest to the Barisan Sosialis, if they  look

at it from the Federation point of view, that a Federal

citizen could equally say then that because he  is  not

allowed to stand for election in Singapore or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



to  vote  in  Singapore, he himself is a second-class

citizen.  The  proposition  is  too  absurd   to   be

contemplated.  Why then do we labour the  point  that

the  Singapore  citizen is inferior  to  the  Federal

citizen?  Can  it be that my friend, the  Member  for

Queenstown,  has a complex about himself?  Has  he  a

complex  that  a Singapore citizen is inferior  to  a

Federal  citizen? Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself have  no

such  complex. I feel that I am equal to the  Federal

citizen,  if not superior. And why should I not  feel

it if I am so inclined to feel it? I do not think the

Federation  Prime Minister is going to object  to  my

thinking  that  I  am  superior  and  that  Singapore

citizenship is superior to Federal citizenship. It is

a matter of opinion and I am entitled to mine. But if

the   Barisan  Sosialis  propounds  as  a  fact  that

Singapore   citizenship  is   inferior   to   Federal

citizenship, that, Mr Speaker, Sir, is not true.  It

is not correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was rung up this morning by a number of people.

They  said,  "We  were very glad you  clarified  this

point because we were in doubt." A further point  was

asked  of  me:  can a Singapore citizen  sit  in  the

Federal Parliament? I said, "Surely you have read the

White Paper; surely it has all been explained." It is

amazing,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the amount of  ignorance

there is in Singapore about these matters, and  as  a

result  of this ignorance, a lot of misunderstandings

are  current.  I  said, "Of course, if  you  feel  so

inclined,  if you wish to stand for election  to  the

Federal  Parliament, you will be entitled to  do  so.

There  is nothing in the White Paper which I can  see

which  goes  against  it.  In  fact,  if  I  remember

rightly,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  an  express

statement to that effect. In paragraph 14, page 4  of

Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961, it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore citizens will vote in Singapore for

their   representatives   to   the   new   Federation

Parliament and the citizens of the present Federation

of  Malaya  will  vote in the present Federation  for

their  representatives to the  same  new  Federation

Parliament.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



From  that  paragraph it seems  to  me  obvious  that

Singapore  citizens  will  vote  and  can  stand   in

Singapore  in respect of the 15 constituencies  which

will   send  their  representatives  to  the  Federal

Parliament. Even from that point of view, there is no

question of a second-class citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further question was raised whether the words

"Federal  national" have been introduced  into  these

proceedings with a view to confusing the  issues  and

that  a  Federal  national is not  really  a  Federal

national;  he  might  be  a  British  subject,   and,

therefore,  being a British subject it  is  something

derogatory. I think it was the Member for  Anson  who

took  the view that a Federal national really equates

to  a British subject. Mr Speaker, Sir, all that the

White  Paper says is this. A Singapore citizen and  a

Federal  citizen will both become Federal  nationals.

At  the  moment the phrase "Federal national" is  not

known  to  the  Constitution  of  the  Federation  of

Malaya. I take it that it will be necessary to  amend

the  Constitution to give the phrase a place  in  the

statute. I take it that it will be done. Once that is

done,   then  the  term  "Federal  national"  has   a

constitutional significance, and under the Federation

Constitution,   a   Federal  national   will   be   a

Commonwealth  citizen and not a British subject.  The

British  are wise people. They amended their  British

Nationality Laws - I think it was in 1947  or  1948;  I

cannot  remember  the exact date - because,  in  their

wisdom, they knew that the term "British subject" was

not  viewed  with favour by people in the  Dominions,

and therefore they devised an arrangement under their

British  Nationality  Laws and coined  a  new  phrase

"Commonwealth  citizen". So that a  Federal  national

will   become   a   Commonwealth   citizen.   Now   a

Commonwealth  citizen  will  have  the  status  of  a

British  subject.  Therefore, the  Member  for  Anson

argued  that  if  he  has the  status  of  a  British

subject,  he  is then a British subject.  With  great

respect  to the Member for Anson - he is my  senior  in

many  ways - I  beg  to disagree with him.  Having  the

status of a British subject does not necessarily mean

that you are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



a  British subject. What it means is this, that if  you

should  happen to be in Great Britain, then having  the

status  of a British subject would entitle you  to  all

the  privileges that a British subject would  enjoy  in

the  British Isles. That is all it means, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may make my point clearer and bring it home to

the  Member  for Anson. Recently we have  read  in  the

papers that Japanese nationals will be given the status

of  South  Africans in South Africa when  they  are  in

South  Africa. I ask the Member for Anson, does he,  in

all  seriousness, advance the argument that because  of

this  that Japanese nationals will become south African

subjects? I think the Japanese people will be the first

to  disavow  it.  What  it merely  means  is  this.  If

Japanese nationals have been given by the South African

Government in their wisdom the status of South Africans

in  South  Africa, it merely means that they  can  ride

with  the  whites in their buses; and if  the  Japanese

want it that way, they are welcome to it. Why should we

object?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand from the papers that the People's

Republic of China has applied for that status. Both the

extreme  Right  and the extreme Left in Asia  want  the

status  of  South Africans, and if they  want  it,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, who are we to say that it is a derogatory

status? But the curious position is this. We have heard

a  lot  about the Afro-Asian conferences. It is  a  bit

peculiar  when two nations in Asia - one on  the  extreme

Right and the other on the extreme Left - should seek the

status  of South Africans. So it is difficult  to  know

where  we  are in this modern world. The extreme  Right

and the extreme Left want to ride in the same bus as  a

South  African, but they do not want to ride with their

black brothers. So when we talk about Socialism and the

extreme Right, I, as one who does not subscribe to  any

such   particular  political  philosophy,  am   a   bit

confused. But that is only by the way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, let us not say that a

Singapore citizen is a second-class citizen. Let us not

even go one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



better and say third-class citizens. This category  was

introduced yesterday. The point was made that a Federal

citizen  is a first-class citizen, a Singapore  citizen

is a second-class citizen. Yesterday the point was made

that  there  are third-class citizens.  The  point  and

purpose  of  that  statement was to draw  a  difference

between   Singapore   citizens   by   birth   and    by

registration. According to some Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis,  it  seems that citizens by registration  are

third-class  citizens,  and in that  category  is  your

humble servant. I do not accept that statement.  It  is

not  true. It is not right. I would like Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis to quote chapter and verse because  I

am personally vitally interested in that issue, because

if  any  constitutional arrangement arrived at  by  the

Hon, the  Prime  Minister with  the  Federation  Prime

Minister were to make me into a third-class citizen,  I

would be the first to object to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You have an alliance with the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> We are no citizens at all

in the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If hon. Members wish for

elucidation, all they have to do is to stand up  and  I

am sure the Member for Farrer Park will oblige.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I have made any mis-statements on the law, if I have misconceived the

position, if I have made any wrong statements  to  this

House, if any Member, either on the Front Benches or on

the Back Benches on the Government side or on the Front

Benches or on the Back Benches on the Opposition  side,

says I am talking nonsense and I am wrong in any of  my

statements, I am quite prepared to give way so that the

House  will  be given a full explanation, of  the  true

factual   and  legal  position  resulting  from   these

constitutional arrangements. I await that, Mr Speaker,

Sir, and I will gladly resume my seat and give them the

Floor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to stay

very much longer on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



Floor. There are other important issues to be discussed

and  I  hope  I  am  confining myself strictly  to  the

amendment. I will have something more to say  when  the

main motion is debated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the adjournment yesterday, I was fumbling around

with  the Wartawan to find a statement made by Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong,  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  to  the effect that he and  his  Party  were

willing to go to the people of Singapore to explain  to

them  the whole position and obtain their support.  Now

that  is  a tall statement for anyone to make. For  one

person  to  say  that  he can convince  the  people  of

Singapore,  I  envy him if he can do that.  But  if  he

exercises that power in the right direction, he will do

a  power  of  good for this country and  I  have  every

confidence that his intention is to do a power of  good

to this country. But to put the record clear and right,

let me quote him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are fully aware of the difficulties that face us in

our struggle for Malayan unity. As a result of colonial

rule,  differences  of  race  and  religion  have  been

emphasised  and much work will be needed to repair  the

damage done by colonialism. However, we declare that if

the representatives of the people of the Federation are

agreeable to do the same-'



<br><br>this is the place, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'we will pledge ourselves to exert whole-heartedly our

influence to win the people of Singapore to accept full

and  complete merger forthwith, that is, with Singapore

as  the  twelfth  State  of  the  Federation  and  with

Singapore   citizens  automatically  becoming   Malayan

citizens  with  proportional  representation   in   the

Federation  Parliament.  Let  the  Government  of   the

Federation  of  Malaya tell us if  it  is  prepared  to

persuade  the  people of the Federation to  accept  the

people  of  Singapore  in a full  and  complete  merger

before 1963.'



<br><br>Now  let us examine the psychological situation against

which such a statement is made.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry to intervene at this stage. I

thought  the  Member was going on with the question  of

citizenship. Would the speaker agree - I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



not  got  the  documents with  me  but  I  have  quoted

them - that  in  the  Constitution of the  Federation  of

Malaya  there is an express provision that only Federal

citizens  may sit both in the House and in the  Senate,

and  in the White Paper it is perfectly consistent with

our voting for Federal citizens who will then represent

us?   Secondly,  would  the  Member  agree   that   all

Commonwealth citizens under the British Nationality and

Status  of  Aliens  Act,  1948,  are  in  fact  British

nationals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret the Member for

Anson was not listening to me carefully. You see,  Sir,

how  difficult it is to get a point across. How can the

people in the coffee-shops understand anything when the

Member for Anson, who is himself a trained lawyer,  and

I  myself - I  hope that I can say that I  am  a  trained

lawyer - used  to  the use of words, are  trying  to  put

words   together   in  a  manner  which   people   will

understand? If I cannot get myself across to him and he

cannot  get  himself  across to  me,  we  can  see  how

difficult  the  position of the man in the  coffee-shop

is.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have already told  the  House

that at the moment the phrase "Federal national" is not

known  to the Federal Constitution - at least I have  not

seen  it  in  the Federal Constitution. As  this  is  a

phrase  coined  as  a  result of  these  constitutional

arrangements, it will therefore become necessary - I have

told the House; I may be wrong -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Surely it must

be so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - it will become necessary to amend the

Federal Constitution. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member  for

Anson  must  know  all this. Let us  not  look  at  the

Federal Constitution as something which is going to  be

static.   It  follows  the  will  of  the  people.   No

constitution is static. It moves with the will  of  the

people,  and  if the will of the people  is  that  this

Constitution is to be amended, it will be amended;  and

it  will  be amended to this effect, that wherever  the

phrase  "Federal citizen" appears, the phrase  "Federal

national" shall be substituted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



That is only my suggestion. They might amend it in some

other  way.  But  certainly the  Constitution  must  be

amended  to carry with it the conception of  a  Federal

national  and  to  give it statutory effect  and  legal

concept.  That  must  be  done.  I  cannot,  therefore,

understand the Member for Anson saying that because the

Constitution  now  does not have  the  phrase  "Federal

national",  how  can  Singapore  citizens  sit  in  the

Federal  Assembly? If this Constitution is  amended  to

bring  in the phrase "Federal national", and because  a

Singapore citizen is a Federal national, therefore,  by

virtue of the fact that he is a Federal national, he is

entitled to sit in the Federal Parliament. Surely it is

a  simple  proposition. I would have thought  that  the

Member   for  Anson  would  have  been  the  first   to

understand  it. If he cannot understand  it,  how  much

more  difficult  it is going to be for persons  in  the

coffee-shops  to  understand  it.  And  I  beg  of  the

Government, if they are serious in these constitutional

arrangements - and  they are of vital importance  to  the

country - that they put this across to the people.  They

do  not  understand it, Mr Speaker. If the Member  for

Anson cannot understand it -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He does not want to!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Does not want to? No, I do not say that.

How can that be? He is a patriot.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of elucidation, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am very much obliged. Sir, this is

very important. Is the speaker, in fact, stating -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I beg your pardon. Is the Member, in

fact,  stating that he is satisfied that  wherever  the

words   "Federal   citizen"  appear  in   the   Federal

Constitution,  the  words "Federal  national"  will  be

substituted? Because if that is so, it makes a complete

change in my own stand. I am sorry I am stupid. But  if

I am given an assurance that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



wherever in the Federal Constitution the words "Federal

national"  appear,  sections 8, 10,  82,  wherever  the

words  "Federal  citizen" appear,  the  words  "Federal

national"  will  be substituted, I will  vote  for  the

White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am so glad we have now clarified the

position  because  I am entirely with  the  Member  for

Anson.  If the Constitution is not going to be  amended

to  make me a Federal National, co-equal with a Federal

citizen   for  purposes  of  sitting  in  the   Federal

Parliament,  then  I will certainly  vote  against  the

White  Paper. Why should I vote for it? It is  on  that

understanding  and on that basis that I  am  supporting

the  White Paper. And let me tell the Member for  Anson

through you, Sir, that if under this Constitution there

are certain things which are pertinent to the rights of

man,  then I sincerely hope that the rights of  man  in

the Federation and in Singapore will be co-equal. I  do

sincerely hope that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That must be so. Otherwise, there can be no

constitutional arrangements. There can be  no  equality

of  status.  I  am  supporting this  entirely  on  that

basis - that  the  rights of man  in  Singapore  and  the

rights  of man in the Federation co-equate and are  co-equal,  and  interchangeable. The Federal  citizen  can

come  here and the Singapore citizen can go there.  But

they cannot go into each other's territory for purposes

of  exercising  the  vote. That is  the  constitutional

arrangement for the time being. When the psychology  of

the  two territories changes, then possibly there  need

not  be a Federal citizen and a Singapore citizen.  But

that is not possible now. Let us hope it will be within

our lifetime anyway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am almost finished, but there are

one or two points I would like to stress to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one phrase used by the Member for Upper

Serangoon.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> He is

not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Member for Upper Serangoon is not here.

He is such an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



important  adjunct  in the Barisan Sosialis  system  of

things that I would have liked him to be here in  order

to pose this problem to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when he was speaking yesterday in

this House, he said this, "The people of Singapore like

socialism."  There  is absolutely  nothing  wrong  with

that. It is the fashion nowadays to be a socialist. And

who  does not want to be in the fashion, whether to  be

in  a  bush jacket, without a tie, or with a  tie?  The

three classes are well represented here, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Three classes of socialists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> By that I do not mean three classes of

citizens. They are still co-equal, I hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say what struck me as something very

interesting - "especially for the Chinese." Mr  Speaker,

this  is  the sort of thing that really gets  me  down.

What  is  this brief "especially for the Chinese"?  The

Member  for  Thomson is not a Chinese. The  Member  for

Bukit Timah is not a Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon, the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Prime Minister is not a Chinese.  Mr

Devan Nair is not a Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Byrne is not a Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Byrne is not a Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Minister for Law!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Minister for Law is not a Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Minister for Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Minister for Culture, one of the ablest

spokesmen,  rather  more  able  than  the  Member   for

Thomson,  is  not a Chinese. The Vice-Chairman  of  the

Barisan Sosialis is not a Chinese.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> The

Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, he is not a Chinese. My Chinese

friends,  I hope, will forgive me if I tell  them  that

some  of  the ablest spokesmen for socialism in  Malaya

are non-Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not for Communism, you know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, why then do we draw this red

herring - "especially  for the Chinese"?  What  does  the

Member for Upper Serangoon mean by that? If you  are  a

socialist, you are a socialist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And I thought that one of the basic tenets

of socialism is that once you are a true socialist, you

cease  to  be  a  Chinese  or an  Indian.  You  are  an

internationalist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, that is not true after the

22nd Congress.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not know about this Congress. My

theory  is  that  way back one of the basic  tenets  of

socialism  is the international creed. Once you  are  a

socialist, you have no race, no creed, no country.  Why

talk  about the Chinese? Mr Speaker, Sir, a  socialist

is  not  a chauvinist. And if a socialist talks like  a

chauvinist, what does one make of him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is just one last thing I wish

to  state.  The  proposals  before  the  House  on  the

question  of  merger and the other allied motions  that

are  being  discussed  are in the nature  of  temporary

measures.  They have not reached any form of  finality.

It is just an immediate step to something which we want

in the future. With that intent and purpose, that seems

to  be  the position. I give notice now that  when  the

proper  time  comes,  Mr  Speaker,  I  shall  move  an

amendment to item 3 on the Order Paper, under the  name

of   the  Hon, the  Prime  Minister -  White  Paper  on

Reunification of Singapore and Federation of Malaya:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House, accepts the heads of agreement set

out in'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. We are

discussing  the  amendment. Surely we  cannot  at  this

stage,  before the amendment is passed, deal with  item

3?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understood the Member for Farrer

Park  just  to  indicate what he is  going  to  do.  Of

course,  he  will not be able to discuss his  amendment

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. That is exactly my

intention. I give notice now, after which I  shall  sit

down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...agreed to between the Governments of the State of

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya  as  a  working

basis for a reunification of the two territories.'



<br><br>The  amendment which I intend to propose, Mr  Speaker,

will be this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the word "That", to insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"as an immediate practical step towards the ideal goal

of complete merger,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'this House accepts the heads of agreement set out in

the  White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 agreed to between  the

Governments   of  the  State  of  Singapore   and   the

Federation  of  Malaya  as  a  working  basis   for   a

reunification of the two territories.'



<br><br>The point and purpose of the amendment, Mr Speaker, is

to throw the debate into proper focus.



<br><br>3.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish first to

address myself to the amendment moved by the Member for

Queenstown.  There  are  two parts  to  his  amendment.

First,  that Singapore should merge with the Federation

of  Malaya  as  the  twelfth State;  second,  that  all

Singapore   citizens   should   automatically    become

Federation citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first deal with the first limb of the

amendment - that Singapore should be the twelfth State of

the  Federation? Let me refer him to a joint  statement

issued  on  16th  September  this  year  by  the  Prime

Minister  of the Federation of Malaya and myself.  That

statement said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The two Prime Ministers are satisfied that all

legitimate local and special interests of the people in

the  two  territories can and will be safeguarded  with

the   merger  of  Singapore  as  a  State  within   the

Federation.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



I  want  to  emphasise  these words,  Sir -  "merger  of

Singapore as a State within the Federation". These  are

not  casual  words uttered at Press Conferences  or  in

conversations. These are words carefully  chosen  after

scrutiny  by officials of both sides. They  carry  with

them  the full import of their ordinary meaning.  There

can  be no doubt whatsoever that Singapore will be  the

twelfth  State  of the new Federation. I  do  not  know

whether there is any special virtue in being the  12th,

13th, 14th or 15th State, but I can assure hon. Members

that  if  it  is the number 13 that they  are  against,

perhaps  for  some unhappy connotation of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  and so on, I shall ensure that we shall  take

pride of place before the Borneo territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been considerable play over the word

"merger".  Members of the Opposition have  for  various

reasons  alleged  that the proposals contained  in  the

White  Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 do not constitute a merger

of  Singapore with the Federation of Malaya. There  was

some  talk of complete merger like Penang and  Malacca.

The  Barisan  Sosialis talked of it. Others  talked  of

absolute  merger, whatever that may mean. It is  useful

to  note the title of the Memorandum which contains the

Heads of Agreement agreed to between the Prime Minister

of the Federation and ourselves. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'MEMORANDUM SETTING OUT HEADS OF AGREEMENT FOR A MERGER BETWEEN THE FEDERATION OF MALAYA AND SINGAPORE'.



<br><br>Not  what I said, Sir, but what the Tunku and I jointly

said.  The joint statement issued in London at the  end

of  the  Tunku's first series of discussions  with  the

Prime  Minister of the United Kingdom - I am quoting  now

from the official communique - says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister [U.K. and Federation of Malaya

Ministers] took note with satisfaction of the heads  of

agreement  recently negotiated between the  Governments

of  Malaya and Singapore for merging Singapore with the

Federation.'



<br><br>Three   Ministers   of   the   Federation   of   Malaya

Government - the   Prime  Minister,  the   Deputy   Prime

Minister, and the Finance Minister - and the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



Minister  of  the  United  Kingdom  together  with  the

Secretaries  of State, for Commonwealth Relations,  for

the  Colonies, and for Defence - one Scots man and  three

Englishmen - have described these heads of  agreement  as

merging Singapore with the Federation of Malaya. Sir, I

did  not  take the liberty of bringing in  the  Shorter

Oxford  Dictionary  into  this  Chamber,  but  I  trust

Members  will  believe me when I say that my  secretary

has accurately copied the definition of "merger" in the

Shorter  Oxford  Dictionary. "Merger", it  says,  means

"combine or to merge." And the word "merge" is  defined

as  "to  cause  something to lose its own character  or

identity in something else."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Singapore citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is right. They shall both

lose   their   identity  for  Pan-Malayan  purpose   as

nationals  of the new Federation. It is no use  shaking

heads. I have documents written from the pen with green

ink  of  the  former Chief Minister  of  Singapore  who

referred  to "nationals" of Singapore. We learned  from

him, Sir, as we learn from everybody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is part of the problems of the Communists that

they have to find metaphysical arguments to explain why

a merger is not a merger. They have agreed to merger on

principle. For years, since 1945, they have agreed with

us  on  this in their written documents, which we  have

published  from  time to time and will  republish.  But

they cannot afford to admit that the heads of agreement

contained  in this Command Paper are a merger  without,

at  the same time, having to accept them and having  to

land  themselves  in an impossible  position.  For  the

furtherance  of  the Communist cause, it  would  be  an

impossible position. But not for the furtherance of the

socialist democratic cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on the other side, particularly Members of the

Barisan Sosialis, have termed these conditions  as  the

P.A.P. type of merger. Merger requires



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



two parties to an agreement. The proposals contained in

this  White Paper are no more the P.A.P. type than  the

Tunku's  type of merger. If it were all purely  P.A.P.,

there  would have been a different White Paper.  If  it

were  all  purely Tunku, there would also have  been  a

very  different  White  Paper.  But  this  White  Paper

represents  the  widest  consensus  of  opinion   after

thorough  and frank discussions. It represents  how  we

believe  merger can be achieved with the least possible

upset for either side. I have waded through 12 days  of

this  merger  debate and I have not heard  anybody  nor

read anybody having the temerity to call this the Tunku

type of merger and then set out to tear it to pieces.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He is not responsible to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, Sir, how kind, courteous,

correct  and proper! But may I suggest that  when  they

talk  of feudalistic leaders and so on, obviously  they

are not inhibited by these considerations in this House

or  outside?  I will say that whatever the follies  and

the errors of the Barisan Sosialis, they not understand

the realities of power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government is a democratic and

tolerant  Government.  More important,  the  Federation

Government   is   also   a  democratic   and   tolerant

Government. But more important from the Communist point

of  view,  the  Barisan Sosialis  and  their  Communist

friends  understand that the P.A.P. Government  has  no

Congo-seasoned troops to deal with any emergency  which

they can create. But the Federation Government has.  We

have  only got 817 soldiers in the S.I.R. to  back  our

will.   And   from  the  point  of  view  of   Leninist

revolution,, it is an easy Government  to  deal  with.

There are only 817 soldiers under the joint control  of

the Ministry of Home Affairs and the U.K. Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had occasion to describe the Member for Nee

Soon, as one of the most intelligent of the Barisan

Sosialis Members -





<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> One of the brightest Barisan stars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is one of the brightest stars.

He  showed his brightness when he called the  Tunku  in

this  Chamber "a statesman". Sir, the smiling, friendly

Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya is what  the

Malays call him, "Papa Kemerdekaan". The Member for Nee

Soon   obviously  understands  that   the   Tunku   has

sufficient  battalions  of troops  and  jungle  bashing

policemen  to  ensure  that the people  of  Malaya  can

afford to relax, smile and laugh, despite the venom and

the frustration of the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khrushchev from time to time beats up Albania. Instead of taking on Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese, he takes up General Hoxha and the Albanians. He abuses, castigates and threatens Albania. But the whole world knows that what he wants to do is to abuse, castigate and threaten, not small Albania, but big China. Unfortunately for Mr Khrushchev, big China takes no notice of him. So like Mr Khrushchev, the Barisan

Sosialis, I am sorry to hear, are still taking the  old

Russian line instead of getting modern and catching  up

with  the Chinese line. The Barisan Sosialis have  gone

on abusing the proposals in Cmd. Paper 33 as the P.A.P.

type  merger. Sir, we do not mind being little  Albania

for brave men from the Barisan Sosialis - revolutionaries

who  talk  fiercely of dealing with the  gentle  P.A.P.

Government in Singapore, while they coo about statesmen

in  Kuala Lumpur, hoping thereby that the statesmen  in

Kuala  Lumpur  may be kind to them when  the  time  for

final  settlement  comes. But I  wonder,  Sir,  whether

merely  a few sweet words with no supporting action  to

prove   the  sincerity  of  those  words  will  deceive

anybody, either in Singapore or in Kuala Lumpur. I  can

assure  the  Member for Queenstown,  who  I  hope  will

inform  the  Member for Nee Soon, that  the  people  in

Kuala  Lumpur are as knowledgeable of the ways  of  the

Communists  as the people in Singapore. The leaders  of

the  Barisan Sosialis may find this out to their  great

cost when the day for reckoning comes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You hope so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have expected Members of

the  Barisan Sosialis to spout the Communist  line  and

say that whatever we propose is phoney. I even expected

the  Member for Anson to appeal in the name of decency,

from  human beings to human beings, not to corrupt  the

word  "merger".  He used the word "corrupt".  A  sacred

word,  said he. And it is. It is the political  battle-cry that has kept the nationalists, the Communists, and

all the other anti-colonialists together all these long

years.  He  said that we corrupted that  word  when  we

described  it, not I, Sir, the Tunku and I - "China"  and

"Albania"  - described these heads of  agreement  for  a

merger  between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.

But  these are people who are not particularly  precise

with     their    use    of    words.    The    Barisan

Sosialis - sometimes, but not always. Only  sometimes  is

the  Member  for  Anson  not  precise.  Usually  he  is

precise, Sir,I remember once we were entertained to an

extremely scholarly treatise on the meaning of "on  the

advice  of"  or  "after  consultation  with"  in   this

Chamber.  You  will remember, Sir,  that  we  were  all

refreshed  in our knowledge of the law as a  result  of

it.  But when people get abusive, after they have  lost

the argument, they cease to be precise about the use of

words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was disappointed to hear the Member for Farrer

Park  yesterday. He always tries to be precise  in  his

words, lie spent a great deal of time yesterday arguing

that  the  merger is not a merger. Sir, I cannot  agree

with  him. It is not for me to tell him the meaning  of

meaning.  He  has  no  doubt  read  a  scholarly   book

entitled,  "The meaning of meaning". A  great  deal  of

clear  thinking  is  necessary over  this  very  simple

subject.  The  book  is so common and  sensible  as  to

become  quite erudite. The Member for Farrer Park  will

recall,  in  "Alice  through the looking  glass",  what

Humpty Dumpty said to Alice. "When I use a word,"  said

Humpty Dumpty in a rather scornful tone, "it means just

what  I choose it to mean, neither more nor less." "The

question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



is,"  said  Alice [That is me] "whether  you  can  make

words  mean  so  many different things." "The  question

is,"  said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be master.  That

is all."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I first started the study of law some years

ago,  the  first  few  lessons  I  had  to  study  were

entitled,  "Language and the Law". A brilliant  teacher

expounded   to   me  with  considerable  lucidity   the

importance of being precise in the terms we use.  These

lessons, for the benefit of the Member for Farrer  Park

and the Member for Anson, were later published. I think

it was contemporaneously published in the Law Quarterly

Review,  "Language and the Law" - Glanville L.  Williams,

1945,  Law  Q.R.  The  first  lesson  was  devoted   to

explaining  that  any  word  can  have  three  possible

meanings. First, the speaker using the word intends  it

to  mean.  Second, what the meaning which the  listener

hearing  it  interprets it to mean. Third, the  meaning

commonly or widely accepted of the word by the majority

of  the  people.  Sir,  let us take  this  simple  word

"peace". When Mr Khrushchev talks of "world peace", he

means  a  situation in which his enemies in the Western

world  are  slowly  crumbling and  decaying  under  the

pressure  of Soviet technological and economic  advance

and the pressure of Soviet propaganda, and with all the

present neutral countries joining or slowly won over to

his  Communist camp. When President Kennedy  hears  Mr

Khrushchev talk of "world peace", he understands  peace

differently. To him, peace means a situation where  the

capitalist world is naturally expanding by the  process

of  free competition based on the inter-play of selfish

individual  motives,  and  a  situation  in  which  the

Communists  are  contained in a tight concord  of  pro-Western  and  anti-Communist allies, and from  time  to

time  satellite countries like Hungary and Poland break

out   in   successful  revolts  against   the   Russian

tyrannical masters. So that a simple word like "peace",

when  Khrushchev  says  it, means  to  him  one  thing.

Kennedy listening to it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



immediately thinks of another, and the majority of  the

people  in  the world understand it quite  differently.

When  they think of peace, they want a situation  where

the  diabolical  and ruthless process of  struggle  and

attrition  between  the Communist and  the  Capitalists

worlds,  where  one system is intent on destroying  the

other, ceases, and human ingenuity and intelligence ate

spent  on  fruitful research to make life  happier  and

more meaningful for everyone without fear of war or the

threat of war. So Mr Speaker, Sir, a simple word  like

"peace" can mean three different things:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To Mr Khrushchev when he uses it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To Mr Kennedy when he hears Mr Khrushchev use it.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To the vast majority of mankind who understand it

to mean what it ordinarily mean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, Sir, as the Member for Farrer Park

used  the  word  "merger". When he said  it,  he  meant

merger like Penang or Malacca, Johore or Perak, or  any

one  of  the  other  11 States in the  Federation.  Any

variation  from  these  terms  giving  Singapore   more

reserved  powers and preserving the rights of Singapore

citizens   who   are   otherwise  not   qualified   for

citizenship  under  the  laws  of  citizenship  of  the

Federation   and,  at  the  same  time,   giving   them

automatically the nationality of the new Federation, he

does not understand that to be merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Barisan Sosialis first talked of merger,

they  meant merger like Penang and Malacca. Since  then

they  discovered what happened in Penang  and  Malacca,

and they have added the second rider to their amendment

about  automatic  conversion of Singapore  citizens  to

Federal  citizens. What the Barisan Sosialis, in  fact,

say,  on  behalf of their Communist backroom  boys,  is

that they want merger like Penang and Malacca, and then

just in case that should be acceptable to the Tunku and

his Government, they ask for automatic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



conversion;  and in case automatic conversion  is  also

acceptable, they ask for something else; until finally,

impossible  terms are asked, the Tunku refuses,  merger

is   frustrated,  and  the  Communists  carry  on  with

Singapore, with the Singapore Government to deal  with,

in  other  words,  only 817 S.I.R. soldiers  under  the

joint control of the wicked colonialists and us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we used the word "merger", we did not intend

to  give  any special meaning to it. We have used  this

word  in the widely and commonly understood meaning  of

the word -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Take-over bid!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Take over? By whom?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have been given the opportunity to

on that theme when we come to debate the main motion.

know  how  grateful  he must be  to  you.  He  went  to

Australia   very   recently,  Sir.  He   has   sterling

qualities.  He  is a human being with a  generosity  of

heart  in  a  warm moment, and often I  have  been  the

beneficiary of that human warmth. But from time to time

the warmth turns to heat and the thermostat control  is

lost  and the whistle starts to blow. One such occasion

was when he landed, I think, in Melbourne or Sydney -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us not get into those details.

Now the Prime Minister is talking about whistles and so

on. Let us go back now to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How true, Sir. The point is this.

Never say these weighty things in haste, for whoever

says it in haste may have cause to regret it at

leisure. I am not qualified to give advice to those who

are more senior than I am in the affairs of this world,

but I do beseech the Member for Anson - and I do know

what happened and so does he - do not say these reckless

things. It brings about a chain of consequences which

can be quite unpleasant. Sir, all I need say is this - I

have not had the time to look up the library's Who's

Who about the Prime Minister in the United Kingdom and

the three Cabinet Ministers - but assuming that the Prime

Minister is English, then I have three Englishmen and

one Scotsman on my side, Sir. Although I may not be an

Englishman, I am quite prepared to accept a Scotsman's

definition of an English word -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Irish is better!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Irish? Better still, yes. Sir, may

I  draw  the  attention of Members  of  this  House  to

paragraph  5  of  the memorandum? These  are  operative

provisions, Sir, apart from the title:



<div align="center"><i>'The State of Singapore</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will be a State within the Federation but on

special  conditions and with a larger measure of  local

autonomy than the other States forming the Federation.'



<br><br>Sir,  how  can Singapore go into the Federation  if  it

does not go in as a State? It must go in as a State.  I

do not know whether Brunei will beat us to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Could I refer him to the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech -  his  Government's  policy  statement

[Hansard, 31st October, 1961, Vol. 15, No. 1, col. 11]:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The people must know that these interests cannot be

protected in a complete merger as a 12th State like one

of the other 11 States of the present Federation...'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> True, Sir, "like one of the 11

States of the Federation", because "like one of the  11

States  of  the  Federation" means no reserved  powers -

[Interruption]. You go in as a twelfth -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is correct if the

Member for Anson will read the whole paragraph, because

reading  part  of  it  out of context  might - I  do  not

know - be misleading. It is in Hansard, Vol. 15,  No.  1,

col 11 - the whole of the paragraph.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> This is the paragraph, Sir, in col. 11,

31st October, 1961:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The people must know that these interests cannot be

protected in a complete merger as a 12th State like one

of  the other 11 States of the present Federation,  for

then automatically all these matters will be controlled

by  the  Central Government and must follow the pattern

of  what  happened in the 11th States  of  the  present

Federation of Malaya.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point, Sir. We are

dealing  with honest people like the Member for  Anson.

We will not mind telling him what is coming in the next

chapter.  But  dealing with the backroom  boys  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis, when we say we cannot have a twelfth

State  like  the other 11 States, they say, "Ah,  well,

since we can't have that, then we ask for it," and they

immediately  put  in an amendment - twelfth  State  and

automatic  conversion. We will give them twelfth  State

and  they  will  know the reality of  merger  when  the

British  flag  comes  down and  the  flag  of  the  new

Federation  goes up and those operative  provisions  of

the Schedule take effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all fairness, I must mention the play that the

Opposition  has made of what the Tunku has  said  about

close    association   and   partnership.   The   Tunku

understands  the  uneasiness  of  the  Malays  in   the

Federation  with regard to the taking  in  of  slightly

over  one million Chinese from Singapore, and absorbing

them  into  the  new Federation, and more particularly,

because of the Press reports



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



or  organised  misbehaviour by Chinese school  students

and  Chinese workers from time to time, thereby  making

the  rural Malays apprehensive of becoming engulfed and

swamped  by the addition of more Chinese from Singapore

into the Federation of Malaya. This is nothing new.  We

have  analysed  it all in our 4th Anniversary  Souvenir

number,  which I heard the Member for Queenstown  react

with  gusto and endorse with great approval.  Here  are

the honest unpleasant truths, Sir. So from time to time

the  Tunku  has  gone  out of his  way  to  stress  the

differences   of  the  conditions  of  merger   between

Singapore  and the Federation and those  of  the  other

States of the Federation. It is not for me to say  why,

but  I  would  suggest that perhaps in this  way  Malay

fears  can  be  lessened or allayed. The  words  "close

association between Singapore and the Federation". Sir,

by   whatever   name,  whether  we   call   it   "close

association", "complete merger", "absolute merger", all

must  agree that the proposals contained in Paper  Cmd.

33  mean  that  the British flag will be  removed  from

Singapore,  other than for the bases (where there  will

be special arrangements made), and we shall, in future,

fly the flag of the new Federation, play the anthem  of

the  new Federation, and display the symbols of the new

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizens wherever born, whether they were

born in Singapore or China or India, will, as nationals

of  the  new  Federation,  vote  in  Singapore  for  15

representatives direct to the Central Parliament of the

new Federation, just as the present Federation citizens

will, also as nationals of the new Federation, vote  in

the present Federation for their representatives to the

same    Parliament;    and    there    together,    the

representatives  of the people from Singapore  and  the

Federation  will deliberate on policy, legislation  and

the  welfare of all the people of the whole of the  new

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me ask the Member for Farrer Park this

metaphysical  question, a very simple little  exercise:

At  what  point does close association become so  close

that  it becomes complete merger? And conversely,  when

is complete merger made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



not  so  complete by the reservation to  the  State  of

large  powers  of  education, labour,  social  welfare,

health and other matters as proposed for Singapore,  so

as  to  make  a merger a close association?  These  are

witch  words, Mr Speaker, Sir. Whatever anybody  likes

to  call them, one thing is quite clear. The Communists

understand  these arrangements will thwart their  plot.

Their  plot  is  to  use Singapore  as  a  base  for  a

Communist  ideological  and propaganda  offensive  and,

ultimately, as the Tunku has said, a military offensive

against  the Federation, and then we will get a genuine

Communist  merger, not of Singapore with the Federation

of  Malaya,  but  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya  into

Singapore. As long as the merger proposals defeat their

interests, we must expect them to oppose them  although

they may be in the interests of the people. So I say to

the  House, let us not use words as Humpty Dumpty  uses

them, to make them mean what Humpty Dumpty intends them

to mean.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear! But let us use the

commonly and widely accepted meaning of the word.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would ask Members to resort to

the Oxford Dictionary and to Webster's Dictionary which

are available in the Library of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim is in a singularly happy

position  of not being responsible. He says,  "Ah,  the

Government is responsible." Then he says, "Ah,  Barisan

Sosialis,  I am not getting mixed up with you.  You  do

not  protect  students. I will become  the  leader  and

champion." Mind you, Sir, in the end, it all depends on

who  has  got more trumps in his hand. We will come  to

that by and by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Joker!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, or the joker. The Member for

Hong  Lim referred to the heads of agreement as  making

Singapore only an associate member of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



Federation  club. Let me draw attention - his  attention

in  particular - to a few points on which I hope he  will

be  able  to enlighten us whether he persists in  these

allegations.  First,  all citizens  of  Singapore  will

automatically,   as  Federation  nationals,   vote   15

representatives  direct to the Parliament  of  the  new

Federation. Sir, anyone of these 15 representatives, as

nationals of the new Federation representing the people

of the new Federation from Singapore in Parliament, can

become  a  Minister  of  the  Government  of  the   new

Federation. According to the Constitution  of  the  new

Federation,  there  is  nothing  to  stop  a  Singapore

citizen, by virtue of automatically becoming a national

of the new Federation, from becoming the Prime Minister

of  the  new Federation of Malaysia. This is so whether

he  is  a  Singapore  citizen born in  Singapore  or  a

Singapore citizen born in China, India or elsewhere and

who has acquired Singapore citizenship by registration.

I  am  making statements which are advisely made. I  do

not  make  these things in my capacity as  one  of  the

signatories to this Command Paper. This is the  natural

interpretation to be spelt out of the Command Paper.  I

give the Member for Anson my categorical assurance that

we  shall  see  enshrined in it that  he,  a  Singapore

citizen  born here - or even as malicious rumour  has  it

that  he was not born here but in Baghdad - has the right

to be the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is what you want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir. May I say, Sir, that I do

not have to read the horoscope?



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> He

can go to the United Nations now!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not have to read the

horoscope for it to tell me that for a very long  time,

the  Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaysia  will

be  Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj. The Member for Nee

Soon understands that and he is a very bright boy. Sir,

from time to time, the Tunku has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



talking about his heavy duties as Prime Minister and he

talks  of  giving way to younger men. I have a  feeling

that  he  will be there for a long time,  much  to  the

unhappiness  of  the Communists, and  when  he  finally

retires -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Prime Minister is very good and I am

appreciative.  He  has told us that  there  will  be  a

change in the Constitution to enable Singapore citizens

to  be  Ministers and to sit in Parliament. Perhaps  he

could  complete  that, Sir, and inform us  whether  the

Member for Farrer Park was right in indicating that the

new  Constitution would substitute the  words  "Federal

national" for "Federal citizen" wherever they appear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so, Sir. Wherever the

words  "Federal  citizen" appear,  the  words  "Federal

national" will be substituted, except in Part III which

talks  about  the qualifications of how one  becomes  a

Federal  citizen, because that will have to remain  for

the Federation side and Singapore citizens will have to

come  in.  I  do not want to anticipate events,  but  I

suggest  that it will not be long when we will have  to

amend our Singapore citizenship laws to be on par  with

the  Federation  citizenship laws,  otherwise  one  can

become a Federal national easier via Singapore than via

the Federation, and then a little bit of blackmarketing

may go on. I would suggest that that must be so, and it

is  the  logical significance if I may spell out  these

things from paragraph 14 of the White Paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All Singapore citizens will keep their citizenship

and   automatically  become  nationals  of  the  larger

Federation.  Citizens  of the present  Federation  will

similarly  become  nationals of the larger  Federation.

Nationals  of the larger Federation, whether  Singapore

citizens  or the Federation citizens, will as nationals



have  equal rights, carry the same passport, enjoy  the

same protection and be subject to the equal duties  and

responsibilities under the Constitution of  the  larger

Federation. Singapore citizens will continue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



to  enjoy  their  State rights and  privileges  within

Singapore  [in other words, education, labour,  and  so

on].'



<br><br>Once in Parliament, there is nothing to stop any Member

of this House who becomes a Member of Parliament of the

Federation of Malaysia from becoming a Minister, Deputy

Prime Minister or even Prime Minister of the Federation

of Malaysia. Equal rights mean what it says there. Sir,

I have heard great tributes paid by Members opposite to

the  capacity for frankness, the qualities of truth and

statesmanship  of the Prime Minister of the  Federation

of  Malaya. Sir, like little Albania, may I say that he

signed  this  document,  and I  have  every  reason  to

believe that he will honour every word of it?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do you honour your own words?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Every word of it, Sir. I give my

personal undertaking, for whatever it is worth, to  the

Member for Anson who keeps on telling the world that he

feels very sorry every time he believes the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, this has been

most helpful and I appreciate your consent. The Federal

Constitution gives constitutional protection, right  of

residence,   right  of  work,  right  of   freedom   of

association    and   freedom   of   speech    in    the

Federation - only  to  Federal citizens.  What  does  the

Prime  Minister really mean when he says - I do not  know

whether  he means what he says - that a Singapore citizen

who then becomes a Federal national will have all those

constitutional rights in the Federation? It makes a lot

of difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, that is so. If the hon.

Member  had  been following the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation,  he  would  have  noticed  that  the  Prime

Minister  of the Federation made the point  that  there

would be no barrier between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



the  mingling  of Singapore citizens in the  Federation

and  vice  versa.  He  said - if I remember  him  on  one

occasion, reading reports from London - that he  believed

the  migration  is more up than down, but unfortunately

my  Minister in charge of social welfare tells me  that

it  is  more  down than up. Whatever it is,  that  will

continue;  there  will be rights of  association,  Pan-Malayan or Pan-Malaysian parties, trade unions, and so

on. I do not like to raise hopes unduly, Sir, because I

looked up a man who could read the stars and he told me

that  when the Tunku finally retires - according  to  his

reading of the stars, and he also read the Red Star of

the Barisan very carefully - Tun Abdul Razak is likely to

be  the  Prime Minister of Malaysia. Sir, I  am  afraid

this will not make the Communists very happy. But what

to  do?  These are the unfortunate things of life  with

which  they  have  to  put  up.  There  is  nothing  to

stop - this  is  in  a more practical vein - any  Singapore

Member  (this  is  by  way  of  example,  of  Singapore

U.M.N.O. or  even  of  the Singapore  Alliance)  from

becoming  a Minister of the New Government of  the  new

Federation   of   Malaysia   after   merger.   And   in

constitutional theory - I told this to the astrologer who

looked  up  the stars and read the Barisan Red  Star - I

told him that there was nothing to stop the Member  for

Queenstown  in  conjunction with his Front  friends  in

Penang, like Mr Lim Kean Siew and so on, from becoming

the  Prime  Minister of the new Federation.  Mind  you,

Sir,  I  think long before that happy event arrives,  I

have  a  feeling  that there will be a lot  of  trouble

between ambitious Front men - both in Singapore  and  in

Penang.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that also from the stars?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, that is also read from the

stars,  Sir.  And he has a five-pointed red  star.  The

Member  for Anson has a friend in Ipoh who has  a  six-pointed blue star - or black star; I am not sure.  But  I

saw  some  blue ones painted in Kuala Lumpur where  the

P.P.P. stood for election. I do not know, but these are

some  of  the anomalies that will have to be  adjusted,

otherwise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



people  will  get confused over the voting  paper.  You

cannot put a five-pointed star or a six-pointed star in

red or black. It would be terribly complicated when  it

comes to voting.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> There is only a one-pointed star.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> These are problems to which I

think  they could do well to bend their minds. If  they

calculate a few steps ahead and be more careful',  they

might  avoid - I think it is too late to avoid this round

which has reached the zugzwang - a second round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to ask the Member for Hong Lim this very

simple  question.  Can he show me any  instance  of  an

associate member of a club having the right to become a

member    of    the    managing   committee?    Fifteen

representatives from Singapore will be  elected  direct

by  the  citizens  of Singapore, as  automatic  Federal

nationals, to the Parliament of the new Federation  and

will  become members of the managing committee  of  the

new  Federation of Malaysia. Another question is  this.

Can  he show me a club which allows an associate member

to become the President or the General Secretary or the

Secretary-General or an office-bearer of the club?

is the point? If I can pay only half my fees as an

member  and  then  I  can  be  the  President  of   the

wonder  the  Medical Faculty is in  such  a  deplorable

condition. The chaps are selling out the rights of  the

We try to save them from their own folly.

Ministers,   Deputy  Prime  Minister,  or  even   Prime

Minister  of  the  Federation of Malaysia.  I  ask  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  is  that a sell-out?  We  sell  out

Singapore  in order to allow theoretically a  Singapore

man  to be the Prime Minister of the new Federation of

Malaysia.  You sell yourself to yourself. What  are  we

talking about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the second part of the amendment, I have

already  referred to paragraph 14 of Command  Paper  33

which is a clear and categorical statement agreed to by

the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya. It says

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nationals of the larger Federation, whether Singapore

citizens  or the Federation citizens, will as nationals

have  equal rights, carry the same passport, enjoy  the

same protection and be subject to the equal duties  and

responsibilities under the Constitution of  the  larger

Federation.'



<br><br>And  every  single  word  therein  has  been  carefully

weighed  by the Attorney-General on that side  and  the

State  Advocate-General on this side.  The  only  point

where  Singapore citizens are different from Federation

citizens  is  that Singapore citizens will continue  to

enjoy  their  State  rights  and  privileges - education,

labour,  social welfare benefits. They are of different

rates,  Sir,If tomorrow we have complete merger,  our

social welfare allowances will have to go down by  more

than one-half to keep them in line with the rural areas

of  the Federation. And I do not think, in the minds of

the ordinary people, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



they   will  understand  that  merger  brings  economic

stability,  expansion and prosperity, if  that  is  the

immediate side effect.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> $90 million.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sure the Member for

Queenstown  will find the Prime Minister  accommodating

if he wishes for elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Giving $90 million away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We are not giving $90 million

away, Sir. There is no such thing. Nobody is giving $90

million away. This is magic conjured up by some  bright

spark;  I  do not know who. I do not think it is  James

Puthucheary.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am responsible, if you will permit,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am responsible, Mr Speaker, Sir, on

the  assurance  of the Prime Minister  talking  to  his

cronies  on the air, the cronies of the Press, when  he

informed them that we have come to an arrangement  with

the Federation whereby the Federation will receive one-quarter  of our annual income, which works out  to  $98

million  a  year on the present Estimates. $98  million

for nothing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is another instance, Sir,

perhaps  of  saying  words in haste and  regretting  at

leisure. May I refer to the exchange of letters between

the  Prime  Minister of the Federation  of  Malaya  and

myself?  This is my letter dated 11th November  to  the

Prime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya. The second

last paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Finally, we have agreed that Singapore would keep

more  than  three-quarters  of  her  revenue  for   the

discharge  of  her  responsibilities on  education  and

labour,  social  welfare,  health  and  all  the  other

matters set out as state or concurrent responsibilities

in  the  schedule  annexed to our memorandum,  and,  be

entitled to 15 seats in the Central Parliament  of  the

new Federation.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  may  I  very simply explain this?  If  one  looks

through  the schedule, the State List - I am  obliged  to

you,  Sir, for having circulated it to Members. It  was

an  oversight, and we should have put it  out,  but  we

assumed that Members had made themselves familiar  with

the  Federation Constitution. That, anyway, is for  all

States.  List  I,  in  all  the  other  States  of  the

Federation,  is what they call Federal List  controlled

by  the  Central Government. Sir, we are taking out  of

that  List,  from  Federation to  State  control,  very

important items. In particular, Members will note items

13, 14, 15, and all the other concurrent items. Because

of  the  complexities of budgeting procedure, it  is  a

very   complicated  subject.  I  do  not   pretend   to

understand things which I do not understand. I leave it

to  the  experts to work them out. But  may  I  give  a

simple  example?  The one Ministry  most  affected,  of

course,  is the Ministry of Home Affairs. My colleague,

the  Member  in  charge  of  Home  Affairs,  will  have

divested  himself  of a great deal  of  responsibility,

like internal security, item No. 3 there. Defence - he is

doing  a  little bit of it, S.I.R. and so on.  External

Affairs -  I run a minor department to keep the Consular

Corps   happy,  and  from  time  to  time  insult   the

Portuguese  Consulate by not sending them  a  Christmas

card;  that sort of thing, Sir. Well, my colleague  the

Minister for Home Affairs will have divested himself of

nearly three-quarters of his responsibility - Police, $28

million, is it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> $30 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Police, $30 million. He is not

giving  to  the  Federation. That chunk of  the  Budget

will,  from  the day of merger, appear in  the  Central

Parliament  Budget, not the Singapore Budget.  We  will

not present it anymore.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of elucidation, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have got the paper here of what he

said,  the  20th  November, after  those  letters  were

exchanged. The Prime Minister said the acceptance of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



15  seats  was  not  just a question of  splitting  the

difference  between 12 and 19 and reaching  the  figure

15,  but  because  Singapore would  be  getting  three-quarters  of the State revenue. If you like,  Sir,  the

paper is available.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that is exactly what is

contained in the letter of 11th November, 1961. Is that

correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am sorry if I had been

misunderstood. But quite simply what it means is  this:

those  items not appearing in the Singapore Budget  and

which come under the Federal List will be taken out  of

the  Singapore Budget. Our Police Force  will  then  be

paid  by the Central Government. That is so. It  is  my

job  to  negotiate, Mr Speaker, Sir. And the  Minister

for  Finance will have to spend a heavy amount of  work

in  apportioning  pensions. Pensions is  one  of  those

things which they have decided [Interruption]. Yes, let

me  explain, Sir,It is a complicated procedure. Let me

start off with the police, because I am quite sure  the

Barisan Sosialis are very interested in these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the day of merger, the Minister for Home

Affairs will only look after -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> The Fire Brigade!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Fire Brigade and a few other

things. No, no. He will look after - [Laughter]. Well, we

are such a

wicked, tyrannical Government! Are they not happy  that

we are rid of such a tyrannical Minister?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is why we are laughing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. But let me inform them of

this.  These are a few mercies for which they  must  be

grateful. The Minister for Home Affairs will  still  be

in  concurrent charge of publications. So we  will  let

Fajar be published - it does not matter. We will let the

Barisan,  you  know, the red star and  a  blue  circle,

carry  on. We will not cancel all these things.  Where

the  item  is concurrent, it will still appear  in  the

State Budget. We will have to pay for it -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



the   staff,  secretaries  and  so  on.  Where  it   is

completely  Federal, like Police, Post and  Telegraphs,

Telecommunications,  the whole lot  will  go  into  the

Federation   Central  Budget,  and  a  very   intricate

Establishment  exercise  is  involved  because  of  the

pension liability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to anticipate the tremendous

financial  problems that will crop up. But  may  I  say

this, and I say it with some reservation, looking at my

colleague, the Minister for Finance:

we have certain reserves and we intend - probably Brunei

also  intends - to  keep these reserves aside  for  State

development. But the reserves are already committed for

pension   liability  of  all  officers.   Now   certain

categories  of  officers, as in  the  P  &  T,  Police,

Prisons - I  am sorry to be so morbid, Sir, but  in  the

nature  of  things they go to the Central Budget;  they

will appear in the Federal List. Some of these officers

have  already  served 20 or 30 years in Singapore,  and

for that part of their service, their pension liability

will have to be borne by the Singapore reserves. Future

service  will have to be borne by the Malayan  reserves

or  Pan-Malaysian reserves. And I am told this is quite

a delicate exercise in the mathematics of actuarial -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actuarial science.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Actuarial science. I am told you

can calculate what the odds are. How many chaps die  at

what  age, and who live to enjoy pensions for how long.

These  things  have to be worked out.  So  it  is  with

policemen, prison warders, postmen, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform Members of the House that this $90

million  is just a misconception. I will not  say  more

than  that.  I  am sure the Member for Anson  generally

misunderstood, or I did not make myself clear. But this

is that section of the Budget which will be transferred

to  the  Central Budget. The Federation does  not  take

over  the  Police Force tomorrow and then  disband  and

sack  the  whole Department. Somebody has to  keep  the

police    going;   the   police   stations,   vehicles,

replacements, V.H.F. equipment, latest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



finger-printing searchers, and so on and  so  forth.  A

very intricate business. It has to go on; it has to  be

paid for. In my estimation, in fact, the end result  is

that  we  will be keeping more than three-quarters,  at

least  three-quarters. You will see  in  the  letter  I

mentioned more than three-quarters. How much more  than

three-quarters we do not know, because of  the  pension

liability and other things. But we will continue.  This

Assembly will not be emaciated. It will not become like

the   Johore  State  Assembly,  Sir.  Forgive  me   for

mentioning  such mundane things, Sir, but  if  it  did,

then  suddenly Members' allowances would be reduced  to

$200  - a very sad thing for Barisan Members.  I  hear

that  nowadays  they have to scrounge  around  to  keep

their branches going, to set up new branches and to pay

rents  and so on. Let alone the Speaker, Sir,  and  the

whole  panoply of his office. I do not mind being  paid

as the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Speaker is

entitled to debate. The Speaker is impartial.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point I want to make:

that  after  everything is said and  done,  and  having

transferred all the Federal Departments to the  Centre,

we  will  still be in charge of over three-quarters  of

our  annual  revenue, and the machinery for  collection

will  still remain as it is. And we will present yearly

Budgets;  albeit this time the obvious ones which  will

be  missing, probably from the next  Budget,  will  be

Police, Prisons, Posts & Telegraphs. I must be fair  to

the  Member  for  Anson. The only extra expenditure  we

will  incur,  and  which we are not  incurring  at  the

moment  because the British are discharging it, is  the

Ministry  of  External  Affairs  and  Defence.  At  the

moment, we pay nothing for it. The British pay for  the

Consulates.  We  only pay for Djakarta and  London.  We

have a little Trade Commissioner's Office in London and

one  in Djakarta. We are hoping to set up one in Japan.

By  the  special arrangements made, we will still  have

direct  access  to Trade Commissions  in  all  the  key

centres for our entrepot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



business, but it will become part of the Malayan Embassy. And this is the -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> From what has transpired from the Prime

Minister's  speech,  even  though  he  is  a  political

opponent,  I  would  like to point  out  that  in  this

matter,  it was the Leader of the House who, in  answer

to  my question, "Why are we giving this $90 million?",

said,  "For Defence" in this very House. Now  what  the

Prime Minister has said has certainly clarified it. And

I  wonder  whether  the Prime Minister  would  consider

attaching  addenda to the White Paper, so that  we  can

the   better  understand  it  in  the  light   of   the

elucidation both on the subject of citizenship and  the

expenditure of money before we continue the vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I will be happy to continue

to  elucidate. And I say quite frankly, as  the  Member

for  Farrer Park has said, if the Member for Anson, who

is  a  trained  lawyer of some repute, particularly  in

criminal  matters  he  has  a  very  high  repute,  can

misunderstand   this,   probably   there   are    other

misconceptions.  For that reason,  we  have  published,

this  early. And we will give everybody ample  time  to

raise  any  query on any subject. There  are  no  cards

hidden  anywhere. There are no traps. There is  nothing

that  is a fast one. What is done is open on the  table

for debate and for discussion. And I say the only extra

expenditure which we are not incurring at the moment is

to  pay  our  portion of the Federation's  Ministry  of

External  Affairs and Defence. That has been calculated

by  the  Ministry of Finance at about $12  million,  if

only Singapore and the Federation come in, or about $10

million, perhaps less, (maybe $8 million) if the Borneo

territories also come in, because then they  will  have

to  share the load. That is all. That is the only  load

we are not carrying at the moment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the second part of the

amendment - the  question  of  automatic  conversion   of

Singapore  citizenship to Federation  citizenship.  Mr

Speaker,  we had anticipated that the Barisan  Sosialis

would  continue  to  raise a  false  alarm.  They  will

continue to do it over citizenship. It is our  duty  as

the  Government - and I hope we will be helped by Members

even  of  the Opposition, who have principles by  which

they  stand  and  who  believe  that  this  must  be  a

necessary  step forward towards our destiny to  a  more

stable and prosperous society - to defend, to explain and

to continue explaining until every lie has been bared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in precise and clear terms, the White Paper

explains  that  no  Singapore  citizen  will  lose  his

citizenship  rights. Li addition, he will  acquire  new

rights  as a national of the new Federation.  I  repeat

this again, because I think it bears repetition for the

purposes of the record. Among those rights will be  the

right to elect representatives direct to the Federation

Parliament;  the right to carry the same  passport  and

enjoy   the  same  rights  and  privileges  under   the

Constitution; and to be subject, of course, to the same

duties and responsibilities for instance, conscription,

taxes and so on. These rights and duties are set out in

many sections of the Federation Constitution, beginning

with Article 8, which emphasises that all citizens  are

equal.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to labour the

point, but I think hon. Members who are interested  can

look   through   the   documents   entitled,   "Malayan

Constitutional  Documents". They can  see  there  spelt

out,  equal  rights, equal liabilities of all  citizens

which  will  later on be of all nationals  of  the  new

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'8. (1) All persons are equal before the law and

entitled to the equal protection of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Except as expressly authorised by this

Constitution, there shall be no discrimination  against

citizens  on the ground only of religion race,  descent

or place of birth ...'



<br><br>and  so  on.  Citizens who will have to be  changed  to

nationals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(3) There shall be no discrimination in favour of any

person on the ground that he is a subject of the  Ruler

of any State.'



<br><br>And  so on to Articles 9, on prohibition of banishment,

and freedom of movement. But here, may I add this, Sir?

I do not want to mislead anybody. Under Singapore laws,

and  under  the  provisions agreed to  in  the  Command

Paper,  Sessional Paper 31 of 1956, a Singapore Citizen

can,  for varied reasons, be he an opium smuggler or  a

smuggler  of a less apparent commodity than  opium,  be

called  upon  to show cause why his citizenship  should

not  be  questioned  and so on.  But  that  is  another

matter. I do not want to mislead anybody on that point.

What I want to say is this, all rights in Singapore and

the  Federation, of Singapore citizens  and  Federation

citizens  and Federation nationals, will be equal.  The

operative  Articles which will have to be amended  will

be  8,  9,  10,  47 (Qualifications for  membership  of

Parliament), 119 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. For the record, if the marginal

titles are read, perhaps that will be sufficient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I then just run through the

marginal  titles  of the provisions:  8.  Equality;  9.

Prohibition of banishment, and freedom of movement; 10.

Freedom  of  speech,  assembly  and  association;   11.

Freedom  of religion; 47. Qualifications for membership

of  Parliament:  119. Qualifications of electors;  123.

Qualifications  of Judges of Supreme Court.  There  are

several   other  sections,  Sir,  hut  these  are   the

important  ones which set out the rights and duties  of

nationals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have discussed the question of citizenship,

nationality,   and  the  representation  of   Singapore

Members  in the Central Federation Parliament with  the

Federation  Prime  Minister  and  his  colleagues.  Our

respective  arguments and view-points were recorded  in

an  exchange  of  letters which  were  tabled  on  24th

November,  Friday.  May I, Sir, draw  he  attention  of

Members  to certain relevant portions thereof? This  is

particularly important when considering the proposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



now put forward by the Barisan Sosialis,  namely,

that all Singapore citizens should automatically become

Federation citizens. They make this demand in the  full

knowledge  that  it is completely unacceptable  to  the

Federation, and that it cannot be supported  either  by

logic,  reason  or precedent in the Federation.  First,

may  I read what the Federation Prime Minister said  in

his  letter of 13th November, in the second  and  third

paragraphs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would like to emphasise that it cannot be assumed

that  the  analogy of Penang or Malacca is  necessarily

relevant  to  the status of Singapore in a merger  with

the   Federation.   Article  22   of   the   Federation

Constitution makes provision for a merger of new states

on terms which do not necessarily have to follow Penang

and   Malacca  which  were  already  members   of   the

Federation when the 1957 Constitution came into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the stricter citizenship laws of the other States

were  applied to Singapore, Singapore would be entitled

to not more than twelve seats, since less persons would

be   eligible  for  citizenship  and  consequently  for

franchise,  quite apart from the question of  weightage

for rural areas.'



<br><br>May  I  just  pause there and explain  this,  Sir?  The

Federation's point of view is quite simple. Penang  and

Malacca  were special. They were part of the Federation

already. People born in Penang and Malacca were already

Federation  citizen  by virtue of  the  1952  Agreement

before   the  coming  into  being  of  the  independent

Federation   of  Malaya.  That  is  the  first   point.

Secondly,  if we were to follow the laws of  Johore  or

Perak,  either  the  Federated  Malay  States  or   the

Unfederated  Malay States, then however generously  you

interpret  these  rules and so on, their  appraisal  is

that we would not be entitled to more than 12 seats  at

the  maximum. Finally, they go on to say that in regard

to  the  distribution  of seats in  the  whole  of  the

Federation  as  such - as in other  countries  where  the

parliamentary  system  is practised - by  the  nature  of

things and by the circumstances of geography, there  is

more  representation per 10,000 of  population  in  the

rural  than  in  the city areas. In  the  urban  areas,

people  are  concentrated together. One  representative

can  cover one square mile, or even half a square mile.

The Member for Kreta Ayer, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for  Finance,  has a constituency,  I  think,

which  does  not run to more than even  half  a  square

mile.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Thirty acres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He has as many people to look

after  as  the Member for Sembawang or the  Member  for

Chua Chu Kang, who constantly complains of the enormous

distances he has to travel. On the average, it has been

worked out, I think, at about 30,000 per representative

in  the urban area and 20,000 per representative in the

rural  area, because the man in the rural area  has  to

cover  enormous  distances.  If  that  is  taken   into

consideration, then it will definitely be less than  12

by  any calculation. That is the Federation's point  of

view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I then read my letter to the Federation Prime

Minister of the 11th November, setting forth our  point

of view? Third paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If merger were completely on the basis of Penang,

then  the  citizenship laws of the  present  Federation

which  applied in Penang will apply to Singapore. About

284,000 representing those born in Singapore out of the

624,000  Singapore citizens would automatically qualify

for  citizenship of the present Federation. This  would

entitle  Singapore  to send 14 representatives  to  the

Central  Federation Legislature. This is comparable  to

the  14  seats  to which Johore's 291,230 citizens  are

entitled.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johore has 291,000 - 14 seats. We say that if Penang

terms  apply, we will have 284,000. These are the  more

important parts, Sir. How did we come to the figure 15?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The remaining 340,000 Singapore citizens who were not

born  in  Singapore would have to apply for citizenship

under  the  present citizenship laws of the  Federation

which  require, inter alia, a residential qualification

and a knowledge of the Malay language. On the basis  of

the   numbers  in  the  other  States  in  the  present

Federation  who  have  qualified  by  application   for

citizenship in this way, over two-thirds i.e. more than

230,000 will lose their present citizenship.'



<br><br>This is really the crux of the problem. Because of  the

different  citizenship  laws  in  Singapore   and   the

Federation,  if we now apply the Federation citizenship

Jaws,  there  are 340,000 Singapore citizens  who  will

have  to re-apply. If we study the statistics of people

in  the Federation who were not born there and who  had

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



apply,  then we will know fairly accurately what  would

happen  in  Singapore. What happened is that about  one

out  of  three was successful in their application.  In

other  words,  out of the 340,000, our  calculation  is

that 110,000 will qualify and 230,000 will not qualify.

This  is  the crux of the matter. If we listen  to  the

Barisan Sosialis - or if we were foolish enough to listen

to  them - take them at their face value and ask for  the

Penang  and  Malacca type of merger, there  will  be  a

confused  and  riotous position in  Singapore,  because

340,000  people  will have to re-apply,  two-thirds  of

whom  will  not succeed. Therefore, we have arrived  at

the  provision which I later explained in  the  letter.

May I continue with the letter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the other hand, the claim that Singapore citizens

should  automatically  become Federation  citizens  and

thereby increase the representation Singapore would  be

entitled  to,  was and still is, in the  view  of  your

Government, too absurd to merit serious consideration.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite simply what they told us. First, the

Barisan  Sosialis  say,  "We  want  Singapore  citizens

automatically to convert." A man comes here from  India

for  two years. He would never have been entitled  even

to  make the application, and so is disqualified on the

face   of   the   application  because  of   inadequate

residence. He then becomes a Singapore citizen  because

our  laws  are  different. He says, "I  want  to  be  a

Federation citizen now." Not only do we want that,  but

we  then  say,  "Well, now, that entitles  us  to  more

representation."  This, in the view of  the  Federation

Government, is unacceptable and is known to the Barisan

Sosialis.  It  must be obviously so,  Sir,  unless  the

Government  wishes to lose the confidence  of  its  own

electorate there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Merger on either of these terms would be unrealistic.

However,  you  have  agreed that all present  Singapore

citizens will keep their citizenship rights and  become

Federal  nationals,  provided  this  is  not  then  put

forward  as a reason for an increase in the  number  of

representatives for Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the operative clause, Sir, - "provided this is

not then put forward as a reason for an increase in the

number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



of  representatives for Singapore." It is as simple  as

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, without discourtesy to the Chair,

may   I  take  off  my  jacket  because  of  the   air-conditioning? I must say, for the benefit  of  Members,

that I did attempt to get the City Engineer to maintain

pressure in the Assembly but not for the whole  of  the

City  area,  but  he  explained  to  me  that  it   was

impossible to maintain pressure for the Assembly  alone

without at the same time opening the whole of the  City

area.  Everybody  would then open their  taps  and  the

pressure would fall down, and that would affect the air

conditioning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to my subject, may I say that this is the

core of the problem? If we went in like Penang, and  if

what  happened in Penang and Malacca happened here,  we

would have 284,000 automatically qualified amongst whom

would be quite a number of Members from this House, not

including  the Member for Queenstown or the Member  for

Thomson,  because they were not born in  Singapore,  or

the Member for Pasir Panjang or the Member for Moulmein

because  they  were born in China. They would  have  to

reapply. That is another problem for them. But we  say,

"All  will keep their Singapore citizenship.  All  will

become  Federal  nationals and be equal  to  Federation

citizens who also become Federal nationals." As far  as

national rights are concerned, they are equal. The only

difference is in the voting, because these 230,000 - two-thirds  of  the 340,000 - who were not born in Singapore

will  not have qualified. The Federation does not  want

them just to go across the Causeway and start voting in

Johore, thereby increasing their representation  there,

because they would not have qualified in any case.  But

we  say,  "No.  We have allowed them to  qualify  under

Singapore  laws". The Federation says. "Well,  that  is

your  business,  but  we are not giving  you  increased

representation as a result of allowing you to let  them

keep  Singapore citizenship and becoming  automatically

Federation  nationals." It is a simple case of  saying,

"Here is the Singapore cake. How do you share it,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



whether  it is among 624,000 citizens of 624,000  minus

230,000 who will not qualify, that is not our business.

But you are not going to get a bigger cake just because

you  say you have more citizens, because they would not

have qualified in the Federation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My government estimated that on a merger like Penang,

Singapore  would  be entitled to 19 seats  in  view  of

Perak's 450,000 voters entitling Perak to 19 seats.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain this, Sir. 284,000 born here; from the

figures   in  the  Federation  of  one  out  of   three

qualifying, we can calculate that 110,000 will qualify.

110,000 plus 284,000 makes 394,000; let us round it off

at 400,000. Let us say that between now and Merger Day,

everybody  suddenly takes an interest in  the  national

language and learns very hard, and the percentage  will

increase,  not  one in three as in the Federation,  but

say,  50,000  more will qualify; make it 450,000;  that

would  entitle us to 19 seats. Perak - 450,000.  I  must

make  this point. This is our argument which the  Tunku

does  not  accept, as you will see in  his  reply.  His

point is that Perak - 450,000 is spread over a very large

area, and we have to compute ourselves on the basis  of

the  urban  areas - Penang, Kuala Lumpur,  Johore  Bahru,

Ipoh,  Malacca - not the rural areas like  Perak.  But,

anyway, our contention is 19 seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I go on to the next paragraph but one:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Finally, we have agreed that Singapore would keep

more  than  three-quarters  of  her  revenue  for   the

discharge  of  her  responsibilities on  education  and

labour,  social  welfare,  health  and  all  the  other

matters set out as state or concurrent responsibilities

in  the  schedule  annexed to our  memorandum,  and  he

entitled to 15 seats in the Central Parliament  of  the

new Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement has precedents in constitutional

practice.  Northern Ireland, though part of the  United

Kingdom  retains certain autonomous powers.  In  return

for this, though Northern Ireland would he entitled  to

16  seats on the basis of electoral strength,  she  has

only  12 because she retains autonomous powers.  Should

in  the  future Singapore surrender some or all of  her

autonomous  powers  and state revenue  to  the  Central

Government,  the  question  of  representation  can  he

reviewed.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have sold nobody out. We have bought nobody

from  the Tunku. All we have done is to try and find  a

way  out  of  the  anomaly that  has  been  created  by

different  citizenship laws. And  even  more  important

than  different citizenship laws, a fact that everybody

knows,  if you want trouble - not this little boycott  of

the  examinations,  a  manifestly  reasonable  academic

problem of taking the examinations has already  led  to

two   motions   in   this  Chamber,   one   beleaguered

Parliamentary  Secretary  and  the  Serjeant  at   Arms

greatly  imperilled by being asked to undertake  duties

which  he  had not bargained for when he undertook  his

office.  But  can anybody in his right mind  doubt  the

opening we will give to misunderstanding and trouble if

we say education goes to the Federation? $120 million a

year  is  spent  on  education alone. Annual  recurrent

teachers'  salaries, books, this, that and  the  other,

$90  million; building new schools $30 million. We hand

over $120 million to the Federation Government and say,

"Implement the Rahman Talib Report." Then I  say  quite

obviously we are not only ham-handed, but we deserve to

be  in  trouble because obviously we do not  understand

our  own problems. Does anybody in his right mind  - and

already some people are questioning whether one  Member

opposite  is  in his right mind - believe  that  you  can

stand  up  in  Singapore  and  tell  the  people  here,

particularly  the Chinese-educated, that they  have  to

implement  the  Rahman  Talib  Report?  Only  one-third

instruction   to  be  in  the  mother   language;   the

vernacular;  there will be no more public  examinations

in Chinese; any school which does not comply with those

rules  ceases  to  get grants in aid. In  other  words,

Chinese  High  School, Chung Cheng, Nanyang  University

atrophy,  shrink  and die away. No more  bursaries  for

students  in  Nanyang or Chung Cheng  for  their  post-secondary examinations, studies and so on. And they say

we have sold out the people, Sir!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time will come, Sir, when we shall put these

things  to  the test. We understand these  problems.  I

give myself no credit, Sir, for understanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



these  problems  a little better than  the  Member  for

Queenstown,  because he started getting  interested  in

these problems only since about February 1959, when  he

saw  the  P.A.P. flash and the circle.  We  have  been

living  with these problems for years. The  Member  for

Anson  remembers well what happened. In 1954 and  1955,

he  became  the Chief Minister. I used to  see  him  on

behalf of the students. I saw both sides, Sir,I saw  a

Chief Minister really trying his level best to do  what

he  could to resolve the matter. I saw kids bright  and

intelligent and able organisers, but with chaps at  the

rear to see that they did not settle these matters. The

Member for Anson knew that. It is not the kids who  did

not want to settle. It is the chaps who were behind the

kids, it  is like the Hock Lee problem. He  went  down

there, and so did I. I was advising the Hock Lee Union.

He  was there trying to resolve the dispute between the

employer  and the union. He ate a bowl of kway-teow  on

the  spot  to  the delectation of the photographer.  He

thought it was settled, and he went back, and so did I.

I  thought  it  was settled too. We went  back  and  we

discovered  it  was not settled. It was not  the  Union

Committee  that decided. He saw the Union Committee.  I

hate  to  say  this,  but I do not think  it  was  just

because of his persuasive powers, but because it was  a

reasonable settlement. They accepted. We then  departed

believing the problem was over. Four days later,  there

were  riots in Singapore because the real chaps  behind

who made the decisions did not want a settlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, with the 4:2 and 3:3 systems. We have been

through  all  that.  That is  why  we  never  made  the

decision. The Government did not make the decision  4:2

or   3:3, it  was  the  Chinese  educational  experts

themselves - the school management committees and  school

principals - who decided on 4:2. So you see  the  problem

of  the  Communists when they have  not  got  a  united

front.  Supposing we had decided on 4:2, then we  would

have  had  Mr  Ko  Teck Kin on behalf  of  the  school

management  committees and Mr So  and  So.  All  these

hidden  men  keep quiet, and virulent  words  would  be

uttered via manifestly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



moderate,  reasonable merchants who are  obviously  not

interested in politics but only interested in  commerce

and the education of their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time it is different and it will continue to

be  different so long as this Government is in  office.

When  we  were going through all that, we were doing  a

little  bit of computation as to what would happen  one

of  these days if we had to be responsible. We did  not

intend  to play the role of just being a whipping  boy,

slogged from one corner of the ring to the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought many of the decisions of the Member for

Cairnhill were tricky and unwise, but I could not  help

feeling  sorry  for  him as a human being,  pulverised.

beaten  to  pulp, the day he ill-advisedly allowed  the

police  to  go  in  with steel helmets,  wicker  basket

shields  and tear gas to clear the Chinese High  School

and the Chung Cheng High School. That day he died.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That was only the day before yesterday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, that is different. We do not

intend to use steel helmets and wicker baskets. I  told

you we have already found Out from Italy that they have

itching  powder. Let me explain it. I  saw  it  from  a

ringside view. I was with the Committee of Human Rights

speaking  at  Beauty Park. I do not  know  whether  the

Member  for  Havelock was there. Has he  gone  to  the

Federation yet? I am not sure whether he has left  for

the  Federation. But I think he will remember  that  we

went up there and railed against the colonialists. They

were still in charge, and there were no doubt about it.

The  Chief  Secretary gave the orders.  Mind  you,  the

Chief  Minister  agreed,  and  that  was  his  greatest

mistake. That night, Sir, I saw the preview of what was

coming.  We  finished the meeting at seven  o'clock.  I

came  down  Bukit Timah Road and I saw the police  line

up, and so did the parents. They just lined up to watch

their  own children in anxiety and these little  picket

boys   playing  bandits.  It  is  very  exciting,  this

business of putting on handkerchiefs. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



gives  them a sense of adventure. Sheriffs and bandits!

They  kept  the parents out and the police prepared  to

move in. The parents watched in anxiety for their kids.

That  night the police moved in - one night of  tear  gas

and  charges.  The next morning at seven  o'clock,  the

kids  were  weeping  from the tear gas.  I  can  assure

Members  opposite  that when I  went  into  the  fourth

branch  of the Shop and Factory Workers Union two  days

after the riots, the gas was still there and I came out

from the premises weeping.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And you will weep again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am told this tear gas is a bit

old-fashioned  nowadays.  It is  the  foolish  colonial

chaps who do these things and make martyrs of people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Speaker was so engrossed that

he  did not realise that the Prime Minister is straying

away  from the motion. Perhaps we will stop at  itching

powder.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think we had better not start

that  one,  Sir,  or the Member for Queenstown  may  be

spending a sleepless night, because I am told  that  if

you are given a dose of it, your first and only thought

is  to  go home and have a good bath, and having had  a

good  bath  you will not feel like going out  for  some

time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It will hurt the user more than the

used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is that so? I am not sure about

this, it depends on how it is delivered, Sir. But I  am

told, beyond any doubt, and having seen pictures of it,

that the effect is immediate. Suddenly an angry man  in

a position -



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> On a point of

elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> In case the Prime Minister is not

joking  and  is seriously thinking of using  it - he  has

said he has had no experience of itching powder but  he

has  experienced  tear gas; vice versa  when  I  was  a

child, I used to be interested in magic shows and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



ordered  some itching powder - let me tell him  that  its

effect  on children will be more cruel than the use  of

tear gas. Having had experience of that, and he has not

had  it,  I  would like to advise him that if  he  ever

thinks  of  using  it  on school  children  in  another

boycott, please do not do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am deeply indebted to the dear

Lady  for giving me the advice. After all, my kids  may

be  involved too and I do not want to harm them.  I  do

not mind their getting a good scratch and then having a

good  bath,  but no more than that. Several members  of

the  Chambers of Commerce - eminent gentry - have children

who  also put on white masks. It is all fun and  games.

But  let us keep it at that level - fun and games. There

is  no need for martyrs in Singapore. If we have clowns

and foolish men, well, let them be branded as such. Why

make them heroes? That is the point the P.A.P. learned.

We  do not intend to let education go to the centre for

the  simple reason that that is the surest way to start

trouble.   There   will  be  real  trouble   and   real

misunderstanding. And I say even if the Communists want

to  stop it, they will not be able to, because  it  has

nothing  to  do  with  Communism. This  is  the  latent

hangover  of generations of culture and tradition,  and

it  takes  a  long  time to get a  multi-racial  people

together.  I  have  covered this  theme  often  before,

particularly when the various component parts are being

inspired   by  what  is  happening  outside  Malaya - the

Chinese  by what is happening in China; the Indians  by

what  is happening in India, and the Malays by what  is

happening in Indonesia - and at this juncture in history,

we are trying to get the races to come together. So let

us  not  make  our job more difficult. If  the  Barisan

Sosialis stand up and say, "Ah, why not let us  have  a

Pan-Malayan education policy?", I say to them, that  we

have fortunately got that down in writing, and they may

yet  live  to be sorry that they have put  it  down  in

writing,  because  we will prove to them,  first,  that

that  is  not what the people of Singapore  want,  and,

second, that when they said that, they were utterly and

absolutely insincere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I pass on from citizenship to nationality,

may  I mention that the Member for Queenstown has asked

nine  questions regarding citizenship and  nationality,

and   the   Member  for  Thomson  has   added   a   few

more - according  to  reports, as  I  did  not  have  the

privilege  to listen to him. Sir, these questions  make

interesting  subjects for a discussion in  a  forum  in

which - as  I  understand from the interjections  of  the

Member for Queenstown - he is eager to take part.  It  is

only  the  inordinate  length of this  debate  that  is

preventing him from expressing his views to the  people

of  Singapore in person. No doubt, Sir, as this  debate

comes  to  a  close, he can discuss his nine  questions

with  the Member for Kreta Ayer, the Member for  Farrer

Park  and the Member for Hong Lim. They are interesting

questions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What about the Member for Anson?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He will be coming too. Sir, I am

looking forward to seeing the Member for Anson,  but  I

think  he  should not take away the fire and the  light

from the Member for Queenstown. He should be given  one

on  his  own with the Member for Kreta Ayer,  and  then

perhaps the Member for Anson on some other occasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone of these proposals in Paper Cmd. 33 of

1961 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Is farcical.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Oh, you can take part in the

forum.  Sir, it is so dull and uninteresting.  He  gets

these  questions  written up  somewhere  and  he  says,

"Please answer them." It is no use. We answer them  and

then his Party think out new ones and he comes back and

asks us some more - as we have seen, Sir, on one occasion

when they agreed to a motion to be debated. If only  we

were  allowed to say, "Proceed now and debate,"  as  on

Thursday  if  we  had  to discuss  the  Chinese  school

students and the pickets.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It was a surprise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, there was no surprise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To distract attention from the

debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister should

ignore these interjections and just carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the point I want to make is

this.  As I understand parliamentary democracy and  the

democratic  system, one of its most vital  features  is

the  open confrontation. [Interruption] Yes, true.  The

Member  for  Anson is absolutely a past master  in  the

game.  As when a witness is in the box on oath  and  he

tells a lie, he is literally torn to strips. But if the

witness  just reads a long statement from the dock  and

refuses to answer questions, you know what it is worth.

It  is  a waste of time. Anybody can draft a 7�-hour

speech. In fact, I was aghast at the lack of ingenuity,

the  lack of material and the lack of flair in the  7�-hour speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hi-fi record.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Queenstown

may  be interested in this because it has something  to

do with his future. The Minister of the Interior of the

Federation was playing golf with me the other day -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think there was an attempt by

some  Member - I do not remember who it was - to give  that

story to this Assembly and I stopped him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is a different story. It has

nothing to do with the conduct of the Member. All  that

the  Minister  said was that he admired the  7�-hour

speech;  that Krishna Menon, when he was in the  United

Nations, made a seven-hour speech; and that the  Member

for  Queenstown had beaten him by half an hour. And  he

also said that Krishna Menon was being recalled. But  I

will  say this for Krishna Menon. When he talks, it  is

Krishna Menon who is talking. Everybody knows that.  He

does  not just read his scripts. There is the touch  of

the artist. When the Member for Anson talks, I have  no

doubt  whatsoever that it is the Member for  Anson  who

talks.  Sometimes, to the discomfiture of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  boys,  they keep on asking  him  for  advice.

Because, after all,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



there  are  moments when, in the name of  humanity  and

human beings, he comes right down to the core and says,

"Well,  that is fair. I will vote for it.  I  will  not

condone." And he voted for the motion. He takes no line

from  anybody. We know that. That is why we never blame

him  for the Public Daily-Rated Employees Union strike.

We  knew  he  was  not  involved in  it.  That  is  the

point - the open confrontation. The Member for Queenstown

is  an exponent of democracy as it is understood by the

Barisan  Sosialis. The Member for Farrer Park has  also

learnt  a  little bit from colonial days.  In  fact,  I

think he must be quite experienced by now, having  seen

different  ages come to pass. I can assure  the  Member

for  Queenstown  the moment this debate  is  over,  the

invitation  is  on  the table. He  can  have  his  nine

questions  answered,  and more.  We  also  have  a  few

questions to ask him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, it is futile to have all these long

speeches.  The  Members just read them. These  speeches

just  have no meaning. You give the answer and they  go

home   to  think  of  something  new  and  ask  another

question. So we say, have the questioner there; we give

the  answer, and at the same time we ask the questioner

another question. So we mutually ask questions of  each

other  to elucidate the matter. I can assure the Member

for  Queenstown - he can ask for advice from  the  Member

for  Anson - that  in  the process  of  cross-examination

nothing  is  more serious than to tell a  lie,  because

when  they ask you for one false premise, you are drawn

relentlessly down to an absurd conclusion, and  finally

the  House burst out in laughter. This time the witness

will not be joining in the laughter because it will  be

at  his  expense. Sir, I look forward very  much - and  I

hope too will other Members of this House - to listening

in  to this exciting forum that is to come on the  nine

questions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is now a convenient time to suspend.

explain and to show that every one of the proposals  in

Paper  Cmd.  33  of 1961 is just, fair and  reasonable.

Those  who make fantastic allegations of a sell-out  of

Singapore rights to the Federation of Malaya should  do

well to ask themselves whether the people would believe

that a government which is contemplating a sell-out  of

the  rights of the people would act in the way  we  are

doing.  First, we have published the agreement  between

us and the Federation Government as soon as it is ready

and  before  the Tunku left for London on the  16th  of

November. We wanted to give ample time to everyone  for

a  full  debate on every point. Second, we are  willing

and ready to explain the reasons for every one of these

provisions  to  everybody  and  every  association   of

citizens genuinely interested in and concerned over the

future  of  the  people of Malaya, and  to  give  these

explanations in any language at any convenient time and

place.  I  may  add here, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  the

Chinese  Chamber of Commerce is arranging a meeting  of

representatives of their member associations and  their

guilds   in  order  to  seek  clarification  of  points

connected with education, multi-lingualism, citizenship

and trade. And I will be happy - I have already indicated

that  the  Government is happy -  to attend to  give  all

elucidation  and  answer  all  questions  that  anybody

wishes  to  raise. Sir, I will not be  organising  this

meeting.  It is to be organised by the Chinese  Chamber

of Commerce.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We have asked questions which you

cannot answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point, Sir. These are

so  exciting and interesting that I think they  make  a

good  series  over  the wireless, and  we  are  looking

forward to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Assembly would like it early, you

know.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, I think they should be given

in  time. As I have explained, I am greatly indebted to

the  Member for Anson because I did not understand  why

the  Barisan  Sosialis  moved the  first  limb  of  the

amendment, "genuine merger as a twelfth state", because

they were asking for something which was already in the

proposals. But when the Member for Anson read  out  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech,  then  I  understood

him - whatever we say cannot be done, they then ask  for,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, and they misread this part. So  they

ask  for a twelfth State, not knowing that is what they

are getting, much to their discomfiture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we are prepared to put all or any one of these

proposals before the people for them to decide on. Sir,

let  me  ask  the Barisan Sosialis and their  Communist

mentors:  if there is a sell-out, what is the  sell-out

in return for? What is the price?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To keep you in office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is the price we are accused

of  in  return. This is how this scheme came  about - the

Prime  Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister would  be

resigning  and  a new Prime Minister and  Deputy  Prime

Minister would be installed. They were fully aware that

only  in  May  this year, after Hong  Lim,  the  P.A.P.

Government was quite prepared to resign and return  the

mandate to the people. At that time, Sir, we saw no way

out of the economic, social and political problems;  no

prospect  of merger and no Common Market in sight,  for

without  merger and without a Common Market, we  cannot

resolve these problems. We cannot meet the expectations

of  the people for jobs, houses, welfare benefits,  and

so many of the other wants which they kept on repeating

as  we  went  canvassing in Hong Lim. It just  was  not

possible. "Why have I not got a house?" "Why have I not

got  a flat?" "Why have I not got a job?" There was  no

answer.  The  reason  was that economic  expansion  was

being constricted by competition between Singapore  and

the  Federation for capital development. At that  time,

they - the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



Members now in the Barisan Sosialis -  wanted us to carry

on  in  office. You will recall the Press statement  by

the so-called Left-wing unions - "Duty to the people, and

so  on;  we must carry on." Shortly after Hong Lim,  we

had  a  Party meeting, and they told us, "We must carry

on.  Ignore the people of Hong Lirn. That was  no  real

verdict;  no true expression of the people  who  really

counted."  Moreover,  the  Member  for  Queenstown,  in

particular  my  former  Parliamentary  Secretary   (the

Member  for Upper Serangoon) - the two of them added,  if

Mao  Tse-tung had to stand for election in  China  with

all  the  food  shortage in the communes, Mao  Tse-tung

would lose his deposit. That is the truth; the absolute

and utter truth! That is what they told us.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He is not here to answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You were there too!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Speaker was

there. Will the Prime Minister address the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is a fact. If the Member for

Queenstown  is not very careful, we might  dig  up  the

tape   recorder.  The  meeting  was  held   with   tape

recordings, if he will remember.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Bring it up then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And they all know what was said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Bring it here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We must not do too many things at

one  time,  Sir, because it spoils the  ending.  It  is

difficult.  It is nor as if we went to see  a  Western,

Sir.  Whether or not you could tell in the end how  the

bandit  was  caught by the sheriff, you still  see  the

picture.  But  if  in  a live play,  whilst  it  is  in

progress, you tell how the sheriff in the end is  going

to  catch the bandit, the bandit may be absent! So  let

us  leave it until after the event, Sir, when it is all

over, and we will put it in a sealed envelope and  say,

"There you are. It happened that way."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Parliamentary Secretary urged me not to pay

too  much  attention to these democratic  niceties.  He

said that, after all, what mattered was not whether the

people  thought we were doing good or not, but whether,

in  fact, we were doing good to the people or not, and,

in his view, we were. So we should carry

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have something to fight for, a worthwhile task

to  fulfil  on  behalf of the people of  Singapore,  to

bring  Singapore into reunification with the Federation

of  Malaya  to  a  more stable and prosperous  society,

where  we  see  prospects  of  expanding  our  economy,

creating  more  jobs, more homes, and more  prosperity.

But  when we have this, they want us to resign. Do they

believe  that  the people have such short memories?  Do

they  believe  that the people cannot see  through  the

sudden   twists  and  the  roundabout  turns   of   the

Communists in the Barisan Sosialis?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They will not forget you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You will remember, Sir, that in

September  this  year, the Leader of the  House,  in  a

letter  to  Members who are leaders of  the  Opposition

Parties  in  this House (amongst them  the  Member  for

Queenstown),  asked them to state their Parties'  views

on  merger.  In  his  reply the Member  for  Queenstown

stated  that  Singapore  should  be  merged  with   the

Federation  as  the  twelfth  State,  like  Penang  and

Malacca.  Sir,  I  emphasise the working  words,  "like

Penang  and  Malacca". He wrote them on behalf  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  Yet he is now asking  that,  unlike

Penang  and Malacca, Singapore should not abide by  the

citizenship laws of the Federation of Malaya, but  that

there should be automatic conversion. As the Member for

Anson said - I was not fortunate enough to listen to  him

but  I sought confirmation of it in the reports on  the

following day - the Barisan Sosialis demand for  complete

merger  like Penang and Malacca was a great mistake.  I

venture to suggest that their ghost writers were driven

to  this predicament by their being forced to say  that

they  wanted  complete merger when, in fact,  the  last

thing they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



want  is  merger in any shape or form, until of course,

there  is  a Communist government in the Federation  of

Malaya, or the Communist government in Singapore  could

capture the Federation of Malaya. But having said  that

they  wanted  complete merger, they then - as  the  Tunku

said  in  his  Parliament on the 16th October - "ask  for

impossible  terms" (these were the Tunku's  words),  so

that  merger can be frustrated. And if this demand  for

automatic conversion were unexpectedly agreed to  by  a

generous  Federation  Parliament, then  the  Communists

would  oppose merger on some other ground.  Of  course,

the  trouble is this: it is difficult to get the people

to  oppose merger on the ground that merger is not good

for  the Communists. So they have to get the people  to

oppose  merger  by  falsely alleging  that  the  merger

proposals  are  bad for the people.  These  are  united

front  dialectics.  If you admit  to  the  people  that

merger is bad for the Communists, then the people  will

say, "So what? Is it good for me [the people]?" And you

show  them  that  it is. And they tell the  Communists,

"Well, it is too bad for you. Why be a Communist?" They

understand that, Sir, in the same way as this  4:2  and

3:3  education systems. We did not win the battle.  The

people  did. They were unable to bamboozle  the  people

into believing that the 4:2 system was bad, and so they

failed.  It is too bad for the Communists. Why? Because

they  wanted to create trouble on any issue. The people

did  not  believe it. They lost. Hence, their  constant

search  for  an issue ostensibly unconnected  with  the

Communists round which to rally - it is quite obvious  to

all Members of the House -  the Chinese in particular  to

oppose  merger in any shape or form. This is  the  open

communal  line  the Barisan Sosialis have  taken  since

this Assembly reconvened.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nonsense! That is the P.A.P. line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The questions from the eight of

them:  what were the supplementaries about? People  who

were studiously learning the national language



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



when  they  were  sitting on this  side  of  the  House

suddenly decided to talk in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have ruled that comment of that

nature is out of order because the Standing Orders just

say that any Member may speak in any language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker. But let

me  say that it is because of their open communal  line

that  they have naturally provoked some dangerous  talk

by Malay Assemblymen about bringing out the parang pan

fang  and  the  kris.  Who has provoked  this?  We  the

Government?  Or  the  Barisan  Sosialis  by  their  own

communal  slant? But I say to them that  theirs  is  an

almost   impossible  task.  The  Chinese,  the  Indian-speaking  and  the  English-speaking  sections  of  the

people in Singapore know in their heart of hearts  that

they  do  not  want merger on the basis  of  Penang  or

Malacca.  The reasons are obvious. If those  conditions

apply,  230,000  will  lose  their  citizenship  rights

because   they  cannot  qualify  under  the  Federation

citizenship  laws. Everybody - not just the  230,000 - will

lose  the  present status which he enjoys. Perhaps  the

more   appropriate  word  would  be  "privilege"   - free

competition between all races in the civil service,  in

trade,  commerce, industry, and in nearly all walks  of

life  in Singapore. This is a free area. Seven  out  of

our  nine  Permanent  Secretaries have  come  from  the

Federation.  Three  out of our five local  Judges  have

come  from  the Federation. Seven out of nine Ministers

have  come  from the Federation. Do the Barisan  really

seriously  suggest  that the people  in  Singapore  and

Singapore citizens want to go in on the basis of Penang

and Malacca? Honestly, do they believe it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Member for Queenstown's ghost writers has

referred  to  the  Sinn  Fein movement  in  Ireland.  I

thought  this is for them an unfortunate example.  That

is  the  trouble  with  young and  inexperienced  ghost

writers. It is because there was complete merger at the

beginning between Ireland and England, with no reserved

powers   for  Ireland,  that  the  Sinn  Fein  movement

started.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Under compulsion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am told that when the Member for

Queenstown  spent his years in college, he was  a  good

rugger player, a good chess player, and a good athlete.

He  once  ran the 440 yards and won it. But  I  do  not

think  he  was a good student of history.  He  has  his

facts wrong. He does not understand these things. It is

because   complete  merger  at  present  may  lead   to

unhappiness and a Sinn Fein movement that the Tunku has

agreed  to  give  Singapore  larger  powers  of   local

autonomy,  like Northern Ireland. Had these  powers  of

local  autonomy  been  given to Southern  Ireland, the

history of Eire might well have been different. On  the

other  hand,  the people who want to create  Sinn  Fein

trouble  are  the  Communists in the Barisan  Sosialis.

They  are suggesting that we should hand over education

to  the  Federation Government and implement the Rahman

Talib   Report   in  Singapore, with  all   its   full

consequences  on  Chinese middle  schools  and  Nanyang

University. But while they are publicly saying this  on

the  one hand, their agitators and cadres - I do not mean

the  Barisan  Sosialis;  I mean  the  boys  behind  the

Barisan   Sosialis,  namely,  the  Communists - Communist

agitators  and cadres are mounting trouble  in  Chinese

schools  over  a very simple and innocuous  proposition

that  has  been  agreed to between  school  principals,

management  committees  and  the  Education   Ministry;

namely, that all those who want to take the Government

Upper Secondary II Examination -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order. Sir. What has

that  he  has  said  got to do with  the  amendment  in

question?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This subject has been discussed and

counter  discussed  not only in this particular  motion

but  in  other motions. I take it the Prime Minster  is

mentioning this in passing. If he goes into detail,  of

course, he will be out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I fully understand what a painful

subject  all  this is to the Member for Queenstown,  in

view of the unfortunate sequences of events



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



namely,   that  they  did  not  find  us  a   haphazard

Government  out  of  use  batons  and  policemen.  But,

nevertheless, let me mention the relevance. The  Member

for Queenstown was asking, in his 7�-hour speech, for

complete merger in which education goes to the  Central

Government.  I  am  questioning the sincerity  of  that

because  I have pointed out that the men who manipulate

the  Barisan Sosialis are manipulating these  agitators

in  the Chinese schools. On the one hand, he, on behalf

of  the  Communists, says education goes to the centre.

On   the  other  hand,  while  education  is  still  in

Singapore, they are causing trouble long before it goes

to  the  centre. Does anybody in his right  mind  doubt

what  would  happen if this Government  says  education

goes to the centre, in defiance or in complete oblivion

of  the  wishes,  the feelings and  sentiments  of  the

people?  The  Barisan Sosialis say this. On  the  other

hand,  when there is a meeting of parents, the  Barisan

Sosialis Tampines Committee Member turned up.  I  tried

to  find out whether he has a son. My first information

is  that  the man is not married. Because of the  Tommy

Koh incident, I have asked to make quite sure. Maybe he

has a wife whom we do not know of and has a son whom we

do  not  know of. So we are checking up first. That  is

why  he is mentioning this. It is an unpleasant subject

to  the  Member  for  Queenstown because  truth  is  an

unpleasant  thing  to those who are  hypocritical.  The

simple  proposition - and this is the truth  that  I  am

reciting  now - has been agreed by the school principals,

management committees and the Ministry of Education. It

is not a Government edict, Sir. It is their choice - 4:2.

All  those  who  want  to  take  the  Government  Upper

Secondary  II Examination at the end of six years  must

pass  the  Government Secondary IV at the end  of  four

years. It is a very simple proposition. Before you take

your  M.A., you first get your B.A. Then they  cause  a

boycott because they do not want to take the B.A.  They

just  want  to  take the M.A. Pass  or  fail  does  not

matter! It gets so complicated, Sir, that I do not know

how they argue themselves out of this proposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were in the united front - I do not want to be

immodest  in saying this - at least we kept our arguments

to  reality and logic. We paid some attention to  logic

and  reason and sanity, because we refused to join them

in  anything which was illogical and unreasonable.  But

the  Barisan stars are different. They shoot  off  into

outer  space  like  sputniks, some  of  them  never  to

return!  They  are  trying to get  the  Chinese  middle

schools  and students excited over the proposition,  as

absurd as saying that students should be allowed to  go

to  Nanyang  University before  they  pass  the  Senior

Middle III Examination. But nobody has suggested  that.

Obviously that is absurd. If you do not pass the Senior

Middle  III, how can you go to Nanyang University?  But

they  say,  if  you do not pass the School Certificate,

never  mind,  you  still  go  on  and  take  the  Upper

Secondary III examination.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order. The Prime

Minister  is going into the question of education,  and

you disallowed us a chance to talk on this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I remember the Member for

Serangoon Gardens did endeavour to debate the  4:2  and

3:3  systems. I permitted him to mention the matter  in

passing.  But  I  stopped him when he  was  going  into

details  on  the merits and demerits of these  systems.

But I do not think the Prime Minister has got as far as

that yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to go into details,

partly  because  I  am  not fully acquainted  with  the

details.  We  left  this  to  the  Chinese  educational

experts  to decide. And they decided it this way.  That

is  the  reason  why,  when the students  were  running

around, some of the experts were locked up in the class-rooms  and the principals could not get out. They  were

beleaguered and there was no Assembly to help them  out

with resolutions, sad to say, Sir. The trouble over the

boycott has stopped for the time being. But I say this,

in  connection  not  with Chinese  education  but  with

merger  and the Communist attempt to frustrate  merger,

that we would be unwise to assume that the Communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



have  decided  not to use the students any  more  as  a

source  of  mischief and disorder in their  attempt  to

prevent  merger.  Therefore, I say to this  House  that

when the Government is forbearing to the point of being

accused  of  weakness, let them  remember  that  it  is

always better to be accused of being too tolerant,  too

gentle, than to lend the slightest shred of credence to

the  accusation that we use brutality, like the  Member

for Cairnhill - brutality, atrocity. I saw them, Sir. As

I  said,  they used tear gas - a very foolish thing -  and

batons,  not to beat the students, hut just to disperse

them.  And they came down in marching columns from  the

Chinese  High  School  to  Newton  Circus  singing.   A

memorable  evening!  That day Mr Chew  Swee  Kee  died

politically,  because, to thousands of Chinese  parents

whose  children  were in Chung Cheng and  Chinese  High

Schools  and who did not understand what this  was  all

about,  their innocent children were being flushed  out

in   defence  of  Chinese  culture,  civilisation   and

language.  So  that was what they were  there  for.  In

defence  of  Chinese  culture, civilisation,  language;

Malay  culture, civilisation, language; Indian culture,

civilisation,  language; English  culture  or  English-speaking and so on and so forth!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> P.A.P. culture!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They have no culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That coming from the Member for

Anson,  Sir,  I  feel  a  bit  sorry  because  he  must

understand.  I  am not in a vulnerable position.  I  am

Chinese.  I  could throw myself back as a  Chinese  and

play  the  Chinese line. It is quite  simple.  I  could

survive.  I  have learnt the language a little  bit.  I

will learn more as the years go by.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Getting old.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So says the Member for Queenstown.

But  those who are not, I say it is utter stupidity  to

play  this  line. This is the way to a  red  blood-bath

which  neither  the Communists nor the  Government  can

stop. This is what happened in Ceylon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



- Singhalese  versus Tamils. This is  what  happened  in

India  - Punjabis versus Gujeratis: Punjabi-speaking,

Malayalee-speaking, Andhra-speaking - a  whole  host  of

problems  so  developed.  So let  us  not  start  these

things.  The  attitude of the Government towards  these

matters   must   obviously  be  simple  and   obviously

reasonable.  There is no reason at all  to  be  excited

about  the  future  of Chinese education,  language  or

culture. Education in our merger proposals is a subject

reserved for the State, and there will be the financial

provision  to  make  this  a  reality - genuine  reserved

powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 4:2 system, as I have said, has been agreed

to  between  the principals, management committees  and

the Ministry of Education. It is not our wish to impose

any  change on the Chinese educational system,  or  the

Malay  educational  system or  the  Indian  educational

system,  even if it is a change for the better,  unless

the  Chinese educational world or the Malay educational

world  themselves desire the change. In  this  way,  we

shall watch the Communists run around in vain trying to

find a rallying point in the Chinese schools from which

to mount an assault on the Government



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members of the Barisan Sosialis are keen

bridge players. I am told by the Member for Jalan Besar

that while the Barisan Sosialis were in the doldrums in

the  last  few  months  staying  at  the  Canning  Rise

Assemblymen's Hostel, reading the news of our  progress

towards  merger,  they used to while  away  their  time

playing  bridge, day and night At a later  date,  I  am

told  that  it degenerated into poker, Sir. But  bridge

was  what  they started with - an intellectual exercise,

Sir.  Therefore, I say they will appreciate this little

metaphor.  We will call merger trumps. They  raise  the

bid   on  merger's  trumps.  Our  merger  partner,  the

Federation  Government, raise the bid  higher.  Finally

the  Barisan  Sosialis call a grand slam  for  merger's

trumps.  They  say they want complete  merger  with  no

reserved powers. They want more merger than we do. Sir,

in our hand we hold 7, 8, 9,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



10  cards  of  merger trumps. In the Tunku's  hand,  he

holds  the Ace, Jack, Queen and King of merger  trumps.

Sir,  I  do  not know whether it is because  the  Tunku

holds  the  Queen  and King of merger trumps  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis  have  ill-advisedly  called  him   a

feudalist. But now, the hand will be played out to  its

inexorable  conclusion and a terrifying lot  of  points

will  be  lost in this little round. The folly  of  the

false  and hypocritical proposition that the Communists

want  more merger than the Singapore Government or  the

Federation  Government, or the people of  Singapore  or

the  people of the Federation, will land them  in  more

and  more difficulties until the game is inevitably and

irretrievably lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of ill-considered and ill-conceived remarks

about  the  Tunku  and the citizenship and  nationality

proposals  in this White Paper have been  made  by  the

Communists   through  the  voice  of  the  Member   for

Queenstown in this House. He has two assets, from their

point  of  view,  Sir.  A  strong  voice  and  a  total

disregard  for  reason, logic and good  sense.  He  has

referred  to the citizenship and nationality  proposals

agreed to between the Tunku and his colleagues and  the

Singapore Government as a form of apartheid in which he

wildly   alleges  that  Singapore  citizens   will   be

segregated from Federation citizens. Nothing,  Sir,  is

more  remote from the truth. The Tunku has said,  "More

up  than  down."  We believe it is the other  way.  But

whatever  it  is,  does he believe a  Government  which

allows,  in  constitutional  theory,  the  Member   for

Queenstown to be eligible to be Prime Minister  of  the

whole of the Federation of Malaysia? And he calls  that

apartheid!  Dr  Malan agreed that  the  Cape  coloured

persons  and  the  Zulus can become Prime  Minister  of

South  Africa. And he says that is apartheid! What  are

we  talking about? Sir, he has read too many  different

speeches  written  by  too  many  ghost  writers.   The

arguments  they put forward for him to read  are  often

contradictory.  First, he asked, in  writing  (this  is

very  important, because otherwise, he will say,  "When

did I say these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



things?"),  for  merger  with Singapore  as  a  twelfth

State,  like  Penang and Malacca. Then he rejected  the

conditions  of citizenship which applied in Penang  and

Malacca and wanted automatic conversion even though  he

admitted that the rules for Singapore citizenship  were

quite  different, they being freer and easier than  the

rules for Federation citizenship. Then, in lengthy  and

complicated  arguments, both  he  and  the  Member  for

Thomson -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Obviously you have never studied

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, one of the unfortunate

burdens of office I have to carry is to read studiously

through  a whole host of jargon. I have to read through

it  in  case I find one valuable point which has to  be

answered.  So I studiously read through it. I  am  more

fortunate than you, Mr Speaker, Sir, because I do  not

have  to be here, but you have to be. But, anyway,  you

have  a  wig, so I hope from time to time you are  safe

from some of the more rigorous portions -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You read all that in spite of the

thing causing you -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Queenstown would

like  elucidation. I am sure the Prime  Minister  will

sit down. We cannot have these long interjections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He was never here in the Assembly,

Sir.  All  that  I  have said about  citizenship  never

appeared  in  English newspapers, not even  over  Radio

P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> He reads Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I studiously spent long hours

sweating  it  out with my Chinese teacher, reading  the

Nanyang  Siang  Pau  and the Sin Chew  Jit  Por  which

published  every word of it verbatim. This  led  me  to

believe,  since both these papers had exactly the  same

thing,  word  for  word, character for character,  that

there  was already a prepared Chinese text handed over.

I went through the whole lot. I have to,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



it  is  my duty. Sad to say, I get no special allowance

for all this, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, then in very lengthy and complicated

arguments, he and the Member for Thomson tried to  show

that  even if the rules for Penang and Malacca applied,

nearly  all Singapore citizens would qualify.  That  is

what  the Member for Queenstown said, Sir. And  yet  on

the  20th of October, when I asked him publicly in  the

newspapers to say, since he believed that all Singapore

citizens  would  qualify  under Federation  citizenship

laws, whether he would accept the citizenship laws that

applied in Penang and Malacca. To that letter there was

never a reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There was no reply from Toh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There was no reply -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> From Toh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think he gets confused. I wrote

this  letter and I said, "Since you say everybody  will

qualify,  would you mind saying categorically -  if  you

believe  in your argument that they will all qualify - "I

accept  it" and tell the people? Assure them that  they

will  qualify." I do not tell the people that,  because

calculating the figures in the Federation, I know  that

230,000   would   be  disqualified.  The   Member   for

Queenstown says, "No, they will all qualify." But  when

we  asked them to say in writing, "Yes, we accept  it,"

they  kept  quiet. Sir, instead, he has come back  here

and  repeated the claim for automatic conversion, which

he  knows is completely unacceptable, and he has  tried

to  laugh  off the different residential qualifications

required  by the Federation citizenship laws by  saying

that  only  a  few European civilians and ex-servicemen

would  be  involved. I think I am right in saying  that

because I interjected at that point. I was here then. I

asked  him whether he was aware that a large number  of

Indians,  as  British Commonwealth  citizens - or  rather

Commonwealth citizens (I think the British have decided

to  be more discreet these days) - are allowed to acquire

and  have acquired Singapore citizenship after only two

years' residence -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What place?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Here. Over 50,000 such persons,

the  majority  of whom are Indians, have  qualified  in

this   way   and  would  be  disenfranchised   on   the

residential qualifications alone, if we had  merger  on

the  basis  of  Penang and Malacca.  They  include  the

10,000  City Council Indian workers, and others in  the

Naval  Base, Army, R.E.M.E. Workshops and Air Ministry.

Of this 50,000 the majority are Indians, and only 1,000

or  2,000,  at  the  most 3,000 are Europeans.  And  he

laughed  it off. I think this is food for thought.  Let

me  do  the  computation for him. I think  one  of  his

advisers,   Mr   James   Puthucheary,   is   a    good

statistician. He might confirm this for the Member  for

Queenstown.  I rely on my colleague, the  Minister  for

Finance.   624,000   voters  in  Singapore,   Singapore

citizens - Malay-educated,  approximately  15  per  cent;

English-educated,  approximately 10 per  cent;  Indian-educated,  another 10 per cent. That is  35  per  cent.

They  are  solidly ranged against all these nonsensical

proposals that the Barisan are spouting for. If we take

the  latest figures on the English-educated, every year

since  the last revision it has gone up; it is  now  12

per  cent.  So  it  is  now 37 per  cent.  The  Barisan

Sosialis can be quite sure that they start off with  37

per  cent  saying "No" to them. So you  see,  it  is  a

pretty tough proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said they had 2,000 students attending the

meeting,  mass rally, procession or victory march.  The

Chinese  papers  said 4,000. So let  us  be  fair.  The

Straits  Times said 2,000 but I also read  the  Nanyang

Siang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh and they said 4,000.

4,000  students out of a total of nearly 50,000  middle

school  students. That is a minority  of  8  per  cent,

which,  in this year of excitement, they can  mount  on

the other side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I view the future with a reasonable degree of

equanimity,  provided - this is an important  proviso - we

do  not give any excuse for raising communal fears  and

tensions. I would beseech the Malay Assemblymen in this

House not even unwittingly to help the Barisan in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



playing  this line. It is a natural thing to react  and

talk of parang panjang and the kris, but it is not wise

because  what they say in this House, by  the  time  it

reaches  the coffee-shops (which the Member for  Farrer

Park has talked about) is completely distorted and they

say  that  what  the Member for Geylang Serai  and  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan promised was the kris  and

the  parang  panjang on the day of merger.  A  complete

distortion  would have gone out. Tensions would  mount.

So  I  say  the  less talk of this the better.  If  the

Barisan   want  to  play  this  line,  they  take   the

consequences  upon themselves. I say neither  wittingly

nor unwittingly should we give them any excuse to mount

this. We know the Member for Geylang Serai did not  say

that.  What  he said was, if they persisted  in  saying

this,  then  in the end the result would be the  parang

pan  lang.  A  fair  remark.  The  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan said there was also the kris.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have a volatile situation, Sir. For no rhyme or

reason,  all of a sudden people think that somebody  is

going  to  attack another body, and the whole situation

suddenly gets tense. It is a curious thing that  before

the  ARTIS  case  was  even announced,  half  the  town

already knew of it. Not a word had been uttered; nobody

had  been yet arrested; tension had mounted by word  of

mouth because, on communal issues, you can arouse fears

so quickly and so intensely that it just is not true. I

say, as responsible political leaders, however provoked

we  may  be, let the Barisan alone play this  dangerous

line -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - for anyway, they are in a

dangerous position. God bless them!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I add that any Singapore citizen who goes to

reside in the Federation and would like to give up  his

Singapore  citizenship  and,  together  with  it,   his

special  rights,  State rights in  Singapore,  and  his

education, housing, social welfare benefits and so  on,

can do so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



and  apply for citizenship of the Federation. If he can

pass  the rules for citizenship, including the language

test,  he  can  convert his Singapore citizenship  into

Federation  citizenship. But there are 320,000  present

Singapore  citizens who will be unable, either  because

of   the  residential  qualification  or  the  language

qualification,  to  satisfy the Federation  citizenship

rules. They can travel freely throughout the new Federation  and enjoy equal rights and protection under  the

Constitution  as  nationals of the new Federation  even

though  they do not convert their Singapore citizenship

to  Federation  citizenship because  they  cannot  pass

these tests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a point worthwhile mentioning, not

because the Members concerned are necessarily concerned

only for themselves. This is one of the reasons why the

Communists   lay   such  great  stress   on   automatic

conversion.  By  way of example, Sir, the  Members  for

Queenstown,  Thomson, Pasir Panjang and  Moulmein  were

not  born in Singapore. The Members for Queens-town and

Thomson were born in the Federation, and the other  two

were born in China. Under Penang and Malacca conditions

of merger, they would have to re-apply for registration

as  citizens.  They  know  very  well,  Sir,  that  the

Federation Government does not give citizenship  rights

to  Communists, pro-Communists, or conscious stooges of

the  Communists,  and that if they  are  to  apply  for

registration  as Federal citizens they will  never  get

it.  There are quite a number in this category, and not

just the four hon. Gentlemen I have mentioned. You will

recall, Sir, that one of the demands they made  on  2nd

June for supporting us in the Anson by-election was  to

give citizenship rights to anti-colonialists, like  Mr

Fong  Swee  Suan  and a few others. But  they  did  not

mention   that   these   anti-colonialists   were   not

nationalists  but  Communists,  and  we  did  not  give

citizenship rights to them. They are worried for  these

people.  They  have neither Singapore  citizenship  nor

Federation citizenship, and they are not going  to  get

Federation nationality.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



For  their own selfish interest, to ensure that the few

who have Singapore citizenship can run for election  in

the Federation in case they cannot win in Singapore, or

in  case they have not enough of what they call "kakis"

in the Federation, they have mistakenly first asked for

complete  merger like Penang and Malacca,  not  knowing

that,  in  effect, they were selling out the rights  of

over 230,000 Singapore citizens who would be completely

disenfranchised  by  the  application  of  Penang   and

Malacca conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very few people in Singapore change their

residence to the Federation, and over 99.9 per cent  of

the  people  of  Singapore are not Communists;  and  of

those who move to the Federation nearly all can qualify

under the Federation citizenship laws to vote there for

Federal   State   elections  and   Central   Parliament

elections  if  they  can  satisfy  the  residence   and

language test. But the Communists who apply will not be

given  that  right, and they know that.  Only  they - and

unfortunately  there are many of them  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis - are anxious about the condition that they have

to  register  for Federation citizenship, because  they

know  that  the  Federation Government  will  not  give

citizenship  rights  to  the  Communists  or   pro-Communists or even conscious stooges of Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been told that the term "national of the

new  Federation"  means absolutely  nothing.  You  will

remember  that  the  Member for  Anson  raised  certain

questions arising out of the term "national of the  new

Federation".  I said then that I would  ask  the  State

Advocate-General  to  advise us  on  this  question  of

nationality.  I  have done this and I have  tabled  his

opinion  for the benefit of all Members of this  House.

Sir, one of the advisers of the Member for Queenstown - I

think  he has two in the Party - is only a semi-qualified

person.  He  has only passed certain parts of  the  law

examinations. I do not know It may be. But  if  he  has

such  an  adviser, naturally he came to the  conclusion

that  since there is no such term as "Federal national"

in  the present Constitution, then, therefore, the term

"national"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



means nothing. Sir, this half LL.B. - because he has only

half  an LL.B. - went through this Constitution and said,

"No  'national'. Therefore this means nothing."  Surely

do   they  expect  the  people  to  believe  all  this?

Obviously I do not know, Sir,I was in the chamber  and

explanations  were  going on  between  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  and the Member for Anson. I  think  the

Member  for  Anson  was slightly  unclear  about  these

proposals, probably no doubt through constant  meetings

with the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You are very interested!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> However, Sir, I am glad that the

ignorance  of  the Member for Anson is not  responsible

far the lack of lucidity which is usually very apparent

in his legal arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they believe that all these proposals in Cmd. Paper

33   of   1961,  which  hears  the  signature  of   the

Federation's  Prime Minister, mean  nothing,  that  the

Constitution will remain like this and we just send  up

the  15  representatives voted by us?  The  Member  for

Anson - I quote him as an authority - negotiated the  first

talks  in  Singapore.  He  worked  out  his  heads   of

agreement.  He knew that once they were agreed  to,  it

means that the parliamentary draftsman would step in to

spell  it  out  and  enshrine it in  the  Constitution.

Surely  that  must follow. I repeat once more:  if  for

domestic  and internal purposes, a man wants to  change

his  rights  of  Singapore  citizenship  to  Federation

citizenship  or  vice-versa, be can  do  so  under  the

domestic  or internal State laws of Singapore  and  the

Federation.   But   for  national   and   international

purposes,   it   is   unnecessary,  because   he   will

automatically  become a national of the new  Federation

and whether he changes from Singapore to the Federation

or  vice  versa,  he  is still a national  of  the  new

Federation  with  no right added or subtracted  by  his

conversion.  There  is  nothing  to  support  the  wild

allegation that a Singapore citizen will be  a  second-class citizen or will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



segregated from Federation citizens. It is just one  of

those  Barisan Sosialis lines intended to  confuse  the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to labour the explanations the

State   Advocate-General  has  given  in  his   written

opinion,  but for the purposes of the record,  I  would

like  to refer to them - photo-engraved copies have  been

circulated to all Members of this House - and if there is

any further point that requires elucidation, I am quite

happy to refer the matter to the S.A.G. As I have said,

Lawyer though I may be, it is not my business to be the

Government's  legal  adviser.  On  these  matters   the

Constitution lays down who is to advise the Government,

and if the Government is asked for further elucidation,

either in or outside this Chamber, we shall be only too

happy to ask the S.A.G. to clarify. But I would like to

paraphrase, if I may, because I am told by the Minister

for  Culture that the language used in the  opinion  is

too legalistic and formalistic to be readily understood

by  the  majority of people. I would like to paraphrase

it  in simple language without altering the meaning  or

the  sense  of what the S.A.G. has written.  It  simply

means that the terms "citizen" and "national" have  the

same  meaning. The word "citizen" is usually used  with

reference  to  a  person's domestic or internal  rights

within  a  country and the term "national"  is  usually

used  with reference to a man's international  standing

and  status.  I would like to add that we could  easily

call all present Singapore citizens, together with  the

present  Federation  Citizens,  citizens  of  the   new

Federation  instead of nationals of the new  Federation

without  any  change  in the meaning  or  the  content.

Calling a man a citizen or a national cannot add to  or

subtract  from the rights of citizens or  nationals  of

the  new  Federation by whichever term they are called.

These rights have been agreed to in paragraph 14 of the

White  Paper  and  they will be  so  enshrined  in  the

Constitution of the new Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first merdeka talks in 1956, the Member

for  Anson  secured  the  agreement  of  the  All-Party

Delegation - I am now quoting from Cmd. 31 of 1956.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



Annexure  D - "Heads of agreement between the  Government

of the United Kingdom and the Government of Singapore".

These  provisions  were set out from  the  pen  of  the

Member for Anson arid were agreed to by all members  of

the All-Party Delegation, including myself and Mr Lim

Ching Siong, the then Member for Bukit Timah. Paragraph

8 (7) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That the nationals of Singapore [not the citizens of

Singapore] shall be:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) person born in Singapore before or after the

operative date.'



<br><br>I  do  not want to repeat (b), (c) and (d), but  may  I

point out that they had this proviso:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Provided that nationality acquired under clause (c) or

clause  (d)  or clause (e) may be revoked in accordance

with the law for the time being in force.'



<br><br>That   is  the  only  distinction  between  citizenship

acquired  by descent or birth and citizenship  acquired

by registration or naturalisation. Then in paragraph  9

of   Annexure  D,  the  Member  for  Anson,  with   the

concurrence of all members of the All-Party Delegation,

including  the  Member for Cairnhill,  myself  and  the

former  Member  for Bukit Timah, Mr Lim  Ching  Siong,

agreed:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Independence Bill shall include a

provision  whereby a national of Singapore shall  cease

to  be a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies but

shall be a British subject or Commonwealth citizen, and

the  Singapore  Independence  Order  in  Council  shall

include   a   provision  whereby  a  citizen   of   any

Commonwealth  country  which  recognizes  nationals  of

Singapore as British subjects or Commonwealth  citizens

shall  be recognized in Singapore as a British  subject

or Commonwealth citizen.'



<br><br>Sir, I am not interested in the legal provisions there,

but  the  point is that the term used was "national" - an

orthodox,  classical term. I had not done this  bit  of

research  at the time I answered the Member  for  Anson

when  he asked parliamentary questions. I think he will

now recall that the term "national" was used to mean at

the same time "citizen" - he nods in agreement, and I  am

happy to have that recorded, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The nod?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is an important thing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering how our

reporter will be able to record a nod.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> For that reason, Sir, I have

described  it  as  an  up  and  down  movement  of  the

cerebrum - not  more than 25 degrees. Subsequently,  when

we  came  into  this Chamber in the  last  Assembly  to

implement  these proposals - this was one  of  the  terms

which  were agreed to in the first Constitutional talks

in  1956, not the second one, because we inherited this

from  the  Member for Anson when he led the  first  one

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and when we translated them I did not know why, who or

what,  but  the Member for Cairnhill then as the  Chief

Minister   introduced  a  Citizenship  Bill  presumably

because (I am not giving any secrets away) I think what

happened  was  they  just copied the  Federation  Bill.

Since the Federation called them "citizens", they  just

changed "nationality" to "citizen".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> While we were asking for independence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, not because of independence.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not when I was called the Chief

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I see. I think that is a valid

reason.  It enhances my argument that now that  we  are

going   to  be  independent,  we  will  become  Federal

nationals.  I am indebted to the Member for  Anson  for

having  reinforced  my  point.  When  the  Member   for

Cairnhill changed it to "citizens", nobody said it  was

a  sell-out.  Now  we  change it  back  to  "Federation

nationals", and the Barisan Socialis say it is a  sell-out. Now they have no less a person than the Member for

Anson from whom from time to time I see them soliciting

advice on matters of procedure.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We take advice from the people!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yeah!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is a

very  angry man! I have indicated that if he wishes  to

interject, I am sure the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point which I think I

have  to labour because - the Member for Farrer Park  has

already   drawn  your  attention  to  it - it  is   being

deliberately   misconstrued   outside.   The    Chinese

characters, unfortunately, by translation, have not the

same connotations as the English terms for the word. To

any  English-speaking  man,  particularly  one  who  is

familiar with legal language, one talks of nationality,

never  of citizenship. The first question that is asked

when  you enter any country and immigration forms  have

to  be filled up is. "Nationality?". When you apply for

a  Singapore  passport  or a Federation  passport,  the

question  is  asked, "Nationality?". But  unfortunately

when  it is translated into Chinese, the original, more

commonly used term for "citizen" is translated Kung Min,

meaning   public,  people,  citizen.   And   the   word

"nationality", Kuo Min, meaning country, people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am genuinely grateful to the Member for Anson for

having  been helpful in this matter, in convincing  the

people that the terms "citizen" and "national" mean the

same,  and  that further, in the English language,  the

term   more  commonly  used  is  "national",  and   not

"citizen". This is the problem which has now arisen out

of the interpretation of Kung Min and Kuo Min, and we may

have  to  spend  quite some time and  I  welcome  every

opportunity  we have to do every conceivable  thing  to

explain  to  all  people  that  they  are  not   losing

anything.  They are keeping their Singapore citizenship

and  they  become automatically nationals  of  the  new

Federation. They can vote for their representatives  to

the  Central  Parliament. They have all the  rights  of

nationals, anywhere in Malaya or Malaysia. If they want

to  go  to  the  Federation  and  take  part  in  State

elections there, they can qualify under the State  laws

there or the Federation citizenship laws there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point that must constantly worry the Communist

backroom  boys of the Barisan Sosialis is that whatever

hap, pens, or whichever way you combine and permute the

conditions for merger, after merger security will be in

the hands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



of  a  strong Central Government, and their opportunity

for  subversive activities will be severely  conscribed

and  confined. The Member for Queenstown has, on behalf

of  his Communist friends, denied that they are worried

about this and has claimed that they are quite happy to

go  to gaol. Sir, I know of no sane man being happy  to

go  to gaol, but I know of chaps who are not afraid  to

go  to gaol. I quite believe there are some - I know  of

some in the Barisan Sosialis - who are not afraid. But I

also  know of some who are very afraid. That is another

matter. They say they are not afraid to go to gaol, but

are  happy to go to gaol. Then, on the other hand, they

get  it  in  writing that the only proposal for  merger

which  is  acceptable to the Barisan Sosialis  is  that

which  is  stated  in  writing,  a  confederation  with

internal  security  not in the  hands  of  the  Central

Government. Then they are happy. They do not mind, Sir,

about foreign affairs or defence. Even if you say, "$90

million", they say, "Make it $190 million. Tunku,  take

it.  Provided  I can run around here in  Singapore  and

build  a  little  ant-hill." You  know,  all  the  ants

foregather, and the rain comes and dries up the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if merger means that security has to come under

the control of the Federation Government, I say it does

in  any  government  with a federal  constitution;  any

government they can think of. One of their advisers  is

still  a  student,  half  LL.B.  He  can  look  up  the

Constitutions  of Australia, New Zealand,  Canada,  the

United  States. In a federal constitution, security  is

in  the  hands of the centre, not in the hands  of  the

outer  region,  because if you leave security  ii:  the

hands  of the outer region, then things begin to happen

there.  It is as simple as that. Because of this,  they

ask   for  impossible  conditions,  such  as  automatic

Conversion. They know it is not possible, and they say,

"Ah,  that  is what we must ask for." They misread  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech about  it  not  being

possible  to  do these things as a twelfth  State  like

Penang and Malacca. They suddenly forgot to read, "as a

twelfth State" and they say, "Ah, it is not possible to

be  a twelfth State. Right, ask to be a twelfth State."

But we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



going  to  give it to them - the honour  of  being  the

twelfth  State. Sir, this is their dilemma. In  a  7�-hour  speech - which I do not intend to equal-the  Member

for  Queenstown asked for complete merger as a  twelfth

State.  He  never once mentioned that he is,  in  fact,

asking for education and labour to be controlled by the

Central Federation Government. He knows, and even  more

so  do his backgroom boys, the Communists, Sir. I  mean

the  real ones, not the Member for Queenstown. He  told

me  he  just wanted to make use of them. "Why not  make

use  of  them?" He also told the Minister for Finance.

There  is  proof of that, and that is why he has  never

dared to deny that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Don't twist!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You either say you make use of the

Communists, or you do not say it. If you have said  it,

then  you  have said it. I am quite prepared to  accept

the  Member  for Queenstown's explanation now  that  he

really  did not mean to make use of them, but  what  he

really meant was that he was going to collaborate  with

them.  That  is another matter, Sir. He  can  give  his

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are talking about you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Me? I have no intention of

collaborating with them on a Communist united front. My

intention, Sir, was to collaborate with them on a

genuine nationalist, anti-colonial front against the

British. So long as we were out to down the British,

anybody that said, "I join you to down the British,", I

would say, "Yes." The Tunku surely did not down the

Communists until after he had got independence. He went

to Baling with the Member for Anson, chit-chatted with

Chin Peng, came to know of him, and came back. But he

did not really go for them. When he got in-dependence

and when the issue was not "How do we get rid of the

British?", but "What do we do with Malaya?", then we

parted company. I will not go in to join with them on

abolishing the Internal Security Council, and full

internal self-government which is going to lead to an

independent Singapore. We saw through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



all  that, and we are not that simple. We got  them  to

sign  on  the  dotted  line  when  they  came  out   of

prison - Lim  Ching Siong, Fong Swee Suan, and Sanderason

Woodhull.  And the objective was merger. From  time  to

time,  Sir, we must remind them of this document.  They

always  find these things unpleasant. They  spent  2�

years  of peaceful solitude and concentration and  came

to  the  correct conclusion that merger was inevitable.

Then  they  came  out. Night meetings, too  much  night

life,  and they came to the wrong conclusions - that  the

Internal  Security  Council should be  abolished  as  a

first step to an independent Singapore. What can we do,

Sir?  All I can say is, it is a pity that in the  midst

of  their freedom and all this night life, they did not

betake  themselves to a quiet place  and  think  things

out.  If  only  they had pondered over  some  of  these

things - I  and  my colleague, the Minister for  Finance,

told  Mr James Puthucheary - they would never have  made

the  grievous miscalculations that they had  made.  The

Most Honourable the Earl of Selkirk, U.K. Commissioner.

Things came to such a state, Sir, that in a crisis they

were  more  pally with the U.K. Commissioner than  they

were with us. I said there was something wrong. I could

not  believe  it. At that time I found it difficult  of

explanation.  [Interruption] No. They  happened  to  be

true, unfortunately. But there are certain other things

which  have  transpired and which perhaps they  may  be

able to guess at, but we are not going to tell them  at

this  stage - how  these  things  happen  and  why  they

happen.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You are talking in riddles!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown, by his

interjections,  is  prolonging  the   debate   on   the

amendment.  An interjection of that nature, I  suppose,

would ask for a reply, and I ask the Prime Minister not

to give a solution to that riddle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But I am quite prepared to write

the solution down and hand it to somebody. And when the

solution is already obvious, we can open



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



it and read it, Sir. We knew the answer earlier, Sir.

That is their trouble. But I will say this before we

finish off with the Chinese education problem. They

know that the last thing the Singapore Chinese want is

the Rahman Talib Report to be implemented. There is a

great deal of unhappiness and misunderstanding - some

of it deliberately created, and some of it genuine - over

this. That is the last thing any Singapore government

should do. But they come to this Chamber, demand

complete merger, and say. "Yes, [by implication] let

the Central Government take charge of education." And

these are the same men, in the same breath uttering and

constantly uttering the direst of threats and abuses

against the Rahman Talib Report, both in Singapore and

the Federation. They have only one company. They do not

form a limited company here and a limited company in

the Federation. They have one limited company for the

whole of Malaya and Singapore. They say one thing in

the Federation and another thing in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the purposes of the record, I just want to

read through this, that the Rahman Talib Report means

that Chinese middle schools should teach only for one-third of their school-time in the mother tongue, and

that public government examinations should only be in

Malay and English. These are the very points the

Communists are encouraging people to get excited about

against the Rahman Talib Report. They come into this

House and, through the voice of the Member for

Queenstown, say. "Hand over education to the centre",

in order that there can be real trouble then and merger

can be frustrated. We are not concerned with their

hysterics as they find the net of merger and a solidly

united Malayan nationalist movement relentlessly

closing in on them. The people of Singapore can read,

can understand, and can discuss their rights and their

future for themselves, and decide that the proposals

which we have tabled are fair, just and in their best

interests. The Singapore citizen will keep his

citizenship; he will lose nothing. Instead he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



will get something more - the status of a national of

the new Federation. This status will bring with it all

the rights and privileges written iii the Constitution

of the new Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already explained simply that the only

change which involves all Singapore citizens is a

change for the better. Instead of the words "British

passport" and "British subject" appearing on the

passport carried by the present citizens of Singapore,

there will appear the words "Federation of Malaysia

passport" and "Federation of Malaysia national". Yet to

the jaundiced eye of the Communists, Sir, this is a

retrograde step. They want the Internal Security

Council abolished. They want the British flag still

here. They have come to an agreement with the U.K.

Commissioner to leave the bases alone. They can still

carry British passports. That is anti-colonialism, Sir!

But when we get independence and national status, they

say we are selling out!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are not getting independence!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come, come! I have already

mentioned to the Member for Queenstown the possibility

that if he could come to terms with his friends in

Penang, there is a chance - maybe not for a very long

time. But that is another matter. But from people who

have long powers of endurance, they might survive all

the trials and tribulations, and in the end - they

never know. But I will say this to the Member for

Queenstown. Whatever happens in the end, if they take

the line they are taking now, it is going to do them no

good, Sir, because they cannot win. If winning means

that they win on behalf of the Communists, they just

cannot win. They will not be allowed to win by the very

nature of things. If you want to win, you have to win

on your own behalf as a democrat, whether you are a

Left-wing or a Right-wing. That is another matter. But

be your own separate movement, not an adjunct of the

Communist movement. Do not rely on the strength of the

Communist organisation to provide you with the mass

support. We did not, Sir. People used to say that should

Lim Ching Siong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



get  locked up, the P.A.P. would vanish and melt  away.

We did not. We carried on. People used to say, when the

Member  for  Hong Lim left the P.A.P., that the  masses

would vanish. They did not. 3.000-odd solidly voted  in

Anson  in  spite of the treachery of eight  Assemblymen

who  came  out  on  the eve of the poll  to  shake  the

confidence of the public in the P.A.P. 3,000 -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You did not get in!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, maybe. But we are not

running  away,  Sir. We depend on our  own  stand,  and

further more, -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You lost in Anson on your record.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to belittle the

Member  for  Anson. He won by 500 votes. S.P.A. got  a

thousand votes. We got 3,000 votes. Somebody else got a

hundred  over votes. That does not matter, Sir.  But  I

may  say  this.  In  the  end, and  the  time  is  fast

approaching,  the  line is drawn.  The  P.A.P. is  all

right. Win or lose, we are still all right. That is the

beauty  of  the situation. We have an ensured position.

Heads I win, tails you lose. Anyway, I cannot lose. The

P.A.P. cannot lose.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Go to the election right now!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no, that is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. As I have said, all these

interjections are just prolonging this debate.  Perhaps

the  Prime Minister could carry on with the debate  and

ignore these interjections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have tried to oblige all

Members  of  this Assembly when they seek  elucidation.

However, I will press on as you have suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They prefer full internal self-government, with the

Internal  Security Council abolished,  to  independence

through  merger.  What  kind of people  are  they?  An

average  sensible man asks himself that. They claim  to

be  anti-colonialists, and yet they are suggesting that

we   should  continue  to  use  British  passports,  as

colonial subjects of Britain, in preference



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



to  an  independent  Federation  passport,  as

nationals   of  an  independent  nation.   The   people

understand also that with this national status  go  all

the rights and privileges equal to those of the present

Federation citizens, who will also become nationals  of

the  new Federation. They say this is a sell-out. Sell-out to whom? The British? The Federation? To us? What

are  they  talking about? Can the Member for Queenstown

explain  why,  by his proposals, he prefers  a  British

passport to the Federation of Malaya passport?  He  has

seen it all published in the Chinese Press; he reads it

studiously, like me too. He prefers to carry a  British

passport, and he says he is an anti-colonialist. It  is

a funny kind of anti-colonialism that insists on having

the  colonialists  there all the  time.  When  we  say,

"Look,   shake   them  off.  Let  us   be   independent

nationals." He says, "No." He may not know the  answer.

These are tricky questions for him, because he does not

know  the real answer. The real answer is that  if  you

strike  out the British, then the colonialists are  out

of  the  ring.  Then you have to fight the nationalists

and openly say that you are fighting them. Then you are

in trouble when you fight them. It is one thing dealing

with  a  dying  British regime.  It  is  another  thing

dealing with a virile nationalist regime. Those are the

imponderables which the Member for Queenstown  did  not

calculate  carefully when he made his bid on merger  as

trumps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these proposals are in the interests of the

people. The people will endorse and support what is  in

their interests, whether the Communists like it or not.

After   allowing   ample  time  for   explanation   and

discussion to clarify all aspects of merger, we have no

doubt  that  the terms the people will  decide  on  are

those which are in their best interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been called "desperate men". I, in

particular,  have been likened to Syngman Rhee,  Chiang

Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If I were even remotely like any

one of these three gentlemen, the ghost writers for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Queenstown,  some  of  whom  were  in  the

Assembly -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated that 1

will not allow any direct reference to strangers in the

Gallery.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I want to remind Members of the

nearness  and the reality of the position. If  we  were

remotely  like  any one of these three  gentlemen,  not

only  his  ghost writers, but quite a lot of his  other

chaps  would have been banished painfully, but quietly,

without  a  squeak. This is how those  three  gentlemen

dealt  with their opponents. But we allow them  a  free

debate. We invite them to a radio forum from which they

studiously  run  away.  What kind  of  Wang  Ching-wei,

Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek or Ngo Dinh Diem are we?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The radio is all yours!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We asked them to come, Sir. But

they   would  not.  They  are  shy.  One  of  the  most

remarkable  statements ever made was by the  Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis. He said I hid behind a

microphone. I thought all revolutionaries want to  grab

hold  of the microphone and talk to the people. But  he

said  I hid behind one. I asked him to join me at  one.

He  did not feel at all happy about it. He did not turn

up.  What  kind of Syngman Rhee am I? Did Syngman  Rhee

invite  his  political opponents to join him  in  Radio

Seoul?  No,  Sir. As I have said, we talk  peace, act

peace -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You pose peace.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Act peace. No police, no batons,

no  force. We use arguments, reason and logic. Sir, the

trouble  the  Communists are  in,  I  think,  has  been

inadvertently admitted by Mr Woodhull. Recently in the

Press  I  read  a reprint of what he said  in  a  union

magazine. He said the trouble was that it was easier to

deal  with  reactionaries like the Member for Cairnhill

and  his S.P.A. than with us in the P.A.P. He said this

in  the  C.P.A. Room and I was informed of  it  by  the

Minister  for  Culture. He openly told the  Member  for

Cairnhill That he preferred to deal with him.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He did not pose so well.







<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Ah! He prefers him. I have

confirmation from no less an authority than the  Member

for  Queenstown. He prefers the Member  for  Cairnhill.

Mr Woodhull said, "Strike me! Strike me!" The Minister

for  Culture  said,  "No, no. Why should  we  do  these

things?  So  long  as  you  are  democratic,   we   are

democratic." I will tell them what is the  problem.  We

have  the  advantage of knowing them, and knowing  them

well. We have good reasons to know them well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the old united front days, when we fought the

British  for  the common objective of independence, we

used  to  work  together. We got to  know  their  modus

operandi.  We watched the conjurer from the  backstage,

not  from the front stage, Sir. We took out the top hat

and they slipped in the rabbit, as I have explained. We

pulled the rabbit out - applause from the multitude!  At

other times, Sir, they allowed themselves to be tied up

and locked up and put in a big suitcase. After a decent

interval - two  and a half years - we  unlocked  the

suitcase and they came out free men. But in the process

we  learned how they worked their tricks. We  know  how

the props are used and where they are used. The trouble

with  the  Member for Queenstown is - and this  goes  for

quite a number of his Barisan Sosialis boys who are not

Communists, there are quite a few of them who  are  not

Communists who are running around with them - is that he

has  never had the experience of this gruelling process

of working the united front with the Communists. It may

he  that  one of these days, through lack of experience

and over-excitement, as I have said, instead of pulling

out  a  rabbit,  he will pull out a serpent  which  may

mortally bite him, to the discomfiture of his Communist

props. That is why their ghost writers were watching so

anxiously  in this Chamber when the Member for  Queenstown   was  performing  for  them.  Often  their  faces

betrayed their utter dismay as he bungled the role that

he   was  asked  to  play.  He  read  out  their  lines

correctly,  Sir. But often he got the stage  directions

wrong. For instance, instead of staring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



at us fiercely in the eyes denouncing us as he read his

heavy  lines of abuse and denunciation, written against

us,  he  joined  us  in  mirth  and  merriment  at  the

absurdity  of it all. Here was their great  moment - like

Hamlet,  Sir, "To be or not to be." - And the Member  for

Queenstown  broke into uncontrollable  mirth.  You  can

imagine  the dismay of the directors! They wrote  three

red lines: Look fiercely. Stare them in the eyes -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is where you are wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hamlet broke down and laughed Sir!

It  was  absurd.  But, in fact, he has very  little  to

laugh  about, because there is a fundamental difference

between  the united front we worked together  with  the

Communists  in the years between the formation  of  the

P.A.P. and  the attainment of independence of  Malaya,

and   the  present  united  front  between  some   non-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis and the majority  of

pro-Communists  and  Communists.  Let  me  explain  the

difference to him. In our united front from  the  years

1954   to   1957,  it  was  the  classic  anti-colonial

movement. The enemy was the Right force. The enemy  was

the British. Everybody who was against the British,  be

he a nationalist or a Communist, got together to oppose

the British colonial system. That is the classic united

front.  The  common enemy was the British imperialists.

The  people  of Malaya - nationalists, Communists,  anti-Communists, pro-Communists - sank their differences  and

got together to fight a common enemy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have mentioned just now, even the Tunku did

not  fight  the  Communists until he got  independence.

Then  he  had to fight them, because after Merdeka  the

Communists  wanted to fight on for a Communist  Malaya.

He  did not want a Communist Malaya. That is the point.

If  we  wanted a Communist Singapore, the way to travel

that road is with the Barisan; abolish the I.S.C., next

step  independence,  next step all irretrievably  lost.

Let  me tell the Member for Queenstown, even in his own

selfish  interests, if he travels that  road,  assuming

that that road can succeed, he will not succeed,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



Sir.  Because he cannot control the forces  that

carry him there. But we can. We went with them up to  a

point,  and the point was fight the British. The moment

they  change the enemy and say fight the Tunku, we  say

we  do nothing of the sort. He is a nationalist and  we

are  nationalists. He is Right, we are Left. But on one

thing  we  are agreed - no Communist Malaya.  Therefore,

merger.  I  see  he  is more pensive these  days,  Sir.

[Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. For a moment, I thought the Prime

Minister  was  thinking of the Speaker, because  he  is

supposed to look at the Speaker and not at Members  who

are perhaps weary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely, Sir, maybe it did not soak

into  him so. May I just point out the difference?  The

Barisan Sosialis, on the other hand, have embarked on a

different  proposition. The common enemy is  no  longer

British colonialism. It is the nationalists they intend

to   fight,  not  the  British.  Theirs  is  an   anti-nationalist, not an anti-colonialist united front. When

they  say all progressive forces should unite to  fight

the   reactionary  and  feudalistic   forces   of   the

Federation, what they really mean is that all those  in

favour  of  Communism should combine to down the  Malay

nationalists   who   rally  round  U.M.N.O. and   the

leadership of Tunku Abdul Rahman. Let me tell him where

we  stand.  We  the  non-Communists support  the  Tunku

because   he  represents  the  genuine  will   of   the

nationalists   in  Malaya.  Differences  in   political

policy, political philosophy and economic policy  there

are and always will be between a Party of non-Communist

Socialists - the P.A.P.  - and what the Tunku has called  a

party  of  the Right in U.M.N.O. and Alliance  Parties.

But on the nationalist issue - perhaps I should say on  a

national  issue - of whether we should have a  national

democratic  Malaya or a Communist Malaya,  we  have  no

hesitation  in  declaring which side we  stand  on.  We

stand  on the side of the nationalist Malayans  and  we

will  prevent  the  Communists  from  undermining   our

society and the independence of our country.

and  he knew that. We both went down to Hock Lee to try

and  settle  it. I tried. He tried. We thought  we  had

succeeded. Four days later there were riots because Mr

Fong Swee Suan got the directive not to settle. That is

all. It is as simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I think he agrees with you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Who? Yes, the Member for Anson

nodded in agreement, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me remind the Barisan Sosialis that the united

front  is no longer against the British Raj.  It  is  a

completely  different proposition fighting the  Malayan

nationalists.  He has joined hands with the  Communists

not  to hammer somebody who is dying and on the way out

- British  colonialism and British governors - but  he  is

being  foolhardy enough to try and take on  the  virile

political  forces that Malayan nationalism  represents.

It  is a hazardous gamble that he has embarked on,  and

the  least  that  we can wish him,  Sir,  is  that  his

painful  experience  should  be  over  as  quickly   as

possible.



The Member for Queenstown, and particularly the Member

for Nee Soon, Sir, - he is a more intelligent man -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A Rightist!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - know well the predicament into

which their wrong assumptions have led them. The Member

for Queenstown will recall the earnest conversations he

had  with me and the Minister for Finance in June  this

year during the Anson by-election. He was persuaded  to

believe,  both  by the British and by  the  Communists,

that Mr Lim Chin Siong and his Communist friends would

be  given  the  free run of the place  by  the  British

provided they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



left  the bases alone. This is the important point -

provided  they  left  the bases  alone.  And  you  will

notice,  Sir, through all the ups and downs  about  the

British bases, never once did the Barisan Sosialis say,

"Down  with  the British bases!" Because  they  have  a

little private understanding. Leave the bases alone and

all  will  be  well. And so we became the nationalists.

The  Tunku and I, we say, "Change from sovereign rights

to treaty rights." The Barisan Sosialis say, "No. Carry

on  with internal self government. Sovereign rights  to

the  British.  Carry on with the bases." What  kind  of

united  front  is  this,  combining  with  the  British

against the nationalists?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Who is selling?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Who is selling out whom to whom,

Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In the midst of the crisis, they

sought  solace from the U.K. Commissioner. I say,  Sir,

without the slightest reluctance, that I have misjudged

the quality of the U.K. Commissioner.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what the Prime

Minister is leading up to. But I do not think he should

now  go  into  the  personality of the  United  Kingdom

Commissioner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, I am very fond of

personalities. Mr Speaker, Sir. This is a  role  which

he plays with great -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Elegance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - aplomb. Considerable acumen on

the  part  of the British Government. Not only  did  he

lead  Lim  Ching Siong, S. Woodhull, James  Puthucheary

and  Fong Swee Suan up the garden path - they had  a  tea

party  at  Eden  Hall, Sir. Somebody said  it  was  the

Garden  of  Eden  Hall. You know what  happens  in  the

Garden  of  Eden, Sir. There was the apple and  so  on.

Somebody  said - [Interruption]. Yes. But  whatever

it  was, the result was most unfortunate all round. And

having  done  them  in; having got  this  agreement - you

know.  British bases, do not touch, then  all  will  be

well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



- Mr  Woodhull goes to the Naval Base and says.  "Yes,

we  must have the bases. They look after the rights  of

the 40,000 workers. The bases must be there."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the great anti-colonial fighters. I do

not know how they do these things. But they wound up in

the  end  trying  to  form an alliance  with  the  U.K.

Commissioner  against  the  Tunku  and   me   and   the

nationalists. I do not know how they do this  analysis,

but I can assure the Member for Queenstown - although he

does  not  understand these things - that  his  back-room

boys completely misread and misconstrued the situation.

Hence  they are in serious trouble. I tell  you  why  I

believe  they  not  only misread and  misconstrued  but

arrogantly believed that they were still right after we

had pointed out to them the error of their ways -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Who is arrogant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the trouble, Sir. The

bright chaps in the Barisan Sosialis. We told them that

the  U.K.  Commissioner was taking them for a  ride.  I

think  this  is a necessary bit of explanation  of  the

merger   proposals   and   the   British   bases   why,

fortunately, by this exercise around Eden Hall, we have

had  no  trouble over the bases problem. They  came  to

some  kind of an entente cordiale that the bases should

be left alone. So Mr MacMillan could say to the Tunku,

"Even  the  Communists agree the bases should  be  left

alone.   Why  are  you  troubling  me  about   changing

sovereign  rights  to  treaty rights  and  so  on?  The

extreme  open  front Communist leaders  like  Lim  Chin

Siong  are quite happy with the bases. S. Woodhull,  on

behalf of the Barisan Sosialis, says, "Three cheers for   ..." -





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is the

Prime  Minister still thinking that this place is Radio

Singapore or Radio P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think that is a point of order.

Perhaps it is a point of elucidation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, one of the things the Member

for  Queenstown has to learn is that he has taken on  a

hazardous  role. One of the things that an  open  front

leader  who  is not a Communist has to learn  when  the

Communists  are getting into trouble and he is  getting

into  trouble  with them is to decide,  first,  not  to

betray  the fact that they are in trouble; second,  not

to  betray  the fact that he is in trouble.  He  starts

jumping  around; then people will know that  he  is  in

trouble.   It  is  bad  propaganda.  Obviously.   Radio

Singapore  terrifies  him and he hates  to  hear  these

things. But this is a factual analysis. Mr S. Woodhull

went to the Naval Base in September and said, "Keep the

bases." It was reported in the Press, and was confirmed

by  my friends and the Minister for Labour's friends in

the  Naval Base. So you see, Sir, no trouble about  the

bases.  Instead,  they started trouble  with  something

else.  We then said they were taken for a ride  because

how  could they take power when we were asked  to  deal

with  them?  That  was the contradiction  I  could  not

reconcile.  On the one hand, the Member for  Queenstown

believes  all is well, they can take over,  only  leave

the  bases  alone.  On the other hand, we  were  told,

"Look,  do your duty and stop this running around  like

-"

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to be so crude,

Sir, - gaols and so on - they upset me. I do not think  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - Oxford man, great elegance in

He  reminded  us that it was our duty to  maintain  the

security  position  and drew our attention  to  certain

alarming prospects of the security position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



with   Political  Secretaries  running   around   doing

dangerous  things.  We  told  him  that  all  was  well

provided everybody played their respective roles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was explaining, Sir, we were asked to take on a

role  we  were  not supposed to play.  However,  having

exposed all this, I said, "Look, this cannot be  true."

Then  we  exposed  the plot, Sir,  or  half  the  plot,

because there k a second half which is still to unravel

itself.  They  did not believe it, Sir.  Mr  Lim  Chin

Siong and Mr J. J. Puthucheary turned up at Eden  Hall

again after all this exposure, and shook the Lord Mayor

of  London  by  the hand warmly. I was told  Mr  James

Puthucheary,  most  indiscreet man,  saw  the  Earl  of

Selkirk  and  said, "Ah, Machiavelli,"  and  shook  his

hand. Eight foreign correspondents were present, Sir,I

listened to all this with great astonishment. All  this

was  after  the event. I had explained where they  were

wrong and they were so ignorant and arrogant -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think possibly the Prime Minister is

going  into too great details in these matters. He  can

mention  these instances in passing, but not  too  many

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The point I wanted to make, Sir,

is  this.  We have been accused of being arrogant.  But

when we make a mistake we quickly learn and acknowledge

it.  We  say, "Yes. Sorry we were wrong." But  here  we

pointed  out  the  error of their ways,  and  in  utter

arrogance  they showed their aplomb. They  went  up  to

"Machiavelli" and shook his hand. I cannot  understand,

Sir. And I say I have misjudged the Earl of Selkirk.  I

thought him to be a simple country gentleman, Sir.  But

he is going -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think it is right for

any  Member to ridicule a representative of the  United

Kingdom in Singapore. The Prime Minster is very near to

ridiculing the man.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry I have given you

the  impression that I wanted to ridicule him.  What  I

wanted to convey was - brought up as I am to believe that

all people in tweed suits talk in the intonation of the

English-educated  squire - that  he  was  a  very  simple

straightforward man. I heard him talk  and  I  saw  him

dress - so  elegant and, graceful. I did not  know,  Sir,

that he was an extremely skilful diplomat. This is  the

bouquet I want to hand him today, that not only he  had

done  them  in, but he had got them to shake  his  hand

after that. I say that you really delivered the coup de

grace and the man said 'Thank you' to you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this major error of judgment stems a whole

host   of   terrible  consequences.  After  the   joint

statement on the establishment of Malaysia by the Prime

Ministers  of the United Kingdom and of the  Federation

of  Malaya,  any faint hope there may have  been  of  a

Communist  assumption of power by  the-manipulation  of

open  lawful  parties, like the Barisan  Sosialis,  has

disappeared.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Leader of the House

has a business motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on items I and 3 on the Order

Paper be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order

Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I was wondering whether we could

debate that motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is Standing Order No 4(1):



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A motion may be made, without notice, by a Minister,

at the commencement of public business or at any time

between 7 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. to be decided without

amendment or debate, to the effect either [this is the

first alternative]-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the proceedings on any specified business be

exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of

Standing Order No. 1.'.



<br><br>So there is no debate and there is no amendment, but

just a vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, could I ask whether you would agree

to a ten-minute adjournment so that this matter could

be discussed? It has been sprung on us by surprise.

another midnight to 4 a.m. debate at this stage - sprung

as it is by surprise - is not fair.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that is in order at

all. Under the Standing Orders, the motion has been

properly moved and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes. Could you explain what this is

all about?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The position now is that the debate on

the amendment as shown in item I will be proceeded with

to its conclusion. After the amendment has been

disposed of, we will go back to the main motion in item

1. It has already been agreed that the debate on the

main motion in item I would cover the contents of the

motion standing in the name of the Prime Minister, that

is, his motion in regard to the White Paper on the

reunification of Singapore and the Federation, as well

as the contents of the amendment to the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's speech which deals with the question of

merger - that is, the amendment standing in the name of

the Member for Queenstown - as well as that part of the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech dealing with merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I add that Members are

aware that at 2.30 p.m. tomorrow the debate on the

Budget Statement must commence. There are so many items

that we will have to go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



through after the Budget session is over that we shall

run very close to Christmas before we are finished. We

have tried to get a Saturday and a Sunday sittings.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Prime Minister

should invite a debate now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

Paper be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order

No. 1.

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>7.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, from the Communist point of

view, whatever happens now, they are in trouble. At one

time, they hoped that if the P.A.P. could be voted  out

of  office,  there  could be general  elections  and  a

confused  situation  created.  As  a  result  of   such

confusion, even if they could not win the elections, no

coherent and strong government would emerge, and merger

would  be  thwarted for the time being. Their back-room

dialectical analysts must be naive if they believe this

any  more. In the light of events since the publication

of  Cmd.  Paper  33  of 1961 - in particular,  the  joint

statement   of   the   Malayan   and   British    Prime

Ministers - all prudent and wise men can see the shape of

things  to  come.  Whatever  the  alterations  in   the

constellation, I do not see the red star of the Barisan

Sosialis in the ascendant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting of the Sembawang Branch of the Barisan

Sosialis on 27th October, Mr Woodhull stated that  the

P.A.P. had only another two years to go. After that, he

believed that the Barisan Sosialis would deal with  us.

Sir, I have a premonition that long before Mr Woodhull

reaches  the  time when he can vent his frustration  on

the  people  who obtained his release from  prison,  he

might well be in a predicament worse than he was before

5th June, 1959, when he was released on our insistence.

As  the  Minister for Finance has said, in  a  zugzwang

situation in chess, any move



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



the  Member  for  Queenstown makes  still  leads  to  a

checkmate. There are three forces that could  checkmate

the  pro-Communist groups, the Barisan Sosialis,  Party

Ra'ayat,   the  Communist-controlled  union  like   the

General  Employees Union, the student  clubs,  the  old

boys'  associations  and  the cultural  bodies.  First,

there  is  the  castle representing the forces  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya. Second,  there  is  the  bishop

representing the forces of the British Government.  And

third,    the   knight   representing   the   Singapore

Government. What the bishop wants to do is to  get  the

knight  to  do  the  checkmate,  but  as  in  Alice  in

Wonderland, the pieces on the chess-board move of their

own  volition, and the knight is unwilling  to  do  the

checkmate, because either the castle or the bishop  can

more  quickly and decisively settle the game. The  time

is  fast  approaching for those who in July decided  to

take  the  Communist  bandwagon shortcut  to  fame  and

glory,  to  show how well they can take it.  Those  who

cannot  take  it, Sir, may find the next 18  months  to

June 1963 a long and harrowing process.

be left out."

standing  in  the  name of the Member for Queenstown,

which reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"at end, to add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'but regrets that the Government is pursuing

a  "merger"  policy of unequal rights contrary  to  the

interests  of  the  people of the two territories,  and

urges  the  Government to re-orientate  its  policy  in

conformity  with the ardent desires of the  people  for

genuine unification'."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Farrer Park has indicated that he

will  be  moving  an amendment to the Prime  Minister's

motion. It might be convenient if he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



makes  his  speech  now  and moves  his  amendment.  The

suggestion  I  will make then is that the debate  should

also  range  over  the hon. Member's amendment.  So  the

effect  will  be that all Members will have  one  speech

until  the  very  end, when the Hon, the  Minister  for

Labour  who moved the original motion will be given  an

opportunity  to reply. I trust that is clear - one  speech

for  all Members except the Minister for Labour who will

be  given an opportunity to reply. Also, the Member  for

Queenstown will not be able to speak any longer -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank God!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> - on these motions because he did speak

on  all  aspects of the three motions when he  made  his

speech.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

But  this  is  a  new  amendment.  I  understand  a  new

amendment is coming up.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. When the Member for Farrer Park

moves  his amendment, I think I will permit the  Member

for Queenstown to make his comments, but strictly on the

amendment,  because  he  has  had  his  opportunity   of

speaking  to the three motions which are now before  the

House.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  When the Leader of the  House,  without

consulting  other Opposition leaders, moved this  motion

of his, he mentioned items 1 and 3, but not 5.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is, only procedural, because it has

already  been agreed that the debate should  range  over

items 1, 3, :and that aspect of merger contained in item

5.  Of  course, at the end of the debate, votes will  be

taken  only on items 1 and 3. The vote on the  amendment

by   the  Member  for  Queenstown  will  only  be  taken

simpliciter;  then  the motion on  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech  which  has been  moved  by  the  Prime

Minister. That arrangement, I think, was arrived  at  by

consent of the House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of further clarification from

you,  Sir. What about the non-merger part of the  motion

in item 5?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That will be entered upon when the motion

is  moved. The motion on item 5 will not be moved today.

There  will  be no vote on item 5. I trust I  have  made

myself clear. The motion on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech will be moved on some other day. There will be no

debate  today  on  other parts of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's speech which do not touch on merger. It is only

the  merger part which will be debated today.  I  trust

that is clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which the Clerk has reminded me

of,  that the question on the amendment which the Member

for  Farrer Park proposes to move will not be put by  me

until  item 3 is formally proposed to the House  by  the

Prime  Minister at the end of the debate. It is  just  a

procedural formality.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can you please

let  us  know  further? You do realise that tomorrow  we

have  a  debate coming on, and if we carry on  too  late

today, what happens? We cannot even go home to rest  and

sleep and wake up tomorrow!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is completely out of my hands. I

myself  will have to come at half-past two. This is  not

the making of the Chair. It is done -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> By the Leader of the House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> - correctly under the Standing Orders.

If  Opposition Members have not been consulted, that  is

no concern of mine. [Interruption]. Order.



<br><br>7.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion in itself,

standing  in  the name of the Minister for  Labour,  is

actually what all the political Parties in Singapore are

committed to. But we have had a lengthy debate over  the

last  10 to 12 days on that, and the amendment to  that,

merely because, in my view, the problem had not been put

in its proper perspective. Because of that, an amendment

had been moved and, in our view, moved not bona fide but

with  a  political intent, in the sense that the  Member

for  Anson  had used the word "political", and therefore

we opposed the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we on the Front benches on the

Opposition  feel that the ultimate goal is  a  complete

merger.  I  use the word "complete", Mr Speaker,  Sir,

because  the  word  "merger"  in  itself  should   mean

"complete  merger". But there has been such  a  lot  of

confusion over the use of the words "complete  merger",

"partial  merger",  "P.A.P. merger",  "phoney  merger",

"genuine merger", that the word "merger" has become  so

confused that it has taken on a peculiar meaning of its

own  over  the last 12 days, so that I think  we  might

speak  of  "complete merger' in the sense of a complete

integration of Singapore with the Federation, as in the

sense  that  Johore or Perak or Selangor is  integrated

with the Federation. It is in that sense that "complete

merger" will be used by me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the position is that all the

political  Parties are committed to ultimate merger  or

complete  merger, or whatever you may like to call  it,

then  the question arises: what is the opportune moment

to  bring  about  such  a  merger?  That  would  depend

entirely  upon  the  Government of  Singapore  and  the

Government  of the Federation. If both Governments  are

agreed  that  there should be a complete  merger,  then

complete merger will take place.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> But if both Governments do not agree upon a

complete merger do we then say, "Let the time come, let

the  opportunity  arise  when complete  merger  can  be

effected." Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it would be

wrong if both the Governments took that line, because I

feel  that the longer the situation is kept  as  it  is

today,  the  longer the time it takes  for  a  complete

merger  to  be  effected, the more difficult  will  the

situation become. It could well be, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, that if we do not take some sort of action at  the

moment  it would be possible that during the next  five

or  ten  years, even any sort of association  with  the

Federation might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



become  difficult, if not impossible.  It  is  on  that

basis,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, that I welcome  the  White

Paper  on  the  reunification  of  Singapore  and   the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make this point very clear. In my opinion, the proposals before the House are not a merger in the sense that I have thought

merger  was. The Prime Minister has mentioned that  the

word "merger" could mean this. If he says it means that

to  him, it is not for me to deny it. But to me, and to

quite  a lot of people in Singapore, merger means quite

a  different thing. May I respectfully suggest  to  the

Prime  Minister  that,  in so far  as  this  particular

problem is concerned, it is not what the Prime Minister

himself  feels  what merger is but what the  people  of

Singapore  feel  what  merger is  that  really  is  the

problem?   Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  to  the   people   of

Singapore, merger means Singapore coming together  with

the  Federation  of  Malaya in the sense  that  Johore,

Selangor   and  Perak  are  merged  in  and  with   the

Federation.  Although  the policy  of  the  S.P.A. was

ultimately committed to merger, the S.P.A. felt that in

the  present  context of Singapore and in  the  present

context of feelings in the Federation, a merger was not

possible.   Therefore,  we  propounded  the   political

philosophy  that,  for the moment, the  most  desirable

objective  for Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya

was  to  come  together in some  sort  of  a  political

association. We call this a confederation  under  which

Singapore citizens would remain Singapore citizens  and

Federal   citizens   would  remain  Federal   citizens.

Singapore  would  voluntarily  give  up  some  of   its

sovereignty  to the Federal Parliament. On that  basis,

we  run a confederation Government, with local autonomy

in  all matters of which the Singapore Government  felt

it  should  retain  control.  In  that  connection,  we

welcome  the  inclusion of the Bornean  territories  in

this  confederation, in order to make it not  only  one

political unit but also a larger economic unit  within'

which this confederation could work and survive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposition of the Government set Out in its White

Paper,  Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest, is not a merger,

nor  is  it, in my opinion, a confederation.  It  is  a

mixture  of  the  two. But I think it does  not  really

matter whether it is a merger, a confederation of  what

sort of political title one can give to this particular

White Paper. But the point is that it has been possible

for   the   Federation  Government  and  the  Singapore

Government to come to some agreement which is a working

possibility   and  which  will,  at  the   moment,   be

acceptable  to the people of the Federation  of  Malaya

and,  I  think,  to a large majority of the  people  in

Singapore.  On that basis, we welcome the  White  Paper

proposals. I do not wish to enlarge on the contents  of

the  White  Paper. I think the contents  of  the  White

Paper - all  the  emotional aspects of  it  and  all  the

aspects  to which there was opposition from the Barisan

Sosialis - have been adequately dealt with in connection

with  the amendment which we have been discussing  over

the last 10 or 12 days. Therefore, I do not propose  to

deal with that matter in great detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emotional aspect of citizenship, namely, whether a

Singapore citizen is a first-class citizen or a second-class  citizen and whether a Singapore citizen  equates

to  a  Federal  citizen, has been, I think,  adequately

dealt  with.  The Hon. the Prime Minister has  supplied

all the answers, which I think should alleviate all the

fears  on  that aspect. Therefore, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  I  do  not  propose personally to dwell  on  the

contents of the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to put this debate in proper focus, I said, when I was speaking on the amendment, that I would move an amendment to item 3.

The  amendment would merely mean that the  White  Paper

proposals were "an immediate practical step towards the

ideal goal of complete merger". I think the Parties  in

Singapore - and   by   Parties  I  mean   the   political

Parties - are  committed to complete  merger.  There  has

been  no dispute in this House on that. In my own view,

the  White  Paper that is now being placed  before  the

House is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



practical  proposition. As an immediate practical  step

towards  the ideal goal of complete merger,  I  welcome

the White Paper proposals. It is on that basis that  we

have  objected  to  the amendment  of  the  Member  for

Queenstown  and  that we now support the  main  motion,

together  with  all the allied motions  which  are  now

being discussed by this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to take up much

time  moving this amendment. We have a very  heavy  day

ahead tomorrow, and I do not wish to speak very much. I

think  Members  opposite  the  Opposition  benches  and

behind  the Front bench Opposition would like to  speak

more  about  this  and get further  clarification.  For

myself,  I  feel that the question of a  grant  of  $90

million, which was troubling the Member for Anson,  has

been  adequately discussed. So far as I was  concerned,

Mr Deputy Speaker, I had no qualms about that, because

I knew that under these arrangements, certain Singapore

services  would become Federal services. It  is  hardly

right  that the Federation was going to pay  for  these

services out of its own Budget. It must come out of the

Singapore Budget. Therefore, it is necessary, from  the

budgetary  point  of view, that monies  from  Singapore

should be transferred to the Federal budget in order to

cover  the Federal services. As to the balance  of  the

$12  million, the Prime Minister has said  that  it  is

possibly for the defence of the country, which, at  the

moment, is undertaken by Great Britain without cost  to

Singapore. Therefore, I think the two points which were

worrying  the  House, or some part of  the  House - i.e.,

citizenship and the $90 million grant being made by the

Singapore  Government to the Federation Government - have

been  adequately  answered. So, Mr Deputy  Speaker,  I

will  not take up very much more the time of the  House

except formally to move the amendment to item 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After "That" in line I to insert the words "as an

immediate  practical step towards  the  ideal  goal  of

complete merger".



<br><br>I  have here typed copies of the amendment which I  now

hand to the Clerk.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of amendment handed in to the Clerk.



<br><br>7.58 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I have indicated, the question on the

amendment moved by the Member for Farrer Park will  not

now be proposed by the Chair. Firstly, it could not  be

proposed  by  the Chair because the main motion  [i.e.,

item  3]  has  not yet been moved. Secondly,  the  idea

behind  Members  being  given an  indication  what  the

amendment  is to enable them from now on to debate  the

implications of that amendment, so that at the  end  of

the debate, I shall take, firstly, the vote on item  1;

secondly,  I will call upon the Prime Minister  or  any

Minister to move the motion shown in item 3. When  that

is   moved  simpliciter,  I  shall  put  the  amendment

simpliciter  to  the  House  for  a  vote.  After   the

amendment  has been disposed of, I shall put the  Prime

Minister's motion, as amended, as the case may  be,  to

the  House  simpliciter for a vote. That  is  when  the

proceedings  will end. There will be no vote  today  on

item 5. I trust that is clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I had better explain a little further. The

Deputy Speaker has drawn my attention to the fact  that

perhaps Members do not appreciate that the debate  from

now on must be on merger, but other than the aspect  of

merger which has already been debated, by reason of the

amendment  which  has  been moved  by  the  Member  for

Queenstown  to item 1, and which has now been  disposed

of.  There  must not be any repetition of the arguments

which  have  already been advanced on the questions  of

merger  and  citizens  automatically  becoming  Federal

citizens on Merger Day. I trust that is clear.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I wish to express regret for the  motion

moved  by  the Minister for Labour. I think the  P.A.P.

will not have moved this motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



if it has not lost its faith in the future. It wants to

trap the people. It has been inconsistent. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have reason to say that the P.A.P. Government is

not  tabling this motion for its prestige but that  it

has   other   motives.  This  is  because  the   P.A.P.

Government has been arrogant in its attitude. It  often

says  that its Party leaders are the most clever people

in the world. They have not consulted the people on any

big question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of merger between Singapore

and the Federation, the P.A.P. has boasted about it. We

always hear the Government say that the P.A.P. has full

authority  to  deal  with  the  merger  question.   The

Government has always been saying that it has a mandate

for  merger from the people in the general election  of

1959.  In fact, the merger which was supported  by  the

people  in 1959 is not the same as the one now proposed

by the Government. The Government says that it has full

authority  to deal with the merger question.  Then  why

does  it want our support? Perhaps it has realised that

its merger is a phoney merger, and one that is intended

to sell out the interests of the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have had quite enough

of  the allegation that this is a sell-out merger or  a

phoney  merger. We have dealt with that.  If  the  hon.

Member wishes just to say that in passing, well, say it

in passing, but do not go into further details.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my

intention  in  saying it is to prove  that  the  motion

proposed by the Government is superfluous. The

P.A.P. Government tries to place the responsibility  on

this  House.  It wants to stifle the people  before  it

does these things. Then it can have the excuse that the

House have supported its motion.

That is its motive for tabling the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that I am duty bound to

advise  the Government that if it realises the mistakes

it  has made, then it should rectify them. The Chairman

of  our Party, the Barisan Sosialis, has said that  the

Government should realise its mistakes and mend its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



ways.  In  short,  my colleagues and I  cannot  support

these  weak principles of merger. The Chairman  of  our

Party  has  also said that we must judge the Government

by its acts and not by its words. Mr Speaker, Sir, the

P.A.P. has been in power for two years, but what it has

done has disappointed us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the freedom-loving

people  of  Singapore have their own correct  stand  on

merger.  This motion is intended to lay down a trap  on

our way to merger. It is an obstacle in our way to true

merger.  That  is  why I regret that the  Minister  for

Labour  should have tabled this motion.  The  P.A.P. has

raised  this  motion because it has lost faith  in  its

future. The discontentment of the people has spread all

over  Singapore. Because of this, the P.A.P. Government

has  come to the House asking for support of its merger

proposals. Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel it is not right for

the  Government to use undemocratic methods to try  and

maintain its position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order. Let us get

down  to  the motion. This has got nothing to  do  with

merger at all. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. What the hon. Member for Stamford

has,  in fact, indicated is that the motion as a motion

is  unnecessary, and therefore she is speaking  against

it on those lines.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The duty of a

government is to protect the lives and interests of the

people  and  to  see  that the country  progresses  and

advances,  and  not  to  safeguard  the  interests  and

positions  of  a  few  people, if  our  Government  can

neither  protect the interests of the  masses  nor  see

that  the  country  progresses and prospers,  but  just

looks after the interests of a few people, then it  has

no  right  to continue governing the country.  It  must

resign. It must not try to evade its responsibility.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for

Finance  can  speak later on. If the P.A.P.  Government

tries  to play about with this disreputable thing,  and

it  is  incapable of working for the interests  of  the

people, then it must resign -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have allowed the Member for

Stamford to go on for quite some time on matters  which

perhaps  are  a  bit far away from the motion.  I  have

always allowed exordiums, but they must come to an  end

sometime.  Now  I ask the Member to come  back  to  the

motion we are debating.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

abide  by  your  ruling.  I  only  want  to  show   the

insincerity  of  the P.A.P. in tabling this  motion.  I

have  said earlier that it wants to lay down a trap  on

the  path to true merger. If there is nothing else  the

P.A.P. can  do except to play about with  this  phoney

merger, then it should resign and come back to face the

people.  Let  this question be decided  by  the  people

- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are having a battle of the

female  sex  again! May I remind the  hon.  Member  for

Stamford that we have had this argument earlier on when

we  were debating the amendment? So let us try to  keep

away from the same arguments as far as possible.

In  fact,  if the same arguments are advanced,  then  I

must stop them.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged. Mr Speaker, Sir, is

it  permissible  in the midst of a Member's  speech  to

move  a  motion  under certain orders of  the  Standing

Orders? I have in mind Standing Order No. 24.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, I do not think a motion that the

speaking  from  recollection - at the end of  any  speech

that is being made.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  you  have ruled that the Member for Stamford  was

pursuing a line of argument that is not related to  the

debate.  In  her  last five or six sentences,  she  was

still  pursuing that same line. Mr Speaker, Sir,  time

is  short,  we  do not want to carry on  till  tomorrow

morning - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - but if the Member for Stamford

persists  in reading from a text prepared by her  ghost

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is an opinion which the hon. Member,

perhaps,  holds very dear to her heart, but  I  do  not

think we can allow that trend of argument to develop in

this  particular debate. When we debate the Budget  and

during the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



days  that  are before us when we debate the Estimates,

she  will  have  an opportunity to attack  Ministry  by

Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Then I will leave

this  to the debate on the Budget. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

have  the  impression  that because  of  our  different

stands,  therefore,  we  have different  outlooks  too.

Whatever  we do or say must be different too. An  anti-people Party is different from a Party which works  for

the interests of the people -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Could the hon. Member reserve all

those  comments until such time as is convenient during

the   Budget  debate,  because  those  convenient  have

nothing  to  do  with merger? The fact  that  the  hon.

Member thinks that the Party in power should not govern

and  should  resign I do not think arises now  on  this

particular  motion, which is on merger and,  allied  to

that, on the White Paper giving details of the proposed

merger.  Those are the two items we should debate,  not

whether the Government is a good government or, a  bad

government.  Of  course, the hon. Member  may  say  the

Government  is a bad government. But that is  all.  She

should  not  now  debate as to why the Government,  she

thinks, is a bad government.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  there  had been no interjections, then I would  not

have taken very long to deliver my speech. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think that the proposition made by  the  Prime

Minister  that external affairs, defence  and  internal

security be vested in the Federation Government,  while

Singapore have autonomy in education and labour,  is  a

deception.  It  is  meant to deceive  the  people.  The

autonomy is a sham -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. Sir, the hon. Member was

suggesting  that  the Prime Minister  is  cheating  the

people.  Is  this parliamentary language, Mr  Speaker,

Sir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I heard the word "deceive". It

was  interpreted  as "deceive". I should  imagine  that

that word has been used time and again in this Assembly

from both sides, and I have come to the conclusion that

it is an attribute of a politician to deceive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Wasting Government money!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think we have a translator who is

versed in parliamentary language in his box upstairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> So your Chinese is not up to

standard?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Lady has been misinterpreted,

I am sure she will be the first one to say she has been

misinterpreted. She may not be satisfied with the  word

"deceive".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister can

wait for his turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  know  that  without any political right,  then  any

safeguard is not guaranteed. For example, the strike at

Robinson's. The Government, on a political pretext -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have not got it yet, Mr Minister.

[Laughter]  Order. I think the Hon, the  Minister  must

not be in a hurry when the speech is being interpreted.

I  myself  do not know what has been said. Perhaps  the

hon.  Member  would like to repeat  that  part  of  her

speech?



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

was  saying that the proposition by the Prime  Minister

that  after  merger,  defence,  external  affairs   and

internal  security  will  be  in  the  hands   of   the

Federation  Government, while the Singapore  Government

will  have  autonomy in labour and  education,  is  not

safe.  If we do not have a political safeguard, I think

any  autonomy  will be useless. For example,  not  long

ago, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



the  strike  at  Robinson's, the  Government  used  the

police -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Lady is

right  now in going into a completely different matter.

She  should not go into details like that. If  I  allow

that,  then there will be a debate whether that  strike

was  legal,  whether the use of force by the Government

was  correct or not. I do not think we ought to go into

those  details. Let us come back to the pure and simple

proposition   that  there  should  be  merger   between

Singapore  and  the  Federation, and  that  the  merger

should  be as shown in the White Paper. That is all  we

are debating now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point or order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

order.  We want to get through this business as quickly

as  possible. There is a lot of work tomorrow, but  the

Barisan have come -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My point is this, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Where people are reading a prepared text and where they

are -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not going to allow that

interjection as a point of order at all. I do not think

it  is fair to say that the Member for Stamford has, in

fact,  been reading, because prepared texts have always

been placed on the Table and on the ledges in all parts

of  this  House. Let the hon. Lady continue her speech.

If  she is wandering too far away, I think the Minister

could trust the Chair to bring her back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order again?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order. As the hon.

Lady  is speaking on the opposite side, we do not  wish

to  interrupt.  In  fact, I think we  should  encourage

ladies in this House to talk -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another hon. Member:</b> Go on!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But perhaps Members of the House -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could I have the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes. Could I draw attention to our

Standing Order No. 54, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn

attention to the conduct of a Member, who persists in

irrelevance ...' -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Are you the Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - 'or tedious repetition either of

his own arguments or of the arguments used by other

Members in debate, may direct him to discontinue his

speech.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Speaker knows that Standing

Order perhaps better than the Leader of the House -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> - and I think he can rely on the Speaker

to exercise his authority if he thinks it is the proper

thing to do.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in this way the Government can make use of political excuses to use the police to deal with strikers and

deprive the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not like to interrupt

Members,  especially Lady Members, but I  have  already

indicated  that  we must not go into  details  of  this

nature  in this particular debate, when we are  dealing

with two points - one is merger and the other is the type

of  merger as shown in the White Paper. Those  are  the

only  two points. If the hon. Lady has anything to  say

about the conduct of the Government in using the police

against the strike, the opportunity will present itself

when  we come to debate the Estimates under the heading

of Police.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this has something to do with the merger proposed by

the Government in the White Paper. Although we have

autonomy in labour and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



education,  we  say that this type  of  autonomy  is  a

deception,    because   without   political    backing,

everything is deceit. What I want to say is very short.

I want to illustrate and explain that if the Government

says that employees and strikers are made use of by the

Communists  and  they can be arrested, therefore,  this

type of autonomy is not reliable. Therefore, I say this

merger  is phoney and deceives the people. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since I cannot talk in great detail, my criticism

on autonomy in labour and education ends here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that autonomy in education is also

not  true  at  all. If they say that  the  schools  are

controlled  by  Communists  or  that  there  are   pro-Communists  in  the  schools, then the  Government  can

close  them. This is a political question. At the  same

time,  they can point out which teacher is a  Communist

agent  or  a  pro-Communist and arrest him.  Therefore,

autonomy  in  education  is not  reliable.  I  want  to

illustrate this with an example. Autonomy in labour and

education is just like fishing by the sea-side. If  the

fish  are attracted by the worm and they take  a  bite,

they are hooked. If the people of Singapore are treated

as fish by the Singapore Government and they think that

autonomy  in labour and education is good,  then  I  am

afraid that the P.A.P. proposals on merger are a  bait.

But  I believe the people are very clear in their minds

and they will not fall into the trap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to a speech

made  by  the  Prime Minister to show  that  we  cannot

support   the  P.A.P. type  of  merger.  In  a   Press

conference, he referred to our powers and rights  after

merger.  This  has convinced us more not to  trust  the

P.A.P. type  of merger. On 12th November a publication

appeared  in  the Sin Chew Jit Poh: to the effect  that

the Prime Minister stated that Singapore citizens enjoy

privileges  in  Singapore and that Federation  citizens

enjoy privileges in the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If I allow the Member to carry on

in  this strain, we are going right back to the  debate

on  citizenship. I think we have had a  great  deal  of

argument for and against Singapore citizenship, Federal

citizenship and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



citizens  automatically becoming Federal  citizens.  So

this  line  of argument is repeating an argument  which

has  been  advanced, I think - I cannot remember  exactly

which day it was - about eight days ago.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the difficulty now is this. We feel that it is a phoney

merger, but they say that it is a true merger.  I  want

to  prove that it is a phoney merger. Therefore, I must

quote some examples to prove that. But since you do not

permit me to quote an example, I will not say any more.

I have some opinion on this type of merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the hon. Member does not

think  I am stopping her unnecessarily. We have already

debated  a merger as against a genuine merger. I  think

there  have  been  many speeches from  Members  of  the

Opposition saying that the merger which is suggested in

the White Paper is not a genuine merger. The suggestion

is  that  it  is a phoney merger. We have debated  that

already.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  still hear the Government saying that the PAP, type

of merger is beneficial to the people and that it is  a

true  merger.  But  my opinion of the  P.A.P. type  of

merger is this. There are three characteristics in  the

P.A.P.  The  first is deceit. If they  cannot  deceive,

then  they will threaten. If they cannot threaten, then

they  will  try  to manoeuvre. These  are  their  three

characteristics. I have already said -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is now conversing

with  lady Members opposite. I think if she just  looks

at the Speaker, he will be very pleased. He will listen

to her as carefully as he can.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do not want to speak any more because a lot has already

been  said.  There may be more speeches on  the  policy

speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. The P.A.P. type

of  merger  is not a good one and is not beneficial  to

the  people.  Therefore, I oppose  the  motion  of  the

Minister for Labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, under the

provisions of Standing Order No. 24, I wish to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the debate be now adjourned."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister, who glories under the name of the Leader of the House, has, without consulting the Opposition, presumed in a most undemocratic and

unconstitutional  fashion to  move  the  suspension  of

Standing Orders after his Prime -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I think

you  have  just ruled that when I moved the motion  for

the adjournment it was according to Standing Orders and

I  strongly protest against the words "undemocratic and

unconstitutional" used by the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point is well taken because the

motion  to  exempt these items from the  provisions  of

Standing  Order  No.  1  was properly  made  under  the

Assembly Standing Orders, and therefore it can never be

considered as unconstitutional.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  You  are aware that there are constitutional  and

democratic traditions surrounding the discharge of  the

responsibilities of the Leader of the House. He is  not

merely the minion of his Party. He is supposed to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow language of this

nature. I think all the hon. Member can confine himself

to  is  the motion. "That the debate be now adjourned."

He  should give reasons why he thinks the debate be now

adjourned.  I  think it is not a proper  reason  if  he

alleges that the motion to suspend Standing Order No. 1

is  an undemocratic and unconstitutional move. That  is

not  the  reason  why  he  wishes  this  debate  to  be

adjourned. Let us confine ourselves to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard the

Prime Minister just finishing his four-hour speech.  He

has  had all the headlines. We were entitled to expect,

Sir,  that  we  would be able to digest at  least  some

parts of it, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



though there was much clowning there was some sense and

in  certain  parts there was, to my mind,  considerable

important  clarification  of  a  very  ambiguous  White

Paper -  matters that it was vital to consider  if  they

had  any  respect for their own Prime Minister; instead

of giving us an opportunity to consider what was a very

lengthy speech and what, I should hope from their point

of  view at least was more than mere clowning,  was  of

some  importance  in what their Prime Minister  had  to

say - he  happens  to  be  our Prime  Minister  too - and

giving  us an opportunity to understand and perhaps  to

reorient our way of thinking. It is not a matter of the

P.A.P. and  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  There  are  other

Parties  on  this  side of the House. There  are  other

persons  who  can he persuaded even though  the  P.A.P.

believes  that this House is nothing but  machinery  in

order to enlarge their voice to the public. I say, Sir,

it is barbaric at this juncture to seek -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member is

entitled to say that anything which has been done by  a

Member  of this Assembly is barbaric. I think he  ought

to modulate his language and withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I use the word

"steamroller",  because that is what is  happening?  We

have  had a sitting past midnight only two nights  ago.

The   Members  of  the  Government  Front  Bench   earn

Government  salaries. They do not have  to  look  after

anything else. They can attend here and maybe sleep  in

the mornings; I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that is quite

relevant.  Let  us have some reasons  why  the  present

debate should he adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, most of us have our duties to

discharge  and require the normal quota  of  sleep  for

normal  human beings. [Laughter] Sir, I see one of  the

Ministers  finds it highly amusing that we  are  normal

human beings on this side and not on the P.A.P.'s side.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unreasonable, so shortly after one of these

lengthy  sittings, to seek indirectly on  a  matter  of

such  vital  importance - where their own Prime  Minister

has stated at the very beginning of his speech that  he

resisted your efforts to limit the speeches because  he

did  not  want  any  limitation on the  length  of  the

speeches  or the number of speakers - to bring  about  an

all-night  sitting, not merely to limit the  number  of

speeches  but to render their impact as well  as  their

quality almost negative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving this motion in the hope at least that

those  who have free consciences and are not under  the

whip  of  the  P.A.P. will vote for  it  as  a  protest

against  the undemocratic steamroller of the  P.A.P.  I

say  that  this House should adjourn now in a civilised

fashion and that this debate should be resumed  in  due

course after the Budget debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>8.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. have always prided

themselves on the fact that they want to abide  by  the

Queens-berry  Rules.  You have  a  perfect  example  of

Siamese boxing. As the Member for Anson has just  said,

we had a midnight sitting only a couple of nights back.

During this very important merger debate, all sorts  of

interjections have come in so that attention  might  be

directed away from it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that is relevant

to'  the  motion now. The hon. Member can give  reasons

why he thinks the debate should be adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As the Member for Anson has also

said,  there is no consultation with Opposition Members

as  regards what is happening inside this Assembly.  In

parliamentary practice, it is only fair, Sir,  that  if

they  want  to  have an extension of the debate,  there

should  be  the normal friendly, or if not so  friendly

then  at  least decent, behaviour on the  part  of  the

Government.  It  is only right, Sir, that  they  should

consider other points of view, to say nothing  of  you,

Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And the staff.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is definitely riot an example

of  parliamentary democracy as Western  countries  know

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I thought you despise them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Tomorrow we have a very important

debate  coming,  and as it is, we have not  been  given

much  time  to  study  things  coming  over  from   the

Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir,Is the

Member  questioning the fact that we did not  give  the

appropriate notice as required by Standing  Orders?  Is

he questioning that all these rules on debate, motions,

three clear days' notice, have not been complied with?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the hon. Member ever said

that.  All he said was that he was not given sufficient

time, I suppose, by reason of this prolonged debate  on

merger.  If  he had said that, then, of course,  he  is

completely wrong, because the correct time according to

Standing Orders has been given.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand that, Sir. Although,

on   the   surface,  the  rules  have  been   observed,

nevertheless  the fact is that we have not  been  given

time to study all the motions and the Budget Statement.

As  you  know,  Sir, we have been here every  afternoon

debating and listening to speeches and we have not been

given enough time to study and give of our best -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You mean it was not your best.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - on the subject. Of course, Sir,

the  Prime Minister has the whole civil service to help

him, The Thomsons, Meadows -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that is completely irrelevant to the motion. But I ask the Members of the Government Benches not to interject because this is a complaint

made  by  an Opposition Member. There is a motion  that

the debate be now adjourned. Let us hear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



why the debate should be now adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As you know, Sir, and as the Member

for  Anson has said, we are normal human beings on this

side  of  the  House  and  we  need  rest.  Surely  the

Government  do not hope that we will easily gloss  over

things   and  let  them  pass.  The  Members   of   the

Government - especially the Front Benchers - are  drawing

fat salaries.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us not go into that. Perhaps

the  Hon.  Member  might allege that  Government  Front

Benchers  have  more time than Opposition  Benchers.  I

think  that is as far as we can go, but not  to  allege

about fit salaries. It is completely irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is another factor. Sir.

Government  Benchers  have  cars  to  take  them  home

easily. There are quite a number of us on this side  of

the  House who do not have travelling facilities to  go

back home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You have.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come off it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The bus service stops at certain

hours, Sir, and it is only fair that people who do  not

have  huge limousines, air-conditioned cars, be allowed

an opportunity -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think all these details are

completely  irrelevant. Let us come to the motion.  Let

us  have  detailed  reasons why the  debate  should  be

adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, I might add that quite a

number  of  us do not have any person to tag along  for

our protection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is the

Member  alleging that he is being intimidated, that  he

will be waylaid in some dark alley?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. The point

of order which I myself have raised is that all this is

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Government is trying to

create an artificial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



tension  of urgency and, in so doing, it hopes that  we

will  not  have  enough time for the  debate  which  is

coming  on.  We  have  to take time  to  deliberate  on

national matters. If the Prime Minister wants  to  rush

things through quickly, then obviously he is trying  to

hide  something. At the present moment,  Sir,  quite  a

number  of  us  did  not have tiffin  coming  here  and

although -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is it

proper  for  the  Member to allege quite  unjustly  and

without  truth  that he was prevented from  eating  his

tiffin?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He did not say so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has not said that. He has

indicated  that  he  has  been  so  busy  with  matters

connected  with the Assembly that he did not  have  the

time to eat. That is how I understood him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we do not have time to drink

beer around here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I think you ought to try it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, it is very

unreasonable  for the Government to impose  these  long

sittings on the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If they want to debate things

properly, let them do so in the normal democratic  way.

That  is  the  only way to prove that we are  having  a

semblance - I   know   that  we  do   not   have   it - of

parliamentary democracy. The Prime Minister is a  great

boaster, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  it is regrettable that the  Member  for

Queenstown  is not like his colleague, the  Member  for

Stamford.  He was not here to listen to his colleague's

speech.  As  the  Leader of the  Barisan  Sosialis,  he

should  have as much courage as she has and debate  the

question  now.  He  is  the so-called  fighter  of  the

people. We must pay attention to the motion before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



us. It concerns the people of Singapore and Malaya. The

motion was not raised yesterday but two or three  weeks

ago. The Opposition Members should have made a detailed

study of this motion. When we move for the extension of

the sitting, they oppose us. This is not reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be remembered that when the P.A.P. were in the

City Council in 1957 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. On the main motion, so far the

hon.  Lady  is  in order. Bui we are debating  why  the

debate should be adjourned, and nothing further.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I wanted to say

just  now  that  in the past we sat through  the  night

until  this next morning and we never felt tired.  This

question  concerns  the  people  o  Singapore  and  the

Federation. Is it wrong to extend this sitting? Perhaps

some  Opposition  Members have had no time  to  prepare

their  speeches for this debate, and they  want  to  go

back to have them written out by their back-room boys.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, if there is no need for an interpreter to

interpret my speech, then I will speak very strongly. I

want  to criticise the party very severely, but because

of  the  interpretation I have to speak slowly. When  I

speak slowly, it does not mean that I am not angry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Legislative Assembly is a body

which  reflects the views of the people. It is  not  an

instrument  for  the  Party in power.  Assemblymen  are

elected  representatives of the people.  They  are  not

elected  because  they are clever  or  they  can  speak

eloquently  for  so many hours, but  because  they  can

express  the views of the people. The people  want  the

elected  Assemblymen  to convey  their  views  to  this

House.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  representatives   are

elected  not because they can do everything but because

they can loyally and honestly speak in the interest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



or  the  people. Therefore, in debating this  important

question which concerns the future of 1,600,000  people

of  Singapore, and 7,000,000 people of the  Federation,

the  Government  should listen  to  the  views  of  the

representatives  of the people. The  Government  should

patiently  listen  to  the  views  of  the  people   of

Singapore.  Why is the Government, which  professes  to

represent the people, afraid to listen to their views?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of order,

Sir. Just now the Member for Upper Serangoon accused us

of being afraid to listen to the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. It is a point

of  argument which the Prime Minister can advance later

on. I was on the point of getting up just now because

it seemed to me that the Member for Upper Serangoon was

straying away from the debate. We want to know why  the

Opposition think that the debate should be adjourned. I

think  the Member has made his point and he should  not

enlarge on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think this House should adjourn now, and then after the

debate  on the Budget we can resume the debate on  this

motion.  I do not see any reason why this will  do  any

harm  to the question of merger. We ought to know  that

Singapore and the Federation have been separated for 16

years and there are many complicated problems after the

separation which deserve our careful consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We received the White Paper less than a month ago. We

should  have  longer  time  to  make  a  study  of  its

proposals.  If the White Paper put up by the Government

has  nothing sinister in it, then they should allow  us

longer  time  to  debate this problem  and  in  greater

detail. The Party in power should not -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

If,  as the Member has alleged, they were not ready for

a  debate on the Command Paper, then why did the leader

of  the Barisan Sosialis insist on and finally get this

House to agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



to all the motions being discussed together?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order. That

is an argument which the Prime Minister can advance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on

the  question of Greater Malaysia, the Tunku wishes  to

set  up a Commission of Inquiry to ascertain the  views

of  the people in Borneo and to decide ways of bringing

about  a  merger, so as to avoid racial disharmony.  On

this  question,  the  Party in  power  should  be  more

democratic.  We do not mean to say, as alleged  by  the

Government, that we have not prepared the texts of  our

speeches.  The  question  is  this:  Since  the   Prime

Minister, as the chief spokesman of the Government, has

spoken   at   length   for  the   Government,   we   as

representatives of the people should express our  views

on his speech. If we ask for an adjournment in order to

modify  our speeches to accord with the wishes  of  the

people,  then there is nothing wrong in that. This  can

only make this House a more democratic body and reflect

the  people's  views.  I want to  tell  the  Government

Benchers  that  their  rough  behaviour  will  make   a

laughing  stock of the parliamentary democratic  system

and  bring  about serious consequences to  it.  I  hope

Members  on the Government side will carefully consider

this  and  accept our suggestion to adjourn the  debate

now.



<br><br>9.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  want to carry on  with  the  debate

tonight  because we are debating an issue which  is  of

great  concern  to  the  interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore. The Member for Queenstown has said  that  he

is  hungry, and could not carry on with the debate. But

he  could have asked a servant to buy food for  him  to

eat.  As he is a doctor, he could not get sick just  by

taking  this  meal. It would riot happen. I  heard  the

Member  for  Upper  Serangoon say  just  now  that  our

behaviour has been rough. I have never seen anything of

that sort. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



never tried to beat him up. Therefore, I can only throw

back at him his words, this so-called behaviour.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I remember the

students of Nanyang University told me that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. When the Speaker is on his feet,

the Member must keep silent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think what the hon. Lady is saying has

anything to do with this motion. She has said that  the

debate should go on while the Opposition has said  that

it  should be adjourned. Let us stick to that aspect of

it, because the Speaker also has not eaten.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

just now the Member was accusing the Government side of

rough behaviour. That is why I want to say that we have

not  been  rough. Rather, he is the one  who  has  been

rough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps they cannot get the views of

the  people  in one right. Or perhaps they  have  other

motives  for proposing the adjournment of the debate-to

go  home  and  seek  help from their backseat  drivers,

because in this short space of time they cannot  gather

the views of the people - [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask our former colleagues, now the Barisan Sosialis

Assemblymen, not to interrupt my speech. They can speak

after I have spoken. Let me tell them that if they want

to follow the socialist line -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Point of order, Sir. Is it proper

for  the  Leader  of the House to be yawning  all  the

time?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I myself have been yawning, so I

trust  I  have not been out of order. Of course,  there

have  been occasions when Parliamentarians have  fallen

asleep! Then they get out of order when they snore!



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



should continue with the debate tonight I remember  the

time  when  I was in the City Council. We debated  till

the  next  morning. Therefore, from this we  know  that

they  are not really seeking the adjournment to  gather

the  views  of the people. In asking for an adjournment

they really have some other motive. We can see they are

a pitiful lot in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I suggest that if we go on in this

way,  we  will  have  51 speeches  on  this  particular

motion. If the debate on this particular motion goes on

until  4  o'clock in the morning then we will not  have

time to go on at all if the motion is to be completed.



<br><br>9.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government Benchers cannot say I look tired  because  I

had  about  ten  hours of good sleep  last  night!  The

Government  Benchers can neither say that I am  hungry,

because I had two meals between 5 and 9 o'clock,  since

somebody  gave  me  a  treat! Nor  can  the  Government

Benchers  say that I need a ghost writer  to  write  my

speeches  because I have read through the  White  Paper

several times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the sake of parliamentary

democracy,  I ask the Government to adjourn the  debate

today  because this is making a farce of democracy.  In

previous   instances,   where  Standing   Orders   were

suspended,  they were bona fide cases.  For  instances,

when  the Government was toppling on the motion  of  no

confidence, or last week when there was a motion on the

use  of  the  police, or even tomorrow  on  the  Budget

debate when we are prepared to carry on till 6 a.m. But

I  doubt the bona fides of the Government in moving the

exemption of Standing Orders tonight.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> In moving it, Sir, the Government

has  not consulted any Member of the Opposition. I  can

say  that the Member for Queenstown and the Member  for

Anson - and I am sure the Member for Cairnhill will  also

agree - have not been consulted on this. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



young  men like us are prepared to sit till tomorrow  6

a.m.,  8 a.m. or 9 a.m. We are used to it. But we  must

protest, as the Member for Anson has said, in the  name

of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Let's walk out!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Let's walk out. That is correct. All

of us know that the staff of the Assembly are tired.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that should be

advanced. I would not say that they are not tired.  But

I  do  not think that should be advanced as an argument

in  favour  of the motion to adjourn the debate.  After

all,  the staff and even the Speaker are here to  abide

by the decision of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have already

made  our  stand clear in the past two  weeks  when  we

voted  for  the amendment. We, who wish to support  the

Minister   for   Labour's  motion,  can  make   further

clarification of our points. We reject the White Paper.

Every Party has made its stand clear, and if we are  to

decide whether we should talk more or whether we should

defend  the pillars of democracy, we say that defending

the  pillars  of  democracy  is  more  vital  and  more

important. All Members of the Opposition tonight should

get united and leave this Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member for Hong Lim

says that the topic has been sufficiently discussed and

that  everybody  has  made up his  mind  on  the  three

motions,  then there is another Standing Order (Closure

of  Debate)  which could be applied  and  just  a  vote

taken. That Standing Order reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After a question has been proposed a Member rising in

his  place may claim to move, "That the question be now

put", and, unless it appears to the Speaker or Chairman

that  such  motion  is an abuse of  the  rules  of  the

Assembly,  or  an  infringement of the  rights  of  the

minority, the question, "That the question be now put",

shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or

debate,  notwithstanding that  the  mover  has  had  no

opportunity to make his reply.'



<br><br>But  I  must  be  satisfied  that  there  has  been  no

infringement of the rights of the minority. As  I  have

said, if the hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



Member for Hong Lim is correct when he says that  every

Member  has made up his mind, then there does not  seem

to  be  any  reason  why there should  be  any  further

debate. I just put that out as an avenue of escape from

walking out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have not

made my point sufficiently clear. I was saying just now

that  we have made our stand quite clear on the motions

on principle. But the subject is by no means exhausted.

There  are  many  Members who  want  to  speak  on  the

subject.  But  if  we are to decide whether  we  should

speak again on the subject and exhaust it or whether we

should  defend the pillars of parliamentary  democracy,

then   we   will   have  to  defend  the   pillars   of

parliamentary democracy, and we will have to leave this

Chamber.  But  I  think we will give the  Government  a

chance  to  reply  whether they want to  withdraw  this

motion to exempt Standing Orders or adjourn the debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, if any Member attempts to

move the closure, I will not agree.



<br><br>9.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was rather

distressed to hear the Member for Hong Lim who, when he

was  in  the  P.A.P. and  a Mayor,  set  a  historical

precedent by tormenting his Opposition members  in  the

City  Council,  saying  that, "As  representatives,  we

should be able to sit right through the night."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I have clarified just now what are

the bona fide extensions of a debate, like the instance

when   the  Government  was  toppling,  or  the  debate

tomorrow.  We  are prepared to carry on  in  bona  fide

instances.  When  I  was  chairing  the  City   Council

meetings,  there was a bona fide reason  for  extending

the debate. But what the Minister has said just now  is

that  that extension in the City Council was  meant  to

torture members of the Opposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, I quite understood what he said

earlier.  But just to emphasise what I wanted to  point

out,  I say this. There was a time when the pillars  of

democracy  were upheld in the City Council  Chamber  by

having  sessions  which  went  on  till  the  following

morning.  Whether it was bona fide or not is  an  issue

which we have discussed, I think, for 11 or 12 days.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Only the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think you made a ruling that

we should range over the whole series of topics.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let me make myself very clear. I

think  hon. Members will recollect that when the debate

on the amendment was entered upon, and we had had about

two  speakers. I did make a suggestion that all Members

be  asked  to  make  only  one  speech  to  cover  that

particular amendment and all matters affecting  merger.

An  agreement was reached by Members of the  Opposition

that that should be done. But it was the Leader of  the

House  who  did not agree. The result was that  Members

confined  themselves  as much  as  they  could  to  the

amendment. That, of course, lets in the principle  that

once  Members have spoken on the amendment, they  could

speak  again  on the main motion. And when  they  speak

again  on  the main motion, it is then that they  could

range  over  the three motions I have mentioned,  which

now appear in items 1, 3 and 5. That is the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have spoken on the amendment are now at

liberty to speak again on items 1, 3 and 5 in so far as

they touch on merger, and so long as they do not repeat

their   arguments  and  are  relevant  to  the  motion,

excluding  the  topic we have already  disposed  of  by

reason of the amendment. That is quite clear.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Point of elucidation. Mr Speaker,

I quite agree with what you have said just now. But you

will  also remember that you informed the House - I think

it  was  when  the Member for Cairnhill  was  speaking -

[Interruption]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He will have his say. When the

Member  for Cairnhill was speaking, you did agree  that

you  would not call him to order if his speech was made

outside the amendment. You said you would leave  it  to

Members of the House, if necessary, to pull the  Member

speaking up. During the course of this 12-day debate, a

considerable amount of energy has been spent and  words

have  been uttered during which speakers on both  sides

have ranged very widely over all questions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I quite agree that is so. And that is why

the  job of the Chair now is to see that Members do not

repeat  themselves. I already had  one  speech  by  the

Member  for  Stamford where I had to pull  her  up  and

perhaps cut out half or possibly three-quarters of  her

speech. From now on, it will be the job of the Chair to

see  that  Members  do not repeat themselves.  But  the

procedural position remains, and therefore Members  are

at liberty to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that the

debate was on the amendment. But everybody who has read

the  newspapers knows that, in fact, both sides of  the

House have been stating their stands on the White Paper

proposals,  not only on the amendment but also  on  the

main  motion,  and even the amendment to the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech. So it is quite clear that,  in

fact,  all  Members  on both sides of  the  House  have

ranged over this topic.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification, if the Minister

will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged. I would like to

assure  the Minister, through you, Sir, that in so  far

as  I  am concerned, I have dealt with the White  Paper

very  lightly and I hope to deal with it in detail.  In

fact,  I  have  already got a 17-page speech  ready - not

that  I want to consult anybody, but I think it is  not

fair to go on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the point is that everybody knows

that  we are coming to these two motions, and that they

will  be debated today. We have debated this topic over

the  last 12 days. When the Member for Hong Lim  talked

about  the pillar of democracy, for 12 days the  pillar

of  democracy had been allowed to stand where they  are

and everybody who has anything to say can say so today.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you do  ensure,  as  you  have

indicated, that there will be no repetition, then I  am

quite sure that what has to be said today on the topics

under  discussion for tonight can be said.  The  Member

for  Anson has already indicated that he has got a  17-page speech

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it is quite a change from a 52-page speech. So I say

there is no reason for the contention that just because

we  have lifted Standing Orders for tonight, as we have

done  on many other occasions, the pillars of democracy

are  crumbling or that they will crumble.  But  if  the

truth  must  be told, Sir, it is quite clear  why  some

Members  of  the  Opposition,  especially  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  are anxious for a postponement.  Because  we

know, Sir, that there have been frantic telephone calls

as  the  speeches  tare  not  ready.  More  typewritten

speeches -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Point of order, Sir. In fact, my

speech is all ready.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order. I

think  arguments  that are just being thrown  backwards

and  .forwards  will get us nowhere. I cannot  see  any

further  argument that could be advanced for or against

the  postponement of the debate or the  adjournment  of

the  debate. I ask Members to cut their speeches short.

Perhaps leaders of each Party should decide that  there

should  be  one or two Members of their Party speaking.

Then let us take a vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is the point, Sir. One Member has

said that he has his speech ready. That is why, because

people from outside have not got their line laid  down,

therefore,  their men here want an adjournment.  But  I

say,  as  Members of this Assembly, every Member  after

these 12 days should know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



exactly  where he stands and what he wants to say.  And

he  can  say  it  tonight without  any  prompting  from

outside.  Therefore, Sir, the pillars of democracy  are

safe  and  will  continue to be  safe.  The  fact  that

Standing  Orders  do  allow  such  things  is   nothing

irregular. It serves as an indication that democracy is

not  threatened.  And therefore we see  no  reason  for

retreating from our stand on this point.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I just clarify the matter of

parliamentary practice?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> And that is this: If moves are to be made

procedurally in any Parliament, the usual thing is  for

consultations  to be made through the  usual  channels.

"Through the usual channels" means the Government  Whip

and  the  Opposition  Whip getting  together,  so  that

agreement  is  reached  on any  procedural  matter - the

number of speeches, the length of speeches, and  so  on

and  so  forth. Unfortunately, here we have not got  an

Opposition Whip as such. I just want to make that quite

clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has spoken.



<br><br>9.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we in the

Barisan Sosialis have been accused of wanting to  wreck

the  parliamentary system. But it would appear now that

we,  in  fact,  want  to work the parliamentary  system

smoothly and effectively. And it is the Government that

wants  to overwork the parliamentary system and thereby

make  it  unworkable. As you know, any engine  that  is

overworked  is  bound to get rusty and ultimately  will

not  be  giving the result that it will give if  it  is

normally worked smoothly and effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not take very much time. I just want to

make  one or two points. Briefly they are: (1) that  we

in  the  Barisan  Sosialis (I am  sure  the  Government

Members know this) are not incapable of sitting through

a 24-hour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>



session  if  we  want to. Sir, I have  no  doubt  every

Member on the Government Front Bench is fully aware  of

this.  Therefore, today when we suggest that we adjourn

now, it does not mean that we are weaklings or that  we

are  afraid  to  sit here and debate the  issues  until

perhaps 6 a.m. or 2.30 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is this: we are also not

incapable of making speeches without a written  script.

We  are  quite prepared, Sir, if the Government Members

are,  to  take them on a debate without any  script - the

thirteen  of us - anywhere they say, provided  they  do

the same.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> One other point which I want to make

incidentally, Sir, is that we support the motion  moved

by  the  Member for Anson to adjourn now,  because  the

issues  we are debating are very serious. Sir,  we  are

not talking about whether the Prime Minister should get

a  Tun  or  a  Dato from the Federation Government.  If

merger is to mean whether the Prime Minister should  be

given  a  Tun or a Dato from the Federation Government,

then I say we are all wasting our time talking for days

and  days. Sir, we are debating an issue which involves

our  livelihood. So far as Singapore is concerned,  the

livelihood  of 1.8 million people. The 51 Members  here

are  not  supposed to be squatting around  playing  the

fool and making a monkey of issues which the people are

seriously  concerned about. Today  the  Prime  Minister

spoke  for  four hours. Tomorrow, the daily papers  are

all  covered  with his speeches. In the  words  of  the

Minister for Culture, all that they seek to do is this.

Because  we  have been debating for seven days  on  the

amendment and we have been ranging over the other items

in  the  Order Paper, we have nothing more to  say.  We

will  then debate for another hour or two hours,  close

the  debate,  and there will be no more  discussion  on

merger.  Briefly, it simply means, Sir, that  they  are

scared to let us continue the debate on the merger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I say this to them. If they are people who

want to work the Parliamentary system, if they want  to

uphold   the  niceties  or  concepts  of  parliamentary

democracy,  then I say, have the guts to  adjourn  this

debate  now. Let us debate the issues before us  coolly

and  calmly  - not just for the information  of  the  51

Members  or  for  your information, Sir,  but  for  the

information of the people of Singapore - in an atmosphere

which would be conducive to the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to say that this is not a question of

having a debate tonight between the P.A.P. Members  and

the  Barisan Sosialis Members. I assure you, Sir,  that

if  it  is  a  question of just the 26 Members  of  the

P.A.P. and 13 Barisan Sosialis Members, and nobody else

is  expected  to  work, we say,  fair  enough,  we  are

prepared  to take them on for 24 hours or 48  hours  or

whatever they want. I have no doubt, Sir, that even the

Prime  Minister  would be the first  to  go  to  sleep,

because  I and the Prime Minister had attended meetings

and  I have seen him leaving the meetings earlier  than

I.  Therefore, I say this is not the question.  We  are

people who, in fact, are not accustomed to go round the

clock for a meeting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Too much night life, that is the

trouble!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We have been accused of being night-birds.

But  it  would  appear  now, Sir, that  the  Government

Members,  led  by  the  Hon, the  Prime  Minister,  are

perhaps trying to follow us as night-birds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to conclude by saying this. If it is a

question  of  just the Government Members debating  the

issue with the Barisan Sosialis Members, then it is all

well  and good. We have, not to mention you, Sir, other

members  of  the staff in this Assembly, including  the

interpreters, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated that the staff should

not  be made an excuse for supporting a motion of  this

nature. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



are  here  to serve and they will serve if the Assembly

says they ought to serve.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not wish to involve you in the debate.

But  the  point that I want to establish is that  there

are definitely people who are going to be overworked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are one of them!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No. You know me. I can -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I know you too well. That is the

trouble!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The point that I wanted to establish was

this. As far as we are concerned, we are quite prepared

to  sit round the clock. But as I have said, there  are

going to be people who are going to be overworked.  The

issues  are  such that they need proper  consideration,

and  in  an atmosphere which is conducive to discussing

such   matters.  We  say  that  in  the   interest   of

parliamentary  democracy, let us  adjourn  and  discuss

coolly and calmly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> My intention in speaking early in

this is that I fear there would be a lengthy debate  on

the  motion  for the adjournment, while the typewriters

are merrily going on in the Committee Room.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Oh, we can hear it, Sir, from the

C.P.A.  Room.  One of the disadvantages of  the  C.P.A.

Room  is  that the sounds of the typewriters  are  very

audible. I must warn you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that this is going to be a  lengthy  and

dreary  process. [Interruption] Sir, that is the point.

That is why if only they know what they are typing  out

has  to be uttered in this Chamber! If only they  would

realise  the  utter futility of all these dreary  words

which are sheer repetition, then you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

would  be  in better humour and the rest of  the  House

would be in better health. But the Member for Thomson - I

am sorry to have to admit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>



this,  Sir; I was there quaffing a glass of  beer  with

his  Secretary-General  (a very  bourgeois  habit)  was

drinking  a  glass of brandy and ginger  ale.  That  is

proof that he is a bourgeois man.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Hon. The Prime Minister

wishes  to  bring  up these little incidents,  that,  I

think, is personal conduct. Therefore, he should file a

substantive motion to discuss beer drinking and  brandy

drinking. I might tell the Prime Minister also  that  I

am thirsty. I have not had my beer!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, you have my deepest sympathy,

and I hope -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Let us go home!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is nothing to prevent any

Member from going home. There is nothing to prevent any

Member  from  conscientiously doing so in the  name  of

world  revolution.  What  I would  like  to  hear  from

Members opposite, Sir, is a bit of real fierce talk  in

the  name of world revolution. They will sit round  the

clock, but in the name of parliamentary democracy, Sir.

That  bourgeois  animal  is meant  for  only  bourgeois

politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dictatorship!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Dictatorship Sir? We have

squatted through 12 days of this. We will squat through

12  hours  of this till tomorrow morning, till tomorrow

midnight, if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not in this Chamber?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In this Chamber. But surely, Sir,

if we do not want to bring this Chamber into disrepute.

while  we are trying to squat through 34 hours of this,

there  are  certain necessary processes of nature.  The

trouble  with  Members on the other side is  that  they

lose  their sense of balance, and they lose it  because

all  of a sudden a prop is gone, Sir. The prop is  gone

in  the  midst of the performance. The white rabbit  is

not put in the top hat. The prop is not ready -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes, Sir. I think this is irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was about to rise. It is irrelevant.

Let  us  go  on with this debate. Let us  take  a  vote

anyway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, let us vote.

They  have been given three full weeks to consider.  Do

they  mean to tell me or you or the people of Singapore

that they are going to change their minds when they had

already  taken  a  stand before  the  White  Paper  was

published? They oppose anything published by me and the

Tunku.  Tomorrow  if  we were  to  say  were  agree  to

automatic something or the other, they would oppose it.

As  the  Tunku says, he can do no right,  Sir,  and  so

Members of the Opposition from Singapore and some  from

the  Federation are opposing it. He is prepared for it.

They  are prepared for it. They are going to oppose  it

in  any  event. I may say we were brought up in a  much

tougher  and rougher school. I do not want to  complain

of  these  things, but I do riot think the  Member  for

Thomson did me justice when he said that I always leave

the meetings early. Not always, but sometimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You come late also!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I come late, Sir, because often I

come from another meeting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> And you take your bath in between!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. It is very necessary. It

helps  to  freshen the mind. It exhilarates the  mental

processes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This, of course, is prolonging

matters.  Let us wind up this debate and come  to  some

decision anyway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will wind up the debate on the

basis of the arguments I have heard from the Member for

Queenstown. Sir, from one ex-united front performer  to

another present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



united  front  performer, I say he is  not  up  to  the

standard. He has to find reasons. He says there are  no

bus  services  and no cars. That is a very  complicated

thing. Surely, Sir, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We do not have Daimlers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Diamlers? We do not need them.

Renaults are good enough. They can carry five or six or

seven persons. I have known the Member for Nee Soon, in

the  days  of the P.A.P. revolution, sending  them  all

home in his car. Thirteen of them will require - how many

cars?   The  Member  for  Nee  Soon,  the  Member   for

Queenstown, the Member Havelock, the Member  for  Upper

Serangoon -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This has nothing to do with the

question  that the debate be now adjourned. I must  ask

Members on the Opposition benches not to interject.  If

they interject, of course, they get a response. And the

response tends to be a bit long. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> My point is most relevant. An

argument has been seriously advanced that they have  to

go home earlier because they have no cars. They have no

transport.  The buses have stopped. Two days  ago  they

were prepared to go on till 5.00 o'clock in the morning

in  defence of the stand of the students to picket  and

bully.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How come tonight they are not? [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the trouble. They talk all

nonsense  about fat salaries. The Member for Queenstown

has to make his living. I know that, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have ruled that out of order, Mr Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you very much, Sir. He says

there is no time to think on national matters. No  time

to  think?  That  is  the trouble with  the  Member  of

Queenstown.  For  the 12 sitting days and  three  weeks

since we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



published  the White Paper, and since they shook  Tunku

Abdul  Rahman  Putra Al-Haj by the hand at  Paya  Lebar

Airport  to bid him bon voyage, the Tunku has  gone  to

discuss very big matters with very big people. Sir - four

British  Cabinet Ministers - and to arrive at  a  massive

decision  affecting the future of so  many  people  and

tens of thousands of square miles. We have been hearing

the  same thing played on this gramophone record  again

and again. Needles have been slipped back again. It  is

like  the zither in the "The Third Man." I say  we  are

quite  prepared to sit - it is now a quarter to  ten - till

quarter to ten tomorrow morning. Or be it a quarter  to

2.00 tomorrow. We were brought up in a hard school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We are human!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sorry, Sir. When I say we, I meant

P.A.P. and  ex-P.A.P. And the Member for Hong  Lim  is

quite accustomed to this. He is used to this in the old

City  Council  days. He is tough.  He  was  brought  up

tough.  The  P.A.P. brought him up tough.  The  Barisan

Sosialis are tough too. We know they can stand it.  But

I  think  they  should not under-rate our capacity  for

sheer  stamina and endurance. We will sit it though  to

the  end.  The  Member for Thomson said  that  I  leave

early.  Well, I promise him I will not leave  early.  I

will squat here till the cows come home, till the crows

come  at dawn. But I will say this. I am giving them  a

few  more minutes to get the first speech ready,  while

the  sound of the typewriter is going on. But for God's

sake,  let  us  not  be  hypocritical - in  the  name  of

parliamentary  democracy, according to the  rules,  the

Standing Orders, the Constitution, the Speaker. We have

been  patient  and forbearing to the end,  and  we  are

accused of selling out parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Non-consultation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Non-consultation? As if



consultation between the Deputy Prime Minister and



the Member for Anson -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Consultation is not a joke.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Consultation? I know a doctor's

consultation  means money, Sir. That  is  the  trouble.

Whenever he thinks of consultation, it is the cash pot,

Sir. The sound of cash.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This debate is being prolonged

unnecessarily.  I  would  like  somebody  to  move  the

closure  because it seems to me that Members have  made

up their minds and no further argument can be advanced.

Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point. I will end it

on  this note. Members have made up their minds,  which

we do hold. In the case of the Opposition, they made up

their  minds  before 16th November. They are  going  to

oppose  it  in  any  event. But I  will  say  this,  in

fairness  to the Member for Anson. He made up his  mind

to  oppose. He spoke to me in the C.P.A. Room just now.

I  genuinely and sincerely believe that he is  unmaking

his  mind after what he has heard in the course of  the

debate  from the Member for Farrer Park and from myself

on  the  meaning of "nationality" and so on. He is  the

only  genuine chap there who is thinking out his  mind.

The  others have decided to vote. The Member  for  Hong

Lim  has  said  so. He will vote for the amendment.  He

will  vote for the original motion. He cannot be wrong,

Sir.  One  of it has to be right, and he has voted  for

one.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let us not go into those details. Will

the Prime Minister complete his speech?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has nothing to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Parliamentary democracy does not

mean that we allow the Opposition to invoke these magic

words  in  order  just  to clog  up  the  processes  of

legislation.  We have a Budget to go through.  We  want

them  to debate the Budget. We have given them the full

number  of days to consider the Budget. We have offered

a  very  important proposal. A motion was moved by  the

Minister for Finance the day before yesterday to  allow

a supplementary vote on account -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes. I wonder if this is relevant, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is relevant. The argument is

that  if  this motion goes on, then there will  not  be

time to complete the Budget and the other items on  the

Order Paper before Christmas. And I like my Christmas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, in

other  legislative chambers, there are certain stricter

rules.  You  yourself  have mentioned  the  rules,  the

powers,  the  devices which this House can exercise  to

cut things down to the bone and cut away all the forth.

But  we have been lenient. We want to go on till  half-past two tomorrow. It does not matter. We will sit here

with patience, with tolerance and with forbearance. And

hear  this out too. One thing I do not doubt of Members

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis is that  they,  having  gone

through  the  P.A.P. mill, can  go  through  this  and

survive.  The  Members from the United  People's  Party

too.  I have not the slightest doubt that parliamentary

democracy will not come to grief just because you  have

to  sit  up all night. Say what they have to say,  with

the  help of whatever ghost writers they can rustle up - and  they have rustled up quite a few. We shall  listen

to  it patiently and carefully and rebut every material

point  made. I do not promise that we will rebut  every

frivolous  and  irrelevant point. But they  will  find,

like  the Member for Queenstown, that there is somebody

always  in this Chamber who has taken down the material

point  in  order that it shall not be lost by  default.

Every  material point made in the debate that  must  be

answered will be answered. I promise them that. I  say,

let  us  go on with the debate. They are not afraid  of

sitting up late. Neither are we. They want to do  their

duty by the people. They have made up their minds. They

said  they  were never consulted. The Member for  Upper

Serangoon has the audacity to suggest that he is  going

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



consult. Just as we want to start debating, to wind  up

the  debate,  he now says that he wants to consult  the

people  of Upper Serangoon. What has he been  doing  in

the last three weeks with his meet-the-people sessions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Does he seriously suggest that he

is  going to change his mind? Only the Member for Anson

seriously suggests that, and I believe him.  I  say  to

him,  I am prepared to sit down with him till the early

hours  of  the  morning - night-bird  he  may  not   be,

though - to  explain every conceivable item on this.  Let

me  say this. The debate is not over after the vote  in

this  Chamber. This is what the former Member for Bukit

Timah,  the Secretary-General of the Barisan  Sosialis,

with whom I was quaffing beer, said, Sir. Just before I

came  in here, he was having a whispering session  with

the  Member for Thomson before he made his speech. I've

got   the  Member  for  Tanglin  and  the  Member   for

Mountbatten  as  witnesses to  all  these  proceedings.

Real,  earnest  consultation, Sir. And the  Member  for

Thomson told me, just to alarm me -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is this relevant?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know what is coming out. The

Prime  Minister has got into the mood of wandering  and

wandering  and  suddenly coming to the  point.  Perhaps

those are very good tactics. I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is this, Sir. To alarm me and

alarm  the poor Lady from Mountbatten, he said  loudly,

"Telegram from Chin Peng." And the poor Member from -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is not relevant.

We are not worried about Chin Peng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the point. Sir. I say that

the  conscious  utterance betrays the  subconscious.  I

think  the  Member for Nee Soon can explain why  people

grow beards for no rhyme or reason.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must ask the Prime Minister to

wind  up because he is now persisting in irrelevancies.

Standing Order 54 might apply. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I say, in the name of

democracy,  it  is  important  that  there  should   be

forbearance, tolerance and good humour in the midst  of

adversity.  That  is  important. Forbearance  and  good

humour -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I quite agree about forbearance,

good  humour - but at the right time. Let us now wind  up

this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I can only say that the answer to

all  this  is the good proletarian habit of a glass  of

beer,  which I have just had with the Secretary-General

of  the Barisan Sosialis, and, therefore, the tolerance

and  good  humour.  I  say to  them,  if  they  are  as

democratic as we are, there are the rules. Let us  play

according  to  the  rules.  Sit  through  midnight   to

sunrise, and down to sunset. We will listen to it  all - trivial, relevant, or irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I want to say that whatever we say from this

side  of  the  House  is not just for  Members  on  the

opposite side to hear.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has made

that  point. I must ask the Prime Minister now to  wind

up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to say anymore.

other   than   this.  In  the  name  of   parliamentary

democracy,  let  us abide by the rules. These  Standing

Orders  are  Queensberry rules. There is  the  referee,

albeit without a gun, Sir. But we have the Serjeant  at

Arms with a ceremonial sword. I say, play according  to

the  rules  because that is in their best interest.  If

they  should go outside the rules, as I say, it is  not

me that they have to contend with or collide with. I am

only  the penultimate authority. Penultimate means next

to the ultimate. They know the ultimate. So let us play

according to the rules. We have abided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



by  the  rules. We gave them all the notices,  all  the

opportunities.  We wanted to sit through  Saturday  and

Sunday.  They  did not want to. The- Member  for  Anson

wanted it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Saturday only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, he wanted Saturday only. Two

Saturdays  we have lost. The Member for Queenstown,  as

usual,  in an abrupt manner, did not want to speak   to

me,  Sir, in this Chamber after you had left.  He  only

speaks to me when you, are here, Sir. And he said no -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose that is because he knows

he  gets the protection of the Chair. But may I ask the

Prime Minister again to wind up what he has to say?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And last, the point I wish to

make, Sir, is that we have given them approximately one

hour and fifteen minutes to type at least two speeches.

So let us hear it now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not calling anybody else except a

Member of the Alliance.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, we have spent slightly

more   than  an  hour  debating  the  motion  for   the

adjournment. We, from the S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Alliance, are

prepared  to sit right through if it is the  desire  of

this House. But because the trend of the debate is such

that it appears that it is nothing but party warfare we

will not take part in the voting. But if it is the wish

of  the  House that we should sit, we will be only  too

pleased to sit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated that I will

accept  a motion for closure of the debate, which  does

not  give  the  mover of the motion any opportunity  to

make  a  reply. If no other Member wishes to  speak,  I

shall then invite the closure of the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order 51,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the question be now put.

no  infringement of the rights of any minority. Members

to a vote.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching:</b> Good-night!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The debate continues.



<br><br>10.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there is very little to add

after the demonstration that has just taken place.  May

I  say  that  those  who stay behind, probably  without

involving   the   name   of  parliamentary   democracy,

understand  that it means, be amongst other  things,  a

certain  degree-of tolerance, forbearance  and  playing

according  to  the  rules.  The  dilemma  the   Barisan

Sosialis  Members are in is this: playing according  to

the  rules,  they  know they are  going  to  lose,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  Deep down the bottom of  their  hearts,

they  know it. By leaving this Chamber in mock protest,

they   have   admitted   that  they   cannot   win   by

constitutional processes. They wanted us  to  make  the

first  mistake - to  do something unconstitutional;  use

force;   beat  up  students  or,  as  Mr  S.  Woodhull

suggested  in the presence of the Minister for  Culture

and  the  Member for Cairnhill a few days  ago  in  the

C.P.A.  Room, "Swipe us!" The Minister for Culture  and

the  Minister  for Finance said, "No."  Sorry,  Sir,  I

understand   the  Member  for  Mountbatten   does   not

understand the meaning of "Swipe us!" What in a  rather

exhilarating  mood,  which I was told  was  induced  by

several glasses of beer without a proper meal -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think probably the Prime

Minister  is getting away from the motion.  Perhaps  he

will  excuse the Speaker because he has not had a glass

of beer.



<br><br>10.09 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The point that he made by

implication is that playing according to the  rules  he

is  going  to lose. The whole of the Barisan side,  the

whole  of  the  C.P. outfit, the trade union  movements

under    their   control,   schoolboys'   associations,

University  or Socialist Club, Political Science  Club,

old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



boys'  associations - they cannot win  according  to  the

rules,  because,  in the nature of  things,  people  en

masse,  given the opportunity to express their will  by

secret  ballot,  will not be so easily  bamboozled  and

intimidated.  One  of  the  first  things  they  should

remember -  when I hope my voice will be  heard  outside

this  Chamber - is that playing according  to  the  rules

means  playing  according to the  rules  right  to  the

bitter   end - constitutional,  according   to   Standing

Orders,  according to established democratic  procedure

and  practice. But I give this one bouquet,  that  they

were  able,  for  a diversity of reasons,  to  get  the

Member  for  Anson  on their side and thereby  slightly

confuse  the  situation. If they had gone out  just  by

themselves,  people would have said, "Ah, well."  I  am

not  saying  this of hon. Members in this House.  I  am

saying  what the coffee-shop people, to whom the Member

for  Farrer Park has from time to time referred,  would

say - inexperienced,   impetuous  and   often   wrong - and

"walking  out"  to  them may be  a  little  gesture  of

defiance and protest. What is the meaning of that in  a

situation such as this? For nearly three weeks we  have

sat through every tirade, every tedious repetition.  We

made no protest. The Speaker did, and when he did,  the

Acting  Leader of the House, the Minister for  Culture,

went  into  the Speaker's Chambers and said,  "Let  the

debate continue." That was Thursday last week. "Let the

debate continue. Let everybody have his say." What  did

the  Member for Anson say? He wanted the whole of  what

transpired  in the Speaker's Chambers to be secret  and

confidential. Why? Because it is not in his  interests.

Because in Chambers, he agreed with the Speaker  (am  I

right?) that the proceedings should be cut short,  that

they  were  getting tedious, too long;  Judges  in  the

Federation were getting restive; dates for trials  were

being  postponed. What is the trouble about? They  have

been  given every opportunity to say what they want  to

say, and they will have every opportunity till dawn  or

noon tomorrow to say whatever more they wish to say. Do

they  seriously believe that anybody in Singapore would

listen  to  their  argument that, given  more  time  to

collect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



the  views  of the people, according to the Member  for

Upper  Serangoon, they might change their  minds.  They

had committed themselves beforehand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple proposition before us is: Is what we are

doing, first, unconstitutional? The answer is no. It is

in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with

the  Standing  Orders, in accordance with parliamentary

practice  and tradition. We have tomorrow to begin  the

debate  on  the  Budget. Without the Budget  we  cannot

spend   next   year's   expenses;  annually   recurrent

development expenditure cannot be spent. That  is  part

of   the   democratic   practice   and   constitutional

requirement.  We  have given them the full  lease,  the

full  run.  We are prepared to give them from  10  p.m.

tonight till 2.30 tomorrow to talk their heads off.  We

are  prepared to listen to them. We will make notes and

answer them. If they had been men of substance, if they

had really not only wanted to play for time but had the

ability  to  play for time according to  the  rules,  I

would  have  suggested to them that the way  to  do  it

would have been to get their performer - the Member  for

Queenstown - here  to talk for 7� hours  on  his  own,

without  a script, to be relevant, consistent,  to  the

point, and play for time, right till 2.30 p.m., when we

must  discuss the Budget. There is nothing  to  prevent

them  from  doing that. We offered them from 7.30  p.m.

tonight to 2.30 p.m. tomorrow - 19 hours - and they could

not  fill it up. That is all. They wanted more time for

more  clever  pieces to be written  by  people  in  the

Committee  Room,  in the Headquarters  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  in  little cubicles elsewhere  in  town.  We

wanted their performers here to fill up those 19 hours.

We  wanted to listen to them, what they are capable  of

on  their  own. And what are they capable of  on  their

own?  Just a walk-out. Fair enough. They abjured  their

rights   as  legislators  to  play  according  to   the

democratic rules of this Assembly to argue it out. They

lost  the  argument. Like piqued children, they  picked

themselves  up. In the case of the Member for  Anson - he

must always be special - he picked up a very big book and

walked out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Encyclopedia Britannica!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Encyclopedia Britannica. I

hope  it  is the latest edition, otherwise he might  be

reading stale stuff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever it is, let us congratulate ourselves

that,  in this first contest of patience and endurance,

they  have lost out. Talk till the cows come  home.  Be

reasonable till the cows come home, till the cocks crow

in  the morning. Unfortunately for the Communists - as  I

was  explaining over a glass of beer to the  Secretary-General  of  the Barisan Sosialis - they have picked  out

the  weakest  elements in the P.A.P. and thereby  saved

ourselves a lot of trouble. Now it is their problem  to

defend  these weak elements. I said to him, "God  bless

you,"  in Chinese and he looked at me fiercely  in  the

eye  and said. "We are not superstitious." Well, I wish

him  well.  But I say this to him. We know  he  has  13

chaps   to   talk  through.  Typewriters   were   going

furiously. I got the dear Lady from Mountbatten to bear

witness.  She  and I heard it. The Member  for  Tanglin

also  heard  it.  I  drew  his  attention  to  it.  The

typewriters were going furiously, Sir. Do they  believe

that   by  walking  out,  parliamentary  democracy   is

destroyed?  The Member for Stamford has applied  for  a

mass  meeting at Colombo Court. I think it is within  a

two-mile  radius  of this Assembly. Therefore,  if  she

holds  it, it might be deemed to be an intimidation  of

this  Chamber.  But  as far as we  the  Government  are

concerned, we agree. Sunday mass meeting, by all means.

Typewriters  go. "Sell-out" to Nanyang Siang  Pau  and

Sin  Chew Jit Poh - I say to them, publish by all  means.

But  I say, "Look, at your own peril." These are things

which are noted down in Kuala Lumpur because publishing

licences  are  concurrent things.  Sir,  the  Singapore

Government is accustomed to sophisticated city life and

we allow these things. But the good country folk in the

Federation  do  not like this kind of  talk  and  funny

articles. And I say these papers carry their own risks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long and short of it is this. By being patient and

forbearing  and  by talking peace, we have  shown  that

they have given up. They are unequal to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



Panmunjon.  That is what it amounts to. We have  to  be

grateful,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  that   the   13

gentlemen  who have left us and gone over to the  other

side, the three who left us earlier, and the Member for

Anson,  were  not made of sterner stuff. If  they  were

made of the quality of the men who led the North Korean

delegation  to Panmunjon, I say we would be  here  till

the  cows come home on New Year's Night, 1962. They are

unequal  to  their  jobs. Let North Korea  know  it.  I

admired them for the way they took on the Americans and

the  United Nations. They talked them round the  clock,

backwards and forwards, in and out, and they came  back

fresh, calm, collected and polite. I congratulated  the

Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis on  the  good

humour  with which he drank beer, laughed and  bantered

as  he  talked of old times. We talked a lot about  old

times  until the Member for Thomson rushed in and said,

"Telegram  from Chin Peng." It proved one  thing.  They

are  not  capable of playing according to the rules.  I

say  to them. "Well, you play outside the rules at your

own peril." We are only interested in playing according

to the rules, laws and regulations made by this Chamber

to see that the Queensberry Rules are observed. If they

play outside them, they do so at their own risk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not believe anybody

wants to drag out a Panmunjon. Since we do not have the

Communists' representatives here any more, there is  no

necessity  to drag Out the proceedings. There  will  no

doubt be witty, brief, short and to the point speeches.

Then  in the name of parliamentary democracy, according

to  the  Constitution and the Standing Orders  and  the

best  of  established traditions and practice, we  will

take  the  vote and show the Barisan Sosialis  and  the

Communists how foolish and inadequate they are  to  the

new  task  they have to face. These are not the  wicked

and  oppressive colonialists whom they  have  to  meet.

They  have  not  got  to meet a William  Goode  in  the

Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen):</b> Order. I think  the

Prime Minister is completely irrelevant. Perhaps he can

come to the subject motion of the debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the subject motion of the

debate has been thoroughly exhausted to the point of no

return.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Then I think we can close the

debate and put the question to the vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I submit

to  your ruling, but I would suggest perhaps one or two

words from those who would like to say something on the

other side before the Minister for Labour winds up  and

the  vote  is taken-this time with no voice dissenting.

Just  imagine  it,  Sir. They lost the  opportunity  of

saying   that  17  raucous  voices  in  the   name   of

parliamentary  democracy voted against.  Now  we  carry

this  vote with no voice dissenting. We who believe  in

democracy in a non-Communist Malaya will see this thing

through.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>10.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed

regrettable that the debate on such a vital question as

merger with the Federation of Malaya has turned out  to

be an occasion for Party comrades and ex-Party comrades

to have it out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said earlier, Sir, that if it is the desire of

the  House  that  the  debate shall  continue,  we  are

prepared  to remain; and to that extent we  remain.  We

consider that the motion is very, very important as  it

affects  the welfare and livelihood of each  and  every

one of us in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate on the amendment proposed by the leader of

the  Barisan  Sosialis unfortunately took 12  days.  It

need not have taken such a long time had the Members of

the  Barisan  Sosialis  and the  P.A.P. not  found  it

necessary to indulge in party politics on a matter that

is  of  vital importance to the country. I must  repeat

here  what  I  said  the  other  day - and  it  has  been

mentioned  again - that what has been agreed between  the

two  Governments is not merger. In fact, if I point out

from the wording of the motions before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>



House, hon. Members will find that even in the mind  of

the  mover of the third motion - that is to say,  in  the

mind  of the Prime Minister - the agreements reached  and

set Out in Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961 are not agreements for

merger. In the first motion in the name of the Minister

for Labour, the word "merger" is mentioned. If I may be

permitted  to  read from the fourth last  line  of  the

motion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... declares that the first objective of all true

patriots  of Malaya is to achieve the reunification  of

these two territories in a merger of Singapore with the

Federation of Malaya.'.



<br><br>Whereas in the wording of the third motion in the  name

of the Prime Minister, the words used are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...agreed to between the Governments of the State of

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya  as  a  working

basis for a reunification of the two territories.'



<br><br>The  word  "merger"  is left out in the  third  motion.

Therefore, it is clear that the agreements reached  and

set  out in Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961 are not for a merger.

They  are indeed a step towards merger, and because  it

is  a  step  towards  merger  we  welcome  it.  But  my

colleague,  the Member for Farrer Park, wants  to  make

this  very  clear - that  is why he  will  be  moving  an

amendment  to  the  third motion - that  the  agreements

reached  and set out in Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961 are  just

"the   immediate  practical  step  towards  a  complete

merger".  That is the wording and I am not speaking  on

the amendment just yet, Sir. That is clear, Sir,I hope

the  Government will accept the amendment of the Member

for Farrer Park when it is moved at the proper time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply, Mr Minister?



<br><br>10.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  moved the motion with the intention of seeking

the agreement of everyone in Singapore to the principle

of  merger  between  Singapore and  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  The details, terms and conditions  of  such  a

merger  can  be  the  subject of  debate  and  even  of

considerable disagreement. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>



on  principle nobody has publicly dared to say that  he

opposes  merger. Whoever says that understands that  he

will  run  counter to every nationalist sentiment  that

has  been  the  inspiration  of  the  struggle  against

colonialism for independence of the people of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the amendment of the Member for Queenstown, he

sought  to confuse the issues. Now we are back  to  the

original  motion.  Let him and his  Communist  backroom

boys  carefully calculate before they take the vote  on

the   division.  Unfortunately,  they  have  left   the

Chamber. This motion seeks agreement in broad principle

to  merger  between  Singapore and  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  If  they want to ask for terms and  conditions

about  automatic conversion from Singapore  citizenship

and so on, let them argue on the motion standing in the

name  of the Prime Minister asking the House to  accept

the  heads of agreement set out in the White Paper Cmd.

33  of 1961. But on this, let there be no equivocation.

Either they are for or against merger in principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown has always

been  the  rugger forward, always full of  the  "charge

forward" spirit. But I am afraid he is not here in this

Chamber  to  listen to this. In his innocence,  he  has

been carried away by the enthusiastic words and phrases

of  the  Communists of the prospect of easy victory  in

collaboration  with  them.  When  he  started  on  this

hazardous  gamble, he was unaware of  the  great  peril

that  lies  in  his  path. He and his  colleagues  have

struck  out for themselves. He has formed a  Party  the

constitution of which is such as to make him completely

a  prisoner  of  the  Communists.  They  control  their

Communist cadres in the branches who, by their activist

methods, control the members of the branches. From  the

branches  they  control  him in the  Central  Executive

Committee by having a majority of the pro-Communists in

the Executive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown lacks the

political experience which the Member for Hong Lim has.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>



Whatever his shortcomings, the Member for Hong  Lim  is

not  a  dope  to be taken for a ride by the Communists.

When  he  formed his Party - the United People's Party - he

ensured  that the Communists would not capture him  and

his Party. He has used his invaluable experience in the

P.A.P. to  improve  on  the safeguards  in  his  Party

Constitution  by  copying and improving  on  the  cadre

control system of the Party.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. the Minister must

realise that he is replying to the debate, and all this

is completely irrelevant to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, I think there

is  relevance  because, in the course of my  speech,  I

think  it  is  important  that I  should  make  certain

references.  I  am  not going into  details,  but  just

mention in passing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the fact that the Member

for   Hong  Lim  copied  the  P.A.P.  Constitution  has

anything to do with this merger.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> I think there is a motive

behind  the  reason why they oppose such  a  merger  in

principle,   and  I  am  just  trying  to  relate   the

background of it. The real intention behind the  Member

for Hong Lim and the Barisan, and the way they have got

themselves  involved in the arguments in  this  debate,

have  some relevance to the points I am trying to  make

in my reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That may be so. But how does the

Constitution of the U.P.P. and the Constitution of  the

P.A.P. being similar have anything to do with  merger?

Unless  the two Parties are going to merge.  I  do  not

know.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much

obliged for your ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Member for Queenstown, I must say

that he has done himself in by the way he argued in the

debate  on  this motion. In the case of the Member  for

Hong  Lim,  Sir,  he has never denied  that  there  are

Communists  in  Singapore  and  that  some   tried   to

penetrate into his Party. Being an experienced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



united  front worker in the P.A.P., he remained  silent

all  through  this  debate. When my  colleagues  and  I

explained  how  the  Communists  are  manipulating  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and  Partai  Ra'ayat,  and  planting

cadres  in  the Workers' Party and trying to  penetrate

into the U.P.P., the Barisan Sosialis said there are no

Communists, the Partai Ra'ayat denied it all,  and  the

Chairman  of the Workers' Party, the Member for  Anson,

wanted  to know who they are. But the Chairman  of  the

United  People's Party, the Member for Hong Lim, wisely

remained  silent.  He  was a  member  of  the  Internal

Security  Council. He knows what this is all about.  He

was  a  member of the Cabinet then. When the paper  was

presented by the Deputy Prime Minister - it was tabled in this House sometime  this year - the Member for Hong Lim  was  fully aware  of  what was going on in Singapore.  He  is  not going  to  deny that there are no Communists. In  fact, only last week, Mr Speaker, be told me and some of  my colleagues  in  the  Government  to  expose   all   the Communists   and  their  manoeuvres  in   the   Barisan

Sosialis.  He  drew a line between the  Communists  and

himself.  Very wisely, unlike the Member for Anson,  he

has steered clear of the Communist united front of .the

Barisan  Sosialis. He knows well that the red  star  of

the   Barisan   Sosialis  is  a  dire  peril.   However

persuasive  Mr Lim Ching Siong and his  other  friends

may  be, I am prepared to bet that the Member for  Hong

Lin  is too experienced to get his people involved when

asked  to  go  for a ride in a car which  he  knows  is

heading for the cliff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Nee Soon

has  already insured himself against the day  when  the

Tunku will have to do something about the Communists in

Singapore.  He  has referred to the  Tunku  in  glowing

terms  as  a  statesman, doubtless in the fervent  hope

that,  by so doing, he is paying a premium for  getting

his name scratched out from the little black book which

they  keep  in  Kuala  Lumpur.  Of  all  the  colourful

admissions  of the Barisan Sosialis, I think  the  most

vivid  was  that of my old colleague, Mr S.  Woodhull,

when in a moment of frankness in a conversation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



in  the  C.P.A.  Room  last  week  with  the

Minister  for Culture, who asked him why he  looked  so

gloomy, he asked, "What is there to be cheerful about?"

He  likened  their  position to that  of  the  Zenkuren

Buddhist  who was holding on to the edge of a cliff  by

the skin of his teeth, and who was asked what he had to

say  for  himself.  If he chose to  say  something  and

opened his mouth, utter disaster would befall him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has on several occasions

in  the past referred to the forces at work in the open

political  arena in Malaya - the nationalist  Right,  the

opportunist   Right,  the  democratic  Left   and   the

Communist Left. Each one force has its own interests to

advance.  Each one force has its own ideas  of  how  to

improve  the life of the people of Malaya. But although

not  in  the open arena, the British and the  Communist

underground  play  a considerable role  in  influencing

events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the curious things which have taken place in

the  last few months is the apparent parley between the

Communist  Left  and the British, leading  to  cocktail

parties  and  tea  parties  for  the  so-called   great

leaders - Lim   Ching  Siong,  Fong  Swee   Suan,   James

Puthucheary,  S.  Woodhull - by the Most  Honourable  the

Earl  of Selkirk, U.K. Commissioner for Singapore.  One

of  the points of understanding they have reached, Sir,

is  that the British bases, which are vital for British

commitments to S.E.A.T.O., should be left alone.  I  do

not  know  how  the  British were able  to  seduce  the

Communists  into agreeing to this line, but  agreed  to

this  they certainly have. Only recently, Mr  Speaker,

(I  hope  I  am  not  repeating, but  this  is  factual information), Mr Woodhull, at a general meeting of the

Naval  Base  Labour  Union,  steadfastly  defended  the

retention of these bases - this was reported in the daily

Press - as  necessary  in the interests  of  the  workers

themselves.  Quite  rightly he  pointed  out  that  the

military  bases contributed 20 per cent of the earnings

to the economy of Singapore. Can it be that the British

were   aware   that   the  Federation   and   Singapore

Governments  were getting together on merger  and  that

the time would come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



soon  when  they  (the British), faced  with  the

possibility  of  merger and  the  abandonment  of

these  bases,  were prepared  to  play  with  the

Communisis  and get them to believe that  perhaps

they  could  take power provided the  eases  were

left untouched?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in London Mr Macmillan could have said to

the  Tunku, as the Prime Minister has just  said,

that  since  the  Communists  in  Singapore  have

agreed that the bases should be left intact,  why

should the nationalist Right, like the Tunku,  or

the  nationalist Left, like the PAP.  Government,

be  more  anticolonialistic than the  Communists?

Perhaps  this whole sorry tale of the  Garden  of

Eden  Hall, besides drawing the Cornniunists into

the  open  where they could be devoured by  lions

and tigers, is also a gambit to get a counter  to

play  against the Federation Government  and  the

Singapore Government on the question of the bases

in  Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, right up to now,

although  the  Tunku  has  on  several  occasions

pressed the point of not having S.E.A.T.O. bases

in   the   territory  of  the   new   independent

Federation  of  Malaysia,  the  Communists   have

strangely  been silent and tacitly acquiesced  in

the continuance of the

S.E.A.T.O. bases.  So  by  a  strange  twist  of

British diplomacy and the right-about turn of the

young   and  inexperienced  open-front  Communist

Left,  the Communists are now in a false position

which is rapidly becoming untenable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That, whereas it has always been

the  avowed  objective  of  all  nationalists  of

Malaya  to achieve the reunification of Singapore

with  the Federation of Malaya and to remove  the

artificial  division created by  the  British  by

their  policy  of "divide and rule",  this  House

affirms and declares that the first objective  of

all  true  patriots of Malaya is to  achieve  the

reunification  of  these  two  territories  in  a

merger  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation   of

Malaya."
