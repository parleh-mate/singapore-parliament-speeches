<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT CHINESE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SECONDARY IV EXAMINATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Agitators stopping students from going to examination)</b></div>

<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> (by Private Notice under Standing Order  No. 18 (1) asked the Minister for Education  (i) whether  he is aware that there are agitators in  buses stopping  students from going to the  examination;  and (ii)  what steps the Government proposes to take or  is taking to prevent this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to state

that   the  Government  is  fully  aware  of  political

agitators   stopping  students  from   going   to   the

examinations. These agitators were working in buses and

at  bus  stops. Political agitators covering  Yock  Eng

High  School were posted at the bus stop in  front  of

Happy  World,  and political agitators  covering  Chung

Cheng  High  School  were  posted  at  the  Keppel  Bus

terminus, near the Tanjong Pagar police station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the steps which Government should take, as

I  already  stated yesterday, parents should  accompany

their children to and from examination centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents of those misinformed children who joined the

picket lines would do well to assert their authority as

parents  by  going to the picket lines and taking  them

home.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the Government's intention to give the

Communists  the  excuse  to say  that  the  police  are

manhandling students, unless it is to come to  the  aid

of  students  against violence, because  such  students

refuse to be so intimidated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add that, despite intensive picketing today

with human chains, blocking up all gates of examination

centres with coconut trunks, and bicycles being used to

barricade entrances, about 1,500 students are  carrying

on with the Government Secondary IV Examination for the

second successive day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mrs Seow, a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Supplementary, Sir. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wonder  whether  the Minister  would  consider

taking  this  suggestion  as a  first  immediate  step,

because I notice the Minister said that about 1,500 are

taking the examination, which means that over 1,000 are

not taking the examination. I have been told by members

of the public that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon. Member come to her

supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Would the Minister take the first

immediate  step to inform students through  the  radio,

Rediffusion  and other means available  to  Government,

that it is permissible and advisable for them to go  to

the  examination without their uniforms, as this is the

way  in  which  all  the  students  are  recognised  by

agitators?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Democratic

methods!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is a

little  difficult to insist upon the wearing of uniform

as a requirement for an examination.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister gives way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I thought the Member for Mountbatten

was  suggesting that students should be  informed  that

they  could  go to examination centres with or  without

uniforms -



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Without uniforms, because they

are recognised by their uniforms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As I have said, we should not make

it  so  that  to  take an examination,  you  should  be

wearing a school uniform. I think it should be left  to

them whether they wear or do not wear uniforms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, if we are to survive as a democratic

State,  we should be prepared to stand on our two  hind

legs and say, "Boo!" to intimidation -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> - as we do to secret society

gangsters.  Unless we are prepared  to  fight  for  our

rights,   there  is  very  little  that  a   democratic

government can do.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

the  Minister whether there have been any incidents  of

violence or force used by agitators to date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am pleased to say, Sir, that up to

this  moment, there has been no report of any  violence

whatsoever  nor  mishap. In fact, many  picketers  were

having  handkerchiefs across the bottom half  of  their

faces and they were shivering in fright.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, can the Minister say

whether  the  agitation that is  now  taking  place  is

following  the same pattern as the agitation that  took

place during the time of the previous Government?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a completely different question.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether

the  Minister would do for those who were not  able  to

take their examination today, what he did for those who

were not able to take their examination yesterday, that

means,  give  them  a substitute examination  paper  to

take?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> If it is true that they were

prevented  through sheer intimidation from  taking  the

paper today, the Ministry will be pleased to prepare  a

substitute paper for those students who did not turn up

for the examination today, as it did yesterday.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Thank you.

<div align="center"><b>IN THE MATTER OF TOMMY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>KOH THONG BEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Personal explanation by Mr Marshall)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Anson has obtained leave to

make  a  personal  explanation. I have  acquainted  the

Minister  of what the personal explanation is about.  I

take it the Minister has received my letter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No? Has the Minister for Education

received a letter which I addressed to him personally?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am afraid not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will give him a copy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clerk handed a copy of Mr Speaker's letter to

Mr Yong Nyuk Lin.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I have

been  in  telephonic communication with Mr  Tommy  Koh

Thong  Bee, who is working in my office and is  now  at

the  Eastern Hotel, Tanah Ratah, with reference to  the

statement  made yesterday by the Minister for Education

in  the  context of the alleged plot of  Communists  to

subvert  Chinese  students  in  order  to  bring  about

violence  and  disruption of  the  merger  talks,  that

yesterday,  Monday, 27th of November, at 9 a.m.,  Tommy

Koh  Thong  Bee  of the University of Malaya  Socialist

Club, which supports the Barisan Sosialis, visited  the

examination  centre at Whampoa Chinese  School  in  St.

George's Road. He was accompanied by three friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tommy Koh asks that, in fairness, I should inform

the  House  that  he left Singapore on Sunday  morning,

slept in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday night, and at 9 a.m. on

Monday  morning, he was travelling between Kuala Lumpur

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



Tapah with two other persons, more than 300 miles  away

from the Whampoa Chinese school where the Minister  for

Education  said  he was. He has not been  near  Whampoa

Chinese School for months. Mr Tommy Koh is prepared to

substantiate these facts on oath before a Commission of

Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Apologise! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Any Minister who wishes to make a

statement,  and only a statement, on that  may  do  so.

There is no debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I reply to

the Member for Anson, since it was indicated that I had

received  your  note,  which I  have  not,  perhaps  an

inquiry can be made -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inquiry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> - probably it is on its way, so that

the  matter can be put right. As I was coming into  the

Assembly, I was told that there was a telegram  waiting

for  me, and I tore it open but I did not look  at  its

contents  until  I  referred  to  this  letter,   which

mentioned that there was some telegram. So I am reading

the telegram for the first time.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Liar!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Thomson will now

apologise  to  the  House.  Only  an  apology  will  be

accepted and nothing less.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I apologise, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> With reference, Mr Speaker. Sir, to

the Member for Anson's statement. I can only say that I

shall refer his statement to the source of intelligence

that  I  have received, and after the matter  has  been

clarified, I shall make a suitable statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, can I ask you whether you have  received

any other telegrams?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> None from Mr Fong Swee Suan, Sir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is completely out of the

ambit of the personal explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the telegram that seems to

be referred to, is it material to the statement?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The telegram is a telegram which I, as

Speaker,  received from Tommy Koh, and which I  thought

the  Minister  ought  to see. I  am  not  permitted  to

disclose  the contents of any such document that  comes

to my hand except, of course, through an Assemblyman.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy of the

Government for the year 1962.

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When moving this motion last year, I

said in my introductory remarks "the background against

which  this  Budget  is  being  presented  is  markedly

different from that a year ago". This year, this  holds

only  too true and with greater force. For we now stand

on  the threshold of a new independence, reunited  with

the Federation of Malaya. It is hardly necessary for me

to labour this point, as the House is in the midst of a

debate on the merger proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger is the dominant issue before the whole country

today.  When  such momentous issues are  being  debated

both  in  the  Assembly and outside, it is almost  with

diffidence that I, as Finance Minister, enter the arena

to  draw  attention  to  such mundane  affairs  as  the

Budget.  Nevertheless, Sir, life must go on.  Provision

must be made for the running of the public service next

year.  Perhaps  it  is a gracious Providence  that  has

ordained  that the Budget should be introduced  in  the

midst  of  the debate on merger. For there are  already

signs  that  some  Members  of  the  Assembly  in   the

Opposition Benches have allowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



their  imaginations to soar into space, right into  the

realms  of  wild  fantasy. Before  their  minds  circle

permanently  in orbit in outer space, it is  good  that

they be brought back to earth to face the realities  of

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far be it from me to deliver a sermon to the Barisan

Sosialis   on   the  hard  economic  facts   of   life,

nevertheless, I think that a few timely reminders  will

not  be  out of place, if only to bring home the  point

that  while political excitement and euphoria may be  a

pleasant pastime for amateur politicians, there is, for

more  practical  people, the task of  seeing  that  our

economy  continues to function and that the  livelihood

of people be thereby ensured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore live in a tight economic situation.

We are a small island State which is prosperous because

of our central geographical position. This allows us to

render services of value to our neighbours. Through the

port  of  Singapore passes much of the produce  of  the

Federation   of  Malaya,  Indonesia  and   Borneo.   In

addition,  we  serve as a supply base for the  consumer

goods  which these territories need. This is  the  main

source of our livelihood. We will continue to earn this

livelihood  so  long  as  we  provide  these   services

efficiently  and so long as we are on good  terms  with

our  neighbours.  But  when  neither  of  these  things

obtains,  then this principal source of our  livelihood

may  shrivel. And this will bring in its train  poverty

and destitution for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever our differences in political outlook may be

we must refrain from such action that would lead to the

ruin of our country through hostility of our neighbours

or  the  running  down  of our business  organisations.

Political  slogans and political ideology  cannot  feed

empty stomachs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the background of the current political situation,

the  only  possible Budget that a Finance Minister  can

present  to the House is one that sees few innovations,

while  maintaining the public services  much  in  their

present  form  with  some scope for  modest  expansion.

This, in fact, is the Budget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



which  I  am privileged to present to the House  today.

For,  with  merger  around the corner,  there  will  be

innumerable  matters which will need the  attention  of

the  Government and the Central Government of  the  new

Federation. There will be many anomalies and  budgetary

adjustments  to  be  made  between  State  and  Central

Governments,  and at this stage it is unwise  to  enter

into new lines of action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean, however, that the plan for our

economic  expansion should be halted or even  retarded.

The  policy iii this respect is stated clearly  in  the

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. And I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the immediate future, the task of the Government

is to proceed with the work already initiated.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I discuss the Estimates now before the House,

I  shall, in line with past practice, turn to a  review

of the current year.



<br><br><i>Review, of 1961</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 1961 was an eventful one. Several new

financial   and  economic  measures  were  successfully

introduced.  Others initiated by the P.A.P.  Government

in  previous years came to fruition during this period.

I  wish to deal briefly with some of the more important

of these financial and economic measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite the most important event of the year was the

publication  of  the  Four-Year Development  Plan.  The

Development  Plan sets out the targets in economic  and

social  development which the State should  achieve  in

the period

1961-1964.  The principal objective of the Plan  is  to

increase the rate of capital formation from its present

level  of  about 11 per cent of the national income  to

something  nearer 20 per cent. This  is  to  ensure  an

expansion  of the economy sufficient to keep pace  with

population growth and to leave aside something for  the

improvement  of  standards of  living.  The  Plan  also

calculates  the available resources, both internal  and

abroad,  to carry out the Programme. The Plan  provides

for capital investment in the public sector, that is to

say,  capital  investment by Government  and  statutory

authorities. By the nature of things, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



cannot  and does not set out targets to be achieved  by

private  investment, though one of the main  objectives

of  the  Plan is to induce an increase in the  rate  of

private  capital investment. The Development  Plan  was

conceived   against   the  background   of   a   severe

unemployment  problem which threatened to  increase  to

unmanageable  proportions if  no  positive  effort  was

taken.  I  will  at a later stage give details  of  the

performance of the Plan in the current year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure of great importance, which was taken

by  the Government, was to set up the Economic Develop.

ment  Board  on 1st August, 1961. An Ordinance  setting

out  the powers and functions of the Board was approved

by  the  Assembly on 24th May, 1961. It has  taken  the

P.A.P. Government some two years to launch the Economic

Development  Board. In this period, we  had  access  to

expert  opinion  at  the highest level,  including  the

World Bank and the United Nations Special Missions. The

Board  has started its work, recruited personnel,  and

got down to business, I shall deal with the work of the

Board later in my statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned in previous Budget statements that

we  would be approaching the World Bank for Development

loans.  Members  will be glad to learn that  the  World

Bank  has  agreed in principle to negotiate  loans  for

projects in the Four-Year Development Plan. At present,

two  projects  are  under  consideration,  namely,  the

expansion of water and power supplies. It is  a  source

of  satisfaction to the Government that the World  Bank

has  agreed to finance our development projects, for  a

World Bank loan indicates the confidence of the Bank in

the financial standing of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 1961 also saw the conclusion of the work

undertaken  by  two  United  Nations  Special  Missions

despatched to Singapore. One Mission, headed by Dr  A.

Winsemius,    studied    the   general    problem    of

industrialisation  of  Singapore.  In   addition,   the

Mission   made  recommendations  in  respect   of   the

establishment of specific new industries. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  for implementing the findings  of  this

report rests with the Economic Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other United Nations Mission, headed by Mr P. L.

Schereschewsky, examined the feasibility  of  a  steel

industry in Singapore. The Government is acting on  its

recommendation that a small rolling mill should be  set

up  as  a  first  step.  We  have  been  successful  in

persuading  a group of local businessmen to pool  their

resources to establish this steel plant which  will  be

sited  in Jurong. They have held negotiations with  one

of  the  major  Japanese  Steel  companies  over  their

participation   in  this  project.  No  agreement   was

reached,  however, though the door was  left  open  for

future  participation  in a more  substantial  project,

should this prove feasible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another event of significance was the conclusion of

the  agreement on basic arrangements in regard to trade

between  the Governments of Singapore and the  Republic

of  Indonesia.  In consequences of this agreement,  the

Office    of   the   Singapore   Trade   and   Cultural

Representative was established in Djakarta  this  year.

Another   agreement  entered  into   with   a   foreign

Government was the Agreement on the Avoidance of Double

Taxation  which  was  ratified by  the  Governments  of

Singapore and Japan in September this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, the Government decided to

offer  Treasury  Bills to the public on  tender.  These

bills  were  issued under the authority  of  the  Local

Treasury  Bill  Ordinance. The value of Treasury  Bills

now  outstanding is $12 million issued on  tender,  and

$5.3 million issues on tap, making a total of just over

$17  million. Treasury Bills provide a safe and  liquid

form of short-term investment. They are useful to banks

and other concerns which may have surplus cash balances

seeking  investment of a fairly liquid form.  There  is

considerable  scope  for expansion  of  the  short-term

money market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loan of $50 million bearing an interest of 5¾ per

cent  redeemable  in  20  years  was  floated  on  27th

September, 1961, all of which was taken up.  This  loan

will  be  a  useful  addition to the resources  of  our

Development Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to turn to the general economic picture of the

State.  The value of Singapore's trade in 1961 has  not

been  as  large as that of the previous year.  For  the

first  three-quarters of 1961, the value of  our  total

trade  amounted  to  $5,473 million  as  compared  with

$5,700  million  last  year. Our imports  fell  by  $72

million  and,  more  seriously,  our  exports  by  $155

million.   Our  two  major  trade  partners   are   the

Federation  of Malaya and Indonesia, and in respect  of

both,  there has been a slight decrease in  value.  Our

exports  to Indonesia, however, have shown a small  but

welcome  increase from an average of  $10  million  per

month  in 1960 to nearly $13 million per month in 1961.

This improvement reflects better relations between  the

two countries. The principal reason for the decline  in

trade  values is the fall in the price of  rubber.  Our

trade  in  rubber  accounts for a third  of  our  total

imports  and  nearly  half of our  exports.  Therefore,

small  variations in the price of rubber  will  have  a

significant effect on our trade values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 1960, was a good year for rubber, the

average  price  for  R.S.S. 1 being  $1.08  cts.  Since

October  1960,  however, the price of rubber  began  to

drop.  During  1961  this  drop  continued  slowly  but

steadily  with average prices being between 90  and  82

cents. Recently the price is around 75 cents above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect on Singapore so far has not been very

substantial.  As  far  as the activities  of  our  port

transport   communications  and  business  houses   are

concerned,  it is the volume of trade rather  than  the

value  which  determines how well off we are.  In  this

respect,  the  position is happier.  Total  tonnage  of

cargo  handled showed a slight improvement in  1961  as

compared  with  last  year. In the  period  January  to

August  1960,  just over 6 million tons  of  cargo  was

discharged and 3.4 million tons loaded. This  year  the

corresponding  figures have risen to 7.5  million  tons

discharged and 4.2 million tons loaded. The  volume  of

cargo handled by the Singapore Harbour Board alone  has

shown  an  increase from a monthly turnover of  396,000

tons to 533,000 tons. Again during the same period, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



number  of  ships which were cleared by our  Port  rose

from  12,933  to  13,751. In terms of total  registered

tons,  there  was an increase from 43 million  tons  to

47.5  million tons. On the whole, the volume  of  trade

was  high this year and the capacity for handling  this

volume was fully employed. Nevertheless, the decline in

the  price  of rubber is bound adversely to affect  the

earning power of our neighbours. They in turn will  buy

less  goods  and  this may reduce the volume  of  trade

passing through Singapore unless there is a revival  in

the price of rubber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general trend of economic activity in the State

for  the  past year is also reflected in the volume  of

financial   transactions  and  changes  in  levels   of

industrial  production  and  constructional   activity.

Loans  and advances made by banks increased from $569.5

million last September to $666.4 million September this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upward trend of manufacturing activity which I

brought to your notice in my last Budget speech may  be

seen  to continue into this year. This is reflected  in

the  increase  of  production of main  industries.  The

cigarette  industry has shown an increase of nearly  25

per  cent  for the first eight months of this  year  as

compared  with the corresponding period of  last  year.

Output  rose from 2,455,000 pounds to 3,062,000 pounds.

Other industries which showed a significant increase in

production  are coconut oil (17 per cent),  sago  flour

(14  per cent), soft drinks (17 per cent) and remilling

of  rubber (40 per cent). How, ever, the production  of

biscuits, soap and soya bean sauce declined slightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry saw heightened activity

generated  by  the  massive building programme  of  the

Housing  and  Development  Board  and  the  revival  of

private building activity with the favourable change of

policy  towards  development  charges  for  main   City

Council services. This is reflected in the increases in

our retained imports of building materials. Imports  of

cement  increased  by 40 per cent  in  the  first  nine

months  of  this  year.  Imports  of  steel  and  other

constructional  materials have also  shown  an  equally

substantial increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic expansion, consumption of textiles

and  durable goods have shown a corresponding rise

for  the period under review. Retained imports  of

radio and refrigerators increased by about 30  per

cent while new registration of private cars, motor-cycles,  and  scooters increased by 35  per  cent.

Textiles retained for the first six months  showed

a  substantial  increase  over  the  corresponding

period  last year. So far as statistical  evidence

is  available, more goods were generally  consumed

this year compared with the last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospects for the coming year are not

unhopeful. The American economy has recovered from

the  recession of last year and it appears set for

further advance. Similarly, the economic expansion

of  industrial  nations, which slowed  down  in  a

number  of  countries  last  year,  is  likely  to

register a general advance.



<br><br><i>Revenue and Expenditure 1961</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to a review of expenditure and

revenue  in  1961.  Expenditure was  estimated  at

$348.3  million. For the first ten months  of  the

year,   actual  expenditure  amounted  to   $246.7

million. It is not easy to forecast what the final

figure would be, because most of the bills for the

purchase  of  equipment under O.C.S.E.  Heads  and

works started in the year will be paid in the last

quarter  of the year. It is likely, however,  that

Expenditure  will fall short of the  Estimates  by

some  $30  million.  I dealt last  year  with  the

reasons  why  expenditure of  that  year  was  not

expected  to  reach  the  levels  estimated.   The

familiar  reasons  were  that  of  difficulty   in

recruitment of staff and delays in the  fulfilment

of  orders by suppliers. This year, however, a new

factor  arose,  and  this  is  that  some  of  the

previous  City Council Departments now  integrated

into the Government Departments have overestimated

their requirements. This will be made clear when I

discuss Heads of Expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Heads of Expenditure where there has

been  substantial under-expenditure, Public  Works

Recurrent shows that some $4 million will not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



spent principally because of the lack of engineers

and   architects  to  supervise  maintenance   and

construction work. We are making every effort  to

bring   the  establishment  of  the  Public  Works

Department to full strength, but there  are  still

deficiencies  in  the senior  and  medium  grades.

Further,  there  has  been  an  over-provision  in

respect of the Transport Centre taken over from to

City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Ministry of Health, under-expenditure has been less than that of previous

years.  The Ministry of Health is likely to  spend

some  $3.7  million less than the  Estimates,  and

this  is principally due to unfilled posts in  the

senior  and  ancillary grades. The Government  has

made  certain  improvements in the  conditions  of

service  of nursing and other ancillary  staff.  I

hope that with these improvements we shall be able

to fill most of the vacant posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance is expected to spend

some  $3 million less than the Estimates. This  is

principally  due  to  the  fact  that  an  Advance

Account  of  $2  million  provided  for   in   the

Estimates   to   pay  for  forward  purchases   of

materials   and  stores  by  the  City  Engineer's

Department  was  not drawn upon. There  have  also

been  stricter controls over payments of  passages

and  miscellaneous travelling expenses. Some  $2.4

million  will not be spent under Charge on Account

of  the  Public Debt, because the total amount  of

borrowing  by  the Government did  not  reach  the

level  estimated.  The  Ministry  of  Labour  will

probably  spend  $900,000 short of  the  estimated

expenditure.  This is principally  due  to  under-expenditure on Work Brigade projects.  The  Police

will  spend  some  $900,000 less  than  estimated.

There is difficulty in recruiting constables  with

the  qualifications and standards set  down.  Some

reorganisation  has taken place, as  a  result  of

which  certain  static  or non-operational  duties

have  been regarded as Guard Constables for  which

lower  standards may be accepted.  Recruitment  to

this  group  is  proceeding  satisfactorily.   The

Ministry of Education will under-spend by  roughly

$4.6   million.  This  is  due  to  more   careful

administration of Grants-in-Aid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



There   is  also  the  perennial  problem  of   getting

sufficient numbers of suitably qualified personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1961 revenue position is satisfactory. The yield

from  most  of  the  main  items  of  revenue  exceeded

expectations.  1960 by all accounts must  have  been  a

good  business  year,  for the yield  from  Income  Tax

surpassed  the  estimated amount of $75 million  by  $5

million. The estimate for Property Tax of $31.6 million

is  likely  to  be exceeded by $12.5 million.  This  is

mainly  due  to improvements in collection  procedures.

Totalisator and Sweepstakes duties did not  fulfil  the

optimistic  expectations of $8 million. The yield  will

be about $2.8 million less than the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs and Excise revenue was buoyant. The total

revenue  collected  from the Customs Department  during

the  first ten months of the year was $95.4 million  or

$3  million more than the revenue collected  last  year

for  the  same  period. The total  Customs  revenue  is

expected to reach $116 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquor duties will probably exceed the estimated

$23.1  million by $3 million. Consumption of liquor  of

all grades had been maintained throughout the year at a

high  level. The Tobacco revenue, which in recent years

had  given  rise to anxiety, will for once  exceed  the

estimate. The figure of $38.5 million may be passed  by

some  $3  million.  On  the other hand,  Petroleum  has

proved  a disappointment. Once again, there is a short-fall, this time probably in the region of $1.3 million.

There  has  been  a  switch from petroleum  engines  to

diesel engines to power vehicles. However, the yield of

the  special tax on heavy oil engine vehicles has  more

than   offset  the  short-fall  in  Petroleum  revenue.

Entertainment Duty may just fail to reach the estimated

$7.7 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second instalment of $10 million of the $30

million loan repayment by the Federation of Malaya  was

made  this year. The United Kingdom Government  made  a

contribution  of $4.28 million towards the  maintenance

of the Local Defence Forces.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>City Council integration</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I comment on the Estimates now before the

House,  I  wish to dwell at some length on the progress

made on the integration of the City Council departments

into  the  Government.  This is a major  administrative

reform  undertaken by the P.A.P. Government. I wish  to

say also something about the next stage in this process

of  integration, which would be the setting up  of  the

Public   Utilities  Board  to  take  over  the  Trading

departments of the City Council. This year's  estimates

is the first exercise at integrating the Budgets of the

Government and certain City Council departments. I have

dwelt  at some length last year on the intricate nature

of  this  exercise. The work of integration was carried

on  more smoothly than was thought possible last  year.

In   spite  of  the  different  systems  of  accounting

procedure,  the  management of this  integrated  Budget

carried  on  smoothly and without any major upset.  The

volume  of  work  handled  at the  Accountant-General's

Office has increased by about a third. The staff of the

office  had to be supplemented with one Accountant  and

sixteen   subordinate  staff.   The   next   stage   of

integration  would  be to set up the  Public  Utilities

Board  and I shall deal with some of the problems  that

this  will  raise, as these are matters  of  widespread

public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council has hitherto been divided into two

main  parts, the Rate Fund Departments and the  Trading

Departments.  The Rate Fund Departments, which  include

sewerage,  cleansing and many other  departments,  were

financed from rates paid by ratepayers under the  Local

Government Ordinance, 1957. The Trading departments are

the  water, gas and electricity departments, and  they

derive their revenues from the consumers of water,  gas

and  electricity.  The intention is to  constitute  the

Trading  departments, with the necessary administrative

staff,  as  a  Public Utilities Board.  The  Rate  Fund

Departments  are  to be integrated or merged  with  the

existing Ministries of the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



The   personnel   and  equipment  of  the   Rate   Fund

Departments have already been transferred physically to

Government Ministries and are now operating  under  the

control   of  those  Ministries.  This,  the  so-called

physical  integration, began on the  1st  January  this

year, and is, for all practical purposes, completed. In

addition, the revenues formerly received by those  Rate

Fund Departments have been paid to the Government since

1st  January, 1961, and their expenditure has been paid

by the Government from the same date in accordance with

the Local Government (Financial Integration) Ordinance,

1960.  The  personnel  and  equipment  of  the  Trading

departments,  and the associated administrative  staff,

will  remain with the City Council, and their  revenues

and  expenditure are still accounted for  by  the  City

Council. Standing outside and apart from the Rate  Fund

and the Trading Departments are the Municipal Provident

Fund  and  the public loans raised by the City Council.

These two accounts serve both the Rate Fund Departments

and   the  Trading  departments  and  are  still  being

maintained  by the City Council as a common service  to

all   departments, including  those  that  have   been

integrated with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taking-over of the revenues of the Rate Fund

Departments by the Government requires only  one  minor

adjustment.  It relates to the collection of  fees  for

sewerage  and  other sanitary services. These  services

are at present billed in different ways in the city and

in  the  rural  areas, but as from 1st January  next  a

uniform  system  of billing is to be  introduced.  From

that  date, the occupiers of all houses throughout  the

island   will   find  that  the  familiar  consolidated

accounts rendered every month by the City Council  will

be  slightly changed and some people in the  city  area

will  find  that  they are billed for certain  sanitary

services by the Ministry of Health and no longer by the

City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been decided that the administration of the

Municipal Provident Fund



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



shall  be taken over by the Government and administered

in  the common interests of the Government, the Housing

and  Development  Board, and the new  Public  Utilities

Board.  It has also been decided that the public  loans

and  sinking funds of the City Council shall  be  taken

over  by  the new Public Utilities Board and  that  the

relatively small liability of the Government for  these

loans  shall  be  discharged by, regular  contributions

from the Government to the new Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It remains to deal with the assets in cash and

property of the City Council. These assets have a  book

value  of over $600,000,000. They are to be apportioned

between  the  Government and the new  Public  Utilities

Board; the power stations, water works and other assets

of  the Trading Departments going to the Board and  the

roads,  sewers, fire engines and other  assets  of  the

Rate  Fund  Departments going to  the  Government.  For

various technical reasons, it has been decided that the

most  convenient date on which the apportionment is  to

take  place  is  1st January, 1961, and the  Government

will  assume  the ownership of its portion with  effect

from that date. The portion which goes to the new Board

will  be  handed  over to it when it  is  set  up.  The

liabilities of the Rate Fund Departments will  likewise

be  assumed by the Government and those of the  Trading

Departments by the new Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minor adjustments are to be made for the

convenience of administration. The public street  lamps

and  stand-pipes of Singapore which are  owned  by  the

Trading  departments  will  be  handed  over   to   the

Government with, of course, the associated liability to

maintain  them. Certain houses and buildings which  are

the  property  of  the  Rate Fund Departments  will  be

handed  over to the new Board in order that it  may  be

properly   equipped   to   carry   on   its   functions

economically  in the interests of consumers  of  water,

gas  and electricity. It will be seen that although  it

is  relatively  easy  to  give general  directions  for

carrying  out  these intentions, an immense  amount  of

work will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



have  to  be  done  in  sorting  out  the  assets   and

liabilities of the City Council acquired over the  last

100 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the problems of the personnel of the

City  Council,  I should first explain that  there  are

about  2,600 monthly-rated employees in the  Rate  Fund

Departments   and,  on  integration   with   Government

Ministries,  they  join up with about  29,000  monthly-rated  Government employees. It has been  decided  that

every  permanently engaged monthly-rated  City  Council

employee  shall  retain his present salary  and  salary

scale  on  his transfer to the Government service.  In

addition,  all of them who are members of the Municipal

Provident  Fund  will be allowed to remain  members  of

that Fund and will, on their retirement, be entitled to

receive  the  full benefits of that Fund calculated  on

.the  basic  salary  drawn in the  Government  service.

There  are many problems connected with their  transfer

the  details  of which are being worked  out  grade  by

grade and, in some cases, individual by individual. The

general  intention is that the entry of these  monthly-rated employees of the City Council into the Government

service  should not result in displacement or  impaired

prospects  either for themselves or for the  Government

employees they join.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained, the physical integration of the

Rate  Fund  departments  with Government  is  complete.

Those  departments  have  now become  merged  with  the

Government.  What remains of the City Council  is  that

part  of its former self which is to become the  Public

Utilities Board. Legislative sanction to carry out  the

final acts of formally transferring assets, liabilities

and  employees will be sought in two Bills. The one  is

the  Local Government Integration Bill which will  deal

with  the transfers to the Government as well  as  with

the  manifold powers and duties carried out by the Rate

Fund   departments.  The  other  Bill  is  the   Public

Utilities  Bill  which will establish  the  new  Public

Utilities Board. Certain other minor Bills will also be

introduced  to bring about consequential amendments  to

the pensions laws and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



constitution of the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br><i>Expenditure Estimates, 1962</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now discuss the 1962 Estimates. As I said in my

introductory remarks, the Budget for 1962  is  designed

to  maintain existing provisions, making allowances for

normal  expansion. The only new service  that  will  be

introduced next year is the Television service which  I

shall discuss later. Other than this, all increases  of

expenditure are due to normal expansion. The  expansion

of  the social services to keep pace with demand  is  a

substantial  one.  Education and  health  between  them

account  for  $25  million additional expenditure.  The

growth of expenditure on education has been striking in

the  past  ten  years.  In  1951  the  annual  vote  on

education was only $12.4 million. Next year the  amount

will  be  $89.1  million, a sevenfold  increase  in  11

years. We in Singapore have reached the stage where  it

is  possible to provide free education for every  child

up  to  primary  stage.  I have,  in  my  first  Budget

statement,  drawn  attention to the  mounting  cost  of

education.  Every  loyal citizen  wants  the  State  to

maintain the highest possible standards of education as

well  as  to  ensure its widest possible extension.  So

far,  we  have  been fortunate that we have  sufficient

resources  to  satisfy this wish. As  for  the  future,

whether  Singapore will be able to  do  so  depends  on

whether  or  not we succeed in expanding  our  national

income   fast  enough.  If  everyone  makes  his   full

contribution  to  this end, I think  we  can  make  the

grade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards particular Heads of Expenditure, the

principal  increases  in expenditure  occur  under  the

Ministry   of  National  Development  ($6.5   million),

Ministry  of Health and Law ($6.1 million),  Charge  on

Account  of  Public  Debt ($5.9 million),  Ministry  of

Culture   ($2.15   million),  Defence  Services   ($1.5

million), and Ministry of Education ($20.98 million).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large increase in the provision of the Ministry

of  National  Development is due to  a  change  in  the

Budget. The votes for the Work Brigade have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



been  transferred from the Ministry of  Labour  to  the

Ministry  of National Development. This has  been  done

for  organisational  reasons  since  the  Ministry   of

National Development is concerned with most of the Work

Brigade projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase under Charge on Account of Public Debt

is to meet loan charges in respect of the 1961 Loan and

that part of Government's liability in relation to City

Council loans consequent on integration of certain City

Council departments into the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate administration, the Head "Ministry of

Health"  has  now been reorganised under  three  Heads:

Ministry  of  Health and Law, Hospitals  Division,  and

Public   Health   Division.  City   Health   has   been

incorporated  into  the  Public  Health  Division.  The

expansion   of   medical  and   health   services   has

necessitated  an  increase  of  staff  at  all  levels.

Maintenance costs have necessarily risen. The  increase

is  also due to the absorption of provisions for  water

supplies  from  stand-pipes in rural  areas  and  rural

cleansing  and  scavenging  services  previously  shown

under Rural Administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the provision for the Ministry of

Culture is due to the incorporation under this Head  of

Victoria  Theatre  and Memorial Hall (previously  shown

separately).  There  has been  also  expansion  in  the

activities of that Ministry. Members will recall voting

supplementary provision this year from Suara  Singapura

and  the Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan.  These

have  now gone into full swing. Provision has also been

entered  for  engineering and  technical  staff  for  a

television service. Plans for this service have reached

an  advanced  stage, and I expect that the new  service

will be inaugurated by the end of 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Defence Services for 1961 was based

on a standstill budget pending the outcome of financial

talks  with the British Government. Now that the extent

of the contribution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



which  the British Government is prepared to  make  has

been  ascertained, it is possible to have  a  realistic

budget  for  Defence  Services.  Recruitment,  repairs,

replacements  of  equipment,  and  so  on  which   were

previously deferred, could now proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the large increase under the Ministry of

Education. With the increase in educational facilities,

additional  staff and non-teaching staff  (to  maintain

school   compounds,  buildings  and  so  on)  will   be

required.  There will be the consequential increase  in

equipment  and consumption of water and light.  Also  a

large  element  of  the increase is occasioned  by  the

contribution to the University of Singapore. The sum is

$8.5 million, of which $4.0 million is recoverable from

the  Federation  Government in  respect  of  Federation

students.  There is also an increase in the  number  of

bursaries to students. Further, earlier this year,  the

Lembaga   Gerakan   Pelajaran   Dewasa   extended   its

activities   substantially   by   introducing   further

education  classes  which  have  proved  to   be   well

supported. To meet this additional commitment  as  well

as  its  regular  expansion, the  contribution  to  the

Lembaga  is  now increased from $500,000 to $1,019,400.

Finally  the total under the Ministry of Education  has

been  increased by a sum of $1,997,400  in  respect  of

"Contribution  to  the  Polytechnic".  In  this  year's

Estimates the contribution to the Polytechnic is  shown

under    the   Head,   Contributions   and   Charitable

Allowances, a practice not in keeping with the  dignity

of that institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to housing, the terms of a subsidy to the

Housing  Board are being discussed, and I  expect  that

these  will  be settled next year. Provision  for  this

will be applied for in a supplementary estimate in  the

course of 1962. In the meantime, substantial sums  have

been  provided  both  in this year's  and  next  year's

Development Estimates to finance the Board  by  way  of

loans.  Thus,  1962 will be another year in  which  the

expansion of social services is kept up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Revenue Estimates, 1962</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The favourable trend in revenue collections is

expected  to  continue  into 1962.  The  1962  estimate

($391.1  million) is $46.3 million more than  the  1961

estimate ($344.8 million). The yield from Income Tax is

expected to exceed the 1961 estimate of $75 million  by

$5  million. Property Tax will yield $14.4 million more

than  the 1961 estimate of $31.6 million. Receipts from

Tobacco  Duties  are also expected to exceed  the  1961

estimates  by  $3  million,  based  on  the  trend   of

consumption  at present. Liquor Duties are expected  to

increase from $23.1 million estimated for 1961 to $26.0

million. Stamp and Estate Duties are estimated to yield

$0.3  million and $1.3 million respectively  more  than

the  1961  estimates of $3.6 million and $3.2  million.

Further,  increases are expected in respect  of  Postal

Receipts   and   Telecommunications   Receipts,   Motor

Vehicles  Taxes,  Rents and Interests  and  Singapore's

share of the Currency Profits. There are also increases

in  the  small items which are too numerous to  detail.

But   two  large  new  items  appear  in  next   year's

Estimates. The first is Reimbursement by the Federation

Government   of  part  of  the  Singapore  Government's

contribution to the University of Singapore, being  its

contribution to cover Federation students  studying  at

the  University. This amounts to $4 million, and  is  a

per-contra  item against the expenditure vote  of  $8.5

million  shown under the Expenditure Estimates  of  the

Ministry of Education. The other is the Contribution by

the  U.K. Government towards the cost of Local  Defence

Services.  This amounts to $4.7 million.  Now  for  the

decreases.  The  falling trend  in  the  collection  of

Petroleum  Duties is reflected in the  decrease  of  $2

million  shown  in the 1962 estimate against  the  1961

estimate  of  $38.5 million. There is also  $½  million

decrease  in  Entertainment  Duty.  The  estimate   for

Sweepstake  revenue has been readjusted,  and  in  1962

will  show a reduction of $1.5 million as compared with

the   1961   estimate  of  $8.0  million.  As  regards,

Commercial Broadcasting, I have taken into account  the

current year's collection as well as the proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



introduction   of   commercial  broadcasting   in   the

Federation  of  Malaya. On these bases,  the  yield  is

expected to be $700,000 less than the 1961 estimate  of

$2.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue forecasts are necessarily affected by the

vagaries of our entrepot trade which is so sensitive to

the  effects  of  trade  fluctuations  in  neighbouring

territories.  The  forecasts  made  of  revenue  yields

assume that there will be no calamitous decline in  the

prices  of  primary products nor any  boom  conditions.

Neither of these extreme conditions is likely and, with

reasonably  good  fortune, we  may  see  our  estimates

realised.



<br><br><i>Summary of Expenditure and Revenue in 1962</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With expenditure estimated at $394.0 million and

Revenue at $391 million, the Budget for 1962 will be an

almost  balanced one. It is a budget intended  to  keep

the public services going in the direction laid down in

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech while the  people

and  the  State  get down to working out  the  detailed

arrangements  of merger and map out the future  as  the

twelfth State of the Federation.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the Development Estimates. Development

projects differ from other activities of the Government

in  that it is not easy to consider them in a framework

of  annual  estimates.  The  reason  is  obvious.  Many

projects take more than one year to complete. Even  for

short-term  projects, work may be started in  one  year

and  completed in the next. Hence there is need to look

forward over a longer period than one year and this  is

one of the reasons why a Development Plan is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose to consider the Development

Estimates  against the framework of the  State's  Four-Year  Development Plan. First, I shall give  a  general

financial outline of development expenditure  in  1961.

Then  I shall proceed to an examination of the progress

achieved  in  some  of  the more important  development

projects in the Four-Year Plan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><i>DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE 1961</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961, the amount voted for development expenditure

was  $166.2  million. It is difficult to  say  at  this

stage  just how much of this sum would have been  spent

by the end of the year for reasons which I have already

mentioned  before.  Preliminary  estimates  show   that

Development Expenditure would amount to about  $100  to

$110 million. This is an all-time record for Singapore.

A  further  sum  of  $54 million has  been  entered  as

revotes  for  next  year. Much of this  sum  represents

expenditure already committed, but the bills  will  not

be presented for actual payment this year. In assessing

the  performance in the first year of the Plan,  it  is

important  to  bear  in  mind certain  difficulties  in

getting  the Plan into stride. First, a fair amount  of

time  has  to  be  spent  in  preparation,  design  and

planning  of public works and building construction.  I

have  already  referred to the shortage of  architects,

quantity  surveyors,  engineers  in  the  Public  Works

Department. This is a source of constant anxiety to the

Government. Further, in many cases, sites for buildings

and routes for roads require preliminary steps, such as

the  acquisition of land and resettlement of squatters,

before work can actually proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tide over the present shortage of technical

personnel,  we have tried to recruit men from  overseas

on   short-term  contracts  pending  the  training  and

recruitment   of  local  personnel.  I   have   already

previously  mentioned  that we tried  to  recruit  from

Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Japan, and Israel and

we are in communication with these Governments. To this

list   must   be   added  Western   Germany.   Overseas

recruitment is by no means an easy task as the shortage

of   experienced  technical  personnel  is   worldwide.

Further, recruitment procedures have to be agreed  with

the government of the countries concerned and this is a

time-consuming  process. Some small  success  has  been

achieved, though I hope that next year we shall be able

to  get more staff. We have so far been able to recruit

from  Israel  two engineers and one architect,  men  of

substantial experience. They have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



offered  three year contracts and should be  coming  to

Singapore soon on completion of certain formalities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we have accelerated the training of

local  staff  to acquire the qualifications  needed.  A

total number of 93 scholarships was awarded in the last

two  years of which no less than 76 relate to  training

in  technical and specialist occupations. In  the  next

few  years, the number of scholarships for training  in

professions experiencing short supply will  be  stepped

up.  But  the  acquisition of such professional  skills

will  take  a  long time and we shall reap the  rewards

only after five or six years, or more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to review the progress of the more

important  projects entered in the  Four-Year  Plan.  I

will discuss the Plan under the main heads in which  it

was divided, namely, Economic and Social Development.



<div align="center"><i>ECONOMIC SECTOR</i></div>

<br><br><i>Economic Development Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Economic Development Board

on  the  1st  August will prove to  be  a  landmark  in

Singapore's  economic history. The Board  will  be  the

instrument through which the State will mount its major

effort to industrialise the economy. The Government has

appointed a senior civil servant to the chairmanship of

the  Board. Other members representing banking, trade,

professional  and  trade  union  interests  have   been

appointed. The Board has recruited a Director, who  was

sent  to  Singapore  under  the  United  Nations'  Opex

Programme, and he assumed duty a month ago. Further key

personnel are required and the United Nations are being

approached for urgent assistance. The staff needed  are

a  senior industrial economist, an officer to head  the

Technical  Consultant Service and three other  officers

to staff the service. These three officers are, one, an

industrial  designer, two, an industrial engineer,  and

three, an industrial accountant. There is also need for

a  chemical  engineer and a mechanical engineer.  Local

recruitment for the staff of the Board has taken  place

by  secondment  to  the  Board  of  two  administrative

officers both with honours.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



degree  in  economics, and a mechanical  engineer  with

very   high  qualifications.  Direct  recruitment   for

additional  staff  is in progress.  In  addition,  four

students  with excellent results in last year's  Higher

School  Certificate  examinations in  Science  subjects

were   awarded  scholarships  to  pursue   courses   in

Mechanical,  Electrical  and  Chemical  Engineering  in

Britain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has only recently commenced work. Much of

this  work will be to complete the preparations already

set  on  foot  before  its  establishment.  Some  solid

progress, however, has already been registered. A  loan

of $0.5 million on favourable terms has been made to  a

local  shipbreaking  firm  in  line  with  Government's

policy   to  encourage  shipbreaking.  There  are   six

applications  now  for loans being  considered  by  the

Board  amounting  to  $4.5  million.  Applications  for

pioneer  status in industry are processed in the  first

instance  by  the Board. At present 12 industries  have

been  granted  pioneer status. They have an  authorised

capital  of $104.5 million and a subscribed capital  of

$86.2  million.  More  than 1,300 additional  permanent

jobs  would have been created when all these industries

are  in  production.  At present, five  have  commenced

production  and another two more will do so before  the

end  of  the  year.  There are 27 new applications  for

pioneer status currently under consideration. These are

expected  to  provide permanent jobs for 1,900  persons

and have a total authorised capital of $105.5 million.



<br><br><i>Industrial Research Unit</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assistance of the New Zealand Government,

our  plan to establish the Industrial Research Unit  is

now  nearly complete and it is expected that  the  Unit

would  commence functioning early next year.  The  Unit

will   assist   local  manufacturers  to  solve   their

production problems. Local staff has been recruited and

two members are now in New Zealand undergoing training.



<br><br><i>Jurong Project</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work has commenced on the development of the Jurong

industrial site and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



progress    is    satisfactory.   To    ensure    rapid

implementation   of   this   important   project,   the

Government has formed a new organisation known  as  the

Jurong  Industrial  Development  Unit,  headed  by   an

engineer  seconded from the P.W.D. and a  surveyor  and

planner. The Unit works under the general direction  of

the  Economic  Development Board. Some  $600,000  would

have been spent by the end of the year and works to the

value  of another $250,000 have already been committed.

Further, a sum of $4.3 million has been spent  on  land

acquisition. So far, the main works in progress are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the construction of the South Access road,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the construction of a culvert at the Jurong River,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the levelling of Hill No. 12 and associated reclamation works.

<div align="center"><h4>	</h4></div>



<br><br>Surveying  of other hills to be levelled is proceeding.

In  addition, test borings of the proposed  wharf  line

are nearing completion. These works now in progress are

giving  jobs  to  more than 220 men,  of  whom  70  are

residents of Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, development work in Jurong will be

considerably  stepped up and it is  expected  that  $15

million  will be needed to pay for earth works,  roads,

development  of  the  wharf area, reservoir  to  supply

industrial  water, sewerage, drainage, etc. The  target

for 1962 has been fixed as follows. By March next year,

it  is hoped that the site for the Steel Mill (Phase I)

would  have  been completed. By late 1962, electricity,

water  supply  and telephone services would  have  been

brought  to  the  area. By the end of 1962,  the  first

phase  of  the lighter wharf should have been completed

with one berth westward of Tanjong Kling ready by June,

and,  if  justified by need, a second berth soon  after

that.  Work on the light industries area north  of  the

Access  Road should be completed by August 1962,  while

part of the heavy industry area should be available for

occupation by the end of 1962.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Other Industrial Estates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the main Industrial Centre at Jurong,

four  small industrial estates are in an advanced stage

of   completion.  They  will  provide  sites  for  :140

factories.  These  industrial  estates  are  sited   at

Redhill, Tanglin Halt, Bendemeer and Kampong Ampat.  On

some  of  these sites, standard factory units  will  he

built.  Thirty-four standard factories are planned  for

Redhill  itself;  of these, eight have been  completed.

The  Housing and Development Board, which is in  charge

of  general supervision of these estates, has  reported

that   applications  for  factories   and   sites   are

satisfactory.



<br><br><i>Kallang Project</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to reclaim land in the swamps in the area

known as the Kallang Pudding. While the general outline

has  been worked out, the detailed design has not  been

proceeded  with.  Owing  to the shortage  of  technical

personnel,  it  has  been necessary for  the  Singapore

Government to make a request to the Government of  West

Germany  for  technical assistance in the planning  and

design of the scheme.



<br><br><i>Public Utilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power and water expansion projects will be financed

by  a  World  Bank  loan, consultants  to  produce  the

details  and  specifications of the new  Power  Station

have  been  appointed and the work of designing  is  in

progress.  The  choice  of consultants  for  the  water

expansion scheme is under consideration.



<br><br><i>East Wharf Project</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the four new berths laid down in the

Four-Year  Plan  was completed in May  this  year.  The

other three berths will be completed next year.



<br><br><i>Civil Aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good progress is being made on extending the runway

from  8,000 to 9,000 feet. In fact, the work is nearing

completion.  The design of a new passenger terminal  is

about  to be completed and tenders are expected  to  be

called for early next year. In addition,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



agreement  on types of telecommunications equipment  to

be  used  by  our Airport has been reached between  the

Governments  of Singapore and the United Kingdom.  This

is  to  fulfil  the  conditions for the  grant  by  the

British   Government  towards  telecommunications   and

navigational aids development. For airport  development

projects,  it is expected that $4 million of the  grant

of $6.5 million would be claimed next year.



<br><br><i>Roads</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The somewhat ambitious Four-Year Programme for road

works  is being reexamined. The Public Works Department

has worked out a revised programme and I propose to set

up a Roads Review Committee to study this revised Plan,

taking  into account all development requirements  such

as  industrial, commercial, residential, traffic,  etc.

The   Roads   Review   Committee   will   consist    of

representatives  from the Economic  Development  Board,

the  Urban  and Rural Services Consultative  Committee,

the   Housing  and  Development  Board,  the   Planning

Department, the Public Works Department, the  Registrar

of  Vehicles,  the  Traffic  Police  and  the  Economic

Development Division of my Ministry. The Committee will

evaluate  the revised programme and arrange priorities,

bearing  in  mind the capacity of the Roads Section  of

the Public Works Department.



<div align="center"><i>SOCIAL SECTOR</i></div>

<br><br><i>Schools</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory progress has been made on the School

Building  Programme.  Ten schools have  been  completed

this year, six primary and four secondary. Another  ten

are  in  an  advanced stage of construction.  Work  has

commenced  on  another nine schools, four primary,  two

secondary  and  three secondary technical.  It  is  the

policy  of  the Government to build larger  and  taller

schools. As a result of the number of schools completed

this year, there are available places for an additional

10,560  children.  With schools soon to  be  completed,

there  will  be  places for a further 10,560  children.

This is a satisfactory achievement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Four-Year Development Plan published details

of  the Housing Programme of the P.A.P. Government,  it

was received with mixed and deep feelings, with hope by

those  in  need  of  housing, with sour  scepticism  in

politically  hostile  quarters. The  target  of  10,000

buildings a year represents nearly three times the best

that had been achieved in any one year in the past, and

four  to five times the average performance of previous

governments. For the first year of the Plan,  a  target

of  7,096  homes was set. This target is likely  to  be

over-fulfilled. The last report I have  is  that  4,410

homes  have  already been completed at Bukit  Ho  Swee,

Tiong Bahru, MacPherson and Queens-town. Another 11,257

are   under  construction,  of  which  3,044  will   be

completed by the end of this year. The number of  homes

expected to be completed this year is therefore  7,454.

The  Board expects to meet its future target of  10,000

homes a year well in advance of its time-table. The end

of  next  year  will  see  the  end  of  the  long  and

frustrating years of waiting for decent homes  by  more

than  10,000  families on the register  of  applicants.

Some  have waited for six or even eight years. By  next

year  there  will  be  a home for  each  one  of  these

families,  and  at  rents they can afford.  This  is  a

record  achievement in the provision of public  housing

and  can  be  claimed as a major success  of  the  P.A.P.

Government. The achievement is all the more  remarkable

if  we  bear  in mind that the Housing and  Development

Board  had to start with what was left of the  wreckage

of  the  former S.I.T. For this outstanding performance

we  are greatly indebted to the honorary members of the

Board  and  the  permanent officers who  implement  the

policy.  In  particular,  I  must  mention  the  drive,

resourcefulness and skill they have displayed under the

able guidance of the Chairman of the Board.





<br><br><i>Television</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning has reached an advanced stage and tenders

for  equipment  had  been under detailed  scrutiny  for

months. Negotiations are in the final stages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



Delivery  of  equipment is expected to be made  by  the

middle of next year. The Government intends to commence

television  broadcasting once the Transmitting  Station

is  ready. A permanent television studio may take  some

time  to  build,  but,  in the  meantime,  a  temporary

building  could provide a two-channel service of  three

to  four  hours  a  day, which  could  be  operational

sometime late next year.



<br><br><i>National Theatre</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site at King George V Park has already been

levelled  and  piling work for the  foundation  of  the

Theatre will begin shortly. The Theatre is expected  to

be completed by the rend of next year.



<div align="center"><i>1962 DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our development proposals for 1962 follow, in the

main, the proposals for expenditure already set out  in

the State Development Plan. With the exception of a few

new projects, the others are continuing ones which have

been  initiated  this year, or for which  it  has  been

possible  to go into more detailed planning this  year.

The  new  projects  included in the Development  Budget

have  been  clearly marked as such, and  I  propose  to

discuss  only  the major ones. There are two  of  them,

namely:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A multi-storey car park;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House.

<div align="center"><b>	</b></div>



<br><br><i>Multi-storey car park</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a multi-storey car park is one which

has  been given long and careful study by both motorist

organisations  and public authorities in  the  past.  A

provision of $2 million has been entered under Head  D.

19  in  the Draft Development Estimates for 1962 for  a

multi-storey car park to be built in the centre of  the

City.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a multi-storey car park is now more

pressing than ever. In common with most growing  cities

the  traffic  problem  in Singapore  is  becoming  very

acute,  because  of the increasing number  of  vehicles

coming on to the road every month. An average of 550



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



new cars are being registered every month, and the rate

of  increase  of motor cycles and scooters  has  lately

become  quite  phenomenal. Between September  1960  and

September 1961 the number of motor cycles and  scooters

on  the  register increased from 17,244 to  26,008,  an

average  increase  of  730 per month.  While  all  this

testifies to a measure of affluence in our society,  it

also increases our traffic problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed site for the multi-storey car park is a

piece  of  vacant Crown land bounded by  Cecil  Street,

Cross Street and Market Street. Detailed plans have not

yet  been drawn up but it is envisaged that a ramp type

garage  of  9  or  10 storeys high will be  constructed

capable  of  accommodating 800 to 900 cars and  a  fair

number  of motor cycles and scooters. The garage,  when

completed, will   be  operated  by  the   Government.

Preliminary  estimates of revenue and expenditure  show

that the garage should be self-supporting.



<br><br><i>Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Union House project is a fulfilment of the

P.A.P. Government's pledge to the workers of Singapore.

The  building  which is to be erected will  incorporate

the  Singapore Conference Hall, and will  be  sited  on

approximately three acres of land at Shenton Way.  Soil

tests  have  been  completed and  a  competition  among

Singapore architects for the design of the building  is

in  progress.  Premiums amounting to  $6,000  would  be

awarded to the first, second and third prizes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost for this new project has been

estimated at $4.15 million, of which $3 million will be

required  for  the  building itself.  The  building  is

expected  to  hold between five and eight storeys,  and

the facilities will be varied and substantial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear need for a Conference Hall of

adequate   size   and  with  adequate   facilities   in

Singapore.  With  the achievement  of  independence  of

Asian countries and their subsequent membership of  the

United Nations and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



its agencies, each year sees innumerable conferences of

delegates  of  independent  Asian  nations.  Singapore,

standing  on  the  verge  of  independence,  should  be

prepared   to  make  its  contribution  to  the   great

international  effort in Asia to bring Asian  countries

closer together to discuss their common problems. As it

stands  in  the  centre of international  sea  and  air

communication routes, Singapore is well placed to serve

as a venue for many of these conferences. But we do not

possess the facilities needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, a Conference Hall with the Trade Union

House  in  the  same building should be constructed  as

soon  as  possible. It is not only a matter of national

prestige;  if we were to act as host to other  nations,

we  should see to it that the facilities we provide are

of adequate standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided that the

Conference  Hall  should  be  a  substantial  one.  The

design,  construction and equipment of the Hall  should

seek   to   attain  acceptable  standards  of  dignity,

elegance  and  taste. There will be an  air-conditioned

auditorium which will seat 1,000 people. There will  be

provision    in   the   auditorium   for   simultaneous

translation   equipment   which   is   used   in    all

international  conferences. In  addition  to  the  main

auditorium,  there  will  be another  three  conference

rooms   each  of  about  1,000  square  feet,  a  large

reception  hall  and  lounge  with  a  buffet  service,

library  and reading rooms, a theatrette, a canteen,  a

kitchen,  as  well  as  residential  accommodation  for

visiting trade unionists and conference delegates.  The

offices  and conference rooms of the Trade Union  House

will be sited in the same building.



<br><br><i>New Revenue Proposals</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to revenue proposals for

1962.  It is obvious that this is not the time for  new

taxes  and  I do not intend to introduce any new  taxes

next  year,  nor  to raise existing ones.  Only  import

duties  may be introduced or varied if it is necessary,

to   protect  local  industries.  I  would  take   this

opportunity to announce that the Government has decided

not to proceed with two of the major tax measures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



announced  in the last Budget. The taxes concerned  are

the Business Registration Tax and Fees to be levied  on

certain   professional  persons  in  private  practice.

Legislation  to  authorise these  new  taxes  had  been

completed  after  discussion with several  professional

associations.  By  the  time  these  discussions   were

completed  and  legislation drafted, the  prospects  of

merger  and a reunification of the professional  bodies

and  associations became a pressing point  against  our

creating  anomalies which would add to the difficulties

after merger. Moreover, there was less justification to

proceed  with the introduction of these measures,  when

the  first  draft  of  next year's Budget  showed  that

expenditure  and  revenue  could  be  held  in  balance

without these measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, intends to proceed with

introducing legislation to regulate the registration of

certain professions, such as accountants and engineers,

which  at  present  are not covered by  any  Ordinance.

Members  of the professions concerned have stated  that

they  would  welcome  such a move in  the  interest  of

maintenance of standards of their profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to make a review next year of the incidence

of  the Property Tax on attap houses. There has been  a

great deal of misunderstanding on the liability to  tax

on  attap houses. Many of these houses are occupied  by

poor  people  who cannot afford better  homes.  On  the

other  hand,  illegal builders are in the  practice  of

setting  up  attap  houses  on  unauthorised  land  and

selling or renting them out to unsuspecting members  of

the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rates of property tax in rural areas were

raised last year, special concession was given to attap

houses.  These  properties were  not  affected  by  the

increases  in  the rates of tax. Further,  all  houses,

whether  built of attap and plank or otherwise,  retain

the  old rates of tax if their annual value is $240  or

less.  But,  of course, yearly revaluations  of  annual

values  do  take  place  as a  matter  of  course.  And

properties  which  were  under-valued  have  had  their

annual values raised. Accordingly, some owners



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



of  attap houses thought that this was contrary to  the

policy outlined in the last Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been represented to me by Government

Assemblymen that in the case of attap houses  in  areas

bearing the maximum rate, that is 36 per cent, there is

a  case  for making some concessions to owner-occupiers

of  attap  houses, on the grounds that these houses  do

not  enjoy all the facilities which permanent buildings

do.  For  instance, roads in districts  where  most  of

these attap houses are found are usually unmetalled and

in  poor  condition. Few of these houses  are  supplied

with   water,  light,  modern  sanitation,   or   other

amenities. I propose to have these problems re-examined

to  see  whether or not concessions in the way  of  tax

reduction are justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this may be the last Budget of the

State of Singapore under its present Constitution as  a

self-governing  State.  If  not  the  last,   it   will

certainly be the penultimate, for by next year,  or  by

1963  at  the latest, we would have merged into Greater

Malaysia. No one could have foreseen the pace of events

at  which  we  have  advanced in the  last  few  months

towards  our  destiny of independence  through  merger.

This is the goal towards which the P.A.P. wants to lead

the country, and we are now in sight of fulfilment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years, the citizens of Singapore have

had  more than a fair share of turmoil and tribulation.

Perhaps more is yet to come. But it is remarkable  that

even  under these troubled conditions, we were able  to

press  ahead as vigorously as we did. But once we  have

passed  through  these troubled waters  and  move  into

calmer  seas, the talent and energy of our people  will

find immeasurably greater outlets of expression. For in

Greater Malaysia, not only will we have a strong stable

central  government  which  will  give  certainty   and

purpose of direction in political affairs, but we shall

also have an immensely wider field for the exercise  of

our industry and enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Amendment

[21st November, 1961] to Question [20th November, 1961],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it, has always been the avowed objective

of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve the

reunification of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya and to remove the artificial division created by

the British by their policy of "divide and rule", this

House affirms and declares that the first objective of

all true patriots of Malaya is to achieve the

reunification of these two territories in a merger of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.".-(The

Minister for Labour-Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim). Which

Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To leave out from "a" in the second last line to the

end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation  as  the

twelfth  state  and with all its Citizens automatically

becoming  Federal  Citizens on Merger  Day".'-(Dr  Lee Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br>4.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I borrow a

phrase used by the Prime Minister? He said last

night - he was talking of another Member - "He was

eloquent, but what has he said?" For six full days,

Sir, we have been sitting here. I believe today is the

seventh. Both the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis have

been very eloquent. But what have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



they said? Out of every hour of speech. Sir, about two-thirds of the hour are taken up with political attacks,

probably  one-sixth  washing  dirty  linen,  and   one-sixth - this is quite a generous proportion, Sir - probably

on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis have shown

that  they  are more interested in the welfare  of  the

Party than the State or the people. Both have found fit

to  use  a merger - such an important issue as merger,

which is actually the pivoting point of the welfare  of

Singapore  and  the people - to vie for power!  Both  are

equally    guilty,   Sir.   The   motion    is    quite

straightforward. But the Minister, in  introducing  the

motion, tried to make the word "merger" mean the P.A.P.

merger.  Then  the  natural  reaction  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is  that  they wanted to make  it  a  Barisan

Sosialis merger. Then what caps the confusion was  when

the  Member for Hong Lim, leader of the United People's

Party,  said that he supported both the phoney and  the

genuine  merger.  Sir, this is not  surprising  because

they  all  came from the same camp. They had  the  same

training  and, therefore, they are employing  the  same

methods. All these methods aim at confusing the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common feature, Sir, with the P.A.P. and the

Barisan  Sosialis is their arrogance. Had the  Minister

not introduced his motion with such arrogance and abuse

and suspicion flung across at the Barisan Sosialis, the

motion   might  have  been  well  received   and   more

appropriately  treated, and we, Sir,  might  have  been

spared six days' debate on the amendment - or seven days,

including today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time there is a quarrel within the P.A.P.,

we  have to sit here day after day. Once we even sat up

to  4.00  o'clock in the morning - just to  witness  this

quarrel and dissension within the

Party.  In  such  instances, as in this one,  important

matters  of State have had to be put aside and  delayed

just  to listen to this quarrel first. Sir, this  is  a

disgraceful  abuse  of  parliamentary  democracy.   The

P.A.P. has  spent  more  time  here  quarrelling   and

fighting  for power among themselves than  working  for

the State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the six days, Sir, during this

debate  on  the  amendment, fits beautifully  into  the

P.A.P. pattern of behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, in 1959, during their first

year of office, the Prime Minister spent his leisure in

this Chamber shooting at dead ducks and gunny sacks and

in  humiliating the English-educated who, according  to

him,   were  emasculated,  devitalised,  deculturalised

people,  who should go down on their bended  knees  and

thank their gods that their souls have been spared.  In

the  second  year, he was indulging in challenging  the

Member for Hong Lim to fight him outside the Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Opposition consisted of the S.P.A. and

U.M.N.O., Singapore had been warned against Right-wing

suppression. When the Opposition was enlarged by the

Member for Hong Lim and his colleagues, Singapore was

warn ed against Left-wing opportunism. Now when it is

further enlarged by the Barisan Sosialis, we are warned

against Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there are Communists or pro-Communists in

this  Chamber, and if the dignity of this  Chamber  has

been defiled by the presence of Communists, who are the

culprits responsible for it? Who brought them in  here?

The P.A.P. Sir. The Prime Minister last night said, "We

trained  them." Two days ago, I think the Minister  for

Education  said, "We nurtured them." But we,  Sir,  the

Alliance say that they shielded them from the  law,  if

they were Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the six days' debate on the amendment, Sir,

the  Barisan Sosialis have been behaving in exactly the

way they used to behave when they were sitting there on

the  Government  benches. And the Government  applauded

their  behaviour. Today when they are sitting  on  this

side  of the House, their behaviour has been condemned.

But  anyone  could have told them that their  behaviour

was the same as that when they were on that side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment superficially seems to be one

that  everyone should support. As the Member for  Anson

pointed out, do we not want genuine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



merger?  Do  we  not want Singapore to be  the  twelfth

State? Do we not want the 624,000 Singapore citizens to

have  automatic Federal citizenship? Of course, we  do.

But  the fact that the Member for Queenstown has  found

fit,  Sir, when introducing his amendment, to  issue  a

threat  to  the Federation - not only to issue a  threat,

but  also  to  emphasise  the  fact  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis' intention to join up with the Sosialist Party

in  the  Federation after merger in order to  overthrow

the present Government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Socialist forces.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Oh, Socialist forces - I beg your

pardon - suggest  that  there may  be  a  dangerous  hook

inside  this innocent and attractive looking bait.  For

those  who  are  about to swallow this  bait,  Sir,  my

message to them is, beware of the hook. I make this  as

an appeal, Sir. Let every Member in this House reassess

both  the  main motion and the amendment in a  detached

and  unbiased  atmosphere. Let us put the interests  of

the  State and the people of Singapore before  personal

or  even  party  interests and ask ourselves - does  this

motion really need an amendment? - and give ourselves  an

honest answer to that.



<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

has  been so much talk about what is, in fact,  a  very

simple issue at this stage, and the talk has served  to

obscure the real question. Do we or do we not agree  in

principle with the concept of Merger? Months ago, years

ago  everyone,  including the  Barisan  Sosialis,  were

ready to say they wanted merger - an unqualified yes. But

then it was only a dream. Now it is a reality tabled in

this House. Now what have they to say. You would expect

everyone  to greet it as the achievement it really  is.

But  no;  we  find opposition. It is easy  to  pay  lip

service  to a far-off dream, that may never  come  off,

but when it becomes a reality, then is the time to test

for sincerity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Parties have said they want merger. All we are

asked for is our agreement in principle. We are going

no further than the first objective. The Member for

Queenstown has talked of marriage and of the difference

between a wife and a mistress. Well, the period of

courtship does seem to have successfully come to an

end, and we are at the proposal stage. And any woman

will tell you that now is the moment for a straight

"yes" or "no". It is not the time to haggle and impose

impossible conditions, unless you want to lose the

offer. Later, once the union has taken place, then the

process of adjustment occurs - in stages - and a full

relationship is worked out - a working relationship to

try to make that union for better, not for worse. In

accepting the proposal, Sir, we are declaring our faith

that such a union will succeed, and bring benefits to

both parties, as we believe this merger will do. The

proposal, moreover, is a sincere one. Singapore is

being offered an honest union; she is not being

propositioned as a mistress. I would remind the Member

for Queenstown that the real difference between a wife

and a mistress is a legal one. The mistress may, in

fact, enjoy more benefits but they are temporary ones

and she has no security in law. This merger is legal

and constitutional and permanent. Can you call it

anything but a genuine merger?



<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> What is fundamentally at stake? Do

you  want independence from the colonial power? Do  you

want  to  be  reunited with Malaya? These are  national

issues. The Member for Queenstown and his comrades  are

trying  to  reduce them to selfish party  issues,  even

personal  ones. This is a cause of the people,  not  an

excuse  for abuse and personal smears. Why go  to  such

lengths about the stability of the Government?  We  are

not  legislating  for  the future  of  this  Government

alone, or to win the next election. We are deciding the

future destiny of all Parties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



and   of   the  State  as  a  whole.  Of  course, the

opportunists  look at merger for what  they  themselves

can  get  out  of it, which is perhaps why the  Barisan

Sosialis are calculating how many extra seats  will  be

there for them to contest in the Federation. The P.A.P.

prefers to act as the agent of the people. They are the

go  betweens  in  this marriage proposal - the  properly

authorised  go-betweens  on an  election  mandate.  The

Barisan   Sosialis,  having  deserted  their   election

mandate, have only themselves to act for. And as to the

P.A.P. being too weak for their task, they have managed

to  negotiate terms with the Federation that two  years

ago seemed impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the Federation appeared to be the

stumbling-block. The block has been removed only to  be

replaced by one within our own ranks. Having come  this

far towards our goal, it would seem that the Member for

Queenstown  is doing his best to frustrate  the  entire

plan.  His demands are extreme. They could be aimed  at

frightening off the Federation. We all know that if you

are  set  against making a business deal,  you  set  an

impossibly high price on yourself. You demand  in  this

case  automatic citizenship of the Federation, and  you

do  not hesitate to insult the Tunku, because he  is  a

client you wish to drive away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that the Barisan Sosialis are being

deliberately obstructionist. Their objections  are  red

herrings,  to  draw us away from the real  issue.  They

disbelieve the sincerity of the Federation because  the

same  people who once opposed merger are still  at  the

helm.  Yet  I  seem  to remember that  they  themselves

crossed  the  Floor  here, because they  changed  their

minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say we shall become second-class citizens with

only  a token representation in the Federal Parliament.

15  seats  are a pretty big token - second only to  Perak

and more representatives than the Barisans can claim in

this  Assembly. It is not very flattering to  Singapore

politicians and the people's choice to suggest that our

15 will not be able to exert any influence. We can only

gain from becoming part of the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



territory, and for this, we give up nothing. We  remain

first-class  citizens  of Singapore  enjoying  all  our

previous  rights plus independence. In fact, where  the

P.A.P. have negotiated for separate conditions for  us,

they  have  all been in our favour. Far from castrating

or  crippling us, they give us special privileges  over

the  other  States  in education, labour,  Finance  and

trade.  Where  is the sell-out? Where are  the  losses?

Would the Member for Queenstown exchange our education

and  control  of labour for this automatic citizenship?

We  in  fact  get  two  brands of independence - the  new

political   release   from   colonialism    and    full

nationality,  and the old independence or  autonomy  in

what matters most to us. We enter the married state and

are allowed to take our jewels with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the only ones who stand to lose are those who

are  afraid of the Internal Security Council, but these

are not the honest loyal citizens of Singapore whom the

Council cannot touch. There is no longer a principle at

stake.  The  Council will not be like the P.P.S.O.,  an

instrument of the colonial power. It cannot be seen  as

interfering in our affairs because it will  consist  of

our  own local people. We objected to the British lion,

but we do not object to the Malayan tiger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been talk of sacrifice on behalf of the

people. This seems a very noble thought from those  who

were   last  heard  of  looting  furniture  and  sewing

machines   from   their  former  Party  Branches.   But

sacrifice  is  rather vain, is it not? Would  they  not

better  serve  the cause of socialism by joining  their

brothers  in the Federation whom they claim  the  Tunku

and  our  Prime  Minister have  a  common  interest  in

suppressing? This is surely an opportunity to  organise

themselves  through  constitutional  means  on  a  pan-Malayan   basis.   But  perhaps  they   do   not   like

constitutional means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to my first point. We are being offered a

fair,  realistic deal for our people - more than we  ever

expected  at this time last year. Let us not  miss  the

bus through arguing about the kind of seats on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we or do we not want merger?



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, today the  question  before  the

House  is  not  as what the Deputy Prime  Minister  has

said.  It is not a question of whether we want a merger

or not. It is a question of what type of a merger do we

want.  Do  you want the merger proposed by the  P.A.P.,

i.e.,  a  sell-out merger, or do you want  our  Barisan

Sosialis' genuine merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the amendment moved by our

Barisan  Sosialis,  i.e., for  a  genuine  merger?  Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  let me state  why  the  Barisan

Sosialis want a genuine merger. Is the Barisan Sosialis

afraid  of  a  real  merger? Is  the  Barisan  Sosialis

sincere  in  putting forward this genuine merger?  What

are  the  basic  conditions  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis

towards  the merger question? Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,

geographically,       ethnically,       linguistically,

historically, economically and in customs  and  habits,

Singapore  and  the  Federation  were  one  originally.

However,  ever since 1944, Singapore and the Federation

of  Malaya  were  forcibly divided by  the  colonialist

British  Government.  It became  part  of  the  British

colonialist policy to divide and rule. The arrogant and

unreasonable conduct adopted by the British  Government

in  those  days  aroused protests from  the  people  of

Malaya. In spite of protests by the people in those two

territories   against   their   policy,   the   British

colonialists  still  persisted in  carrying  out  their

divide  and  rule policy. In August 1957,  the  British

colonialists  gave  up  the Federation  of  Malaya  and

allowed  it  to  be  independent. On  1st  June,  1959,

Singapore  became  a self-governing State.  Ever  since

that  time,  the separation between the two territories

has  become  more and more marked. Do  the  peoples  of

Singapore  and  the  Federation of Malaya  want  to  be

separated?   Do  the  Left-wing  forces  in   the   two

territories want to be separated? No, not at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we the Left-wing forces have

never  supported  the artificial division  of  the  two

territories.  The peoples in these two territories  are

not  happy  about this division of the two territories.

Therefore, it has been one of our objectives  to  fight

for  a  real  and  genuine  reunification  of  the  two

territories  and to be free from colonialism.  This  is

also  the  main objective of the Left-wing  forces.  We

believe in the integration of the two territories  with

independence in economy and politics, equal rights  for

the people, and democratic freedom. Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, these are our basic aims. A genuine merger between

Singapore and the Federation is one objective for which

we  will never give up fighting. The Right-wing  forces

should not smear us and give warning to us here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my duty to state the

objectives of the Barisan Sosialis as contained in  our

Party  Constitution.  Let  me  now  read  some  of  the

articles  in  our  Party  Constitution.  Article   1 - to

eliminate  colonialism and to establish an  independent

unified nation comprising the Federation and Singapore.

Article  2 - to set up a democratic government  based  on

the  right  of  franchise of the citizens  in  the  two

territories.  Article 3 - to bring  about  a  prosperous,

stable  and  just  economic system.  Article  4 - to  get

together the people of all races to establish a Malayan

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis demand

a  genuine merger of Singapore and the Federation. This

is in accordance with our Party platform and is also in

conformity with the interest of the people.  Our  stand

is firm and resolute. We are not weak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the socialist ideology was

born  in an unjust society. The socialist movement  has

had  its  setbacks and socialists have been prosecuted.

This  is to be expected and it is not surprising. Those

who  make  use of the socialist banner to  deceive  the

people  become turn-coats half-way. This  is  something

which very often occurs in the course of development of

the socialist movement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today we are discussing the

serious problem of merger between the two territories.

We the Barisan Sosialis request a genuine merger

between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. The

leadership of the P.A.P. has said that we are afraid of

merger because we are afraid of a strong Right-wing

Central Government. They have also said that the

Barisan Sosialis want to make use of Singapore as a

base in order to emancipate the people of the

Federation of Malaya. All these accusations are

nonsense. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to ask the

leadership of the P.A.P. whether they are sincere in

seeking a true merger between the two territories of

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. The answer is,

"No, they are not sincere."

What the P.A.P. want is a kind of sellout for the

people of Singapore. According to the P.A.P. logic, we

are afraid of merger because we are afraid of being

arrested. They say that we are opportunists. But I can

honestly tell the leadership of the P.A.P. that what we

are afraid of is that the interests of the people of

Singapore will be endangered if there is no genuine

merger between the two territories, because the people

will not be able to share the same political life as

that enjoyed by the people in the Federation. As to the

threat that the Left-wingers will be arrested by the

Right-wing Government after merger, this is another

matter and it is not important. The socialist movement

has been known to be curbed. History has proved that

the socialist movement has always met with a setback,

after which it becomes all the stronger and develops

faster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have learnt from history

that those who are really afraid of being arrested are

those reactionaries and traitors who sell out the

interests of the people. These people pursue a line of

holding high State posts in order to enrich

themselves - like Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang

Chin-wei, Bao Dai and Chew Swee Kee. For the sake of

their own personal interests, positions and prestige,

these people resort to any means to curb the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



activities  of  patriots and sell out the  people.  The

P.A.P. are now following this line in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Left-wing forces of

Singapore  demand  a  true  merger  between   the   two

territories of Singapore and the Federation of  Malaya.

They  expect that they may be arrested and thrown  into

Changi Goal or detained in St. John's Island. But  true

socialists  work only for what is in the  interests  of

the  people and the future of the country, so that  the

people  can move forward towards a more prosperous  and

happy future. Other things are insignificant and of  no

importance at all to them. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you

do  not  see  genuine anti-colonialists and  socialists

being afraid of oppression from reactionaries. If  they

are  afraid,  they will cringe with fear and  will  not

come forward. You never see that happening.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Nehru, is worshipped  by

our   Prime   Minister.   In   his   struggle   against

colonialism, Mr Nehru spent many years in prison.  The

Indonesian President, Dr Soekarno, in his struggle  in

the  past against the Dutch colonialists, had also been

imprisoned. The Congolese Prime Minister, Mr  Lumumba,

because   of  his  struggle  against  colonialism   and

imperialism,  was  murdered. The  President  of  Partai

Rakyat  in  the Federation of Malaya, Inche  Boestamam,

has  been  imprisoned for his struggle in the socialist

cause.   Singapore's   Leftist   elements   have   been

imprisoned too. Now they are still under detention. Why

are they imprisoned? Why do they suffer? For what? What

they   are   fighting  for  is  only  to  achieve   the

integration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



of  the  two national territories. And they oppose  the

colonial  rule.  They  seek  to  achieve  a  more  just

society. They are not afraid of death, and they do  not

carry   on  the  struggle  for  the  sake  of  personal

interests  or prosperity. Therefore, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

we  the Barisan Sosialis, in our stand for true merger,

were  positive in the past. We are positive at present,

and in future we will also bepositive in our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, according to the Prime Minister's speech, we are not sincere in our demand for true merger. He said we are purposely trying to embarrass

the  Government. He also said that we are afraid of the

Right-wing  Government in the Federation. Mr  Speaker,

for a non-Communist, socialist leader of the P.A.P. to

make such childish utterances is a very sad thing.  Mr

Speaker,  the Prime Minister has said that the  leaders

of  the Barisan Sosialis are capable young men who lack

experience.  Yes, we are still young. We  do  not  have

experience in deceiving the people. We congratulate our

Prime  Minister for his experience in this  respect,  a

very  rich experience. But I regret that a person  with

several  years  - of experience of the  so-called  non-Communist,  socialist  struggle cannot  understand  the

true  meaning of socialism and the development  of  the

socialist  movement.  Perhaps the  Prime  Minister  has

tried to suppress the growth of the socialist movement.

But  I  can  honestly  tell the  Prime  Minister  that,

according  to  the  facts of history  and  my  personal

experience which I have gained from study and learning,

the  socialist  movement is not based on  race,  creed,

religion, colour, or any form of barrier. There  is  no

barrier.  As  long  as  there  is  unreasonableness  in

society, the germ of socialism will grow into  a  plant

and  flower  and bring forth fruit. Because  if  these

unreasonable  conditions in society, the people  become

poorer  and  poorer everyday and they are  deprived  of

their  democratic  rights. All  these  harsh  facts  of

practical  life clearly tell the people that they  must

reform the society in which they live.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member could possibly

touch  on  socialism just on the surface  to  make  his

point. But if he goes into details, then, of course, he

is debating socialism. We are not debating socialism at

the  moment. We are debating merger. As I said, all  he

need do is to touch on the fringe of socialism and make

his point in that way, but he must not go into details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

shall   return  to  the  main  subject.  The  Left-wing

movement in the territories of the Federation of Malaya

and  Singapore existed during the colonial era.  Before

the  establishment  of the P.A.P. in  1954,  there  was

already  a  socialist movement. And there was socialism

before  I  was born. All along the Left-wing  movement-had   met   with  oppression  and  attacks   from   all

reactionary forces. The Left-wing movement could  still

exist  under such conditions and expand. Does  it  mean

that  the  reactionary forces of oppression could  curb

the  Left-wing  movement? No. They cannot  do  so.  The

truth  of  the  matter is that the  socialist  movement

moves according to history, which propels the socialist

movement   forward,  and  in  its  natural  course   it

develops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although at present in the

Federation  there  is  a  strong Right-wing  government

suppressing  the  Left-wing  movement,  our   socialist

comrades, under the banner of the Socialist Front,  are

now  strengthening and expanding their forces and  they

have  extended their influence to every city, town  and

rural   kampong.  The  prospects  for  the  future   of

socialism  are very bright. Socialism is on the  march.

Although  the Socialist Front is in opposition  in  the

Federation  at  present, the oppression  of  socialist

elements there was no better than under  colonial rule.

All  this  could  not  stop the  Socialist  Front  from

developing.  It cannot stop the cause of socialism.  In

Singapore  the Left-wing strength has been attacked  by

the   oppression   of  this  so-called   non-Communist,

socialist  Government. The democratic  rights  of  the

people have been curbed by the Government. Unreasonable

laws have been passed. They are more stringent -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I ask the hon. Member to come

back  to the motion. All this, to my mind, is more than

irrelevant. It is opening out a debate-that has nothing

at all to do with the merger motion before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was

explaining  to  you why we, the Barisan Sosialis,  want

genuine  merger. But the Government says we are  afraid

of  merger  because we are afraid of being  curbed  and

oppressed   by   the  Right-wing  Government   in   the

Federation. Therefore, I have mentioned all these facts

and  reasons to prove that in moving our amendment,  we

are  very sincere in asking what we want. What we  want

is genuine merger and not a phoney merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the rapid development and

progress  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  in  Singapore  has

struck  fear  in  the  heart of the P.A.P.  Government.

Therefore, no matter how bad the circumstances are, the

socialist  movement can still exist  and  develop.  For

instance, the Pahang River must flow out into the South

China  Sea.  The  Rivet Nile must  flow  out  into  the

Mediterranean Sea. The River Thames must flow out  into

the  English Channel. That is a course nobody can  stop

or  alter. Therefore, no matter what kind of oppression

or curb is imposed upon it., the socialist movement can

still  endure  and  progress.  All  these  efforts   at

suppression will be wasted. People in the end will tell

the oppressors what the result will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we the Barisan Sosialis demand a genuine merger. We are ready at any time to suffer the same fate as our comrades in the Federation. We want to

struggle  for  the same aim-and the same  objective  as

long as the people of Singapore and the Federation live

the  same  political life and share and enjoy the  same

citizenship rights.. The socialist movement  will  have

nothing to fear. Only those who do not like to see  the

socialist movement progress will be afraid. Only  these

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



will think of ways to deprive the citizens of Singapore

of  their  citizenship rights. By this they  have  been

exposed as phoney socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since its formation, the Barisan

Sosialis,  has  never altered its stand  in  regard  to

merger of the two territories. We do not want to change

our  stand  now. The stand will also not be changed  in

the future. In this respect the P.A.P. dare not criticise

us.  They  can only allege hypocritically that  we  are

trying  to  embarrass the Government and  that  we  are

afraid of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of history, you can

never find any true socialists who are opposed to  true

unification of the territories into one nation. On  the

other  hand, true socialists will go through  fire  and

water to achieve the unification of the territories and

unity  of  the  country. They will fight very  hard  to

achieve this aim. I cannot understand the so-called non-Communist,  socialist P.A.P. leadership. They  are  now

looking  at  everything through coloured glasses.  They

also   look  through  coloured  glasses  at  this  very

important issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we the Barisan Sosialis have proposed this amendment in order to demand a genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya We do this out

of sincerity and honesty We do this in the interests of

all  the  people. If the people of the two  territories

can truly merge and be united, it does not matter if we

socialists  have to make sacrifices. It  is  worth  our

sacrifices. I hope that hon. Members in this House  can

understand  our sincerity, and not try to  slander,  to

smear  and to indulge in mud-slinging for the interests

of their own Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis' basic

principles  in regard to merger of Singapore  with  the

Federation of Malaya are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A genuine merger of Singapore with the

Federation of Malaya;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Singapore becoming the twelfth State of the

Federation of Malaya;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The present Singapore citizens automatically

become citizens of the Federation on Merger Day;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Singapore citizens can freely take part in

elections  in  any  part in the  Federation.  Of

course, any citizen from the Federation can also

come to Singapore to take part in elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one word, Mr Speaker, we ask that after merger of

the  two territories, the people of the two territories

will be able to enjoy equal political life. This is the

basic attitude of the Barisan Sosialis towards merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question before us is not

whether we want a merger, but whether we want a genuine

merger  or a phoney merger, that is, a sell-out merger.

The  Barisan Sosialis want to achieve a genuine merger.

But  the P.A.P. are opposed to this genuine merger. The

Barisan Sosialis demand that all the Singapore citizens

should become the citizens of the new Federation  after

Merger  Day.  But the P.A.P. want to give up  the  over

600,000  citizens  of Singapore. The  Barisan  Sosialis

demand that after true merger Singapore will become the

twelfth  State  of the new Federation. But  the  P.A.P.

want  Singapore  to  become  only  a  partner  in   the

Federation. The Barisan Sosialis: want the citizens  of

the new Federation to be able to stand for election  in

any  State  in the new Federation. But the P.A.P. only

want the citizens of Singapore to be able to stand  for

election only in Singapore. The Barisan Sosialis demand

that there should be proportional representation in the

Federal  Parliament. But the P.A.P. want  to  determine

the   number  of  representatives  after  taking   into

consideration  the  fact  that  Singapore   will   have

autonomy in labour and education and how much Singapore

will  have  to contribute to the Federation Government.

Mr  Speaker,  these are the basic differences  in  our

demand for merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the question of merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, I wish to give an analogy here. Let me take the example of an integrated

school  introduced by the Government. But it  does  not

mean that the management of integrated schools is being

carried out very well. I mean to say, the rights of the

students in this school are equal. Therefore, this  can

help us to understand what will happen after the merger

of  Singapore  with the Federation  of  Malaya.  The

rights  and  obligations of the  citizens  of  the  two

territories should also be equal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you know that the Government has integrated students from the Chinese stream of education with students from the English stream into

one  school. Students from the two streams of education

were  in  the past separated in different schools.  The

students had their respective obligations and rights in

their  respective  schools. They had  their  respective

principals  in  their schools. But now  when  they  are

integrated into one school, they go to the same school.

This integrated school has one principal. There is only

one  school song. The students go to different  classes

to attend their lessons. The students have the right to

carry  out  various activities in the same  playground.

They use the same auditorium and the same library. They

use  the same Physics laboratory and they can also  use

the  same microscope. They can use the same music hail.

They  can have equal access to the Arts room. Not  only

have they the right to use the same facilities provided

by  the  school and have the same rights, but  what  is

important  is that everyone of them has an equal  right

with the other. They also have the right to elect their

representatives to the students body, for instance, the

Historical Society, the Geographical Society, the  Film

Society,  the  Photographic Study Society,  the  Sports

Society and others.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> On a point of order. Have the

schools or the students mentioned in these examples any

connection with this amendment?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understood the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang to say that he was drawing an analogy between

an  integrated school and the reunification of the  two

territories. But perhaps the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang

does  realise  that he is going into too many  details.

Whatever  he  has  said could have  been  said  in  one

minute.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  been trying to help you and our friends  opposite

to  understand what is the true meaning  of  a  genuine

merger.  Now  let me continue. I: does not matter  from

which  school  the students come. They  have  the  same

rights  and  obligations to elect their representatives

to  be  responsible for various kinds of offices. Every

student  can stand for election as an office-bearer  of

any student body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the students in the school enjoy

the same rights and obligations. In this way the school

can  be said to be a genuine integrated school. We  can

also  call it a genuine merger. If the students do  not

enjoy   the   same  rights  and  do  not   have   equal

obligations, where then is the equality? If there is no

equality, how can we talk about merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya is just like the analogy I have mentioned. It is just like an integrated school. The

basic question is that of equal rights. In other words,

after  merger  the present citizens of  Singapore  must

become the citizens of the new Federation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I draw the attention of the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang to the fact that he has  been

repeating himself about three or four times,  and  that

there is a Standing Order which says that if repetition

becomes  tedious,  the Speaker will draw  attention  to

that  fact  and then, if the Member still  persists  in

tedious repetition, he will request the Member to cease

his speech. We must not have too much repetition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

was  just about to end my speech. If there are no  such

rights, then it is no use for us to talk



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



about  autonomy. What kind of merger will that be then?

Mr  Speaker, Sir, there is a very good Chinese proverb

which  goes like this, "If there is no skin, where  can

the  hair grow?" The meaning is that there is no  place

to  grow any hair. If there is only hair, but no  skin,

what is the use of the hair then? Therefore, in talking

about  a  merger  of Singapore with the  Federation  of

Malaya,  the  same  reason obtains  if,  after  merger,

Singapore citizens can automatically become citizens of

the  Federation. It is as important as the skin on  the

body.  Citizenship rights and autonomy  in  labour  and

education are just like our hair. They are unimportant.

This analogy tells us that if we do not solve the basic

problems, but instead, deal with minor, irrelevant  and

unimportant things and split hairs over minor  details,

then  it will be a waste of time and energy. We  cannot

get  any benefit out of it. On the other hand, we  will

incur a loss as a result of wasting our energy and time

on those minor issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me quote from the Nanyang Siang

Pau  of 22nd November, in which the person who occupies

the  second  seat on the Government Bench, namely,  the

Minister for Finance, in replying to my colleague,  the

Member for Queenstown, on the 21st November, said, "Why

do  the  Barisan  Sosialis want to quarrel  over  these

small  issues?"  These "small issues"  are  citizenship

rights.  The  so-called  "small  issues"  to  him   are

citizenship rights and things like that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the basic principles of the

Barisan  Sosialis  in  regard to merger  is  that  this

should  not endanger the present position of  Singapore

citizens.  The  type of merger should not  degrade  the

status   and  the  rights  of  the  present   Singapore

citizens. But the Minister for Finance said that  these

questions were unimportant. I wish to ask the  Minister

for Finance whether he does remember that the people of

Singapore had fought hard to acquire their citizenship?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b> rose -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Member for Choa Chu Kang has said (just  now)

that  the  Minister for Finance said  that  citizenship

rights  were unimportant. I think he is distorting  the

facts.  Citizenship  rights  can  be  acquired   by   a

constitutional arrangement. It does not mean  that  the

question of citizenship rights is unimportant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, I must tell the hon. Lady, is not

a  point  of  order. It is an argument.  I  shall  look

forward to hearing her speak in due course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I mention all this

only  to  help  our friends opposite  think.  Does  the

Minister for Finance know that the 320,000 citizens  of

Singapore  have  grown up on the soil of  Malaya?  What

must  we  degrade them to the position of  second-class

citizens?  Does  it  mean  that  "citizenship"  is   an

academic  phrase or word? Mr Speaker, Sir, I  use  the

word  "academic" because the Minister for  Finance  has

said  that this is a question pertaining to an academic

exercise. Perhaps I do not understand what is meant  by

an  "academic exercise". The Minister for Finance is  a

Doctor   of   economics.  He  knows   that   the   word

"citizenship"  is  academic. It is  not  realistic  and

practical; therefore, it is not important.  I  wish  to

advise  the  Minister for Finance that if he  wants  to

chop off his own head just because of an academic word,

we  are  not  concerned. But he must not chop  off  the

citizenship   rights  of  over  600,000   citizens   of

Singapore because of this academic

word. This is what the Singapore people cannot tolerate

and let him do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the highest legislative authority

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Kreta Ayer is the

Minister for Finance, if I am not mistaken. He must  be

referred to as the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will take your

advice,  Mr  Speaker. Let me repeat.  May  I  ask  who

elected  the  Minister for Finance? The answer  is  the

citizens  of Singapore. Who elected the Prime Minister?

The  answer  is the citizens of Singapore. Who  elected

the Minister for Culture? The answer is the citizens of

Singapore.  Who  elected all the  Assemblymen  in  this

House?  The  answer is the citizens of  Singapore.  Who

elected  the P.A.P. Government? The answer is also  the

citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to be Singapore citizens to

attend  primary  and secondary schools, the  University

and technical school. One has to be a Singapore citizen

to   apply   for   scholarships   or   bursaries,   and

registration for employment as a seaman. One  has  also

got to be a Singapore citizen to get registered for any

job, apply for a Government post or be a member of  the

Work  Brigade.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  do  not  want  to

enumerate any more examples. From this, we can  clearly

see  that  the  question of citizenship supersedes  all

other  questions.  One  cannot do  anything  without  a

citizenship. It is just like the Monkey King who cannot

jump across the five fingers of the Buddha.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can understand more than I do.

This  House  is  the highest legislative  authority  in

Singapore:  but  after merger, the highest  legislative

authority  will be moved across the Causeway  to  Kuala

Lumpur.  It will not remain in Empress Place any  more.

The  authority  will be removed to Kuala  Lumpur,  just

like   Malacca  and  Penang.  Therefore,  the   present

Singapore citizens should be like the citizens  of  all

the  States  in  the Federation and have  proportionate

representation  in  the  Central  Parliament  in  Kuala

Lumpur.  The  necessary right of the present  Singapore

citizens -

between  Singapore and the Federation, any  citizen  in

the  Federation will be able to stand for  election  in

Singapore. But the P.A.P. is not prepared to fight  for

the   basic   citizenship  rights  of  the  people   of

Singapore. They only fight for the interests of  a  few

people  in  their Party and they sell out the interests

of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we want a genuine merger but the

P.A.P. claim that their type of merger will bring  more

benefits  to  the people of Singapore. What  are  these

benefits?  We  ask  the P.A.P. to tell  us  what  these

benefits  are. As far as I know, there will be  another

Prime  Minister in Singapore. This is the dream of  our

Prime  Minister. There will be another national anthem,

another  national  flag, and other  so-called  national

rights.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if we have all these things,

does  it  mean that we have a genuine merger?  Does  it

mean  that  our  problems will be  solved  if  we  have

national  rights? "National rights" is  the  registered

trademark of the P.A.P. The P.A.P. tries to mislead the

people  by  covering up the mistakes  of  their  regime

which  is going to perish. The P.A.P. hopes to  mislead

and  obscure  the vision of the people by  giving  them

national  rights. They want to make the people  believe

that they will not only retain their citizenship rights

but  they will also get national rights, and that  what

they  are  fighting for is more than what  the  Barisan

Sosialis  are fighting for so as to deceive the  people

of Singapore. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. think that the citizens of Singapore will be as

foolish as a bear and that they can be easily misled.

The fox and the bear with a short tail -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche M. Ismail Rahim (Geylang East)</b> rose -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ismail Rahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  understand what bear the hon. Member is  referring

to. Is it a parliamentary word that can be used, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the Member for Choa Chu

Kang alleged that any Member of this Assembly is a

bear. He was likening the people of Singapore to bears.

If the hon. Member likens any Member of the Assembly to

a bear, then of course he is out of order. Mr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  say  that our friends opposite  are  foxes  or

bears. I am trying to help you understand the analogy I

mentioned just now. In Northern Europe, there is a very

meaningful folk story.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member is becoming a

little  tedious.  He  is  now repeating  his  theme  of

analogies in other parts of his speech. I think he will

be well advised to wind up his speech. Mr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

shall shorten my speech. The cunning tricks adopted  by

the  P.A.P. through its radio and Press conferences are

intended  to  confuse the people. It tells  the  people

that  the time has now come for them to grab the chance

of  a merger between Singapore and the Federation,  and

that  if  they treat the citizenship rights as national

rights they will then get benefits and their lives will

be  happier. It seems that the P.A.P. is very concerned

with  the people's interests. How sincere is it?  As  a

matter  of fact, it is a very fearful trap. The  P.A.P.

is  trying  to set a trap for the people. It  wants  to

chop  off the heads of the people of Singapore  in  the

name of merger for the sake of the minority leaders  in

the Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last few days, the Members

of  this  House have witnessed the struggle of a  dying

Party.  The  speeches of Government Members  have  been

contradictory and inconsistent as a result of which the

people  of  Singapore  are  somewhat  confused.   Which

Minister  should  the people of Singapore  believe  in?

Which  Minister is representing the Government? Or  are

the Ministers representing themselves?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of

order. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to know who wrote

the speech which

the hon. Member is reading with such great labour?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order being whether the

hon. Member is entitled to read. I have suggested in my

circulars  to  Members that if a speech is  made  in  a

language   other  than  English,  copies  of   prepared

speeches be given to interpreters for the sake of  ease

of interpretation. I take it that is what has been done

in this particular case. Mr Ong Chang Sam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): My point is this. I agree

that  copies  of  speeches  should  be  given  to   the

interpreters. But if the speech of the hon. Member  was

written by himself, surely he should not be reading  it

with great difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There are different methods of reading.

Mr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the Member for

Bukit Timah -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not want any debate. Please

continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the P.A.P. profess

themselves  to be non-Communist Socialists,  then  they

should  not  confuse  the  vision  of  the  people   of

Singapore with all kinds of distortions and nonsensical

speeches. Mr Speaker, Sir, if one is confused over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



a  certain matter and one still pursues a certain line,

then the danger is very great. It is just like this. If

you  are  not sure how deep the water is but you  still

insist  on jumping in, then in the end you will  drown,

as a result of which the people will laugh at you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the term "merger" between the two

territories  is not quite clear. The Prime Minister  of

the  Federation said that this is not a complete merger

and  that  a  better term for it i3 a partnership.  The

Prime Minister of Singapore said that this is a kind of

merger and that merger on a partnership basis is better

than  any  other relationship. The Minister for  Health

said  that  this is a kind of merger on  a  partnership

basis. His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his

speech said that merger is impossible. But the Minister

for  Labour,  in  moving his motion, said  that  it  is

merger.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore  are

confused, and are not sure which is Right and which  is

Left. In fact, the P.A.P. intend to throw dust into the

eyes  of  the people of Singapore. They said that  that

kind  of merger is very good because they want to blind

the  people's vision and so confuse them. May I ask the

Government which Minister's speech is correct? And  may

I  ask  the Prime Minister to declare openly, sincerely

and  honestly in this House whether the speech  of  the

Prime Minister of the Federation is correct, or whether

what  he himself has said is correct? Whether the Tunku

has  deceived the people, or whether the Prime Minister

of Singapore has cheated the people?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already warned the Member

that  he is becoming a bit tedious. I think I must  now

read the Standing Order so that he will then perhaps be

compelled to try and bring his speech to a close.  This

is Standing Order 54:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn

attention  to the conduct of a Member, who persists  in

irrelevance, or tedious repetition either  of  his  own

arguments or of the arguments used by other Members  in

debate, may direct him to discontinue his speech.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



But I do not wish to ask the hon. Member to discontinue

his  speech.  I do wish to ask him to be a little  more

relevant, to speak a little more closely to the  merger

question  and  try not to repeat arguments  which  have

been  advanced by Members of his own Party. I have made

a  rough calculation - we have been debating for about 12

hours, i.e., more than two days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what I was saying just now was in order to help you and

the  people  of  Singapore understand  the  meaning  of

merger.  Otherwise, you will be confused,  we  will  be

confused,  and  the people of Singapore  will  also  be

confused over the meaning of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me look into what the Minister

for  Health and Law said. This is the Nanyang Siang Pau

of 23rd November. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We agree with the negotiations but we do not agree

to proposing intransigent proposals. We know that under

true  negotiations  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of

Malaya  will not have generous terms accruing  to  each

side and no generous terms can satisfy either party  on

either side of the Causeway.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, how absurd it is. First, the  P.A.P.

by  itself  along has no right to talk about merger,  a

matter  which concerns all the people. Second, granting

that  the P.A.P. has the right to represent the  people

of  Singapore, does it ask for automatic conversion  of

the   citizens  of  Singapore  into  citizens  of   the

Federation? Third, who authorised the P.A.P. to give up

so generously the first-class citizenship rights of the

people of Singapore? Is the question of merger only  to

satisfy  the interests of the few leaders on the  other

side  of the Causeway? Can the interests of the  people

be regarded as party interests?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Health and Law

said  on 22nd November - let me quote a passage from  his

speech as reported there:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All these flimsy arguments about citizenship,

status,  and  so  on, are invented  by  those  who  are

against   merger.  Nationalists  and   patriots   after

understanding that there are no basic differences  will

not  insist  on  saying that there is a  difference  in

citizenship status.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is meant by a "flimsy and

phoney" argument? A first-class citizen is demoted to a

second-class  citizen - is that not a  fact?  Is  it  not

false?  Is  it  not  hypocrisy? Does the  Minister  for

Health and Law know what is the definition of the  word

"invention"? By saying that there are different classes

of  citizens, this inventor then should be  the  P.A.P.

who invented all these different classes of citizens. I

am  only mentioning numerous facts to prove that  there

are  different classes of citizens. What we mention  is

based on facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law accused us of being anti-merger and of giving flimsy or hypocritical arguments. Mr Speaker, in the course of history, you can never see the true patriots and nationalists who will insist on giving away their country, their national flag and their national anthem and their rights to acquire unequal rights and status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government of the Federation, in opposing the South African apartheid policy, has set a very good example. But if the people of Singapore are

likened to the coloured people of South Africa, and the

citizens of the 11 States of the Federation are likened

to  white men, what difference is there in this kind of

analogy? This comparison is very apt. I sincerely  hope

that  under  true  negotiations  of  merger,  Singapore

citizens  will  have  the same equal  rights.  Let  the

P.A.P. declare   what   are   the   definitions    of

"nationalist",  "patriot",  and  the  so-called   "non-Communist".  What is the theoretical basis  of  a  non-Communist socialist?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us examine this. The Minister

for  Culture,  as you know, is a non-Communist  Malayan

Socialist.  He is the Chief of Staff in promoting  this

Malayan culture. He asked, with reference to the speech

of  the Member for Queenstown, how many of the 600,000-odd citizens of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



could  enjoy  this right? How many of them  think  they

would  go  to the Federation to stand for election?  He

also  said that even if the majority of the voters were

given  that right, they were not interested in standing

for  election.  Mr  Speaker,  how  irresponsible  that

speech  is. The people of Singapore now know  that  the

Government of Singapore is dealing with the problem  of

citizenship  on this basis. That is why the citizenship

rights of the people of Singapore can so easily be sold

out.  I want to tell the Minister for Culture this:  of

course,   it  cannot  be  that  all  these  600,000-odd

Singapore  citizens will stand for  election,  but  the

624,000  citizens  want  to enjoy  the  same  political

rights as the citizens of the Federation. And Singapore

citizens  want  to move about freely in  the  other  11

States in the Federation. The 624,000 citizens want  to

enjoy  the  same economic life. May I ask the  Minister

for  Culture what is meant by parliamentary  democracy?

What  is the basis of parliamentary democracy?  Is  not

voting the basic political right of the people? In this

world, is there any inequality of rights existing in  a

socialist country? What kind of socialism is the P.A.P.

following?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, of the 624,000 citizens of Singapore, how many of them can make use of these rights? They will not strive just for the sake of standing for

election?  What is conveyed by these two sentences?  It

shows  that  the  Minister for Culture  is  ungrateful.

During the time of the elections, he went round to  all

the voters to persuade them to come out to vote.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This again is a repetition of the

same  theme.  I think it must be about the  sixth  time

that the Member has played on this theme. I do ask  him

once again to come to the end of his speech as soon  as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a few minutes

I  shall  wind  up my speech. According to  the  phoney

merger  by  the P.A.P., the citizens of Singapore  will

get  inequality  when  they live,  but  they  will  get

equality when they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



die.  The citizens of Singapore have no-right to  enjoy

the  same  political  life. However,  the  citizens  of

Singapore  have  the obligation to  be  called  up  for

service to defend the new Federation. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I do not mean that the citizens of Singapore should not

be conscripted to defend our motherland. What I mean is

that  under  the  phoney  merger  by  the  P.A.P.,  the

citizens of Singapore and the Federation have the  same

obligations but they do not enjoy the same rights.  How

can you say this is a merger? How can you say that this

is  a  reunification  of the two territories?  Is  this

equality?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few days, the Members of

the  Barisan Sosialis have clearly reflected the  views

of  the people of Singapore. If the Party in power want

to  fight for the interests of the people, they have to

be  awakened  now.  They should stop selling  out.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Buddhists say, "Put down your  sword,

and  then you will become a Buddha." Let those  friends

opposite ponder over this saying. Otherwise the  people

of Singapore will send them to hell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment to the

motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are that at 8.50 a.m. yesterday, car SU

4444  went into St. George's Road and proceeded to  the

Whampoa Secondary School examination centre. SU 4444 is

a car belonging to Tommy Koh's father and often used by

him.  A  young Chinese sitting in the front seat beside

the  driver was identified by an intelligence  observer

as  Tommy Koh Thong Bee. Since receiving this telegram,

further investigation have been made for corroboration.

It  would  now appear that the young man  next  to  the

driver  of  the car SU 4444 is a member of the  family

for whom he was mistaken.

<div align="center"><h4>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do not use unreasonable terms to deal with this serious

question  in this Assembly. I want to pinpoint  on  the

amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown. I  oppose

his   amendment   because   it   is   inopportune   and

unrealistic. Its purpose, as has been clearly shown  by

the Barisan Sosialis, is entirely to oppose merger. Why

should they talk about genuine merger? They talk  about

Singapore  becoming  the  twelfth  State  of  the   new

Federation.   They   talk  about   Singapore   citizens

automatically becoming citizens of the Federation.  All

this   is  an  eyewash.  Let  us  not  try  to  deceive

ourselves.  Let  all the people of Singapore  know  now

that  the Barisan Sosialis are opposed to merger. Their

defection from the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



is  because  the  P.A.P. Government  supports  and  has

arranged  for a merger with the Federation  Government.

That is why they had to resort to any means and tactics

to  break  away from the P.A.P. Therefore,  their  talk

about genuine merger and all the rest of it is only  to

hoodwink  the  people  or  calculated  to  blind  their

vision.   Their   true  purpose   is   to   delay   the

implementation of merger and to sabotage any conditions

for the merger of a true democratic country. Therefore,

we can say that the true purpose of the amendment moved

by  the Member for Queenstown is to sabotage the  work

of  merger. They know that merger is now in view.  They

cannot  stop it. But on the other hand, they are afraid

of merger because they know that after merger, internal

security  will  be  in the hands of  a  strong  Central

Government  of  the  Federation. The Communist  forces,

which  they represent, cannot develop in Singapore  any

more.  On the contrary, they will be checked. They  are

afraid  of  merger. But they cannot  stop  merger  from

coming  into  effect. How can they delay  merger?  They

must  find  some  way  to delay merger,  to  delay  the

unpleasant  day from coming. They have  thought  out  a

condition  to  make the people of Singapore  afraid  of

accepting  merger.  They have  also  thought  out  some

conditions which cannot be acceptable to the Government

of  the  Federation.  The method is  contained  in  the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that Singapore and the Federation of

Malaya  have  been separated for more than  ten  years.

Irrespective of economy and politics, Singapore has its

own special peculiarities and characteristics which are

different from the Federation. The Federation also have

their peculiar policies which cannot be carried out  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Barisan Sosialis want a complete merger

between  Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya,  and

Singapore to be the twelfth State of the Federation. In

other  words,  they want Singapore to follow  the  same

policy of livelihood as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



that pursued in the Federation. Can this be accepted by

the  people  of Singapore? Singapore is a trading  port

for the Federation to export its goods. The imports and

exports  of the Federation have to be directed  through

Singapore.  Therefore,  a great  portion  of  materials

needed  by  the Federation are preserved in  Singapore.

Taxes  and  revenues  are also  in  the  hands  of  the

Singapore  Government.  The  Government  can  use  this

public  money to improve the livelihood of the  people.

It  can carry out all kinds of social welfare and other

services.  Therefore, the average  national  income  is

more  than that of the Federation of Malaya. The public

money  spent by the Singapore Government on social  and

other  services  is much more than that  spent  by  the

Federation  Government. The social services  and  other

benefits  enjoyed by the people of Singapore are  of  a

higher  standard  and more than those  enjoyed  by  the

people of the Federation. Now, if Singapore were to  be

completely  merged with the Federation  of  Malaya  and

become its twelfth State, it would mean that the people

of  Singapore  would  have  to  give  up  their  higher

standard of living. They would have to adapt themselves

to  the conditions in the Federation. Can the people of

Singapore agree to this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us examine objectively what kind of

situation Singapore will be in if we were to  agree  to

the amendment moved by the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. If according to the Barisan Sosialis' type of

merger,   Singapore  is  completely  merged  with   the

Federation  of Malaya to become the twelfth State,  the

present  social services and allowances now enjoyed  by

the  people  will  decrease.  This  is  because  social

services  are  pan-Malayan. The policy  of  Singapore's

social  services will have to follow that obtaining  in

the  Federation. Everyone knows that the average social

aid  is  illustrative of what the people  of  Singapore

get. Can the people of Singapore accept this situation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.04 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): 2. If we follow the

method  of  the  Barisan Sosialis, the examinations  in

Singapore's  Chinese schools will be  effected  in  the

English  or  Malay medium. Chinese students in  Chinese

schools cannot write their answers in Chinese. That  is

what  is  being done now in the Federation  of  Malaya.

Under  a complete merger, Singapore will have to follow

suit.  Can  the  Chinese parents in  Singapore  or  the

present students accept this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If we go according to the Barisan Sosialis'

method,  the  Bank  of  China in  Singapore  and  other

foreign  banks  will  have to close  down,  because  at

present  there  is  a law in the Federation  of  Malaya

which   prohibits  foreign  banks  from  carrying   out

business  in  the Federation. Under a complete  merger,

this law will be applicable to Singapore and bank staff

will  be  unemployed.  I think,  perhaps,  the  Barisan

Sosialis do not want to see this. Perhaps they like  to

see  that  there  are  more unemployed.  The  more  the

merrier. They want to see a confused situation. What we

must take into serious consideration is that, if we  go

according to the way of the Barisan Sosialis, then  our

free port status will be affected and the merchants  of

Singapore  will suffer. Will the merchants of Singapore

agree to that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Under a complete merger, products from China, such

as  textiles, cannot be imported into Singapore because

this is the present policy of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these, there are many other things which

cannot  be  adjusted so very easily at this  moment.  I

have  only enumerated some objective problems  existing

in the two territories. Of course, we entirely agree in

principle  to  a  full  and  complete  merger,  because

basically  this  will  solve our  social  and  economic

problems.  But as I have already said just  now,  there

exist between the two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



territories   numerous  divergencies  and  differences.

Since  there  exist different objectives,  environments

and  circumstances, therefore, to carry out a  complete

merger   immediately  would  only  cause   very   great

confusion  among the people. So this  is  a  road  that

cannot be followed. Only adventurers will, for the sake

of  their own personal interests, accept such a  course

that  will  be  detrimental to  the  interests  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya will happen one day, but its coming cannot be as

what  the  Member  for Queenstown has suggested,  i.e.,

through  his  amendment. Before the coming  of  a  true

merger  of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya,  we

must  prepare the groundwork of laying the  foundations

for a final merger. In this respect -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have no need to count the Assembly

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,   the  complete  merger  of  Singapore  with   the

Federation will ultimately arrive. But its arrival is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



not  like what the Member for Queens-town has said. The

Member for Queens-town has said that to achieve it,  he

need  only move an amendment. Before a complete  merger

of  Singapore  with the Federation can take  place,  we

will have to pave the way for it. We have to lay a firm

foundation   for  the  ultimate  merger  of   the   two

territories.  On  this  point,  I  believe  the  P.A.P.

proposed   merger  in  this  transitional   period   is

realistic, practical, objective and feasible.  It  will

lay  down  good foundations for the ultimate merger  of

the  two territories. We will talk about this in  other

motions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the amendment moved by the

Member  for  Queenstown  is  intended  to  mislead  the

people.  That  is why I oppose it. A few  days  ago  he

uttered weak and empty words. He tried to convince  all

of us that the purpose of the motion was to mislead and

confuse  the  people and to divert attention  from  the

real issue. Therefore, we have to expose his intention.

He  wants  to  entice  the people by  saying  that  the

citizens  of  Singapore  should  automatically   become

citizens  of  the  Federation. This  is  an  attractive

request.  But, in fact, everyone of us knows that  this

demand  is not acceptable to the Federation Government.

The  hon.  Member's  intention is to create  discontent

among  the  people  and  mutual  suspicion  among   the

communities.  Moreover,  he  wants  to  embarrass   the

Federation Government. Judging from the nature  of  the

amendment moved, we can easily put forward all sorts of

demands. We can even ask for the moon and the stars  in

the  sky,  but we have to consider whether our  demands

are  reasonable or not, whether they are feasible,  and

whether they are in the interests of the people  or  in

accordance with their aspirations. All of us know  that

there  are  citizenship laws in the Federation.  Anyone

who  wants to become a Federal citizen has to apply  in

accordance  with the citizenship laws in the Federation

and  not in accordance with the laws of the Member  for

Queenstown.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis also proposed that Singapore

should merge with the Federation on the basis of Penang

or  Malacca. But in the 7½ hour speech of  the  Member

for  Queenstown, there was no mention  of  Malacca  and

Penang because the Minister for Finance has taught  him

a  lesson and he has now become wiser. Now let  me  ask

him  questions  about  the citizenship  rights  of  the

people  of  Malacca and Penang. Can all the  people  in

Malacca    and    Penang   become   Federal    citizens

automatically?  Or  can  they become  citizens  of  the

Federation  according  to the law  of  the  Member  for

Queenstown?  Can  Singapore  citizens  become   Federal

citizens  by  using the same Law? We have to  base  our

arguments on practical circumstances. We should not try

to  sabotage the merger negotiations between  Singapore

and  the  Federation  by putting  forward  unreasonable

demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come back to the question of Penang and

Malacca. The situation in these two places is not  like

what  the Member for Queenstown said. Only those people

born in Penang and Malacca can become Federal citizens.

The other people have to apply for Federal citizenship.

Why  do  the  Barisan Sosialis not ask  that  Singapore

should merge with the Federation on the basis of Penang

or  Malacca? Do they realise that what they  asked  for

before and what they propose now is not the same thing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Choa Chu Kang has said that his

stand is resolute and firm and that he never changes

it. I want to ask the Members opposite, when they were

in the P.A.P., -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We were never in the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I mean the Members

who belong to the Barisan Sosialis, they also said that

our stand was very firm. But today when they are in the

Opposition, they say that their stand is firm, and

tomorrow when they sell out the people's rights, they

will also say that they are very firm in their stand.

They are firm in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



putting forward demands which are not in accordance

with objective realities. The Barisan Sosialis do not

even know what they want. How can the people expect

them to put forward more reasonable demands?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that what the Barisan Sosialis want is not

merger.  We know that they want to oppose merger.  They

want Singapore to be still under British colonialism so

that they can smoothly carry out their under-ground and

above-ground activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a few days ago some Members of the Barisan

Sosialis quoted many historical events and phases  from

Chinese  history.  They likened the Federation  to  the

Manchu Dynasty which conquered China. This sort of talk

is  very dangerous. It will cause suspicion and  racial

conflict  between  the people of the  two  territories.

Therefore,  I  want  to  advise  our  friends  in   the

Opposition that they should be careful about what  they

say.  If  they support merger in principle,  then  they

should not make speeches which would cause a feeling of

uneasiness in the two territories.



<br><br>7.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  just  now  I  have  heard   the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for   Home

Affairs talk about a lot of things. I feel that what he

has  said  is contradictory to what his Ministers  have

said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister for Finance-said that we did

not  break  away from the P.A.P. over the  question  of

merger,  but  just now the Parliamentary Secretary  has

said  that  we did so because of the P.A.P.'s  proposed

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary also touched on the

educational  problem. He asked whether we  would  agree

with  the education policy of the Federation.  I  think

what he said was on the same lines as what the Minister

for Education said two days ago. He also said that true

merger was good but not realistic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



Why  should  the Party in power want to  use  terms  in

their  motion to confuse the people? Merger is  only  a

name. If there is to be a merger, then we should have a

genuine merger and they should not make use of the term

"merger"  to  confuse the people.  The  motion  of  the

Minister for Labour runs like this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That, whereas it has always been the avowed

objective of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve  the

reunification  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation  of

Malaya and to remove the artificial division created by

the  British by their policy of "divide and rule", this

House affirms and declares that the first objective  of

all   true  patriots  of  Malaya  is  to  achieve   the

reunification of these two territories in a  merger  of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of this motion mean that there should be a

merger,  and if there is merger, it should be a genuine

merger.  They  should  not use  the  word  "merger"  to

deceive  the  people. I feel that the speeches  of  the

P.A.P. leadership are not sincere. They  should  learn

from  the Tunku and say that this kind of merger  is  a

partnership.  It will be more correct if they  use  the

word  "partnership",  and  not  the  word  "merger"  to

confuse the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, let me return to the point. Let me talk on the amendment moved by our Chairman. I fully support it because it is based on a stand which is

truly  for  the benefit and interests of the people  of

the two territories. It is unbiased and just. It is the

correct way to deal with true merger of Singapore  with

the  Federation, and with the language issue. It  meets

with  the wishes and desires of the people of  the  two

territories. It also reflects the stand of the  Barisan

Sosialis on merger between the two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis has spent 7½ hours to analyse and to deal with what the Prime Minister has in a few months spread among the people - misgivings and discontent. Our Chairman has dealt with all this. The Prime Minister has been creating artificial tension among the people. He wants to divert their attention from the fact that he is selling them out. He has also analysed the special

characteristics



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



existing  in the two territories, and of the  socialist

forces  that are now growing and developing, especially

the Barisan Sosialis, which is a new political force in

Singapore.   Its   strength  must  have   caused   some

apprehension in the leadership of the P.A.P. and  made

them run to the Federation to fall on all fours to  beg

for help from the Tunku.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of citizenship rights, our Chairman

has  clearly pointed out that we are concerned with the

rights  of  the citizens of Singapore, and we  have  to

clarify our stand on this. He has also pointed out  the

deceits and hypocrisy of the P.A.P. He has pointed  out

that  the P.A.P. has not only deprived the citizens  of

Singapore  of  their citizenship rights, but  has  also

intended to sell out the basic democratic rights of the

people   of  Singapore.  What  we  want  is  a  genuine

merger - Singapore  entering  into  the   Federation   of

Malaya, as a State. All Singapore citizens on the  day

of  merger should automatically become citizens of  the

Federation.  All this shows that what we,  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  want is a genuine merger in which  there  is

integrity  and a reunification of the two  territories.

We resolutely oppose the phoney merger of the P.A.P. We

have also declared that we

want  to  retain the basic citizenship  rights  of  the

citizens  of Singapore on merger. In order to  preserve

the  basic rights of the citizens of Singapore and  the

interests  of the people of Singapore, however  adverse

the   circumstances  and  conditions,  we  the  Barisan

Sosialis will resolutely -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> On a point of order,

Sir. I see that the Member is reading his speech.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It is a point of order, but I

think  the  Member  is  not  reading  but  occasionally

referring to his speech. Mr Tan Cheng Tong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  your ruling is correct. I must show my admiration

for you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also intend to carry out a fight against the

intriguers who want to sell out the citizenship  rights

of the people of Singapore. We know that with the sell-out  of  their  citizenship rights, Singapore  citizens

will  lose all their interests. Therefore, in order  to

safeguard  their present and future interests,  we  the

Barisan   Sosialis  must  point  out  what  the   basic

conditions  for  true merger are. We  must  expose  the

phoney merger of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the debate today is mainly for all Assemblymen to ponder carefully over this question of genuine merger. On this question there has already

been  a  debate for several months. From the result  of

the  debate on this question, we can find out who  are,

in fact, representatives of the people and work for the

interests  of the people, and who are hypocritical  and

deceiving.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. If the translation is

correct, I think the word "hypocritical" is used. I ask

the hon. Member to withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

I withdraw this word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the true picture is very clear now. Speaking as a member of the Barisan Sosialis, our stand on merger is in accordance with the wishes and

desires  of  all classes of people. Therefore,  we  are

always  resolutely working along this line. We want  to

fight  for  a  complete  genuine  merger  of  the   two

territories,  Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya,

and  to  reunify the two territories. The views of  the

Barisan Sosialis are that we must achieve true complete

merger  of  the  two  territories,  to  eliminate   all

colonial  forces remaining in the two territories,  and

to seek more freedom and democratic rights. Under these

circumstances, the two territories can then enjoy  real

happiness. Therefore, in accordance with the  terms  of

our amendment, there are three conditions for merger of

the  two  territories,  namely, that  the  citizens  of

Singapore  should  on  the day of merger  automatically

become citizens of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



Federation.  If  these  citizens  of  Singapore  cannot

automatically  become citizens of the Federation  after

merger,  then  the people of Singapore will  be  losing

many important political rights. This is what everybody

can  understand. It cannot be refuted.  Only  when  the

citizens   of  the  two  territories  enjoy  the   same

citizenship  rights  can  they  enjoy  equal  political

rights and other benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. Let us look at the P.A.P.'s

phoney  merger. According to this type of  merger,  the

citizens of Singapore cannot enjoy the same citizenship

rights  as the citizens of the Federation. The citizens

of   Singapore  then  cannot  take  part  in  political

activities in the various States of the Federation,  to

form  big  Parties  and to stand for  election  in  the

various States. Under these circumstances, whenever the

Federation  Central  Government takes  reactionary  and

dictatorial measures, the people of Singapore  will  be

suppressed  and they will not be able to seek  redress.

On  the other hand, if they can have common citizenship

rights,  then  if  the  Federation  Government  ignores

public  opinion, or if they suppress the people in  the

two territories, then the people in the two territories

can  unite and oppose the unreasonable policies pursued

by  the Government. The people in these two territories

can  unite through the system of one man one vote,  and

elect  a  new government which represents the  people's

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all these comparisons are

based  on  the premises that we have common citizenship

rights  and  functions.  This  shows  that  with  basic

citizenship rights, we can enjoy political rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk about the economic problems of the

people in relation to the merger issue. If a person  in

Singapore wants to go to the Federation to open up  new

land and cultivate it, or if he wants to open a farm in

the  Federation,  then without a real  merger - when  the

citizens  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation  are  not

enjoying the same citizenship rights - this person will be

frustrated in his desire to open a new farm. If a rich



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



person wants to start a new business in the Federation,

then, because he does not enjoy the same rights as  the

Federation  citizens, he will be  thwarted.  He  cannot

even  carry on his business. If a person wants to apply

for  a  taxi  licence but he is not a Federal  citizen,

then  he  cannot  achieve his aim.  In  short,  whether

looking  at  this problem from the daily lives  of  the

people  or  from  the  economic  point  of  view,   the

importance of citizenship rights is indisputable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we the Barisan Sosialis advocate that on

Merger Day the citizens of Singapore must automatically

become Federal citizens. Our demand is a just one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to reiterate what our Party Chairman said at, a mass rally. I think it is necessary to bring out this question. We can show that

we  are honest, serious and careful on the question  of

merger.  We  can also expose the groundless accusations

made  by  the  Ministers when they said  that  we  were

sabotaging merger, that we were insincere about merger,

and  that we were not nationalists. We can also  expose

the  fact  that  they  tried  to  divert  the  people's

attention from the real problem. In the course  of  the

debate  on this question, they want to confuse us  with

all these minor points. The Government has made use  of

the opinion of the State Advocate-General to illustrate

their  points. It is useless to do so. His  opinion  is

useless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four questions. Now I wish to quote from

our Party pamphlet because our views on the question of

merger are propounded in this pamphlet. One of our four

conditions  is that through the system of one  man  one

vote  we  can establish a more just society.  Secondly,

without  the right of automatic citizenship will  those

Singapore  citizens who have no Federal citizenship  be

discriminated  against  and  suppressed?  Thirdly,   if

people  in  Singapore do not have Federal  citizenship,

will  they  have  freedom of speech and  the  right  of

assembly  and organisation in the Federation? Fourthly,

can  the  trade union movement in Singapore be unified?

Will the workers in the two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



territories  be  united  to fight  for  better  working

conditions?  Will graduates from Singapore  schools  be

eligible to work in the Federation civil service?  Will

Nan-yang University graduates be discriminated  against

in  the  Federation?  Will those  people  who  have  no

Federal  citizenship, i.e. merchants,  contractors  and

bus  companies, be restricted in their business in  the

Federation?  Will the people in Singapore  be  able  to

acquire land in the Federation? Will the socialists  in

Singapore be able to go to the Federation to take  part

in   political   activities  there?   Are   all   these

questions, after  merger, in any way  connected  with

citizenship rights?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, why have I raised these questions? Why have I put forward these four questions? My contention is that although we have been debating

this  question for seven days, the Prime Minister  and

some of the Assemblymen have not given a clear-cut view

of  the  matter and have not answered these  questions.

This shows that we are cautious and very sincere in our

approach to the question of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, why did our Party Chairman

reiterate that we should have a genuine merger?  It  is

because we want to prevent the P.A.P. from passing  off

a phoney merger as a real merger. We know that the P.A.P.

conspiracy   in  putting  forward  the  phoney   merger

proposal  is to confuse the people. They have  deceived

the   people  many  times.  They  always  put   forward

plausible,  vague, ambiguous, dubious and sophisticated

arguments-the  so-called  independence,  autonomy   in.

labour  and  education,  that  merger  will  solve  the

problems of the people, and all this talk on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to allow the P.A.P. to mislead the

people  on the question of merger, we have put  forward

genuine  proposals  for a genuine merger  under  which,

when  Singapore  is merged with the Federation  as  the

twelfth State of the Federation, all Singapore citizens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



will  automatically become Federation citizens  on

Merger  Day.  The basic rights of  the  people  in

Singapore  will  not be sold out  by  this  phoney

merger proposal. We will not fall into the trap of

these plotters.
