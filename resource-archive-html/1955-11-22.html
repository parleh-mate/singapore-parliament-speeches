<div align="center"><b>ESTATE DUTY (INCREASE OF RATES) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to substitute a new

scale of estate duty for the scale contained in the

Second  Schedule  to  the  Estate  Duty  Ordinance,

Chapter  227,  as  amended  by  the  Estate  Duties

(Increase of Rates) Ordinance, 1946.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained the reasons why it is

considered  desirable to introduce this new  scale,

and I do not think that I need say anything further

in this connection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three main points about the new scale

to  which I invite attention. It exempts estates of

under  $10,000 from duty. It makes  use  of  a  new

method  of  calculating duty,  and  of  course,  it

increases  the  rate  of duty on  estates  of  over

$10,000. Hitherto, only estates of under $1,000 have

been  exempted from payment of duty. This level  of

exemption is low. A considerable number of  estates

fall  within  the  limits  of  $1,000  to  $10,000,

perhaps  rather  more than a third of  all  estates

assessed  for duty in a normal year. On  the  other

hand,  the  amount  of  duty collected  from  these

estates  is small, and in no way commensurate  with

the  time and labour involved in collecting it. For

example, the 400 estates within these limits, which

were   assessed  in  1954  yielded  no  more  than

$23,000. The staff of the Estate Duty Office is not

large,  and  clearly the time and labour  spent  on

assessing  these  small estates  could,  with  much

greater advantage, be devoted to larger estates. In

the circumstances, it has been decided to raise the

level of exemption to $10,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same form of graduated scale as is used in

income  tax has been adopted. This gives  a  smooth

curve  in  the  progression in the  graduations  of

duty,  avoids  steps  and  obviates  the  need  for

special  provisions for marginal relief. The  first

two   characteristics  will   be   seen   from   an

examination  of the comparative table  attached  to

the   Bill.  Examples  will  illustrate  the  third

characteristic. The existing rate  of  duty  on  an

estate  of  exactly $1 million is 23 per cent.  The

rate of duty on an estate exceeding $1 million  but

less than $1.2 million is 25 per cent. Duty on  an

estate  of exactly $1 million is $230,000. Duty  on

an  estate of $1,000,001 is $250,000.25.  In  other

words, one dollar makes a difference of $20,000  in

duty. Therefore, in this particular section of  the

existing  scale, it is well worthwhile to surrender

estate  up to about $26,000 in order to retain  the

lower  rate  of duty. For example, the duty  on  an

estate of $1,025,000 at 25 per cent is $256,250. If

the  executor decides to surrender estate,  he  can

pay  23  per cent on $1 million, which is $230,000,

surrender $25,000 and still be better off by  about

$1,000  than he would have been if he had  accepted

taxation at 25 per cent. On the other hand, if  the

estate is $1,030,000, it pays to pay tax at 25  per

cent.  The  new form of graduated scale avoids  all

these  anomalies.  The rate of tax  rises  smoothly

without sudden jumps. For example, the duty  on  an

estate  of $1 million is $328,250. The duty  on  an

estate of $1,000,001 is $328,250.50 and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates of duty proposed are generally higher

than   the  existing  rates.  In  this  connection,

attention is invited not to the Schedule but to the

comparative table attached for information  to  the

Bill.  This  table shows the effective rates  under

the  new  scale  by  comparison with  the  existing

rates.  The  effective rate is  the  rate  obtained

after  allowing for exemption on the first $10,000.

For  example,  on  an estate of $25,000  the  first

$10,000  would  be  exempt from tax  and  the  next

$15,000  would be taxed at 5 per cent.  This  would

yield  $750.  The effect in rate  of  tax  on  this

estate is therefore $750 over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>

$25,000  multiplied by 100 equals 3  per  cent.  It

will  be  seen that the effective rate of  the  new

scale diverges increasingly from the existing scale

until, on estates of $5 millions, there is

a difference of about 10 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the second paragraph of the

explanatory note it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In effect under the proposed new scale the

graduations  rise on a large number of small  steps

in  place of a smaller number of large steps  under

the old scale."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have here the Estate Duties (Increase

of   Rates)  Ordinance,  1946,  which  includes   a

schedule  of rates effective from the  4th  day  of

July,  1941.  The scale of duty rises in  27  steps,

covering one per cent on $5,000 to 40 per  cent  on

$5  millions. In the new Bill the scale  starts  on

estates at $10,000 and ends at 60 per cent on  that

part  of  an  estate exceeding $4  millions  in  14

stages.  It  would seem, therefore, that  the  last

sentence  of paragraph two of the explanatory  note

should read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In effect under the proposed new scale the

graduations  rise  on a smaller  number  of  larger

steps  in place of a larger number of smaller steps

under the old scale."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to exempt estates of less than

$10,000   appears  to  be  a  step  in  the   right

direction,  but hon. Members may be  interested  to

know  that  in the United Kingdom exemption  limits

since the war have been steadily increased until in

the  last  Budget the figure was raised to  £3,000,

that   is  approximately  $26,000.  Moreover,   the

effective  rate of duty on estates of $130,000  and

under  will now be higher than the rate of duty  in

the  United  Kingdom. That is just as  a  point  of

interest. But then there is a slight anomaly, to my

mind, with regard to the new Schedule. For example,

under  the old scale an estate of $1,000 paid  duty

at one cent. Now supposing it were $1,001, the duty

paid would be $10.01.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will take it a step further. Under the new

scale an estate of $10,001 will be liable for  duty

at five per cent on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



one  dollar  only,  because the  first  $10,000  is

exempt  from  duty. Well, assuming that  the  basic

cost   of   a   collection,  for  example,   in   a

straightforward  estate is  perhaps  $30 - I  do  not

know, but just call it $30 - it would seem economical

to  exempt estates not exceeding, say, $10,599 with

the  proviso  that for estates in  excess  of  this

figure  the  duty shall be exigible on any  sum  in

excess  of $10,000, so that, in fact, the  proposed

scale still operates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  here again the Labour Front is on very  solid

ground. Even the hon. Mr Sutherland feels that the

move to increase estate duty is a move in the right

direction,  although  he  feels  that  estate  duty

should   be   exempted  up  to   the   amount   the

Conservative  Government of  Britain  allowed  last

year.  On  estates not exceeding £3,000, no  estate

duty  is paid. But then Mr Sutherland did not tell

the  House that in England duty on estates of about

£1  million  goes  up  to 80 per  cent,  of  three-

quarters  to  £1  million 75 per cent,  of  half  a

million  to  three-quarter million  pounds  70  per

cent, and so it tapers down to one per cent between

£3,000 and £4,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hesitate to give the Hon. the Minister for

Transport   a  lecture  on  egalitarian   societies

because obviously he believes such ideas to be old-

fashioned. He believes that we should all be  equal

in  a  Socialist  democracy but  that  some  people

should  be more equal than others. Perhaps that  is

the way it ought to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even he will agree with us that estate duty

is  one  of those forms of taxation which  can  be

used  deliberately  to counter-balance  the  unjust

distribution    of   wealth   and    prevent    its

perpetuation.  The primary purpose of  a  Socialist

taxation  policy is to bring about a redistribution

of  wealth. You take the money from the "haves" and

then you spend it on your education, on your public

services,  and on your social welfare, and  thereby

give  it  to  the  have-nots. You have  this  added

advantage  in  that you really do not hurt  anybody

because  you have really taken it from no one.  All

you have taken away from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



the sons and heirs and successors is not money, but

just  the hope of a succeeding to money. That might

be  painful  for a week or two after the  will  has

been  read  and duties have to be paid, but  it  is

certainly less painful than if we were to impose  a

capital  levy  while  the  man  who  has  made  his

millions is still alive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we commend the increase which the

Labour  Front Government has imposed, a step  taken

independently of the Federation, and while  we  are

confident  that  the Federation will  be  following

suit  in  the  very near future, we feel  that  the

Labour Front Government should compare these tables

with   those   obtaining  in   other   Commonwealth

countries.    These   places   have    Conservative

governments,   not  dedicated  to   the   Socialist

principle, but dedicated to the principle  of  what

they now call a property-owning democracy: in other

words, we will each have a bit of property, but  if

my father has a lot of property, than I will have a

lot more than you have. If a comparative table were

made  of  estate  duties in  all  the  Commonwealth

countries,    where    there    are    Conservative

governments,  I  think the Labour Front  will  find

that  their increases are modest and moderate.  The

next time they are facing a danger of a deficit  in

their Budget, they should consider pushing the rate

of  estate duty up to the limits obtaining  in  the

most conservative of capitalist societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hart, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In reply, Sir. I think that the point

raised  by my friend Mr Sutherland is answered  in

my   opening  address  to  the  effect   that   the

incorporation   of  the  income   tax   method   of

calculating duty gives smooth curves and does  away

with steps in the scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that my friend the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  approves the step we have taken to  increase

estate duty, and I agree heartily with him that  it

is  a  most equitable means of distributing wealth.

Certainly  our rates are lower than those  in  the

United Kingdom in the higher ranges of estate,  but

I think I should say that our new rates are still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



considerably  higher than those  obtaining  in  our

nearest   Commonwealth   neighbours,   Ceylon   and

Hongkong.  I  have the rates for these  territories

here.  I will give them to him if he will come  and

see me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion is required to confirm the

increase  in  the  rate of petrol duty  which  was

imposed   under   the  Public  Revenue   Protection

Ordinance  of the 9th of November. The increase  of

five cents a gallon brings the duty on petrol up to

Federation levels, which should yield at least $1.2

millions in 1956 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



should have no effect whatsoever on consumption. In

fact,   consumption  will  probably   continue   to

increase  steadily as it has done  ever  since  the

war.  It  is unlikely that the increase will  cause

any  hardship to motorists or lead to any  increase

in the price of motor transport.

III. The duty leviable on intoxicating liquors

imported into the Cocos or Keeling Islands

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

for consumption in the said Islands shall be Nil.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in duty on intoxicating liquors

which were announced on 9th November have been  in

force since that date by virtue of an order by  the

Governor  under  section 2 of  the  Public  Revenue

Protection Ordinance (Chapter 234). The purpose  of

this  motion  is  to  confirm  these  increases  by

resolution  under  section 3  (1)  of  the  Liquors

Revenue Ordinance within the 14 days prescribed  in

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained on a previous occasion

why   these   increases  in  customs   duties   are

necessary,  and I do not think I need say  anything

further  on this point. The main increases  are  as

follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full duty on bottled whisky and brandy has

been  increased by $12 per gallon, that  is,  to  a

figure  of $4 a gallon above the present Federation

level.  This  will increase the  duty  on  a  quart

bottle  by  $2.  The preferential duty  on  bottled

brandy   has  been  increased  by  a  corresponding

amount. It is considered that these two commodities

can  take  these substantial increases without  any

marked or lasting effect on consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The import duty on samsu was raised by $4 per

gallon to $31 per gallon. The excise duty has  been

raised  by  $3 per gallon. Here again,  it  is  not

thought that these increases in duty will have  any

marked or prolonged effect on consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferential duty on still wines has been

raised  to  Federation levels, and  the  full  duty

raised   in   such   a   way  that   the   existing

differentials are maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full, preferential and excise duties on beer,

ale  and stout, etc., have been increased by  $1.20

per gallon to the Federation level. These increases

will increase the duty on a pint and a quart bottle

by  10  cents  and  20  cents respectively.  It  is

unlikely that these increases will have much effect

on consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said yesterday, the question of increasing

the  duty  on  rum and gin was also  given  careful

consideration, but for a number of reasons  it  was

decided not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



to  make  any change for the present. The  position

will, however, be carefully watched. Sir, I beg  to

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan:</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I would like to

know  from the Hon. the Financial Secretary whether

he  has  considered a preferential duty on  locally

produced ale, because my contention is that, if  we

want  to promote local industries, we will have  to

give  a preferential tariff. I am not going to make

a  long  speech, Sir, but I just want to  find  out

whether he has considered it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, here again, I

think  we should put on record our full support  of

the  move to increase taxation, indirectly  falling

on  the  whole community, on items which cannot  be

considered essential to life or health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is one of the few places in the world

where  one  can cheaply drink and smoke oneself  to

death. One does not need to have much wealth to  be

able  to afford it. I think the time will come very

soon  when  we should rescue the less strong-willed

members  of  our  population from such  an  unhappy

state by taking excessive smoking and drinking  out

of  their  reach. We shall support  the  Government

every  time  it comes with a proposal  to  step  up

taxation  on  these commodities. It is an  accepted

method of taxation in all civilised countries where

they  govern a country, not just hold the ring  for

private  enterprise, where they govern the  country

and  not  just keep law and order. These  are  the

accepted techniques of taxation, and the Government

should not have the slightest doubt that they would

get full support from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hart, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In reply, Sir, I would like to thank my

friend  the Member for Tanjong Pagar for  his  most

eloquent support of our motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by my friend the

Member for Seletar, we did consider the question of

giving a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



preferential rate to local breweries, but  we  came

to  the  conclusion  that,  having  regard  to  the

excellent  results of last year's working,  perhaps

any  preferential treatment was unnecessary at  the

present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly by virtue of the provisions

of  subsection  (1) of section  3  of  the  Liquors

<div align="center"><b>LABOUR BILL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the report of the Select Committee on the

Labour  Bill contained in Sessional Paper No.  L.A.

12  of  1955 be adopted subject to the recommittal

of  the Bill in respect of clauses 46 and 49 to  a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Bill was committed to a Select

Committee and from Sessional Paper No. L.A. 12  of

1955,  it  will be seen that the Select  Committee

held  six meetings. The minutes of the proceedings

of  these  meetings can be found in Appendix  III.

The  Bill  reproduced in Appendix II contains  all

the  amendments to the Bill as recommended by  the

Select  Committee.  Some of these  amendments  are

major   ones,  while  most  of  them  are   either

consequential  or for the purpose of  tidying  up.

Since  the report was made public, I have received

several    representations,   particularly    from

employers.  These representations have  been  duly

considered in my Ministry and it is not felt  that

they  are  of such major importance as to  warrant

amendments to be made in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sessional Paper has been in the hands of hon.

Members for quite some time, and as the amendments

recommended by the Select Committee will have been

taken note of by hon. Members, I do not propose to

take  up their time to touch on them. I would like

to  say, however,  that I am  confident  that  my

motion will receive the unanimous support of  hon.

Members so that a large



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



majority of the workers of Singapore will be  more

adequately protected than has been possible  under

the present outmoded Labour Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to recommit the Bill in respect of

clauses  46  and 49 to a Committee  of  the  whole

Assembly  is  not to seek any material  amendment,

but  is for the purpose of tidying up. Sir, I  beg

to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee (Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Mak Pak Shee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second the motion and reserve my right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one

other  clause  in this Bill which I think  escaped

the attention of the Minister for Labour and other

Members  of  the  Select Committee,  and  that  is

clause 48 (1):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any workman who has served an employer for a

period  of  not less than twelve months after  the

coming  into force of this Ordinance shall,  after

examination  at the expense of the employer  by  a

duly registered medical practitioner appointed  by

the  employer, be entitled to such paid sick leave

as  may  be  certified  to be  necessary  by  such

medical practitioner:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no workman shall be entitled to an

aggregate  of  more than twenty-eight  days'  paid

sick leave in each year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it escaped our

attention  at  the  time that  it  might  well  be

construed that no workman shall be entitled in any

case to more than 28 days' paid sick leave in each

year.  It  has  been brought to my attention  that

there  are  many  unions  who  have  entered  into

contracts  with many employers for  more  than  28

days' paid sick leave. If the clause were left  in

this form, it might well be taken advantage of  by

unscrupulous  employers  to  get  out   of   their

contracts and go back to 28 days' paid sick leave,

because it says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... no workman shall be entitled to an aggregate of

more than twenty-eight days...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move that clause 48 be inserted

between clauses 46 and 49.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I rise to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 18, lines 36 to 47, to leave out the whole

of sub-clause (3) of clause 46.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this deletion will be re-introduced by

incorporation in a later clause.

left out, be left out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the figure '(3)' proposed to be

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I indicated

just  now  that we overlooked the point  that  the

interpretation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



of  the proviso might well be understood to  mean

that no one shall be entitled to more than 28 days'

paid sick leave in each year. The intention of  the

Select Committee on the Labour Bill was that no one

shall be entitled to less than 28 days. He shall be

entitled  to  at  least 28 days and  to  a  further

number  of days according to any agreement  he  may

have  reached with his employer. 28 days should  be

the minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That on line 25, page 19, the word "more" be left

out and the words "not less" be substituted.



<br><br>The clause will then read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that no workman shall be entitled to an

aggregate of not less than twenty-eight days'  paid

sick leave in each year."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Member for Tanjong Pagar

like to consider that amendment further? I am a bit

puzzled about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is a double negative, Sir.

The only alternative would be a recast of the whole

proviso  and  I  would  rather  consult  the  legal

draftsmen  on this before we attempt to recast  it.

Substitution  of  words will not  upset  the  whole

proviso,  but I should hate to have to  recast  the

whole proviso unless I have an opportunity first to

discuss the matter with the legal draftsmen.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I suggest that perhaps the word

"no"   should  be  left  out  and  the   word   "a"

substituted?  Does  that cover  the  hon.  Member's

point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it does not

really,  because there is this further  difficulty.

It may well mean that in any one year in any case a

workman shall be entitled to at least 28 days' paid

sick  leave. There should be a further  proviso.  I

think  the  intention that we  all  have  is  quite

clear. The workman shall be entitled, if he is  ill

and  if he gets a medical certificate for it, to  a

minimum of 28 days. The maximum may be whatever  is

agreed between him and his employer. If he is  sick

for  28 days, no trouble arises. If he is sick  for

29  days, he will get at least 28 days, but he will

get 29 days if his agreement with his employer says

30 days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Can I be of assistance, Sir? I

do appreciate what I think the hon. Member seeks. It

seems  to  me  very simple. If there are contractual

obligations outside the provisions of this Bill,  he

wishes  to  see  that those contractual  obligations

should, in no way, be affected by the provisions  of

this Bill. I would suggest this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no workman shall be entitled under

the  provisions of this section to an  aggregate  of

more than 28 days' paid sick leave in each year,



<br><br>so  that if there is no contract entered into,  then

he  is entitled to 28 days' paid sick leave even  if

he  is  sick,  say, for six weeks,  and  the  doctor

orders six weeks. But if there is a contract between

an employer and the union to give six weeks, then it

is not affected by the provisions of this section. I

do not know if that is what the hon. Member wishes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged to the Chief

Minister,  Sir, but, with respect, that  is  exactly

the  kind  of  situation which the unions  want  to

avoid.  In  that form, the employer  will  say  that

under  the law the workman is entitled to  28  days,

and  any  agreement  made for  more  than  28  days,

because of this clause of the law, will entitle  the

workman  to  only 28 days. A great deal of  argument

will  start  and a few more strikes may  take  place

just  over  the wording of this clause on paid  sick

leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I have completely overlooked the

fact  that this motion was coming up and I  had  not

realised that the Minister for Labour wanted to take

the Committee stage today.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b>

Perhaps I can be of some assistance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Perhaps the Attorney-General

might  suggest  a formula which will ensure  that  a

workman



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



shall  be entitled to at least 28 days, but  he  can

get as many days as he can get his employer to agree

to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> What I have in mind, Sir, to

resolve   this  difficulty  is  a  further  proviso,

something on these lines:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And provided further that the provisions of this

subsection  shall  be  without  prejudice   to   any

agreement between a workman and his employer."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether this would meet the point

made by the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> If I might comment on that

suggestion, Mr Chairman, Sir, I think the agreement

must  be one which increases and not decreases  the

number  of days. Otherwise, there might be a lockout

to  have  the 28 days cut down, and that is not  the

intention. We have to add something further  to  the

Attorney-General's suggestion to provide for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> I am much obliged to the Minister

for  Communications and Works. I think he  is  quite

right. The difficulty, of course, is to produce what

will  be a suitable further proviso, which is to  be

incorporated in the law, without giving it a  moment

or  two of consideration, and I should like time  to

formulate this. May I have that, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Butterfield.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar and I

are  not  yet  in entire agreement on the  suggested

proviso,  Sir. I think we will have to  take  a  few

moments longer.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will this meet the case? If it does

not,  then  I  propose that we suspend the  sitting.

This is what I suggest as an additional proviso:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And provided further that the provisions of this

section  shall be without prejudice to any agreement

between  a  workman and his employer which  provides

for  more  than  28 days' paid sick  leave  in  each

year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hon. Members indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No? In that case, I will suspend the

sitting for a quarter of an hour.

the words "not exceeding in the aggregate 28 days

in each year".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would   like  to  ask  information  on  Head   35: International Exhibition at Cambodia - $25,000.  Can the Hon. the Financial Secretary say what business

we  have with Cambodia, in terms of dollars or  in

commodities, that we have to spend $25,000  on  an

exhibition in such a small country?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Perhaps before I answer the specific

questions  raised by the Member  for  Telok  Ayer,

Sir,   I   might   explain  that  the   particular

exhibition  to  which  we are  contributing  is  a

tripartite  exhibition in so far as the Federation

Government,  the  Singapore  Government  and   Her

Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are all

taking part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of our stall at the exhibition in Pnom

Penh  is to promote trade, to invite the attention

of  the inhabitants and the traders of Cambodia to

the  existence of Singapore as a potential  source

of supply of the commodities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



which  they require. Trade with Cambodia has  been

mounting slowly over the past three years, and  it

is hoped that this exhibition will have the effect

of increasing trade with Cambodia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that the proposal to have a stall in

the  exhibition in Pnom Penh has the full  support

of the traders of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I cannot say offhand just precisely

what  the  dollar value of our trade with Cambodia

is  each  year.  I  fear  I  shall  have  to  make

reference  to  various statistical reports  in  my

office  before  I can give a full  reply  on  that

point to the Member for Telok Ayer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $85,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 3, Family Planning

Association, on page 23 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, my reasons are as follows. Hon.

Members will remember that at the Assembly sitting

on  the 29th of June, a question was asked of  the

Hon. the Minister for Health. (Mr A. J. Braga) as

to  what  Government's policy was  in  respect  of

family planning. He replied that Government had no

policy in regard to family planning. He also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



said  that  as the matter was a controversial  one

and  affected the conscience and religious beliefs

of  individual Members, it would be open  to  each

and every one to vote according to his conscience.

Now, Sir, I think this is the appropriate time  to

discuss this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, my grand-parents were Roman

Catholics. My parents were Roman Catholics. I am a

Roman  Catholic. So is everyone at home,  and  in

this  case  I think I am qualified  to  say  that

Roman   Catholics  are  strongly  against   family

planning and also against the use of public funds,

to  which they are contributors as tax-payers,  for

family  planning  and birth control.  The  use  of

contraceptives or any method of birth  control  is

against  the  religious  ethics  of  Muslims.   Of

course,  there will be a small minority who  think

that  it is not sinful, but I firmly believe  that

the  majority  of  the Muslims  are  against  such

practices.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Think for yourself!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> I therefore feel that in a

matter which is so highly controversial, it  would

offend  the people who have put us into  power  by

supporting   the   Government   in   giving   this

contribution to the Family Planning Association. I

think it would be wrong of Government to do such a

thing. We should also remember that we should  not

disregard the wishes of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Chairman, Sir, I had hoped that I would  not  have

to  intervene in this debate except to say that on

the  Government side there will be no question  of

the  Whip  being used. The matter is going  to  be

left, in so far as we are concerned, entirely to a

free  vote,  according  to the  feelings  and  the

conscience of the individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do feel very strongly about the few remarks

made by the Member for Bukit Panjang, and I deeply

regret  it  and I am more than a little distressed

that in this Assembly, composed of re-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



presentatives  of people of many creeds  and  many

races,  the  question  of religion  and  religious

beliefs  should  be  made  to  impinge  upon   our

deliberations, and that there should be an  effort

and  a suggestion that any one creed should impose

its  will upon the country as a whole. That  is  a

terrifying  thought, Sir. I  had  hoped  that  the

Member for Bukit Panjang would have recognised and

appreciated  the  religious  tolerance   in   this

country,  exemplified particularly  by  the  Malay

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to follow the lines indicated by the

Member   for  Bukit  Panjang,  my  Ministry,   for

example, would have to cease to give assistance to

farmers in breeding better pork for the market. We

would,  in  fact, have to prohibit  pigs  entirely

from  the  island in order to support  the  theory

that  public money should not be spent in  respect

of   an  item  which  offends  a  section  of  the

community; and certainly the existence of pigs and

the eating of pork offend the Muslim community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would, Sir, have to refrain from spending

money on the veterinary service which looks after

the canine population of this territory. Maybe  we

should  have to go further and put an end  to  the

existence of dogs on this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay community have shown a tolerance and an

understanding of the position, which is an example

to all other communities. They have shown courtesy

towards   others'  views  and  they   have   shown

consideration for others' customs; and one can but

ask  that a community, that is supposed to be  far

more  highly developed, should at least  show  the

same courtesy and the same consideration for other

sections of the community. It is a very frightening

thing,  Sir, that we should in this Assembly  have

religious  intolerance  and  religious  domination

introduced.  I  have  very  many  Roman   Catholic

friends.  I  have the highest regard for  them.  I

have  in  the  Council  of Ministers,  Sir,  Roman

Catholics and we have discussed this matter not on

the  basis of religious feelings but on the  basis

of  individual views and individual conscience. It

has been fully recognised that there can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



no  question  of  any single religion  seeking  to

dominate  the  country  with  its  own  particular

theology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say this: I have the deepest

regard   for  religion  as  the  first  and   most

important  civilising factor  in  the  history  of

humanity - warm religion that understands the  human

being's needs and seeks to guide a human being  to

a  better  way of life. I cede to no one,  however

religious  he  may  be,  in  my  respect  for  the

civilising  influence of religion, but  I  do  ask

hon.  Members  to  recognise the fact  that  often

religions  in  certain  aspects  degenerate   into

nothing but sterile theology whose baneful  edicts

can but do harm to human relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Government is giving an opportunity

to  debate  what many consider to be a  very  real

need.  People of all religions, Sir, not excluding

the  religions, which the Member for Bukit Panjang

has mentioned, have been to the eleven clinics  of

the  Singapore Family Planning Association.  Those

who  are  wealthy do not have to go to the  Family

Planning Association. They go to their own medical

advisers. The rich do not need the Family Planning

Association. They have got their own doctors. What

Government seeks to do, in giving $85,000 out of a

total  Budget  of about $150,000  to  this  Family

Planning  Association, is to assist the very  poor

amongst us who may wish guidance in planning their

families.  There  is  no  question  of  compelling

anybody.  There  is  no  question  of  seeking  to

attract anybody to a particular doctrine. There is

no  question  in our minds of seeking to  diminish

the  increase of population. We have faith in  the

future,  and  we  do  not  fear  the  increase  of

population;  but we do say that where the  wealthy

have an opportunity to get this advice and to  get

this  assistance,  it  is  our  duty  to  give  an

opportunity to the poor to have the same advice if

they should so wish it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intervene early in this debate to express the

sincere hope, the intense desire, the anxiety that

there  should no more during the remaining  stages

of this debate on this particular question ever be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>

mentioned  the religious aspect, and that  Members

should  bear  in  mind the question  of  religious

tolerance to their fellow human beings.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, I rise to support the amendment moved by  the

Member for Bukit Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can understand that we are living it a world

dominated  by  certain economic  factors  and,  of

course, it is a custom nowadays largely to adopt a

materialistic attitude towards life. The real  and

the  selfish idea of family planning is  that,  if

there  are  fewer people around the  table,  there

will  be much to eat. Of course, it will be argued

that  Singapore cannot support a larger population

than  it  does at present. So also, it might  have

been  argued in other capitals of the world,  but,

as  their  population grows, those  capitals  have

adapted  themselves and have tried  to  set  their

economic house in order. So also will we  be  able

to  do  this when we come face to face  with  such

problems.  Nothing  could be, in  my  opinion,  so

short-sighted  as  the  Government  provision  for

family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that those who advocate family planning

know, in their heart of hearts, that this is not a

solution  to the problem. It is only running  away

from  the problem, and those Assemblymen  who  are

going to support family planning are supporting an

issue  equivalent to the slow slaying of a  rising

nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  rise  to support the Chief Minister in opposing

this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the work of the Family Planning

Association is a negative one. It seeks,  for  one

thing,  to prevent coming into this world children

who  might not be properly looked after,  properly

fed,  and properly brought up. For another  thing,

it seeks to space the coming of children into this

world  according  to the financial  means  of  the

parents.  It  therefore benefits both the  parents

and the children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its work being of a negative nature, it is not

easy  for this Association to prove to you how many

unwanted  children have been prevented from  coming

into  this world. It would require much longer time

to be able to judge their success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Association offers its assistance

voluntarily  to all those who need such assistance.

It  compels  no woman or her husband  to  seek  the

assistance it is willing to give. Many  of  us  who

are  not  mental  cases have not  objected  to  the

amount  of  money that has been spent and  will  be

spent   every   year  on  Woodbridge  Hospital.   I

therefore do not see why public revenue should  not

be  spent  on  the  work  of  the  Family  Planning

Association even by those who object to the use  of

contraceptives and other forms of prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the record supplied to me by this

Association, it seems that in 1954 it had  assisted

9,000  women, and assuming that that number remains

the  same, $85,000 a year would mean spending  less

than $10 per person to help such a person either to

prevent  or to space the period of children  coming

into  this world to their happiness and to the good

of Singapore as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it

might  be  thought  that, as the  oldest  unmarried

Member  of  the House, my interest in this  subject

would  be  academic but I find  that  I  cannot  be

neutral  as  I  have  quite decided  views  on  the

matter. I may claim, however, to put forward what I

think to be a truly objective opinion because of my

single - some people call it - blessed state, and also,

Sir,  because I do not belong to any religious sect

which expressly forbids family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received, as I presume all hon.

Members have, a memorandum from a certain group  of

people enclosing their views on family planning. It

is a document containing many interesting, if to my

mind  specious, arguments, but the  main  theme  is

that  birth  control is unnatural.  The  memorandum

then reminds us that the word "nature" has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



several meanings, but in this case is used  in  the

ethical  sense. "Birth control", it says,  "is  the

deliberate  frustration of a function which  nature

clearly intended for an important specific end."  I

am  afraid  I  cannot accept the argument.  Man  is

always  interfering with nature, taming nature  and

bending  nature to his will, and if we did  nothing

contrary  to nature, we would presumably  allow  no

surgeon  to  use a knife, and shaving,  of  course,

would be quite out of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would emphasise that we should

all  respect  the opinions of those who  object  to

family planning on religious grounds, just as we do

the  opinions of those Indian races whose hair  has

never  known a scissors nor face a razor. For those

people  who object to family planning on  religious

grounds  or  on any grounds at all - incidentally,  I

may   say   that  the  memorandum  lists   a   most

frightening  number  of diseases  which  can  arise

through the use of contraceptives - all they have  to

do is to have nothing to do with it. But the reason

for  this  debate  is surely the  dog-in-the-manger

attitude of these very people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memorandum to which I have just referred

urges the Members of this Assembly not to force the

members  of  their organisations to contribute  tax

money   against  their  conscience  to  the  F.P.A.

programme and thus jeopardise the respect of  their

electors.  Well, Sir, I have not in any  case  been

elected,  and  so  I  can speak quite  freely;  but

somebody's conscience must always be worried by the

way  Government money is spent and  I  cannot  take

this plea too seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the organisation to which I have referred

makes  light  of  the fact that in 20  years'  time

Singapore may have a population of two million. "So

what!" they say, "many other cities have more  than

this,  and do not think so badly of it." Now,  Sir,

may I, with your permission, read to the Assembly a

few   sentences  from  an  extract  of  the   Joint

Committee  appointed  by  the  two  Houses  of  the

Legislature  to  examine  the  question  of   over-population in Barbados and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



to  make  recommendations for  dealing  with  this problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The population at the end of 1961 has been

estimated  at  255,600, or 1,540 per square  mile,

one  of the densest in the world. The actual  rate

of increase has so far worked out in excess of the

estimate. The Committee takes a most serious  view

of  these staggering figures and urges that  steps

be   taken  with  the  least  possible  delay   to

alleviate  the situation. It points  out  that  if

early  action is not taken, the result must be  an

increasingly   lower  standard  of   living   with

consequent   misery   for  everyone.   Among   the

implications of over-population is the  fact  that

the  Government  services,  such  as  the  General

Hospital,  the water supply and schools,  are  all

inadequate  and  are  being or  will  have  to  be

enlarged  at  a  tremendous  first  cost  and   an

increasing  recurrent  cost  that  is  beyond  the

economic  resources of the island. Another  effect

is  unemployment and under-employment. There is  a

great  deal of both of these evils at the  present

time, and they will become progressively worse."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then finally, the Address of His Excellency

the  Governor  at  the  opening  of  the  Barbados

Legislative session, 1954/55.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Government believes that the overpopulation

problem  must be approached not only  through  the

development  of local resources but  also  through

the  promotion  of  planned parenthood  among  the

people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, there is something of an analogy

here  for  Singapore  in that  our  population  is

increasing at the rate of three per cent per annum

cumulatively,   and  with  each  succeeding   year

Government's task in providing education, medical,

housing, social and other services becomes one  of

increasing  magnitude. Even the World  Bank,  that

august  body which visited Malaya recently,  urged

Government  support for public and private  bodies

to adopt family planning in the long run interests

of the Malayan people and their welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it must be obvious to anyone with an

elementary    knowledge   of   mathematics    that

population   increases   in   some   sort   of   a

progression,  and  that with higher  standards  of

living  and the technique of preventive  medicine,

the rate of infant mortality, for instance, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



likely  to be reduced, and so on. Where will  that

lead  us in 50 years', 30 years' or even 20 years'

time?  Well,  it may be that man's fecundity  will

diminish, but I should not bank on that!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there cannot be a soul in this House who

does not shrink in horror from the thought of  war

involving  nuclear  weapons; but,  of  course,  if

these  weapons  were  used, they  would  certainly

destroy the destroyers as well as the victims, and

the  chances are that they will never be so  used.

In  fact, they may be even turned to man's use.  A

far  greater problem, in my humble opinion, is the

uncontrolled  growth of population, especially  in

those Asian countries whose economies are, in  any

case,  non-viable. Can anyone  deny  that  in  the

lower   income  groups  the  children  of  smaller

families  have a better chance in life than  those

of  larger  families?  They have  better  feeding,

better attention and healthier living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to pose as a feminist - in

fact, I usually take the opposite role - but I think

it is a great pity that there are no women Members

in this Assembly so that we could hear their point

of  view.  Among those who oppose family planning,

it is usually the arrogant male of the species who

shouts  the  loudest! He forgets, of course,  that

the  part  he plays in bringing children into  the

world  is a comparatively minor one, and  that  he

plays  an even smaller part in looking after  them

when  they  have  made  their  appearance  on  the

planet!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like to suggest that we rid our

minds  of  cant. There are people who, because  of

their beliefs, will always oppose family planning.

So be it. But there are vast numbers of women  in

this  city weary of the burden of incessant child-bearing  to  whom  family  planning  would   bring relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would say that the members

of  the  Family  Planning Association  are  decent

people   who  are  seeking  to  bring  relief   to

sufferers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



They   are  working  neither  for  gain  nor   for

notoriety. They are not corrupt themselves, nor do

they  seek  to corrupt others. They are  certainly

not   trying  to  make  sex  relations  safe   for

democracy! Government, in my opinion, should  give

them  the  utmost  support in the  work  they  are

doing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am glad

that my colleague the Hon. the Chief Minister  has

stated  just  now  that  religion  should  not  be

brought   into   this  Assembly   in   this   most

controversial subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an elected Member of this Assembly, naturally

I  received quite a number of representations from

my  constituency.  I  received  several  memoranda

signed  by  72  members and one  telegram  from  a

person  unknown to me. I will first  mention  that

these  72  members opposed the grant  proposed  by

Government. The other memorandum that  I  received

was  from the Family Planning Association. In view

of  these  representations, I went  and  consulted

many  members of my constituency, the  electorate,

and  to my surprise, a large majority are for  the

Family Planning Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in advising on family planning, the work is

two-fold.  It  shows couples how  to  space  their

children  so  as to allow time for the  mother  to

recover her strength fully between births and also

to   protect  her  own  health  and  that  of  her

children.  Secondly, how to have as many  children

as  the  parents want and can afford to  have,  to

feed,  house, clothe and educate them. In  drawing

attention to the word "educate", which happens  to

be  my Ministry, hon. Members are aware that  many

children are without places in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Build more schools for them!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The question is not to build

more  schools.  The  question  is  to  space   the

children  and  to  have as many  children  as  the

parents  can afford to feed and house them.  There

is always the clamour against Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



that it is not doing enough to feed the people, to

give  social  services to the poor,  and  to  give

education to all that need education. If we do not

have  family planning in a country like Singapore,

where  the  population is increasing by  55,000  a

year,  we will soon have a state in which it  will

be  almost impossible for any government to do its

share  in providing all the facilities that  human

beings are entitled to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to stress that the Family Planning

Association is not trying to limit any  couple  to

the  number  of children they want, but  they  are

only  doing  it  in an advisory capacity,  telling

them  how  to  space  their children,  ensure  the

mother's  health, and to have as many children  as

they  want and can afford. There is no compulsion,

and  I  therefore do not see any objection to  the

provision  by  Government of this  most  admirable

project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, although I have walked across the floor, I am

in full agreement with the Hon. the Chief Minister

on  one  issue,  and that issue is  that  religion

should not come into the debates of this Assembly.

However controversial the subject may be, religion

is entirely out of the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not opposed to family planning myself, but

what  I  am opposed to is that vote being allotted

to  this Association under the Head: Contributions

and  Charitable Allowances. If this vote had  come

under  the  Head:  Social Welfare,  I  would  have

gladly  supported the vote, but  for  it  to  come

under "Contributions and Charitable Allowances", I

am afraid, Sir, that many other associations would

apply  to the Government for contributions.  Where

are  we  to  end  then?  We have  listed  so  many

associations and if we are going to vote money for

associations,  we are using public funds  for  the

purpose  of  associations.  The  subject   is   so

controversial and delicate that I am not  prepared

to discuss the merits or demerits of this question

and I think I am going to remain neutral.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I had

decided  at  the beginning not to  speak  on  this

subject, but I have changed my mind after  hearing

the  arguments put forward by both sides. For  the

arguments  that have been put forward  for  family

planning,  I think, are not valid. I am supporting

the  motion for deleting this provision  from  the

Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been suggested by those who support

family  planning that limitation of population  is

good  for  Singapore because it is  getting  over-populated. Sir, what is good and what is bad is  a

matter  of opinion with each human being and  that

opinion  varies with the times. At the moment,  we

are  in  times  of peace and we  do  not  want  to

increase  our  population. But there  are  nations

which  when  they go to war require cannon  fodder

and then they give bonuses to families who produce

more and more children. So, I think, Sir, that  the

opinion as to what is good or bad varies with  the

times  and, therefore, man must fall back  on  the

fundamental teachings of religion to find a stable

rock on which to lean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the Family Planning

Association  does not force anyone  to  perpetrate

its teachings. That is true. It has also been said

that  the  F.P.A. is seeking this way of  limiting

births  to  those poorer sections of the community

who,  everyone  will  realise,  are  not  educated

enough. Sir, there is always the fear that if  you

teach something which may become dangerous, it  is

better not to take it to those sections who do not

know  how to handle it. For instance, in the  case

of a radio-active substance, you will take care to

give  it to a person who understands how to handle

it,  how  to  control  it,  and  how  to  keep  it

securely.  You will not give it to  a  person  who

does not know how to handle it lest he may destroy

himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The rich understand better

than the poor about family planning.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is not a question of rich

or  poor.  It is a question of whether you  should

teach a thing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



persons who do not know how to handle it, and  who

may, in time, be destroyed by it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been suggested by Mr Sutherland

that   Asian  countries  are  over-populated  and,

therefore,  it would be better for them  to  limit

births.  Sir, I think that is a negative attitude.

If  you are afraid of over-populated nations, then

throw  open  those areas of the  world  which  are

under-populated. Give the human race a  chance  to

expand. Why limit it? This is a negative attitude.

It  has  also been said that the poor man has  not

got  enough educational facilities and so on. That

again  is  a negative attitude. The answer  is  to

provide more for the people. That is the right way

to  approach  the  problem, not  by  limiting  the

population through birth control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I   agree  with  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister's

attitude  that  this  controversial  problem   and

religion cannot mix up all together, but I  cannot

agree with him when he is against the amendment. I

wish  all  Members of this House to  answer  me  a

question.  Is  it  or is it not a  fact  that  our

Malayan nation is big enough - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us have some order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> - to say, "We want Merdeka,

independence, and so on, and so on"?  Yet,  please

check  up how many aliens or outsiders or colonial

workers are in this Colony alone. In other  words,

we need more manpower to build this country. Think

of  it,  we  are  so close to the  border  of  the

Federation where there is so much vacant land, yet

we grumble and say how congested Singapore is. So,

Sir,  I wish all Members of this House would  look

at  this question more from the political point of

view  that our manpower cannot meet the growth  of

the Malayan nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I will support the amendment based on

the  oriental  tradition. Sir, we Eastern  nations

can  learn a lot from the Western nations, but  as

regards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



parental love, I do not think any Western nation can

challenge  us.  I  give an answer to  our  hon.  Mr

Sutherland when he said, "We regret that we have  no

female  Member in this House." I will  represent  my

wife  to this House! She has told me that she wishes

to have a dozen children!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Very good! You can afford it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I can assure this House that

even when I have a dozen children and am jobless  or

cannot  afford  to feed them, I will never  sell  or

kill  them! To kill them or sell them is crazy! Now,

how about the practice of birth control? Is there no

similarity between it and the limitation of  natural

birth?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Think of your wife!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> My wife wants it! I cannot

stop her!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have gone through the list of

volunteer workers in the Family Planning Association

when  I  received their memorandum  on  this  coming

debate.  It was a surprise to me to find  that  many

wealthy ladies are members of this Association,  and

I  think  if  all  the  volunteer  workers  in  this

Association think that this is the right  thing  for

them  to  do,  then simply not go to the Government,

not  go  to  the taxpayer but ask their husbands  to

contribute  to  the sum of money that  is  required.

Besides there is a lot of other social welfare  work

for  these  ladies to do. But, please, for  goodness

sake, do not introduce birth control in this country

because  we want to maintain the oriental  tradition

and keep the growth of the Malayan nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  am  very glad indeed that, from the outset,  this

controversial subject has been lifted from the plane

of religious intolerance. I would go further and ask

Members  of this House not to be influenced  by  the

many  memoranda  and requests we  have  each  of  us

received  and  not think of this question  from  the

point of view of vote-catching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>

or  keeping promises to voters before the  election. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Now, to my mind, this is a very

simple question. We have to think of the whole thing

objectively: whether or not the expenditure of  this

$85,000 is to be beneficial or harmful to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went through the Budget yesterday and we are

quite  convinced  that expenditure  will  mount  and

mount and keep mounting as the years go by. Whatever

we  do, we will not be able to cope with the present

population,  which  we  have in  Singapore,  to  say

nothing  of  the  increase in population  that  will

arise, without some measure of family planning. I am

told  that  we  have  about 40,000  people  who  are

unemployed or are partially unemployed. Add to  that

another 10,000 who will be leaving schools each year

and  who  will  be looking for jobs.  The  Hon. the

Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J.

M. Jumabhoy) says: "Let us have all of them, as many

as possible." Will he be able to find jobs for these

people?  If you get so many unemployed people,  what

is  going  to happen? You are only going to increase

discontent,  subversion and trouble. If  we  are  to

plan our families and only raise the number that  we

can  afford, there will be much less misery in  this

world  and  in Singapore in particular. I have  gone

through  my  constituency, Sir. I have  been  through

huts  where  there is only a small  space  of  about

thirty  feet square. In it, I have found the father,

mother and ten children -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Share your house with them!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Now, some of them have ten or

more  children and the man is earning less than $100

a  month.  Who  is  going to look  after  all  these

children,  and  who  is going to  pay  for  all  the

expenses incurred in child-birth? The result is  that

he  gets  into debt. He goes and worries  relations.

All  the  children are under-fed and in  the  normal

course of events, many children die.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



Do  you prefer them to suffer and die rather  than

to stop producing them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Why bring them up?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. Hon. Members must

please remember that they are in Committee and  if

they want to speak, again there is an opportunity.

They  can  speak  ten times,  but  please  do  not

interrupt. Please continue, Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I have finished.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am glad

the  Member for Paya Lebar raised this  point.  It

strikes  me  that it is the rich who will  support

family  planning  and they will do  all  they  can

because they are afraid that the poor people  will

expand  in numbers; the population will grow,  and

one  day  the  rich will have to part  with  their

money to give the poor education. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> So income tax will have to

be  raised to provide more schools, hospitals, and

so  on,  for the children of the poor.  Maybe  the

best way is to limit the population, and then  the

rich  can  live in their palaces and  enjoy  their

lives.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I heard Mr Lim Cher Kheng. Would

the hon. Member like to speak again?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I rise to speak

with  no sense of pleasure. This is just one  more

skirmish  in the eternal battle between light  and

darkness,   between   knowledge   and   ignorance,

intelligence and stupidity, reason and  prejudice,

and  between  science and magic. It is  a  battle

which  has been fought through the ages. We  might

go  back  about a hundred years, I think,  to  the

invention   of  chloroform.  You  will  recollect,

perhaps, that there was a lot of opposition to the

use of chloroform for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



women  in child-birth. The Christian people  said,

"This  is  very  wrong. Women  should  bear  their

children in pain, for it says so in the Bible. The

Bible  cannot  be  wrong.  They  must  bear  their

children  in  pain and suffering."  And  then,  of

course,  the  advocates of chloroform pointed  out

that  at the very beginning of the Bible, you have

the  story of how the first man gave birth to  the

first woman. Adam was put into a deep sleep by the

Lord and the woman was taken out of his side.  And

so   the   Bible  apparently  contradicted  itself

because, whereas the prophets said this, God, had,

in  fact, done the other thing; God had put a  man

into  a  deep sleep in order that he might produce

another human being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is an eternal battle and we are

gradually   winning   it.  Reason,   intelligence,

understanding, and sympathy for people's suffering

do  gradually get the better of timidity  and  the

fear  of  anything  new  which  tend  to  dominate

people's  minds. I do not want to go on about  the

religious  point of view because  this  is  not  a

place  for  that sort of argument, but  we  had  a

similar  skirmish in this eternal  battle  in  the

very  early  days  of  the  old  Labour  Party  of

Singapore. It was then, I think, we had the  first

vote for family planning - a very small sum, $10,000

or  $15,000,  I  cannot remember the  figures - but,

anyhow,  it  was bitterly opposed  by  people  who

said,  "Well, this is a very wrong thing  to  help

any  woman  to  avoid child bearing."  The  Labour

Party  had a lot of internal discussions about  it

and  they came out with a statement condemning the

vote.  Perhaps  I might read you a little  bit  of

this because it puts the case rather well:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a non-sectarian political Party, Labour does

not  seek  to  form  policy on religious  grounds.

Birth  control  is to be left to the  individual's

free  will and conscience. From the practical side

of  the  question,  Labour is not  convinced  that

birth control teaching and family planning clinics

will  make  any real contribution to  solving  the

problem of a large birth rate tending towards over-population."



<br><br>I  personally  agree with this. I am reluctant  to

shoot  down anybody who is fighting on my side  in

this skirmish, but I do not think myself that  you

will get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



any  significant reduction in your  population  by

encouraging  the  use  of contraceptives,  because

there  are no contraceptives at present  which  do

not  demand  certain  habits  of  punctuality  and

regularity, and certain sanitary conveniences  and

so on, which are, in fact, not available. Even the

long-promised pill (which I do not think has  even

appeared  in a practical form yet), - even  that  is

going to mean that people have got to take a  pill

and  they  have to remember to take it, and  I  am

afraid  they  will forget or they  will  lose  the

pill.  In  any case, I do not think it will  work.

However, that is a point of view. I would not  say

I am right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My personal opinion is that it is not going to

have  a  significant effect on  the  size  of  the

population whether you have it or not,  and  I  am

reluctant  to disappoint my very good  friend  and

colleague,  the  Hon. the Assistant  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry (Mr J. M.  Jumabhoy)  who

apparently  envisaged  Singapore  building  up  an

enormous  army and embarking on some  campaign  of

imperialist  aggression to bring SouthEast  Asia

under our control, supported, if I understood  him

rightly,  by the Member for Changi (Mr  Lim  Cher

Kheng),  who also demanded more manpower.  Perhaps

he  envisaged  an  attack on  the  Federation  and

taking over their lands; I am not sure. Anyhow, he

seems  to  think  in those terms,  but  I  do  not

personally think that it is a religious  point  of

view   to   suggest  that,  in  order   to   avoid

contraception, we should embark on war. That is my

religion, but it may not be the same as others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I might continue to refer to this

original  draft memorandum put out by  the  Labour

Party of Singapore. We drew attention to the  fact

that   in   Great  Britain  in  this   connection,

according   to  Eva  Hubbard  who  is  a   reputed

authority  on the subject - she is on the Population

and  Investigation Committee - more than 50 per cent

of  the mothers in Great Britain say, after birth,

that  their  child was unplanned and  unwanted.  I

remember also that the British Medical Association

at about the same time quoted figures to say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



there  were 60,000 illegal abortions taking  place

in  Britain, amounting to about 10 per cent of the

total  conceptions. If you take those two  figures

together,  you  get  about  55  per  cent  of  all

conceptions  which are unwanted and  unplanned  in

Great Britain, a country with a much more advanced

standard of education than we have here and which,

of  course, has had birth control well  known  for

about  a  hundred  years, since the  time  of  the

Bradlaugh-Besant trial. On those grounds, it seems

to  me  unlikely  that you are going  to  get  any

significant   reduction  in   birth   control   in

Singapore  and  that is not an argument  which  I

personally  accept  as  justifying  this  vote  of

$85,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring this discussion back to

the plane on which it should have been kept. There

has  been,  to  my  mind, far  too  much  laughter

amongst  a group of men who are dealing with  what

is  in  the long run a woman's problem. I am going

to  give one particular instance which I know  and

where  I  have  been concerned  in  trying  to  do

something  to  help. There is a poor woman  living

quite  close to my house. We try and keep in touch

with  the  people around us. We try and give  them

help  and,  in  the case of this  woman,  she  had

twelve children and was very hard up. She found it

very hard to feed her children. We got her a part-time  job washing clothes. She could come out  for

an  hour  or two in the morning to do the  washing

and  then  get  back and look after  the  children

again. By this means she could bring in some more

money  for the family. Well, she worked very  well

and  happily. She was extremely grateful  but,  in

due course, she had to give up the work because  a

thirteenth  child was on the way. It is  extremely

wrong that anybody should laugh at this. It is not

a  comic  story.  It  is a  story  of  the  tragic

suffering of a poor woman in a mud-floor hut  down

in the Serangoon end of Potong Pasir. We went down

to  see  her.  We gave her some little  help,  but

there  she  was, with the children  all  over  the

floor.  One of them was in a high state of  fever,

but she herself was too weak and languid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



to  be  able to look after it. Another had  fallen

into the drain and scratched all the skin off  his

leg,  and there was nobody to look after  him,  to

get  him to a clinic to have a bit of anti-tetanus

serum. We had to look after that. The whole family

was  in  a  state  of  great poverty  and  misery,

although   the  woman  herself  was  an  admirable

person,  being  extremely hard-working,  cheerful,

willing and doing the very best she could to carry

this  family burden. I do not want to seem  to  be

coarse,  but I think I should continue with  this:

that  her  husband insisted on having  intercourse

with  her  up to within 24 hours of the time  that

her  thirteenth baby was born. That baby  has  now

been  born and is paralysed all down the left side

and  will  live  and die a helpless  cripple.  The

mother  is so reduced in strength that she  cannot

go back to work at present and she has got another

mouth  to  feed  on  an  insufficient  salary  and

without  the  strength  even  to  look  after  the

children,  quite apart from feeding them.  She  is

still  there trying to get off her bed, trying  to

look  after  her children and without help.  Well,

that   is  a  typical  case,  to  my  mind,  which

justifies  this  grant and any  Member  who  votes

against this $85,000 is voting for women all  over

Singapore  to  go  on  under those  conditions - for

children  to  be born paralysed, for  children  to

grow  up  in  over-crowded families  uncared  for,

unloved,  doomed for their whole lives to  be  bad

citizens, to be a burden on the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is one more point. The Member for

Changi  said,  in his final peroration,  I  think,

"For  God's  sake  or  for heaven's  sake  do  not

introduce birth control into Singapore." Now, I am

afraid he is very far behind the times. There  has

been the practice of birth control in this part of

the world long before the West ever came here -

Economic  Products of Malaya" by Mr Burkill,  you

will  find  page  after page of jungle  herbs  and

roots  with  their  Malay  names,  their  Sumatran

names;  sometimes they are Chinese names, or  they

are  Sakai  names;  and they are  noted  there  as

economic products because they are connected  with

and sold and used either to produce abortion or in

the  hope of preventing conception. That has  been

going  on here from time immemorial, as it has  in

every part of the world, because women have always

suffered  this  burden of excessive  childbearing.

Their  husbands have imposed it on them, and  they

have had to carry it and they have therefore tried

to  avoid it in one way or another. You can hardly

talk  to  a  family  in this city  without  coming

across a case of some woman who has tried to bring

about  an  abortion  and  has  killed  herself  or

permanently damaged her health in the process, and

that  is going to happen as long as you have these

unwanted  conceptions and you are  going  to  have

people  seeking  to produce abortion.  It  is  not

facing  the facts at all to say, "Do not introduce

family  planning. Do not introduce  birth  control

into Singapore." You have already got it here. You

may  say,  "Let us have it as dirty, as unhealthy,

as  magical, as wrong, as harmful, or as expensive

as  possible,  by all means. Let  us  do  all  the

damage  we  can with it, because women will  still

demand  it."  But  you wish to  deny  them  having

something  which is clean, scientific, reasonable

and secure. I hope Members will remember that this

is  not  a  subject for humorous remarks  although

they  are very easy and tempting to make,  but  at

the  back of it all does lie an enormous  mass  of

human  suffering  which we ought to  relieve,  and

which  we  can  relieve,  through  this  voluntary

Association  which  is doing this  remarkable  and

expanding job of taking away some of the burden of

ignorance  and  suffering which  men  impose  upon

women.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think

the Hon. the Minister for Communications and Works

is mistaken about birth control when he says



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



that  it  has  been  practised quite  long  ago  in

Malaya.  He must be innocent of the fact that  many

abortions are due to illicit intercourse especially

among - I  am  so  sorry to offend  them - the  Malays.

Because  of illicit intercourse they try to  avoid

the punishment. That is why they seek a herb called

"kong  thow", which is an unhygienic means of birth

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have just now pointed out, all the volunteer

workers  and  supporters  of  the  Family  Planning

Association,  including the  wives  of  our  Deputy

Speaker (Mr R. C. H. Lim) and the Member for  Paya

Lebar  (Mr  Lim Koon Teck) are wealthy.  They  can

easily  contribute a sum of $85,000, but it is  not

for  the  Government to support  the  principle  of

granting  this  sum of money for  family  planning,

which is against the feelings of a large section of

the  public.  There  are also  a  majority  of  the

taxpayers who are against it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I rise to oppose this amendment. I

think  it is very necessary and desirable  at  this

stage  of the debate to quote the aims and  objects

of  the Singapore Family Planning Association. Sir,

this body is a voluntary Association the objects of

which are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(i) to educate the people in healthy family

planning   and   to  provide  facilities   for

scientific   contraception  so  that   married

people  may space or limit their families  and

thus  promote their happiness in married  life

and mitigate the evils of ill-health and over-crowding;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to advocate and promote the

establishment  of family planning  centres  at

which,  in  addition to advice  on  scientific

contraception,  women can get advice  on,  and

when   necessary  for,  any  or  all  of   the

following:

<pre>

      (a) involuntary sterility;

      (b) minor gynaecological ailments; and

      (c) difficulties connected with the marriage relationship;

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to encourage the production of healthy

children  who  are  an  asset  to  the  nation

provided  that the parents have the  help  and

means  to  give  them a reasonable  chance  in

life; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to examine such other steps as are relevant

to  the  above and to take such action as  may

be considered as advisable."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Association has been functioning in

Singapore  for the past seven years. It  is  widely

known  for  its good work to both the educated  and

the  uneducated people of Singapore. The  attention

of  many  people,  who have the interests  and  the

welfare  of  the people of Singapore at heart,  has

been  drawn  to the activities of this Association,

which  have  increased considerably.  Consequently,

this Association has to its credit the services  of

about   102  volunteer  workers  acting  as  office

bearers,  Committee  members, a  senior  staff  and

voluntary workers, a fact which, of course, only  a

very  few voluntary organisations in Singapore have

the  good  fortune  to point to  with  pride.  This

includes,  Sir, the broad-minded, enthusiastic  and

public-spirited  wives  of  the  Members   of   the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment before the House, Sir, is in itself

a  compliment  to the work of this Association  and

ample  testimony  of  the wide  interest  taken  by

Members  of  this  Assembly  in  regard  to  family

planning.  Whichever  way  you  look  at  it,   the

Association has been doing very useful work for the

community  generally, and it was not a surprise  at

all   to  me  when  the  Government  repeated   the

provision   of   financial   assistance   to   this

organisation to promote its aims and objects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grant of $60,000 as contribution was

provided  in  the 1955 Budget for the  first  time,

this attracted considerable public attention. Since

then, the subject of family planning and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



Government   contribution  has  met   with   severe

criticism  by members of a certain section  of  the

public,  especially the Roman Catholic denomination

of  the Christian religion, so much so that certain

candidates to the last Assembly election chose this

subject  as  one  of  their election  platforms.  A

reflection  of that promise made at these  election

campaigns  can  be seen in the form  in  which  the

amendment  has  been introduced this  morning.  The

amendment  seeks to delete in toto the  contribution

of  $85,000  to this organisation. Sir,  I,  on  my

behalf,   and  on  behalf  of  my  electorate,   am

dispassionately  against the  amendment.  First  of

all, let me pay my sincere tribute to those who are

against  this expenditure for the courage of  their

convictions. I think honest criticisms can clear up

all misunderstandings underlying the opposition  to

this provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Singapore is increasing

steadily  year by year. In 1954, there were  56,931

births  and  10,790 deaths. The rate of births  was

5.26  times  over  deaths. This  works  out  at  an

average  of  1,090  babies  in  one  week.  It   is

estimated - I am quoting the Singapore Annual  Report

for the year 1954 - that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number of children in the primary age group

of  7-12 years was 144,800 in 1954, but this figure

will  rise  to  239,500 by 1959 the increase  being

nearly  20,000 a year in 1955, increasing to 23,000

a   year   in   1958.  To  provide   extra   school

accommodation  necessary in  these  critical  years

there is a need for 20 new schools a year, and  for

600 teachers."



<br><br>Increased needs will also arise year by year as the

population increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social services, like housing and public

assistance, also tend to increase very  heavily  in

expenditure.  There has been a very sharp  increase

year by year. In 1953, $2,423,503 was paid to 6,835

families and in 1954 nearly $3.6 millions to  9,943

families.  The estimated expenditure  in  1955  was

shown   as   $5  millions.  Most  of  the  families

receiving  public assistance usually complain  that

they  cannot  make both ends meet, because  of  the

cost  of  education,  medical attention,  etc. for

their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast increase in population, accompanied by

the existing high per-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



centage  of illiteracy, low earnings of the people,

and  the  large number of children and  dependants,

should serve as an eye-opener to all right-thinking

men  or  women and cause them to devise new methods

of   improving  the  economic  standards   of   the

community. It can safely be said that the provision

of  social security is not the only solution. There

is  also room for the concept of the prevention  of

new  life on the grounds of duty to care for  those

already  living.  Certain  improvements  cannot  be

effected by measures taken by Government only,  but

voluntary organisations also can help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Planning Association, Sir, I submit,

is  such an organisation aimed at improving  family

life.  Sir,  my main interest in the  work  of  the

Family  Planning Association is in  so  far  as  it

serves  the  poor  families of the  community.  The

Association's record of activities lists  also  the

following.  I  am  now reading,  Sir,  extracts  of

figures that I have been able to get on the  income

groups: -



<pre>

  "Those  who receive  less  than

  $100  per  month or unemployed, etc.       768 persons - 26.83 per cent.



   Those from $101 to $200 per

   month                                   1,284 persons - 44.85 per cent.



   Those from $201 to $300 per

   month                                     374 persons - 13.06 per cent.



   Those from $301 to $400 per

   month                                     146 persons - 5.10 per cent.



   Those from $401 to $500 per

   month                                      46 persons - 1.06 per cent.



   Those from $501 and above per

   month                                     244 persons - 8.05 per cent".

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I maintain that a contribution from

Government  funds to such a voluntary  organisation

is  fully  justified. Having said this, let  me  now

turn  to  what  governments in other parts  of  the

world  are  doing  to  assist the  Family  Planning

Association in their respective countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently in Tokyo there was a conference of

delegates  representing  organisations  on   family

planning.  Fifteen  countries were  represented  at

that conference, and it is very important to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>

note  that  three  of these countries  do  receive

direct  government aid. They are India, Japan  and

Egypt.  Although countries like the United States,

the  United  Kingdom,  Sweden,  Denmark,  Holland,

Pakistan, Ceylon, Germany and South Africa do  not

get   direct  financial  aid,  the  majority  give

subsidies and assistance to local family  planning

organisations   in  the  form  of  equipment   and

premises.  In those countries where  there  is  no

government   subsidy,  facilities   are   provided

otherwise;  for  instance,  for  T.B. and  mental

patients.  The  State  provides  family   planning

facilities,  or  else it pays the family  planning

clinics.  Sir, in the case of countries  like  the

United States and the United Kingdom, there  is  a

basic  difference in the wages that they  receive.

In   Singapore  and  other  parts  of  the   Asian

countries, the basic wage is far lower  than  that

in the countries of Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our position, as compared to India, Japan,

Egypt and other Asian countries, is that we have a

very high percentage of illiteracy and our earning

capacity is very low and we have more than 50  per

cent  who  are  under 21. Sir,  in  Hongkong,  the

Government   provides  premises  for  the   Family

Planning  Association. In 1955,  the  organisation

received a token grant from the Government, a site

in  the  city for their new headquarters,  passage

expenses  for  their two delegates  to  the  Tokyo

conference.  In addition to this, the Jockey  Club

of  Hongkong  gives large donations  yearly.  This

year,  I  understand, a sum of (Hongkong) $125,000

has been contributed to their new building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Japan recognises her obligation to the

Family  Planning  Association. She  has  tried  to

prevent  large families by abortion. This means  a

danger  to mental health, maternal health  and  it

also   threatens   family  happiness   and   moral

character.  I  will  not, for a moment,  recommend

that we take such a step. But Japan is also giving

assistance to the Family Planning Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered some of the

countries, which do give subsidies to their Family

Planning Association.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



May  I  also, Sir, draw attention to a few remarks

made by a very eminent social worker in India  who

is  also  very actively connected with the  Family

Planning  Association there? This  eminent  social

worker  is Mrs. Allabhai B. Wardhya, and she  says

that  there  are  three necessary  conditions  for

planned parenthood in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In each country where it is sought to be

introduced,  it must meet the current  and  future

needs  and  fit in with the national  and  ethical

aims.  As far as religious scruples are concerned,

no rigid dogma seeks to rule out knowledge or what

the practice of fertility can solve. All the great

Asian   religions  forbid  killing   and   enjoins

compassion. A rational application of  this  could

find  ethical the concepts of the prevention of  a

new  life on the grounds of duty to care for those

already living."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to prolong my speech, Sir, with all

those  quotations, but I think what I have already

given will suffice for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main objection to the Singapore

Government's  contribution to the Family  Planning

Association  seems to me to come  from  the  Roman

Catholics.  As far as I can gather, they  too  are

not  opposed  to family planning in  the  broadest

sense. They differ only in the method employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a Hindu by religion. My ancestors were

very orthodox Hindus. Our religion forbids killing

in  all  forms. We are forbidden to kill chickens,

goats  and  even  ants. There are many  Hindus  in

Singapore   to-day,  and  if  the  contention   is

advanced  that  the tax collected from  the  Roman

Catholics  should  not  be  used  for  the  Family

Planning Association, I think the Hindus have just

as  right a claim to say that their religion  does

not  permit  the collection of their rates  to  be

utilised   for   the  construction,   maintenance,

staffing and equipment of slaughter houses. I also

think, Sir, that the Malays would also object  very

strongly   to   those  houses   where   pigs   are

slaughtered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is only one religion in this world,

or   if  Singapore  is  a  religious  state,  then

probably we will be able to impose such conditions

as  the Roman Catholics want us to do, but  may  I

ask  the  Roman  Catholics  of  Singapore  to   be

tolerant in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



the matter? The world at this critical stage cannot

exist   without  individual  members   or   various

religious  organisations exercising  tolerance  and

patience in their beliefs and activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me tell this Assembly

this: if you delete this provision from the Budget,

you will be taking away the basic right of the poor

woman  to  receive a knowledge of contraception,  a

knowledge  that  is  available  to  her   and   her

uneducated  sister  through  the  Family   Planning

Association; or, alternatively, the Government will

be forced to set up family planning centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir, I am confident that  all  the  hon.

Members  in  this  House  are  quite  aware  of  my

attitude towards the question of whether Government

should  use  the  taxpayers' money in  contributing

funds   to  the  Family  Planning  Association   of

Singapore. On the 29th of June, I was asked by  the

Member  for  the  Southern Islands  (Inche  Mohamed

Sidik  Bin  Haji Abdul Hamid) who,  I  believe,  is

against  family planning, what Government's  policy

was  towards the Family Planning Association and  I

replied  that Government had no set policy.  I  did

say,  on  behalf  of the Government,  that  as  the

matter  was  highly  controversial  the  Government

quite rightly decided that it should, at the proper

time,  be  freely debated in this House  where  one

could vote according to one's religious beliefs and

conscience;  and the Hon. the Financial  Secretary,

when  introducing the Budget, informed hon. Members

that  the  $85,000 under Head 3: Contributions  and

Charitable Allowances would form the subject  of  a

free  vote. Government has taken away the Whip  and

everyone  is  entitled to say what he thinks  about

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only issue before this House is whether

Government should finance with taxpayers' money the

Family  Planning Association of Singapore. All  the

Members who have spoken have advocated or, shall  I

say,  preached  the gospel of family  planning  and

have completely lost sight of the issue before  the

House.  Even  the Hon. the Chief Minister,  in  his

address to the House, has taken up the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



wrong  angle.  We  are not asked  to  vote  for  or

against  family planning. I respect  the  views  of

everyone  in  this House, whether  they  be  for  or

against.  I appreciate, however, that the Hon. the

Chief  Minister was perhaps answering  things  that

might  have  been  said  by the  Member  for  Bukit

Panjang (Mr Goh Tong Liang) who was talking  about

his Catholic ancestors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr R. C. H. Lim, in his address, also attacked

the  subject from the same angle. He was attempting

to  preach the gospel of family planning to us.  It

was   the  same  with  our  bachelor  Member   (Mr

Sutherland) - I cannot understand how such a good-looking gentleman is still a bachelor. He said that

family   planning  would  bring  relief  to  women.

Bachelors are usually reminded that they should get

married and do their duty to the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck)

asked  us  not to pay attention to the  appeals  of

members of the public who asked elected Members  to

safeguard their interests. I say to him that  every

Member  should  lend  a  sympathetic  ear  to   his

electorate and then use his sound judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Communications and

Works (Mr Thomas) made a rather pathetic appeal to

us.  He asked everyone to remain silent and serious

while he related a pathetic story in order to  play

upon our emotions. If he is such an ardent advocate

of  birth control and knows that the husband of the

lady he was talking about was insatiable, surely he

could have given the poor lady the necessary advice

or  brought  her  himself to  the  Family  Planning

Association? This lady's case, as are similar cases

in all parts of the world, is used as an example to

advocate  birth control. The answer to his  picture

of a poor home with poor uneducated children around

is  better housing and better education, a  matter,

which  I will touch on a little later. But  as  you

will see, all those who preach the gospel of family

planning  have strayed from the very  issue  before

the  House, and that is whether the sum of  $85,000

be deleted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Singapore - the voters who have

placed  the  elected  Members  in  power  in   this

House - comprise  of a number of races  of  different

creeds. Amongst them, of course, are Catholics,  to

which religion different races belong, embracing  a

large   number  of  Chinese,  Europeans,   Indians,

Eurasians and Tamils, who are certainly opposed  to

Government's grant. There is also a large number of

people  belonging to other Christian denominations.

There  are the Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and  Jews

who   consider  birth  control  and  the   use   of

contraceptives highly objectionable and resent that

part  of  their contribution towards  public  funds

should  be used for a purpose repugnant to them.  I

mention  this  not for the purpose of  raising  any

religious  views,  as  I and  every  right-thinking

person respect the views of others. There are forty

to  fifty thousand Catholics in Singapore of  whom,

taking  a  rough  estimate, thirty  to  thirty-five

thousand are eligible voters spread throughout  the

various  constituencies. I make no threat.  Amongst

the other bodies that I have mentioned, I know that

there  are  minority  groups  who  consider  family

planning not sinful. I have not been able to get an

estimate of the number of those who are anti-family

planning,  but  I  am satisfied that  there  are  a

considerable number from these different creeds who

object  to  taxpayers' money  being  used  for  the

Family  Planning  Association. In mentioning  these

groups, I do not wish, and I repeat once again,  to

raise any religious issues at all nor to impose the

will  of  any  religion  upon  the  Government.  My

purpose  in mentioning this is purely to  show  you

that  it  is  necessary for the  Government  to  be

cautious and not to ride roughshod over the  wishes

and conscience of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are debating today is not purely a matter

of dollars and cents but one that goes much deeper.

We  must  be  concerned with the  feelings  of  our

electorate  and whether or not we are safeguarding,

with  care,  consideration and  understanding,  the

most cherished views even of the minorities- I have

received, and I believe Members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



House have also received, petitions from persons of

different  religions  on the matter.  I  have  also

received  a  memorandum  from  an  association   of

University  students who have expressed their  deep

concern  in this matter. These youths belong  to  a

cross-section of our community, both  in  terms  of

economics and race, and yet they have expressed one

single  united  view against Government's  proposed

grant.  They possess a high sense of responsibility

and  they are the voters of tomorrow and we  cannot

disregard them. I have also received telegrams,  as

have some of you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not asking hon. Members to vote against

family  planning - to some of you it may  be  a  good

thing - but  I  suggest  that  the  Family   Planning

Association of Singapore could and should carry  on

without  any  contributions from public  funds,  as

associations in other parts of the world are doing.

Let  us  suppose that Government tomorrow says:  We

wish to conserve land in Singapore and therefore  a

public  crematorium must be built  and  all  people

dying  in Singapore should be cremated there. Would

not  the  Muslims, the Catholics and  others  whose

very  religious tenets forbid cremation  create  an

uproar  and  call  upon Government  to  change  its

policy?  I  am certain that we in this  House  will

agree that their wishes should be respected. I have

heard  the  argument,  and I have  heard  it  again

today,  that  the  Catholics  and  other  objecting

bodies should be more tolerant because the abattoir

was   built   with  public  funds  and   pigs   are

slaughtered there. I wish to say to the person  who

advanced that argument that he is ignorant  of  the

fact  that a special abattoir has been built solely

for the slaughter of cattle and sheep according  to

Muslim  rites, so that the Muslims and  Jews  whose

religious  laws proclaim pigs to be  unclean  have,

from  part  of their funds, contributed to  special

abattoirs   built  for  them  where   animals   are

slaughtered   without  offending  their   religious

beliefs. There is a special abattoir solely for the

slaughter of pigs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Out of public money!



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Yes, out of public money contributed,

as  we  all know, by the majority of the population

in Singapore, the Chinese. The money contributed by

the Muslims, which is a small amount, has been used

by  Government  to  build a  special  abattoir  for

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what hon. Members' views may be on the

question   of  birth  control  and   the   use   of

contraceptives,  no matter how  strongly  they  may

feel  that  it is a good thing, their  duty  is  to

respect  the wishes of even the minority  of  their

electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know from where my hon. Friend the

Member  for  Seletar (Mr Nair) got his information

about    this   international   family   parenthood

conference that was held in Tokyo. As you all know,

I   went   there  myself  and  I  have   first-hand

information on the subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> At Government expense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Yes, at Government expense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Shame! Why did you not put up -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. You can speak

afterwards, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Since my learned Friend has mentioned

this,  let  me  clarify  the situation.  Government

decided  to send two representatives to  Tokyo  for

this conference and it was felt by my Ministry that

it  would  be  a  good thing for me  to  go  as  an

observer.  I  felt  that it  might  be  politically

unwise  for  me to do so and I referred the  matter

not  only to my electorate but also to the Catholic

Social  Guild  and  I  had their  written  approval

before I decided to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that international conference, there were

sixteen  countries represented. I do not know  from

where my hon. Friend the Member for Seletar got his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



information  about  Egypt, because  Egypt  was  not

represented.  The  countries that were  represented

were  Australia,  Bermuda, Ceylon,  Great  Britain,

Hawaii,    Hongkong,   India,   Israel,   Pakistan,

Singapore,  South  Africa,  Sweden,  Thailand,  the

United States and an observer from Canada. Now, all

the   family   planning   associations   in   these

countries,  with the exception of India and  Japan,

are  run on voluntary contributions. Those in India

and  Japan  are Government financed.  The  Hongkong

Government  gave their family planning  association

this  year a token vote of (Hongkong) $5,000, which

is equivalent to about $2,000 odd of our money. The

Government is now asking us to give $85,000 to  the

Association. If the Jockey Club of Hongkong were to

contribute money to the Family Planning Association

here, I would have no objection at all, but my hon.

Friend the Member for Seletar commenced his address

by saying, when he was boosting the Family Planning

Association  of Singapore, that it is  a  voluntary

Association.  If  that were so,  I  would  have  no

objections whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, for the first time in history, the

majority of the Members are elected representatives

of  the  people.  It is the duty  of  a  democratic

government  to give the people what they  want  and

not  merely,  what is thought good  for  them.  The

World  Health Organisation brought up the  question

of  family  planning  in the House  of  Commons  in

August  1952, and I wish to quote the reply  which

was  given  by the Minister of Health on behalf  of

Her Majesty's Government:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The British Government has no intention of

imposing  birth  control on any  native  territory

under its jurisdiction."



<br><br>Speaking at the end of the debate on birth control,

Miss  Patricia  Hornsby- Smith,  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Ministry of Health, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have also great responsibilities of our own

towards  native populations under our jurisdiction.

Her   Majesty's  Government  have  set   themselves

against  imposing anything of this  nature  on  any

territory under our control. Hon. Members  will  be

in  no  doubt  how readily such a policy  would  be

misrepresented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



as  an attempt to control native populations to the

advantage of white minorities. Hon. Members must be

well  aware  of the dynamite which such  a  policy

would  carry.  Her  Majesty's  Government  do   not

consider the World Health Organisation competent to

discuss or express views on the social, economic or

ethical aspects of birth control."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Churchill, when he was Chancellor of the

Exchequer, referred to the use of contraceptives as

one of the most pernicious innovations of our time,

and  George  Bernard Shaw, who was a  non-Catholic,

called    the   use   of   contraceptives    mutual

masturbation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, like my hon. Friend, say that the matter is

not a laughing matter. It is serious. The maternity

and  child welfare centres and clinics run  by  the

Ministry   of  Health  in  England  have   received

specific directives on the subject. These  are  the

directives given:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister of Health has authorised a statement

that   Government   has  under  consideration   the

question  of  the  use  of institutions  which  are

controlled by local authorities for the purpose  of

giving advice to women on contraceptive methods. So

far  as  maternity  and child welfare  centres  are

concerned,  these  centres can properly  deal  only

with  expectant mothers, nursing mothers and  young

children, and it is the view of the Government that

it  is  not  the  function of the centres  to  give

advice  in  regard to birth control and that  their

use  for  such a purpose would be likely to  damage

the  proper working of these centres. At  the  same

time,  the Government considers that in cases where

there  are  medical grounds for  giving  advice  on

contraceptive   methods   to   married   women   in

attendance at the centres, it may be given but that

such  advice  should  be  limited  to  cases  where

further pregnancy would be detrimental to health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the acute division of public

opinion  on  the  subject  of  birth  control,  the

Government   has   decided  that  no   departmental

sanction,   which   may   be   necessary   to   the

establishment  of  such clinics for  expectant  and

nursing mothers, shall be given except on condition

that  contraceptive advice would be given  only  in

cases  where further pregnancy would be detrimental

to health."



<br><br>It winds up:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Authority will be aware that the Departmental

Committee  on  Maternal Mortality and Morbidity  in

their final Report published in 1932 called special

attention  to  the importance of the  avoidance  of

pregnancy by women suffering from organic  disease,

such  as  tuberculosis,  heart  disease,  diabetes,

chronic nephritis, etc. What is or is not medically

detrimental  to  health  must  be  decided  by  the

professional  judgment  of the  registered  medical

practitioner in charge of the clinics."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions for and against the passing of this

vote  to  the  Family Planning Association  take  a

multiple character. There is the economic view, the

religious  view, the political view and  the  anti-colonial view. Those who support the vote appear to

me to put the cart before the horse, by saying that

the encouragement of so-called family planning will

lessen squalor and poverty. I would suggest  to  my

hon.   Friends   that  squalor  and   poverty   can

unfortunately be found, but they are aspects of the

social, economic and political problems, which were

handed over by our predecessors. Let me quote  from

a  booklet  entitled:  "Is the  World  heading  for

Starvation?"  by  A.  G.  Doniforn,  M.A.,  Oxford,

Lecturer  in Political Economy, University  College

of  London. He cites the proceedings of the  United

Nations  Scientific Conference on the  conservation

and utilisation of resources as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In general, expert after expert concluded that it

was possible for the less wasteful use of resources

to  fuller  application of existing techniques  and

the exploitation of new scientific developments  to

support a far greater population than exists  today

at a much higher level of living."



<br><br>Again,  the  United Nations Food  and  Agricultural

Organisation Survey stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many people who have given serious study to the

population  problem prophesied  doom  for  much  of

mankind unless the rate of population growth can be

drastically  checked. It is worth reiterating  that

the  fundamental  solution of the problem  lies  in

increasing  the productivity of the  individual  by

putting at his disposal modern scientific knowledge

and  the tools of modern technology. To the  extent

that  this is done, every individual can  become  a

source  of  new wealth to his country  and  to  the

world. To the extent that this is not done, he is a

potential  liability,  unable  to  supply  his  own

needs,  let  alone helping to supply those  of  his

fellow-beings."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the conditions of the working

class are not improved by restricting the family to

its  size  but  in providing it with the  needs  it

requires.  The question of a minimum  wage  is  now

being  considered as a matter of great urgency.  In

my  opinion, those who wish to cloak the  evils  of

colonialism and capitalism will support this grant.

There  is  a  great mal-distribution of  wealth  in

society, and families



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



are  asked  to restrict their size by objectionable

methods  with a subsidy from public funds. I  quote

from  an  editorial from a Chinese daily,  the  Sin

Chew Jit Pao of the 21st July, 1954, when discussing

the  question  of the population of  Singapore  and

birth  control.  The  article wound  up  with  this

paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main solution to the problem of population

lies in scientific progress and improvement of  our

social and economic system. If men can be united in

peace  and help one another according to the  moral

law of justice and mercy, the world will experience

no  trouble in feeding a population ten times  more

numerous than the present one."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems ironical that while, on the one hand, we

are  told of squalor and poverty, on the other,  we

are  also  told  of the wealth that this  beautiful

island  has produced and is producing. We admit  we

have  this wealth, yet we must also admit  we  have

this  poverty and this squalor. Yes,  we  have  the

cubicles  of Chinatown and the Indian lines  around

Keppel  Harbour.  We have the  attap  huts  of  our

squatters and the thousands of human beings huddled

behind  Havelock Road and the persons  of  whom  my

hon.  Friend  spoke. In these areas people  suffer

squalor and poverty but, please note, not because as

normal human beings, they desire children, and once

they  have  them they can only support  them  with

difficulty. The reason is because, before our time,

no  attempt  was made to see that the  people  were

properly housed and paid proper wages, and  because

colonial   economy   did  not  allow   for   normal

industrialisation. This is the problem now. This is

our  heritage from the period fortunately now over,

when  nominated and official individuals played  at

politics and thought that so-called family planning

could  be disguised as a radical social reform.  We

are  now  asked to spend $85,000 of the  taxpayers'

money  on  a  scheme which nowhere  has  given  any

conclusive  proof that it can diminish squalor  and

poverty  and which incorporates obnoxious practices

welcomed  only by a few and rejected  by  the  more

normal masses. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



has  been said that no harm is done in the  use  of

contraceptives. Let me quote from a book  on  birth

control by Halliday Sutherland, M.D. - I am sorry  he

is   not  a  relation  of  yours,  Mr  Sutherland!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Medical Objections to Contraception":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All contraceptive methods of birth control are,

in  the first place, unphysiological because, apart

altogether  from preventing conception, they  either

hinder or prevent the absorption of hormones  which

may   have  some  part  in  promoting  health   and

compatibility in marriage."



<br><br>Professor McIlroy of the London School of  Medicine

for  Women  considered it to be more  widely  known

that neuroses are largely the result of the use  of

contraceptives and also that in women the  maternal

passion  is  even  stronger, for it  might  develop

later  than  sexual  passion and  would  ultimately

demand satisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dame Mary Scharliet - this is from the British

Medical Journal - said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An experience of well over forty years convinces

me  that  the artificial limitation of  the  family

causes  damage  to  a woman's nervous  system.  The

damage  done is likely to show itself in  inability

to  conceive when the restriction voluntarily  used

is  abandoned because a couple desire  offspring ...

Sometimes  such  a  woman is not only  sterile  but

nervous  and generally in poor health but the  more

common  occurrence is that she remains fairly  well

until  the  time  of the change of  life  when  she

frequently  suffers more on the nervous  side  than

does a woman who has lived a natural married life."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. James Young, D.S.O., M.D., F.R.C.S., said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Passing to the consideration of contraceptives,

we  have to note that harm to the genital canal can

be  produced  by  such methods  and  we  have  seen

infective lesions in which there was clear evidence

of  such a casual agent. On this subject there  is

urgent  room  for  further study  before  we  could

pretend to speak with authority. Indeed we are in a

position  of  having  allowed a gigantic  unhealthy

system  possessing much of danger to  the  national

health  to  go  up before our eyes almost  entirely

unhealed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst other things that are preached by the

Family Planning Association is the taking advantage

of  the sterile period of a woman, usually known as

the  "safety period". Amongst the religious  bodies

that  I  have  cited, there are  no  objections  to

anything that does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



contravene  the laws of nature. The  Catholics,  of

course,  feel much stronger about it and  say  that

that can only be used when necessary for the health

of the mother.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the earnest desire and intention of this

Government to give more medical, health and  social

services to the people. With this $85,000 much more

good can be done. I could probably build two first-class  maternity and child welfare clinics, or  the

money  could  be utilised for much more  beneficial

social  services than family planning. The  use  of

the  people's money for a purpose repugnant to them

is bitterly resented by quite a large number of our

constituents.  What right have I or any  Member  of

this  House  to  vote for public assistance  to  an

association  that strikes at the deepest  and  most

sincere convictions of a large number of those  who

elected   them?  If  we  in  this  House   consider

ourselves justified in riding roughshod over  their

profound beliefs and ignoring their earnest appeals

to you, can we expect them to have any faith in the

democracy which we are trying to uphold? As I have

said  before, I respect everybody's views and I  am

not asking them to vote against family planning but

against the use of the taxpayers' money and  I  ask

you  once again, hon. Members, no matter what  your

views  may  be,  which I respect, to  be  extremely

cautious  before making your decision  and  not  to

ride  roughshod over the wishes of your voters  who

put you into power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that international conference in Tokyo, the

reports of the various family planning associations

were  brought up. I would just like to read to  you

the   American  report.  It  is  from  the  Planned

Parenthood    Federation    of    America,    which

incorporates all its 49 States:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both this Federation and its affiliates are

supported by voluntary contributions and fees  from

persons  receiving service at the  centres.  Clinic

services are generally rendered at less than  cost.

In 1954 for the first time, the total income of the

Federation and its affiliates of the United  States

topped  a  million  and a half dollars.  The  total

includes more than a million dollars in income from

contributions.  Thus,  for  every  dollar  paid  by

persons  served  in local family planning  centres,

more  than  three other dollars were  collected  in

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



ways  to  operate the total programme. The cost  of

the  planned parenthood fund raised in  the  United

States  alone  is 6.3 per cent of the total  income

and contributions."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, we must all

thank  the  Hon. the Minister for Health  for  his

learned  dissertation on the pros and cons  of  not

spending Government money to help family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question which is highly charged with

emotion, religious and traditional beliefs.  It  is

also  a delicate question which, unless delicately

handled, could border on the burlesque.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to dispose of what I

think  is  the  principal  cause  of  this  lengthy

debate,  namely, the Catholic objection.  It  is  a

proper  objection  for those who subscribe  to  the

Catholic  faith. We have been told that  three  per

cent  of the population in Singapore are Catholics.

They  have every right to voice their views and  to

have their representatives come to this Assembly to

propagate  their point of view. We have to  respect

their  point of view - as we should always do  if  we

are  to remain a happy and tolerant society. But  I

think  the  fundamental question we must decide  is

whether  we  are  a religious state  or  a  secular

state.  If we are a religious state, a state  based

on a particular God, whether a Roman Catholic, non-Roman  Catholic  or  Islamic God,  then  the  whole

question  changes complexion. A state  based  on  a

particular  God  accepts  certain  axioms,  certain

miracles, and certain dogmas. But we hope to  build

out of a multi-religious society a secular state in

which  all  traditional  religions,  beliefs,   and

philosophies are allowed to go their own way and co-exist.  That is the only way out for us  in  Malaya

and,  for  that  reason, we shall  start  with  the

assumption  that we wish to found a secular  state.

If  we  wish  to found a state based on  Islam,  as

Pakistan has done, then the whole question takes on

a  different complexion altogether. Having  decided

that this is to be a secular state, we then put the

Roman Catholic objection - quite a proper objection - into perspective.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposition advanced is that you cannot

spend  the  taxpayers' money to support  a  scheme,

which  is  abhorrent  to  three  per  cent  of  the

population. That is one point of view. The Hon. the

Minister  for Health has explained how it is  that,

in   spite  of  that  major  proposition,  one  his

abattoirs  built with Government funds for  killing

pigs in a multi-religious society such as ours. His

explanation is that the majority of the people here

are Chinese and, therefore, the small percentage of

Muslims   (more  than  three  per   cent   of   the

population)  do  not object to it because,  at  the

same time, they build their own abattoir where they

slaughter  animals according to their  rites.  Now,

Sir,  if  I  may  pursue this  particular  line  of

argument, I would say that if the Hon. the Minister

for Health came to this Assembly with a proposal to

set  up  some kind of institution for the Catholics

which  he  feels  would  counterbalance  government

expenditure on family planning, I am sure it  would

receive a most sympathetic hearing in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another aspect of the problem which

he may have some difficulty in rationalising. There

are  lots of conscientious objectors and I  do  not

think  any  of them has ever raised the proposition

that  his  money  or  any of the  taxpayers'  money

should  not  be  spent on armament  because  it  is

abhorrent to his particular belief. It has not been

suggested in Singapore yet, but we may yet have  an

association  of conscientious objectors  who  might

find supporters in this Assembly, and then we would

be in a very difficult position when we come to the

Defence Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even before we reach that fantastic

situation,  may I remind the Hon. the Minister  for

Health  that  the Roman Catholics, as I  understand

their tenets, object vehemently, and quite rightly,

to  divorce,  because they hold  the  view  that  a

marriage  is  for life. Sir, I have not  heard  any

challenge on that portion of the Budget  which  is

going  to  be  spent on the divorce  courts.  As  a

matter  of fact, Mr Chairman, Sir, quite a  number

of Roman Catholic lawyers practise in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



the  divorce  courts. One has got  to  be  rational

about  these things, and these lawyers are. A Roman

Catholic  lawyer, if he is asked to  appear  for  a

petitioner  to  bring  about  the  wrecking  of   a

marriage,  will object. He will not appear.  It  is

against  his  religious beliefs and, quite  rightly

and properly, he refuses such a brief. No court has

the  right  to  compel him to prosecute  a  divorce

because  the court respects his religious  beliefs.

But  he does appear on behalf of those against whom

a  divorce is sought, sometimes for good, sometimes

for  bad, reasons. What I wish to point out is that

the  whole  process is being financed by the  State

out of State funds, which include the taxes paid by

the  three per cent Catholics, and that fundamental

point has not been challenged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe very strongly in complete

religious  freedom. I believe that it is not  right

that  a  minority point of view - and it is  still  a

minority  point  of  view - should  prevent  us  from

giving  support to what we consider right. Once  we

decide on that, this question of whether we can  or

cannot  spend public money should be set  aside - and

it  should be set aside the moment we have  decided

that  we are a non-religious and secular state,  in

which  the  will of the majority as represented  by

its   elected   representatives  is  the   deciding

factor - we  can then decide whether family  planning

is  good  or  bad. If it is bad on the  merits,  we

shall  not  give the money. If it is  good  on  the

merits, we shall give the money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Health has been

troubled by a lot of arguments one way or the other

on  the  merits of family planning. There  are  two

contending  points of view. The one put forward  by

the Hon. the Minister for Health is that you should

leave nature alone and not tamper with it. You  can

produce  and reproduce and all you need  to  do  to

meet  the  needs  of the increasing  population  is

higher productivity, harder work, putting right the

social evils and, somehow or the other, things will

come  out  right. Man will triumph over nature  and

everybody will flourish. The other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



point  of  view most vehemently advocated  by  the

Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck) is  that

it  is  a  wicked  thing, this  procreation,  this

profligate  fecundity, and we will wind  up  in  a

mass of slums if it is not checked. It has got  to

be  checked somehow, and the way to do  it  is  to

give  them  all  the proper preventives  so  that,

whilst  they  may  not be able  to  control  their

natural  instincts, they can at  least  avoid  the

unpleasant consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think both points of view do not really

pose  the problem which the world faces. It is  a

world  problem,  and it is in that  world  context

that  each  individual  country  should  view  its

problem.  I think it is agreed that if  the  world

keeps  on  multiplying and you have limited  land,

there  must  mathematically speaking come  a  time

when  all the land is completely occupied,  either

agriculturally, industrially or domestically.  One

then  begins  to  build upwards.  You  can  go  on

building upwards until you reach that point in the

hemisphere  where human life could  no  longer  be

maintained. But whether it is an advantage to  any

particular  community, nation or race  to  restrict

its  population, or  maintain  it  or  expand  it

depends  on  relative  factors.  It  depends  upon

certain  circumstances obtaining at any particular

moment. The circumstances are not absolute.  I  do

not  subscribe to the view that one  can  multiply

oneself  ad infinitum and everything will  be  all

right somehow or the other. Nor do I subscribe  to

the  opposing point of view that, unless one stops

this unfortunate multiplication of human lives, an

unhappy  situation will arise and  there  will  be

more  slums in Paya Lebar for the Member for  Paya

Lebar to worry about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think if we approached this problem in a more

academic frame of mind, we would see that  whether

a  particular  nation  or  race  has  expanded  or

contracted  depends on many factors. When  Germany

was   expanding   her  territorial   claims,   her

Government was confident that the right thing  was

to  multiply. They believed that the  more  people

they  had  fighting on their side and holding  the

same beliefs, the greater were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



their   chances  of  overwhelming  their  enemies.

Hitler,  quite rightly, gave prizes all  round  to

mothers  who  were  able to  help  him  build  his

magnificent  Reich  which  was  going  to  last  a

thousand  years. So did Mussolini in Italy.  There

are  also  other  countries,  without  these  evil

intentions,  like  Australia,  who  also  want  to

increase  their population. Given their particular

conditions - a  large  land mass  with  ten   million

Europeans, and 600 million Chinese and nearly  100

million  Japanese  to  the  North - it  is  in   the

interests of Australia militarily, politically and

industrially, too, to expand its population. I  do

not  think the Australian Government will  support

any  family  planning when it is  importing  large

sections of population from Britain, and even from

Italy.   Each   country   faces   its   particular

population problem in a world context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you view birth control from the point of view

of  the  individual, there are many factors coming

into  play - his religious beliefs, his approach  to

life,  his  general philosophy of life. If  people

find  a particular state of bliss in bachelorhood,

then  a very serious situation will arise for  the

country   as  a  whole  if  everybody  becomes   a

bachelor,  and  the Government  will  have  to  do

something to remedy that. But for the time  being,

I  do not think Mr Sutherland is really a problem

either to the British Empire, to his Government or

even to the Colony of Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> That is very generous of you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But there are countries where,

as a result of industrialisation and a breeding of

a particular attitude and approach to life, either

by  reduction of fertility rates or excessive  use

of  contraceptives, the population has,  in  fact,

been   decreasing   and  it  is   worrying   their

governments considerably. The French Government is

extremely  alarmed  at the tapering  down  of  the

population  pyramid.  Health  measures  are  good.

People live longer. Less and less young people are

being born to support more and more old people.  A

very  serious population problem arises where  you

have the inverted population pyramid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem must be viewed from a particular

territory's point of view, its particular economic,

social  and geographical conditions. For  instance,

if  we  want  to overwhelm the island  of  Sumatra,

which  is  occupied by 200,000 people, and  we  say

there is gold, rubber and tin there and all we need

is  a  strong  strapping  army  which  believes  in

conquest,  then  the  proper  thing  to  do  is  to

multiply  our  population at the  fastest  possible

speed.  Train  up youth corps, put  them  in  brown

shirts  or blue shirts, march them up and down,  and

away  they  go  across to Sumatra to  found  a  new

Empire.  But  we are a small nation and  I  do  not

think   our  future  lies  in  military  conquests.

Neither does our future lie in becoming a weak  and

unbalanced society by having the population pyramid

tapering  down and inverted. In fact, if  there  is

any danger of that, the People's Action Party might

not  have  a  free vote on it. As a Member  of  the

Party  I would very strenuously object to any birth

control if the population were going to taper  down

in that way. Because I have very strong views about

having  enough young people to do the work  when  I

reach  that age when I stop working and want social

security benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, the population base is

spreading  right out in Singapore.  It  is  one  of

those things that go by geometrical progression and

going   at   a   terrific  speed.   The   Singapore

Improvement  Trust  have already  thrown  in  their

hand. They say that it is a hopeless job. The  Hon.

the  Minister for Health has not said that it is  a

hopeless  job. He will cope with anything - with  two

district cottage hospitals at $85,000 - and he  says

that  there  is  not the slightest  danger  of  our

population becoming too large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no need for us to expand it. All we

need  do  is  to  keep it steady - with  regular  age

groups  going  right up to the top.  For  the  time

being,  I see no danger whatsoever of this  $85,000

for  the Family Planning Association upsetting  the

population balance or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



upsetting the economy or trade of the country.  All

I  see in this $85,000 is a feeble attempt to bring

the  benefits of birth control methods to those who

wish  to  have them - those who have six or seven  or

eight children and do not wish to have more but  do

not know how to prevent it. This $85,000 is a small

drop  in  the ocean. When the propagation of  birth

control  knowledge and methods becomes a social  or

an economic problem by upsetting the population one

way or the other, then we will have to come back to

this  House and review it. The whole problem  must

be viewed in the context of a particular society at

a  particular  time. The object  of  any  organised

society  is  the pursuit of the happiness  and  the

well-being of all its peoples. My opinion is that,

in  our  pursuit of this happiness,  we  should  do

something to alleviate the sufferings and hardships

of those who wish to avoid unduly large families by

having the assistance of family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France and even Great Britain have reached the

point  where they have childless couples throughout

all  strata  of  society - people whose  attitude  to

life,  as  a  result  of their  civilisation,  have

become  so personal and so introvert that  they  do

not  wish  to assume any responsibility. They  just

like  to  live  their own lives. But when  a  whole

class  of  people in a nation begins to adopt  that

attitude,  as  they  have  in  France,   then   the

Government becomes most concerned because it upsets

the whole population structure. We have not reached

that point yet. For the time being, with very great

respect  for the Catholics, I say there is no  harm

in this subsidy to the Family Planning Association.

If there is any harm, we can review it. It is not a

question  of  brushing aside a  Catholic  point  of

view,  or  imposing  the view of  a  majority.  The

question  is whether we, as Members of an  Assembly

which  wants to establish a secular state, consider

this  in the best interests of the country for  the

time  being, not for all time. For the time  being,

there is no harm in it and we support it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, we have indeed

heard very good speeches from the Hon. the Minister

for  Health  and the Member for Tanjong Pagar.  One

would not know which side to vote for after hearing

these two powerful arguments. Sir, in this case and

in  many  other cases, we have got to  bow  to  the

wishes of our electorate whom we represent here. If

not, we will be questioned on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a place with many races and

many  creeds  but  it  is not a  secular  state.  I

believe it is a religious state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister rather scolded

the  Member for Bukit Panjang (Mr Goh Tong  Liang)

for  bringing religion into this debate.  Sir,  the

Muslims  say  religion  and politics  go  together.

Mahatma  Gandhi once said, "I will do anything  and

everything  at  the dictate of my  inner  voice  or

religion."  Now they are inseparable. There  is  no

reason  why hon. Members cannot debate this subject

based  even  on  religion. Take, for  example,  the

Muslims.  According  to their  religion,  they  are

allowed to marry four wives -



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> How many have you got?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It cannot be for nothing. On the

other hand, it is very difficult to have more  than

one wife if the religion is properly followed. Now,

Sir, according to that religion, it is not wise  to

control  births  unless it is for  health  reasons.

Muslim  religion  is most rational  and  women  can

always  go to their doctors for advice where  their

health is concerned. Because of this I support  the

motion that we should not contribute anything  from

the   taxpayers'  money  to  this  Family  Planning

Association. There will be many who will be willing

to  give  voluntary support, as is being  done,  so

some hon. Members say, in India, Hongkong, and many

other  countries. We should not take up  a  matter

which might create unnecessary trouble.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  this question before the House of whether  or

not to give aid to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



the Family Planning Association should be debated

in the light of whether it is deserving of help. To

answer that question, we will ask: Is it at the

present moment doing the country good? If it is, by

all means give the grant. If it is not doing a

service, then we should not spend a cent on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking on this subject not because I am a

Catholic or because I am not a Catholic. I  am  not

tackling  it from the point of view of religion.  I

wish  to say that I will tackle it from a few other

angles,  say  morals. Years ago, people  were  more

careful  about morals. We did not see much of  what

we  see today and people were happy. But today,  if

we  look  at  the younger generation, I  think  the

knowledge  such  as  that  spread  by  the   Family

Planning Association, although it is meant for  the

grown-ups, very soon gets to the people who  should

not  get  that. That is where, I think, it  is  not

doing  a  service  to the people.  Morals  must  be

watched  and watched at all times. If a  nation  is

going to be one that can lift its head up and  look

forward towards progress, then morals is about  one

of the most important things that we must watch out

for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second point that I am going to raise

will be somewhat similar to the point raised by the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar.  It  is  this.  Is  it

necessary  now  to  teach birth  control?  Have  we

reached   saturation  point  in   the   matter   of

population?  Let us take ourselves back  to  a  few

decades from now, say, to the time between 1890 and

1900.  At  that time Singapore was a  much  smaller

place -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not geographically, was it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> No, but from the economic

point  of view, and at that time, too, I think  the

national income was less. Now, after many years  of

importation  of  people  from  China,   India   and

probably   from   Europe,  we  have   our   present

population   and  the  national  income   has   not

decreased;  it  has  increased.  Now,  if  national

income can increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



with  an increase in population, what does it point

to?  Does it point to the fact that population  and

income are in inverse ratio to each other? It seems

to  me  that they go parallel with each other until

probably  they reach the optimum. Have  we  reached

that optimum? I certainly feel that, although there

is  an  imaginary  line drawn across  the  causeway

saying  that  this is Singapore  and  that  is  the

Federation  of Malaya, I certainly do  not  believe

there are two separate territories. To you, to  me,

and  to everybody living in this peninsula,  it  is

one   territory.  We  are  free  to  get  into  the

Federation  and  the people of the  Federation  are

free to come into Singapore. In the Federation  you

will  find  there  are large  tracts  of  land  not

developed. Their potentialities have not been fully

exploited   and  if  they  have  not   been   fully

exploited,  do  we  want  to  import  people   from

elsewhere to help us exploit that land and  extract

the  riches  from underneath it, or is it  not  our

duty  at the present moment to bring the population

up  so that, in a short time to come, we will  have

sons of the soil tilling the land and making use of

it?  I  certainly feel that that point of  view  is

going to be very important and any attempt to  stop

that   happening  would  not  be  in  the  national

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there has been an outcry from the very

learned   Member   the  Hon. the   Minister   for

Communications and Works who said that we have  all

the  ills of the world in Singapore. We have  slums

right behind this Assembly House and in front of it

and all over Singapore, and we have families having

children  ranging  from ten to fifteen  probably - he

quoted  an  instance  of one family  with  thirteen

children.  Yes,  it  was indeed  a  very  miserable

picture,  but  I think that argument in  favour  of

family  planning will not hold water. We  must  say

that  all this misery has been due to budgets being

wrongly  framed thirty to forty years ago,  whereby

the  people did not get a fair deal. If the budgets

had  been  correctly framed, then we would probably

not  have  so much of the misery we see  today.  If

housing had been planned in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



the  year 1900, probably we would today all have  a

house  at  a rental of, say, $20 a month. If  there

had  been  planning  for  schools,  then  we  would

probably have no problem of school children  coming

to  us asking, "Where can I get a place?" Now,  all

these  ills are not due to the fault of the present

generation  but due to previous administrations.  I

believe  we  can  still remedy such  ills  and,  by

setting  up an accelerated rate of social services,

we can catch up. We definitely can catch up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of a big family of

thirteen,  it  strikes me that if we ever  talk  of

such conditions, we must be there to witness it.  I

do  not  believe  that a family of  thirteen  could

consist  of one, say, two months old, the next  one

eight months old, the next twelve months old and so

on! Even if you step up the ages and say they range

from one year to two years, three, four, etc. until

thirteen,   it   would  be  an  almost   impossible

situation.  I have been going round the  rural  and

slum  areas, and have looked at families large  and

small,  and  I have always seen that if  there  are

eight members in the family where the youngest  one

is,  say,  a  year old, then the oldest  one  would

probably be at an age where he is able to earn  his

or her own living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point of view is this. I do not like the

idea  of families that have only one child  or  two

children.  Do you know of cases where there  is  an

only  child in the family? It is most pampered  and

selfish  and feels that it must have its  own  way.

But  if I look at a large family, I see that  there

is  more  give  and  take. There  is  more  sharing

between them. It is indeed developing a spirit that

is   definitely  good  for  the  community  and   I

certainly  feel that we should not discourage  them

but  we  should assist them - not by giving  them  an

Iron  Cross or a Silver Cross - but assist them  with

more social services -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> What is there to stop them from

working?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> This is a very serious matter.

You  all say that it is a very serious matter,  and

you are all laughing about it -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. There is only five

minutes left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The next point, Sir, would be

to  compare  what  other countries  are  doing.  In

Europe,  there is an outcry: "Look, the  population

is  coming  down.  Let us do something  about  it."

Well,  I  think there is political significance  in

that because if a nation has no young people coming

up,  then it will not have people who will be  able

to  work  and produce income and probably  help  to

defend it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Then it becomes the last of the

Mohicans!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We still have to defend our

country here - Singapore or Malaya. There might  come

a  day  when we will have to defend it and we  will

have to do that -



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> What with?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The main thing is that,

unless you have people, you will not have the means

of  defending your own land and the young people of

today will be precious to us tomorrow. From this, I

feel  that I cannot support the grant to the Family

Planning Association.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Can I ask a question, Sir?

Time is getting very short.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Goh Tong Liang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> In spite of the blackest of

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I wish to make a correction. I did

not  say  that Egypt was represented at  the  Tokyo

Conference.  What  I  said  was  that  of  the  few

countries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



which contribute towards family planning, Egypt  is

one of the countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Minister

that  there should be more communication  but  less

work. As the Minister for Labour and Welfare,  Sir,

I  should say that the Labour Department has at one

time been misinterpreted as the Labour Ward of  the

Labour  Ministry! Therefore, I feel that  I  should

stand  up and speak for the poor women who have  to

bear the burden of those who are married and of  my

good  friend over there, the Member for Changi (Mr
