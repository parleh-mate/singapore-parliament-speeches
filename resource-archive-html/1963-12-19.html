<div align="center"><b>SEAMEN'S REGISTRY BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of benefit to the House if I were to

give a resume of the present practice of registering

seamen for employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registered seamen are offered for selection in

accordance  with  their priority on  a  roster.  The

employer is presented with his requirements plus  50

per  cent  subject  to a minimum  of  two  men.  For

example,  if  he requires four men, he  is  given  a

choice of six men. If the employer fails to complete

his  requirements  from the first selection,  he  is

given a second and last selection on the same basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamen are permitted to refuse two offers of

employment without any penalty. If a third offer  of

employment is refused, the seamen's name is  removed

to the bottom of the roster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of Section 4 of the

Seamen's  Registry Board Ordinance, 1957, the  Board

is  required to enter a registered seaman's name  in

the  roster according to the date of discharge  from

his  last ship or, if the person concerned  has  not

been  previously  employed  as  a  seaman,  then  in

accordance  with the date of his registration  as  a

seaman. This section provides that the Board may sub-divide  a roster or rosters into such categories  as

it may consider necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing provision which requires that a

registered seaman shall have his name entered in the

roster  according to the date of discharge from  his

last  ship  causes,  in certain circumstances,  some

dissatisfaction among the seamen. An example of this

can  be seen as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seaman may be discharged from a ship on 1st January and he applies to the Board for three months' leave of absence. On reporting back to the Board after the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



expiry of his leave, the Ordinance provides that the

seaman  be  replaced on the roster with effect  from

1st  January. Seamen who have been discharged  after

1st  January, and who had not taken leave, and  have

been  reporting regularly for employment  find  that

this particular person who had gone away on leave is

still   placed  ahead  of  them.  They  feel   quite

naturally  that those who had asked  for  leave  and

taken such leave should not be given preference over

them  in  the roster. In a similar manner, a  seaman

who  has  been  suspended for disciplinary  offences

would under the existing provision, after the period

of  suspension,  be placed on the  roster  ahead  of

seamen  who  have  not been under  suspension.  This

again causes extreme dissatisfaction among seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill seeks to delete the requirement

that the Board shall enter the seamen's names in the

roster in accordance with the date of discharge from

their  last  ship. The Board intends to specify  the

various conditions and methods of placing seamen  on

the  roster  in the Regulations which the  Board  is

empowered to make with the approval of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome these various anomalies and

dissatisfaction  caused by them, the  Board  intends

that the names of registered seamen shall be entered

in the appropriate roster in the following manner: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in the case of seamen, who have not been

previously registered, according to the  date

of registration;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in the case of seamen, who have been granted

leave  of absence by the Board for any reason

other than that of illness, according to  the

date  of  reporting to the Board,  after  the

expiry of their leave;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) in the case of seamen, who have had their

registration suspended, according to the date

of reporting to the Board after the period of

suspension; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) in the case of seamen, who have been

discharged from their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



ship,  according to the date of reporting  to

the Board after they had been discharged from

the  ship:  Provided that in the  case  of  a

registered  seaman, who has  been  discharged

from the ship without any culpability on  his

part  after  a period of employment  of  less

than  two  months,  the  Board  may,  at  its

absolute  discretion, decide the position  in

which  the  name  of  such registered  seaman

shall be entered in the appropriate roster.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Toh Chin Chye].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>PORT OF SINGAPORE AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, the Report of the Commission of inquiry

into the Port of Singapore (Sessional Paper No.  S10

of 1957) made the following main recommendations:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) That a single Authority should be set up to

be  responsible  for the whole  of  the  port

area.  The  Authority should  take  over  the

functions, staff and premises of the  present

Singapore Harbour Board together with certain

functions  performed by the Marine Department

and P.W.D. Marine Section;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) That a Dock Labour Corporation should be set

up to be responsible for the supply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



and  regulation of dock labour at the present

Singapore Harbour Board wharves;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) That the Dockyard and Ship Repair

organisation of the present Singapore Harbour

Board  should  be  separated  from  the   new

Authority   and   become   a   wholly   owned

subsidiary of the Port Authority;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) That the Port Authority should accept

responsibility  as  bailee  for  cargo  (i.e.

accept  responsibility for loss or damage  to

cargo  in  its  care) and that a satisfactory

form of joint tallying should be introduced.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently a Cabinet Sub-Committee comprising

the  Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Finance

and the former Minister for Education, agreed that a

Port  Authority  Bill be drafted  to  implement  the

recommendations  of  the Inquiry Commission,  except

that no provision need be made for the setting up of

a  Dock  Labour Corporation as it was not considered

that  the  introduction of such  a  corporation  was

either feasible or desirable in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill accordingly established a Corporation to

be  known  as  "The Port of Singapore Authority"  to

take  over the functions, assets and liabilities  of

the  Harbour Board. The Bill provided that  the  Dry

Docks  and  Ship  Repair sections of  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board shall be separated from the Authority

under  a wholly owned subsidiary company as soon  as

is  practicable.  The name of this company  will  be

"The  Singapore  Drydocks  and  Engineering  Company

Limited." The control of movement of shipping within

port  limits  and  the handling  of  explosives  and

dangerous  goods  are transferred  from  the  Master

Attendant  to the Port Master of the Port Authority.

The  Pilot Board is replaced by a Pilotage Committee

to  be  appointed by the Port Authority  and  pilots

will in future be employed by the Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill was considered by a Select Committee of

the  last  Legislative Assembly but  no  Report  was

submitted   because  of  the  dissolution   of   the

Assembly. This Bill is now being re-introduced with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



slight  amendments  in the light of  representations

made  by  various interested parties to  the  Select

Committee  and  also  to  make  provision  for   the

appointment of a Deputy Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising out of the Port Authority Bill, certain

consequential  amendments  are  necessary   to   the

Merchant Shipping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance,  and these are embodied in  the  Merchant

Shipping (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions relating to the licensing and

control  of  pilots,  the  control  of  movement  of

shipping  within  port limits and  the  handling  of

explosives  and  dangerous goods are  being  deleted

from   the  Merchant  Shipping  Ordinance  as  these

functions  will in future be exercised by  the  Port

Master of the Port Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill was considered by a Select Committee of

the  last  Legislative Assembly, but no  Report  was

submitted   because  of  the  dissolution   of   the

Assembly. The present Bill has been slightly amended

in  the  light  of representations made  by  various

interested parties to the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC DEFENCE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read   a  Second  time."  I  have  His  Excellency's

recommendation that the Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the suspension of trade by Indonesia

following her confrontation against Malaysia saw the

severance of over a century-old trade ties with that

country.  Since Singapore is in the  front  line  of

this  economic  confrontation,  she  has  been   hit

hardest and certain trades and industries which have

been   traditionally  dependent  on  supplies   from

Indonesia  have naturally been the first casualties.

Both  employers  and employees have  been  adversely

affected, but whereas employers are used to the  ups

and  downs  of  business activity and are  generally

able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



to  withstand  the  hardships imposed  by  decreased

activity,  the employees, on the other hand,  become

the  helpless victims of circumstances beyond  their

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have, therefore, set up the

Department  of  Economic  Defence  with  a  view  to

formulating a scheme to protect workers of Singapore

against  the unpleasant consequences of unemployment

arising   from  the  trade  suspension.  The   broad

principle is that during a period of six months from

the  date  a worker is laid off, he will receive  an

amount  equal to two-thirds of his normal wages,  of

which  one-third will be paid by the Government  and

one-third  by  the employer. I must  emphasise  here

that  this  is not a relief scheme or  a  dole;  the

intention is that workers laid off because of  trade

suspension should continue to be on the pay-roll  of

the  individual  firms during the  currency  of  the

scheme  unless  and  until  they  obtain  employment

elsewhere. Should confrontation be called off in the

meantime, then normal activities will resume.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was recognised, however, that in the

implementation  of  this  principle,   the   special

problems   and  peculiarities  of  the   trades   or

industries    concerned    should    be    examined.

Accordingly,    consultations   were    held    with

representatives  of  the trade associations  in  the

Shipping  Industry, the Rubber Industry,  the  Copra

and  Coconut  Oil Mill Industry, the Sago  Industry,

the  Rattan  Industry  and  the  Coffee  and  Pepper

Industries  and  with  the  National  Trades   Union

Congress   in   order  to  overcome  any   practical

difficulties  that might arise in the implementation

of  the  scheme.  I  am happy to  state  that  these

consultations  have revealed that both  workers  and

employers'   representatives   are,   in    general,

agreeable  to  the  scheme in  principle  but  would

prefer legislation so that the administration of the

scheme   could   be   put  on  a  fair,   impartial,

comprehensive  and  effective  basis.  This   is   a

sensible approach, for even though a scheme with the

voluntary co-operation of all concerned is laudable,

the  detailed administration of the scheme is  bound

to   generate   difficulties  that   can   only   be

effectively  dealt  with on the firm  foundation  of

legislation. At the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



moment,  1,300 workers are receiving benefits  under

the  scheme. It is anticipated that, in due  course,

when  the  full  impact of the trade  suspension  is

felt,  and  more  factories and  establishments  are

likely  to  lay  off workers, the  total  number  of

workers laid off may rise to somewhere around 8,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is, in the light of what I

have  already said, to provide financial  assistance

to  the employees in certain businesses affected  by

the   severance  of  trade  between   Malaysia   and

Indonesia.   The  businesses  that  are  immediately

affected   are   shipping  between   Singapore   and

Indonesia, rubber processing, sago, rattan,  coffee,

coconut oil and pepper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the appointment of a

Director  of  Economic Defence  and  such  Assistant

Directors  as may be required. A salient feature  of

the  Bill  is  that  no employer or  contractor,  as

defined in the Bill, may terminate the service of an

employee for a period of six months from a  date  to

be  determined by the Director. This is important if

the very purpose of this Bill is not to be defeated.

The  Bill  also  seeks to ensure  that  those  whose

earnings  are  affected  by  partial  employment  as

against  full employment will also receive benefits.

An  Economic Defence Fund is to be administered  and

controlled by the Director. Into this fund employers

are required to pay in their contributions based  on

one-third  of their monthly total wage bill.  Whilst

workers  affected can enjoy the benefits  prescribed

for them, certain restrictions on the application of

the  scheme are imposed. It is provided that if  any

employee  in  receipt  of payments  under  the  Bill

refuses,  without  reasonable excuse,  an  offer  of

employment  or  an  offer of suitable  training  for

alternative  employment made by the Director  or  an

offer  of  full  employment made  by  the  employer,

further  payments  to him may be  stopped.  However,

with regard to an offer of employment or of training

for alternative employment made by the Director,  he

would  have  a  right of appeal to an Appeals  Board

appointed under the provisions of clause 15  of  the

Bill when the decision of the Director may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



reviewed. The decision of the Appeals Board on every

appeal would be final and binding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will appreciate, Sir, that while the rights of

employees  to  enjoy benefits have been  laid  down,

certain  legal  obligations of  employers  to  their

employees  cannot continue during  the  period  that

employees enjoy benefits under this Bill. The  Bill,

therefore, provides that the employer, contractor or

employee  shall  not be liable to pay  contributions

under  the  Central Provident Fund Ordinance  during

the  period  that  the employee  is  in  receipt  of

payments  under the Bill. In addition,  during  such

period,  the  employee  will  not  be  entitled   to

benefits in respect of holidays and annual leave  as

provided  in the labour laws nor to any  award  made

under  the Industrial Relations Ordinance: he  will,

however,   continue   to  enjoy  any   accommodation

provided by his employer. Again, provision  is  made

under  clause 16 that an employer may terminate  the

service  of  an  employee after 6  months  from  the

relevant date but in such an event, the employer may

set  off the total amount paid by him in respect  of

an  employee against wages payable in lieu of notice

for  terminating  the service of  the  employee  and

against  any  other payments or award which  may  be

payable or ordered to be paid for the termination of

the employee's service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I emphasise that this Bill, in concept and

design,  seeks  to  cushion  the  immediate  adverse

effect  on  the  hardship of the workers  for  which

positive concrete measures have to be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to put forward my views on  the

Bill  before I touch on the detailed clauses. I wish

to  speak on the background and the spirit  of  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said that because of the economic

confrontation brought about by Malaysia, business in

Singapore has suffered a lot and the extent  of  the

loss



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



is  very  great. Not only shipping workers,  rubber,

rattan, coffee and other trades have suffered, there

are also many other trades and industries which have

suffered   indirectly.  Workers   are   faced   with

unemployment. At the same time, it will push up  the

cost  of  living  indirectly, so as  to  bring  more

suffering  and hardship to the people. We had  urged

the  Singapore  Government to persuade  the  Central

Government to settle our differences with  Indonesia

peacefully, but the Government did not do so. On the

contrary,  the  Government  put  the  blame  on  the

Barisan Sosialis for the confrontation. If the Party

in  power did not want to accept our views  and  did

not  have the courage to face reality, we cannot  do

anything.  How  much  can the  Party  in  power,  in

introducing this Economic Defence Bill, make up  for

the  loss brought about by the confrontation? It  is

only  a  palliative; it will not solve  the  problem

fundamentally. It is amounting to cutting the  flesh

of  a  person  to  patch a sore.  At  present  those

hardest  hit  are the broad masses  of  the  people,

especially  the workers. Normally they  cannot  make

ends  meet. They have to work very hard in order  to

feed  themselves and their families.  But  now  that

they  have become unemployed or under-employed, they

have  to  tighten  their belts and their  burden  of

livelihood  will  be  heavier.  Therefore,  if   the

Government  want  to  look  after  those   who   are

affected, these people should deserve the best care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to give some suggestions on the

provisions.  Because  of  the  severance  of   trade

between  Singapore  and  Indonesia,  the  stevedores

- several  hundreds  of  them - have  become  jobless.

These  people are not within the orbit of this Bill.

Why  do  the  Government not include the  stevedores

within   the  orbit  of  this  Bill?  We  urge   the

Government  to implement this Bill so as to  benefit

even the waterfront workers and the stevedores.  The

so-called  prosperity and development  of  Singapore

are  closely  connected  with  the  efforts  of  the

waterfront  workers and the stevedores. We  can  see

ships   all   lying  idle  in  our  harbours.   Many

stevedores have become unemployed. But the  Economic

Defence Board do not help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



them.  This is very unfair. These people  should  be

looked  after  by the Economic Defence  Board  which

should  provide  a  safeguard for their  livelihood.

Because  of  the  stoppage of the  raw  rubber  from

Indonesia,  our rubber factories have  closed  down.

According to our investigations there are  at  least

40  rubber  factories  which  have  closed  down  or

partially closed down. Workers who are unemployed or

under-employed  are  numerous. The  workers  in  the

rubber  factories are not included in the Bill.  But

in  our view, these workers should also be included.

Because  these workers have all along found it  very

difficult  to make a living and the effects  of  the

confrontation   have   worsened   their   means   of

livelihood. The temporary workers are not  only  not

protected  under  the law but they  have  also  been

barred  from  the  orbit of  the  operation  of  the

Economic  Defence Board. On the one hand,  they  are

not  protected by the law of the Government and,  on

the other hand, they are employed or under-employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present stipulation to exclude these workers

from  the  orbit  of the operation of  the  Economic

Defence  Board  is deplorable. So my  suggestion  is

that  this Board should take this into consideration

and bring these workers into its orbit. According to

the  Board's  investigations, there are about  8,000

people  affected by the confrontation.  But  in  our

view,  more than 10,000 people are out of  job.  The

figures  given by the Minister are not very correct.

He  has minimised them. Up to now, we have not  seen

any  achievement of the Economic Defence  Board.  We

only  read in the newspapers that the Board has been

looking  after  this  and  that  factory,  and   yet

thousands   of   people   are   unemployed,   facing

difficulties  in  their  livelihood.  I   hope   the

Government  will not exaggerate the achievements  of

the  Economic Defence Board. We are of  the  opinion

that  the workers who should be looked after  should

include all those affected directly or indirectly by

the   severance  of  trade  between  Singapore   and

Indonesia  such  as stevedores, waterfront  workers,

workers employed in rubber, pepper, copra industries

and local produce. All these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



workers should be protected and looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that the employer is not allowed

to sack the workers affected by confrontation within

six  months.  This is not a long period.  What  will

happen after this six-month period?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that the unemployed workers

should be given priority in recruitment of jobs.  It

looks  all right superficially but, in actual  fact,

it  will not be effective because so far we can see

many  unemployed workers who are still  not  working

today  and many hawkers in the streets of Singapore.

Why are there so many hawkers? It does not mean that

they  do not want to work. If we think carefully  we

will  know the various reasons. Some of the  workers

have been retrenched or sacked, and some of them are

unemployed  for other reasons. If these workers  are

kept  unemployed  for too long a  time,  then  their

families  will  suffer. What will  happen  to  their

families after the period of six months? I urge  the

Government  to take positive steps to  persuade  the

Central Government to consider the sufferings of the

people   and   the   losses   resulting   from   the

confrontation. The Government should take  effective

measures to resolve their difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that the six-month period will

have  to  be decided by the Director of the Economic

Defence  Board. Now when will this period start?  If

it  is  to be decided by the Director, he must  give

earlier   assistance  to  those  workers   who   are

affected.  We know that trade suspension took  place

three  months  ago and the families of such  workers

have no savings. If the Government do not take steps

to  give  them  earlier assistance, then  they  will

suffer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Apparently the Member is under

the impression that the scheme has not been running.

Actually  the scheme has been in operation for  more

than one month. And I have said, 1300 workers or  so

are receiving money under this scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I was saying

is  that  the  ambit within which  the  workers  are

protected is still very limited. The Director of the

Economic Defence Board should take positive steps to

expedite assistance to the workers who are affected.

There should not be any delay in this payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that if the workers do not

get  food  and  employment  in  certain  trades  and

industries, then the employers must contribute  one-third  of the workers' salaries to the fund. Such  a

provision  means  that the employers  will  have  to

share  the  burden with the Government, each  paying

one-third to the workers. If an employer is not in a

position to pay one-third of the wages of a  worker,

then  what right do the Economic Defence Board  have

to enforce this contribution by the employer?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision is that the quantum of the wages

should  be decided by the Director. We do not  agree

with  this. Why should he decide the quantum of  the

wages since the workers have their own salary scale?

What  will that mean? Will it mean an increase or  a

decrease  in the wages? Will the Government  or  the

employers increase their wages? I do not think  that

is  possible. Or will they decrease the wages of the

workers?  If  so, I do not think this is  good.  The

wages  of the workers should be maintained and  this

question should not be decided by the Director.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision in the Bill is that during this

period,  the  employees  will  not  be  entitled  to

holidays and annual leave benefits under other laws.

We  think this is not proper. The workers have  been

and  are living from hand to mouth, and yet the Bill

wants  to deprive them of the benefits provided  for

in  other  labour  laws. This  will  increase  their

hardship.  I hope the Government will consider  this

provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision is that the employees can

continue to enjoy accommodation and other facilities

provided by the employers and contractors.  This  is

well  and  good. We admit that. But I  want  to  ask

Members of this House: what will happen to those who

do  not  enjoy  accommodation and other  facilities?

Will the Government consider giving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



those  living  in  Housing  Board  flats  a  housing

allowance  or  granting  them  a  reduction  in  the

rentals  or  even  exempting them  from  payment  of

rentals? We hope they will consider these points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally this Bill confers a few benefits on a

certain  section of the workers. The great  majority

of  workers  who are affected will not  receive  any

benefit from this Bill. Therefore, we would like  to

advise  the  Government - apart from the  payment  of

temporary   relief  - that  they  should  take   more

positive  steps to renew trade relations by peaceful

negotiations with the country concerned.  The  Prime

Minister has said that when diplomatic relations are

resumed  between Malaysia and Indonesia,  the  trade

relations will not be the same as before. I hope  he

will put into practice what he has said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  wish  to argue with the Government  on  the

general  principles of the Bill. However, there  are

two  matters which I wish to bring to the notice  of

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, it seems to me that the Bill

does  not  cover most categories of people  who  are

affected  by  the Indonesian economic confrontation.

As  the  Minister  for Finance has said,  only  over

1,000  people have so far been given relief, but  in

my  own  estimation, I believe  that  no  less  than

30,000 people have been unemployed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Minister will have a right

to reply later.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You said 30,000. You are wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Even in the rattan industry,

there  are  about  2,000  workers  - I  believe   the

Ministry  of Labour has taken statistics - and  there

are   about  1,800  people  unemployed.  The  relief

measures given by the Government are only for 1,300.

It is not even enough to cover those affected in one

particular  trade. The main defect of  the  Bill  is

that  it  might only be an eyewash to  show  to  the

people that the Government are doing something. But,

as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



matter  of fact, in my opinion, taking some pictures

of  seamen  getting a few dollars from the  Economic

Defence  Board does not help matters very much.  Mr

Speaker,  these three months are not so bad  because

many  of the workers still have jewellery to  go  to

the  pawnshop, a bit of savings, some friends to  go

to.  But  after the New Year, when all these sources

have  dried  up, when there is no more jewellery  to

pawn,  no more friends to turn to, they will face  a

very serious crisis. And if the Government can prove

to  us that it is only 1,300 who have been affected,

then I will agree with them that they have done much

for  the people. That is why, Mr Speaker, the first

matter  which  I wish to bring up is that  the  Bill

does not cover many categories of people. I think if

we  check with the coffee importers, there are 3,000

or  4,000  people  alone  who  are  engaged  in  the

selection  of coffee beans scattered throughout  the

whole island. They are not covered by the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> They are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> They are? That is good.

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> But if they are covered, I do

not  understand how it comes about that 1,300 people

could   cover   those  unemployed  in  coffee   bean

selection,   rubber   industries,   twakows,   lorry

transport, fishermen, boats' seamen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> They are not yet out

of job.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There is still a lot of coffee!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> So the Bill should be extended

to  cover everybody who is unemployed as a result of

Indonesian confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Bill which is undesirable

is  this.  The  Government are going to  compel  all

employers  to  pay one-third of the wage  bill.  Mr

Speaker,  in  my  opinion, it is very  difficult  to

compel, for instance, rattan manufacturers, who  are

only  doing a cottage industry, to pay one-third  of

the  wage  bill; or sago factories, which live  from

hand to mouth,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



to pay one-third of the wage bill. [Interruption]  I

am  not  an  expert like the Minister  for  National

Development  who was more associated with  the  sago

industry. But as far as I know, many of them do  not

have much capital and cannot cover one-third of  the

wage  bill. In the processing of sago, the wage cost

is  a  very  important part of the cost.  Most  sago

factories engage a lot of workmen. So, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  in my opinion, every employer should have  the

right  to discuss with the Government, and  if  they

can  prove that they cannot afford to pay their part

of  the  contribution under the Bill, the Government

should  pay  their share and when times are  better,

they  can  recover back from them as  some  sort  of

loan. The Government have $420 million. In the  case

of  such employers, the Government should not compel

them to pay one-third of the wage bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, this Bill is only going to be an eye-wash. So far as I know, not many persons who are affected by the Indonesian boycott have benefited from the economic defence measures set up by Government. I suggest the Government learn from what President Roosevelt did in his New Deal

measures which he introduced to counter the American

depression. If some of the measures in the New  Deal

were to be re-introduced here, and if the Government

are more keen and sincere in helping the unemployed,

I  think  we could expect more from them  than  just

this Economic Defence Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> We know the

Barisan  Sosialis will come forward to defend  their

friends  in  Indonesia. That is why they  have  kept

quiet  all the time in order to get on to this Bill.

Sir,  first of all, I must say that when the Barisan

say there were 10,000 or more unemployed because  of

this  confrontation policy, it is  rubbish.  I  will

challenge  the  Member of the Barisan  Sosialis  who

said  it to give me details if he can prove that  it

is  correct. I think what he is trying to do  is  to

spread  further rumours so that their foster fathers

in Indonesia will hear about it.



Mr  Speaker, rubber workers are included  in  this scheme.  But  stevedores are out  because  they  are casual workers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



they  have  no  employers at all. How  can  they  be

included  in  the scheme? Our friends  opposite  say

they  feel sorry for those who have lost their  jobs

and   so  on.  But  whose  fault  is  it,  when  the

confrontation  policy  was introduced?  Was  it  not

because  of  the Barisan Sosialis? Why do  they  not

today  denounce the confrontation? Who was the cause

of the l.800 workers from the S.A.T.U. unions losing

their jobs? Was it not from the Barisan people?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member seems to be going away. I

do  not want this debate to develop into a debate on

confrontation  and  the causes  thereof.  Could  the

Member come back?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> The Barisan Sosialis will, of

course,  criticise this Bill. It is in the  interest

of their Indonesian friends that they should try and

blunt  the  efforts of the Government to defend  the

workers  against Indonesia's economic confrontation.

Sir, in all civilised countries, when enemies of the

State  try  to sabotage the defence arrangements  of

the  nation against foreign aggression, they are put

before  a  firing squad and shot. But in  Singapore,

the  Barisan Sosialis, enemies of Malaysia, who  try

to sabotage our national defence effort, are free to

speak on behalf of the nation's enemies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And being paid $500!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must ask the Member to come

back  again to the Economic Defence Bill.  Otherwise

we  will  be  going  on and on to confrontation  and

Malaysia and the Barisan. I do not want this  debate

to  develop into that. If I allow the Member  to  go

on,  I  will have to allow others to go on,  and  we

will be here again till 3.00 o'clock in the morning.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> The workers of Singapore welcome

the  bold approach made by the Government to protect

the  interest of the Singapore workers  affected  by

the severence of trade relations by Indonesia. I say

bold  because, by introducing legislation  i.e. the

Economic  Defence Bill at this stage, it  has  given

sufficient  indication  of  the  stand  that  it  is

prepared to take in the interest of workers, however

unpalatable  such  steps may  be  to  the  world  of

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see that workers affected by this

trade  severence are not required to stand in queues

awaiting  charity and subjected to  means  test  and

such  like methods. I, therefore, feel proud  to  be

associated with a Government that has stood  by  its

word  of protecting the interest of workers  at  all

times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Economic Defence Bill, there

are a few points with which workers in Singapore are

directly  concerned. It is on these aspects  of  the

Bill that I wish to touch upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become common knowledge that while certain

employers have agreed to subscribe to the intentions

behind  the  Economic  Defence  Scheme,  they   have

subsequently  had second thoughts and made  attempts

to  wriggle  out  of  their  obligations  under  the

Economic  Defence Scheme. I refer specially  to  the

aspect of their contributions of one-third wages  to

a  Fund from which payments are made to workers.  In

some  cases I am aware, particularly in the shipping

field,  there have been instances of companies  that

either pleaded exemption from payment on grounds  of

heavy  financial losses and others who after  making

the   first  payment  under  the  Scheme  have   now

protracted   subsequent   payments   under   various

pretexts.  I  am  glad to see that  this  particular

aspect  is  adequately provided for in the  Bill  in

that  sums due to the Fund may be used and recovered

as  if it were a debt to the Government. At least by

this  process  adequate  safeguards  exist  for  the

recovery  of such monies. However, a point  for  the

Government  to consider is that legal  processes  in

making such recoveries can take a considerable time.

I  feel  I  should at this stage say that while  the

process  of  justice  takes time,  the  human  belly

cannot take this into account and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



await Court judgment. I hope that Government will in

such  cases  provide for the payment of advances  on

the employer's contribution so that workers affected

thereby are not seriously hampered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I hope that the Barisan Members will not take this constructive criticism as an anti-national criticism. At the same time, Mr Speaker, I wish to go back to the point I made at the beginning, when you pulled me up. What I was trying to say was that if the confrontation policy were to

change  into a military confrontation, then I  would

be  the first one to register with the firing  squad

to  shoot the friends of our enemies of this country

who sit opposite these benches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, from the Minister for  Finance's

speech, we can see how serious the position is. This

Bill  has now been suggested by the Government,  but

they   have  not  pointed  it  out  to  the  workers

affected.  But  will  this  Bill  be  a  fundamental

solution of this problem? What is the real solution?

The  real solution is the taking of steps to restore

trade  relations. Only in this way will the hardship

of the workers be lessened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. This Bill only provides

for  six  months' wages. What will happen after  the

end  of  the  six months? The Government  have  said

nothing on it. The third point is ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The points raised have already

been gone into in detail by the Member for Tampines.

If  the  Member has anything to add to what  he  has

said,  I  am  prepared to hear him. If the  Member's

speech  is going to be a repetition of what  he  has

said  - and repetition is not being allowed  - I  will

have to stop him. His second point is that this Bill

makes  provision for only six months. That has  been

dealt  with  in  detail by the Member for  Tampines.

Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I want is

a  reply  from  the Government. Are  the  Government

confident that those affected will have other  work?

Can this Bill really bring great benefits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



to those workers affected? We can see many loopholes

in the Bill. For example, the Bill provides that the

Government  pay  into the Economic Defence  Fund  an

amount  equal to that paid by the employer. That  is

equivalent to one-third of the wages of the  worker,

that  is  to  say,  the  worker  is  only  partially

employed. Take, for instance, a worker whose monthly

income is $150 -and, we do not know for how long  he

is  employed. He works only four days  in  a  month.

What about the remaining days that he does not work?

If that is the case, the Government and the employer

will  each have to contribute $40 per month  towards

the  Fund.  The result is that the worker will  only

get  $40 for the whole month, and not $120. That  is

why  I say there are loopholes in this Bill. And  in

order  to  plug  the loopholes, the Bill  should  be

improved,  and  can  be improved by  changing  "one-third"  to  "two-thirds", so that the  workers  will

really benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there should be provisions to

the  effect that if an employer resumes his business

or  has  invested  his capital in some  other  small

industries,  the  workers should  have  priority  of

employment,  and not by nomination by the  Director,

which means that only those approved by the Minister

will be nominated for employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about assistance for the workers, the

Government  make  a provision of  one-third  of  the

wages  and  the  employer also  pay  one-third.  But

normally  when a worker is retrenched, the  employer

pays  him  three months' wages. Here, the assistance

to be doled out to the workers is only operative for

six  months.  So if the employer pays out  severance

pay for retrenching his workers, the workers can  be

sacked  within  six months. The employer  will  then

have to pay one month's wages in lieu of notice.  So

this provision in the Bill is no real help at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Bill is meant to look after  those

workers  affected by confrontation, as  declared  by

the  Minister.  Actually there are many  defects  in

this  Bill.  Since the Minister for  Finance  is  an

economist, he should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



he  more realistic and practical, and should realise

that there are loopholes in the Bill.



<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim, Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unemployment figures given by us are described

as  an  exaggeration  on  our  part.  To  prove  our

figures,  I  would  like to give an  instance  of  a

factory   which   closed  down  as   a   result   of

confrontation.  It  is at the  10th  m.s.  Sembawang

Road.  On  the  closing down  of  the  factory,  the

workers  were the first batch to receive  assistance

from  the Board. Over 100 of these workers were  not

recognised  as normal workers because some  of  them

had  asked  for  medical leave. In  the  end,  these

workers  did  not  receive any assistance  from  the

Board.  On  what basis was the amount of  assistance

calculated?  It  was  based on their  August  wages.

Their August wages were the lowest for the whole  of

that  year. This was based on business calculations.

There  was  the  case  of a female  worker  who  was

injured, and did not work for two days. The  monthly

assistance  amounted  to only  $3.86.  The  employer

reported  the  case to the Ministry of  Labour.  For

that  month,  she  got $5.80 for the  two  days  she

worked.  So two-thirds of $5.80 amounted  to  $3.86.

What is the use of such meagre assistance doled  out

to  her? Other workers were given from $7 or $10, to

$20.  This  matter was addressed to the Ministry  of

Labour that the calculation of the assistance  given

was  not  correct. But the employer  said  that  the

figure was calculated by the Ministry of Labour.  So

I  hope the Minister will look into this matter  and

normalise  the  situation.  This  is  not   just   a

triviality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, out of the 500 workers, there were

about 100 of them who did not receive any assistance

at all because they were either temporary workers or

because  they  did  not work in August  for  medical

reasons. So they did not get a single cent for  that

month for assistance. The calculations should not be

based on their August wages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that the workers affected by confrontation

number  about 30,000 to 50,000, because the  numbers

of temporary workers, piece-rate workers, and hourly

rate workers were not included in the figures. These

workers  should,  in fact, be included  in  the  aid

scheme. The Minister accused us of exaggerating  the

figures. Actually he himself has underestimated  the

figures.  And there are other workers who  are  also

affected. For instance, in one week some workers can

work  for  only  one  or two  days.  In  the  rubber

industry, those who work in the smokehouse can  only

work for one or two days or, at the most, three days

per  week, when the smokehouse is in operation.  Are

they  not also affected? How can they say that these

workers  are not affected and be excluded  from  the

aid  scheme? According to normal calculations, their

wages  are low. So the Economic Defence Board should

provide  some help for them. Instead the  assistance

for them is based on their low wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the unemployment figure stands at 8,200, and that next year it will probably be 18,000. But I say that it should be more. The unemployment figure for the present is higher than that given by the Minister. Can he send someone to investigate into this matter? If he can do that in

this particular rubber factory, he can find out  the

actual  facts.  The Yen Chou Rubber Factory  workers

are  the  first  batch of workers who received  this

economic assistance. This factory is situated at 101

m.s.   Sembawang  Road.  This  factory  closed  down

sometime  ago. Rubber factory workers fully  out  of

job  as  a result of confrontation number 4,000.  In

the  Yen  Chou Rubber Factory, only 300 out  of  500

workers  received  economic  assistance.  The  other

workers,  especially working in the smokehouses  and

other processing departments, numbering about 1,000,

are  not  included in the Bill. The Minister  should

pay attention to this.



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, as the

N.T.U.C. is a party to this Economic Defence  Bill,

we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



assure  the  Members  opposite  that  most  of   the

categories  of  workers who  are  affected  by  this

Indonesian anti-economic confrontation are  covered.

We   the  N.T.U.C. are  a  national  body  of   the

representatives of workers and we know our jobs. The

Government have consulted us before introducing this

Bill.  There  are difficulties in implementing  this

relief.  Take,  for instance, the  workers  who  are

working in the rubber mill factories. As long as the

workers  are working on a monthly basis,  they  will

receive  two-thirds of their salary, one-third  from

the  Government and one-third from the employer. But

the  difficulty is this. Most of the workers are not

working  on  a  monthly pay basis. They  are  casual

workers.  In  one day they can be employed  by  five

contractors. The workers themselves form a pool  and

whenever  the  contractors get a job, they  come  to

this  pool and engage them. So for this category  of

workers we are devising a means to give them relief.

They  cannot be categorised as monthly-paid workers.

But  we have to find the root basis of the cause  of

this  Indonesian  anti-economic  confrontation.  The

workers,  we  agree, are unexpectedly  hit  by  this

economic  confrontation. But this  is  no  fault  of

anybody, except that it is the fault of the  Barisan

Sosialis and their Indonesian friends ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Nonsense? You have been

repeatedly  asking this Government to  persuade  the

Central  Government to negotiate with the Indonesian

Government. If you really have the interests of  the

workers  at  heart, have you also  appealed  to  the

Indonesian Government to negotiate ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have very

thoroughly gone through this confrontation business,

Indonesia, anti-national, in the last few  days.  It

would be better if the Member proceeds with what  he

wants to say on this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Barisan

have  really the interests of the workers at  heart,

they  should  have  gone down to  meet  the  workers

themselves and find out whether they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



really  received  the aid or not. They  simply  come

here to publicise themselves and just pick up one or

two  cases  which, as I have described,  are  casual

workers. These people cannot fall under the Economic

Defence Scheme. We are going to devise a scheme  for

them.   The   Barisan  are  very  smart  in   making

propaganda. They will come here and shout at the top

of  their  voices and say they are the champions  of

the workers. But, as a matter of fact, they are not.

I challenge them. We know the workers are very badly

hit.  Why  do  they  not appeal  to  the  Indonesian

Government to stop the anti-economic confrontation?



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill clearly shows

that the Government in every respect are considering

to  look after the interests of the people.  If  the

Government  do  not  concern  themselves  with   the

interests  of  the workers, then they will  not  put

forward this Bill. This goes without saying, and  we

will not be here to debate it today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Tampines has said that the

hardship was brought about by Malaysia and that  the

loss  was  very  great. Who caused  this  loss?  Who

brought  about the loss to our people?  Who  brought

about the sufferings to our people? This was brought

about by Indonesia's confrontation. Why do they  not

condemn the Indonesian Government? Confrontation was

first  announced by the Indonesians on  the  pretext

that  Malaysia  was  a threat  to  the  security  of

Indonesia. We have touched on this before.  We  have

only  a  few troops and a few cannons and guns.  How

can  we menace them? How can we be a threat to them?

Why  do  they  not  go  and condemn  the  Indonesian

Government? Instead they condemn our own Government.

They condemn Malaysia. They must know that they have

sworn  allegiance to Malaysia and yet now they  turn

round to condemn Malaysia to which they have pledged

their  allegiance in this House as well  as  in  the

Central Parliament. Malaysia is the object of  their

loyalty,   but  now  they  turn  round  to   condemn

Malaysia. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



is  their motive for doing that? When they are  here

in front of us, they say they are loyal to Malaysia.

But  outside  the House, their Chairman talks  about

Malaysia  not  being the object of their  allegiance

and loyalty ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. As I have said, enough

of   this   confrontation,   anti-Indonesia,   anti-national.  Would the Minister please get on  to  his

comments on the Bill under discussion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Their attitude

shows  that those who have beards are their  fathers

but  the  same persons who have their beards  shaved

are  not their fathers and yet they claim themselves

as  the representatives of the people. How can  they

explain  away all this? The speech that  I  make  is

written by me. But their speeches are not written by

them.   They   are   written   by   somebody    else

--- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I will not allow all

the  interruptions that are going on from both sides

of  the  House.  I will ask the Minister  please  to

discontinue this trend of his speech and to continue

with  the  discussion of this  Bill  on  the  Table.

Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Opposition Members talk about solving  our

differences  by peaceful settlement.  We  know  this

Bill  is  only a palliative. It will not go  to  the

root  of  the problem. We have refused their request

for  a  peaceful conference. It is not motivated  by

their  real  desire to solve our differences.  Their

friend  Azahari  is in Indonesia. Why  do  they  not

persuade   Azahari   to  persuade   the   Indonesian

Government  to stop their confrontation? The  Member

for   Nee   Soon  and  the  other  Member  who   has

disappeared  are  reported to be in Indonesia.  They

are not here. If they are here, they will be able to

answer  my  allegation. It is their  fault  for  not

being  present  in  this House. They  have  so  many

friends in Indonesia; they are in close contact with

their  friends  in the Moshi Conference.  They  have

also been able to contact their Indonesian friends ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  are debating the Economic Defence Bill. I do not

know what the Minister has been talking up till now.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jek, I have ruled that we

should   not   go   into  the   discussion   as   to

confrontation  and Indonesian matters.  Please  come

back to the Bill, otherwise I may have to stop you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Opposition

Members   talk   about   peaceful   settlement   and

negotiations.  I want to tear away their  masks  and

expose  their insincerity. They have so many friends

in  Indonesia.  Why do they not urge  their  friends

there to persuade the Indonesian Government to  come

to  the conference table? They have no sincerity  at

all  in  putting forward the proposal for a peaceful

settlement. The Member for Tampines and  the  Member

for  Thomson  also talk about a peaceful settlement.

They  have  all along been condemning the  Malaysian

Government and Malaysia. But they have not chosen to

condemn the Indonesian Government for confrontation.

The  Government's industrialisation  policy  is  the

only  solution to our present crisis. We  know  that

Singapore  has been an entrepot port.  The  Minister

for  Finance  has pointed out in his  Budget  speech

that  we cannot rely any more on our entrepot trade.

If  we  wish to stabilise our economy, then we  must

carry out a self-reliant economic policy. We can  do

so  by implementing our industrialisation policy. If

the  Barisan  Sosialis  are not  interested  in  our

industrialisation  programme,  if   they   are   not

interested in creating jobs for the workers ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, he

has  been talking about industrialisation. I do  not

think    this   is   the   time   to   talk    about

industrialisation.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think the Minister's

reference  to industrialisation has some  connection

with the Economic Defence Bill. I will allow him  to

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We have said

that  the  Economic Defence Bill is  not  a  radical

solution to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



problem. The solution lies in industrialisation.  If

they do not like industrialisation, that proves that

they  are not interested in providing jobs  for  the

workers.  When  we are talking about  the  practical

steps to be taken to solve our problem, they want to

interrupt us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We are debating

the  Economic  Defence Bill. But his  ferocious  and

savage attitude shows that he is not debating it but

abusing us.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I am in the Chair. If there is any lowering of the decorum of this House, I will be the one to make a ruling. Will the Minister please proceed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We are talking

about  industrialisation. We are not  talking  about

opening gambling dens or Chap Ji Kee or other  forms

of gambling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I cannot

understand what he is talking about. If the Minister

does  not  understand the Bill, then I would  advise

him to read it once more.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Minister please

remember not to pass personal remarks or attack hon.

Members of this House? I do not wish to have further

bickerings across the House. Please proceed with the

speech as quickly as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, if the

other side is not referring to me personally, I will

not  attack  them  personally. (In Mandarin)  It  is

because they talk about my personal attitude that  I

have to say what I said just now.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have already ruled. I

will  see  to  it that the House observes  a  proper

sense  of  decorum.  There  should  be  no  personal

attacks from either side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The fundamental

solution   to   our  problem  at  this   crisis   is

industrialisation which will provide enough jobs for

our  workers. The Member for Choa Chu Kang has  said

that  the period of six months during which  aid  is

given  to  the  workers  is not  sufficient.  If  an

employee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



is  retrenched  by the employer, he  will  be  given

three  months' pay. The employer provides only  one-third of the wages. The Bill provides that one-third

of  the  wages is paid by the employers. This  comes

from  their  own wages. The Government also  provide

one-third of the wages. This is a sort of relief  to

help them in this transitional period. After the end

of  the  six  months, the employer can,  of  course,

retrench the employee. When that time comes, it  can

be  a  matter of negotiations. It does not mean that

the  employers  will not have to  pay  anything  for

retrenching the workers concerned. If the problem is

not resolved when the factories are closed down, the

workers  will  be  affected.  The  Government   have

introduced  this Bill to tide over the hardships  of

the  workers  for  a period of six  months.  In  the

meantime, the workers will be able to look for other

employment elsewhere. The fact that the workers have

been  unemployed  due  to the closing  down  of  the

factories should not induce us to blame the workers.

The  blame should not be put on them. If anybody  is

to  be  blamed, it is the Barisan Sosialis. If  they

are  really sincere, they should put forward a  plan

to help the workers. Of course, the operative period

can  only  be six months. How can you go  on  giving

dole  perpetually? If Members of the Opposition  are

really  interested in the welfare  of  the  workers,

they should support the Government in their measures

to  solve the problem. They should also support  the

Government's  industrialisation  plan  in  order  to

provide  more jobs to the workers. They  should  not

attack  Government's labour policy and the  measures

they  have  taken  without  rhyme  or  reason.   The

introduction of this Bill shows that at  a  time  of

crisis,  and  even before confrontation,  Government

have  been able to foresee what is going to  happen.

The  Government conducted a series of investigations

and  assessment in July before the Bill was drafted.

Only  two  months after confrontation we  have  been

able   to  produce  this  Bill  to  deal  with   the

situation. Hence this Bill before the House today. I

would like to tell the people of Singapore that  the

situation was brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



about  by the Barisan. They have inconvenienced  the

people  of  Singapore. If there  is  anybody  to  be

blamed,  it  is the Barisan Sosialis who  should  be

blamed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I will not follow the P.A.P.  Benches

in  wanting to attack them. The introduction of  the

Economic  Defence Bill by the Government  may  be  a

good  idea  because  it may, to  a  certain  extent,

alleviate the problems of the unemployed workers  as

a  result of confrontation. It is no use to put  the

blame on anybody. Both sides have seen the result of

confrontation.  We  also agree to  certain  measures

recommended in this Bill. Stevedores and water-front

workers  are  the  sinews  of  Singapore's  entrepot

trade.  Yet  many of them are not included  in  this

scheme  of  assistance. Once trade between Singapore

and Indonesia stops, the livelihood of these workers

is   affected.  The  burden  of  maintaining   their

families has not increased. If these workers are not

included  in  the  Bill,  their  hardship  will   be

greater.  I would also suggest to the Minister  that

these  workers  should also be included  within  the

ambit of the provisions of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. What happens after

confrontation?  The  Minister  has  said  that   the

workers  who  are directly affected by confrontation

are  those  in  industries like rubber,  copra,  and

rattan.  The  stevedores are  also  affected.  Other

workers who are indirectly affected are those in the

industries of shoe-making, fishery, etc. As a result

of confrontation, there is a severance of trade. The

markets for our local products are now closed.  Many

workers  are now unemployed as a result of  this.  I

hope  the  Minister for Finance will look  into  the

plight  of these workers who are indirectly affected

by confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the one-third of the wages to be

contributed  by the employer and the period  of  six

months in which contributions will be made. Although

there is such a provision here, there may be certain

employers  who  may  see  some  loopholes  in   this

provision.  In  spite of the amount of  their  stock

available in their storehouses at the moment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



- the  stock  may  last for one  month  for  all  the

workers  - many  employers extend  the  work  to  six

months.  They give, say, one or two days' work  each

week  in  order to spread the work over a period  of

six months, so that they could take advantage of the

provision in the Bill relating to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on this point I feel that since the Minister

for  Finance  is in charge of this Economic  Defence

Department,  it is more convenient for him  to  look

into this matter, and not let certain employers take

advantage  of the loopholes in the Bill.  I  advance

this  suggestion out of sincerity  and  I  hope  the

Minister can carry it out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am elated to hear the  Member  for

Paya  Lebar  expressing his support for  this  Bill.

This  Bill  is  introduced in order to  resolve  the

difficulties  resulting  from  Indonesia's  economic

confrontation.  Are  the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members

really  interested in the interests and  welfare  of

the workers or the people of Singapore? No, they are

not  interested at all. They have tried to amend the

motion  of  thanks  of  the Prime  Minister  to  the

Negara's  speech  by asking that  negotiations  with

Indonesia be carried out. They oppose Malaysia,  and

the  least they can do is to try to help bring about

peace  and prosperity to Singapore even if  they  do

not  wish  to  bring about peace and  prosperity  to

Malaysia.  Instead  they talk  about  prosperity  in

South-East   Asia.  [Interruption]   You   are   not

concerned with Singapore. You have no right to  talk

about South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, as I have said, is meant for the

benefit  of the unemployed workers, yet the  Barisan

Members  persist in trivialities by  mentioning  two

minor  cases to show us that the Bill is not  really

perfect.  But are they able to help us  resolve  the

problem? When Singapore boats were detained  by  the

Indonesian authorities, did the Barisan Members  try

to  persuade the Indonesian authorities  to  release

them,  and to persuade them to release the  property

seized  by  them? And when they hear  of  Indonesian

sabotage  here in Singapore, none of them has  dared

to touch on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I wish the Parliamentary

Secretary  will come back to the discussion  of  the

Economic Defence Bill and not stray away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, it is because they in their  speeches

asked us to begin negotiations with Indonesia.  That

is why I have to touch on it in passing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion that the only way the Barisan

Sosialis can help the people of Singapore to resolve

their  sufferings  and difficulties  resulting  from

confrontation  is to support Malaysia.  Instead  all

along  they have been supporting Indonesia. I advise

them  to  turn back and become decent citizens  once

again by supporting Malaysia and show their interest

in working for the people of Singapore. But they are

contented to be led by the nose by the Indonesians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of one-third contribution by the

Government  and  one-third  by  the  employer,   the

Barisan  Assemblymen have not been able  to  advance

concrete   suggestions  to  help   improve   or   to

contribute  something  to better  the  life  of  the

workers who are affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has been talking

nonsense.  Why do the Barisan Members  not  dare  to

attack  Indonesia for all they have done?  And  they

even support the rebellion in Brunei. Dare they  say

that  they do not support the Brunei rebellion? They

are   traitors, treacherous  people,  abetting  the

enemies. [Interruption] When the Prime Minister made

the statement in this House on Indonesian subversive

activities,  none  of the Barisan  Sosialis  Members

dared lift up their heads.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have already ruled

that  no  remarks should be made across  the  House,

because it delays the debate. Will the Parliamentary

Secretary   please  continue  without  any   further

interruption from both sides of the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Under the

circumstances, this Bill is a positive and practical

measure  to  deal  with the situation  obtaining  at

present.  If  the  Barisan  Sosialis  want   to   be

practical, they can contribute towards this Economic

Defence Fund, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



Government I am sure will be very glad to accept.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  I would  also  like  to  say

something  on this Bill. First of all,  the  Barisan

Members  should  admit that whatever  distortion  or

specious  arguments or tactics they adopt, they  can

never  succeed in smearing a responsible  Government

like the P.A.P. Even before the introduction of this

Economic  Defence  Bill, when  Indonesia  began  its

confrontation  against Malaysia, we had  immediately

initiated  a  plan to tide over the difficulties  of

workers  affected. To help them in their living,  we

have urged upon employers concerned to take up their

share of the responsibility to tide over the present

crisis   which  has  been  caused  by  the   Barisan

Assemblymen across the Floor.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.39 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has made a speech

taken from statements of his own union. He says that

waterfront  workers are the backbone of  Singapore's

economy, and that the prosperity of these waterfront

workers  means the prosperity of Singapore.  Can  he

deny that he has compiled his speech from statements

and  publications issued by his own union?  He  dare

not deny

it.  All  the speeches uttered by him have the  same

content. Who is thinking for him?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Whether the Member for Choa

Chu Kang writes his speeches or not is irrelevant to

the Bill. Can the Member for Sembawang come back  to

this Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it

is  because  Members across the Floor have  levelled

attacks against me, that is why I have to make  such

a reply to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the Bill, it provides measures to

help  tide  over  the  situation.  Of  course,   the

assistance given under this Bill is not a  permanent

measure,   because  it  only  helps  to  tide   over

difficulties for a period of six months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



But  during the six months the workers affected  can

seek  employment elsewhere. So we do not claim  that

this  Bill  is  able to solve the  problems  of  the

livelihood of the workers in one sweep.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our only hope of what the Barisan Assemblymen can

do  is not to oppose this Bill without any rhyme  or

reason.  Their attack that the Bill is useless,  has

loopholes and is detrimental to the interests of the

workers,  will not help to resolve the  difficulties

of  the  workers affected. Instead they  should  try

with  all sincerity to think out measures to resolve

the  difficulties  resulting from confrontation.  If

they are really sincere in the welfare and interests

of  the  workers I hope they will give their support

to this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of

the  Opposition are worried on one point,  i.e. the

possibilities of employers by-passing the provisions

of   the   Bill   and   not  paying   their   proper

contributions  to the workers. There  was  reference

from  the Members for Choa Chu Kang, Paya Lebar  and

Thomson, about the loopholes of the Bill. They  said

that  employers can give, let us say, two  or  three

days'  employment a month and then keep the  workers

without work for the rest of the month. And this can

go  on  for  the whole of six months, and  therefore

they  avoid having to go into the scheme. Well,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I refer them to clause 5 (2) .  Let

me read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if the Director is satisfied, from information

received  from an employer, contractor or any  other

source,  that  for the reason set out in  subsection

(1)    of  this  section  [i.e. confrontation],  any

employer  or  contractor is unable to  provide  full

employment  or  is  able  to  provide  only  partial

employment  to  any of his employees,  the  director

may,  after  making such inquiries as  he  may  deem

necessary,  determine  the  date  from   which   the

employer  or  contractor is unable to  provide  full

employment  or  is  able  to  provide  only  partial

employment  ..... and  shall advise  the  employer  or

contractor  in writing of the relevant date  and  of

his obligations under this Ordinance.'



<br><br>Clause  2 of the Bill defines "full employment"  and

"partial employment". The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



definition of "partial employment" is, I  think,  of

significance. The operative words are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`..... the employee's total wages per month are less

than the wages received by him from his employer  or

contractor  immediately prior to the adverse  effect

on the business of the employer or contractor.....'.



<br><br>So  it is not possible for employers to escape their

obligations  by giving two or three days'  work  per

month, if that happens, then the workers  will  get

two  or  three days' full pay for the  days  he  has

worked,  and  for the days he does no work  he  goes

under this scheme, that is to say, one-third pay  to

he paid by the employer and one-third pay to be paid

by  the Government. I hope this is made clear and is

understood all round. If the employers try to  evade

their   responsibility   and   avoid   their   legal

obligation in this way, then, of course,  they  have

committed an offence under this Bill and are liable

to  substantial  penalties. So  I  think  that  will

answer  the doubts raised by the Opposition on  this

coverage  of  the  Bill  and  the  possibilities  of

evasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has referred to a

particular company in Sembawang Road. He  says  that

there  is  some  injustice  there.  This  particular

company  is  called Kota Trading  Company,  and  the

Chinese  name is Yen Chou, 91 Sembawang  Road.  They

now have 381 workers on the scheme. As far as we are

informed,  all  the permanent labour force  of  this

factory  are under the scheme. They have been  under

the scheme for some time actually. He said that some

workers arc offered only two days' pay as the  basis

of  this  two-thirds  contribution.  There  are  few

workers attached to this factory who regard work  at

this  factory as casual work. Normally they  do  not

work  there.  They  prefer  hawking  or  fishing  or

farming or whatever they can do --- [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> These are facts. These are the

people who have in the past been offered work by the

employer,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



and the normal practice is that they do not want  to

work  when it is offered to them. It is not that  it

is  only in August that they got two or three  days'

work.   That  was  the  case  in  July,   June   and

previously.  These are the facts as  established  by

investigation ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Bluff!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If the Member for Thomson is

still  unconvinced, I shall be very pleased  to  get

further details from him. This is as I am advised by

the Director of Economic Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson says, "Why August? August

is  a  very  poor month." This is all nonsense,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir. August is a very good month.  I  have

given   figures  to  show  how  our  business   with

Indonesia has been increasing from 1960 to 1962  and

during  1963,  until  confrontation,  it  has   been

increasing  all  the  time. I have  further  details

about this Kota Trading Company. There are only  six

persons  involved, belonging to the class of  people

who  work  one or two days a month. They  cannot  be

considered regular workers because it is their habit

to  refuse  work when such work has been offered  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members of the Opposition have referred to

certain categories of workers who do not fall within

the  scope  of this Bill. The Member for Paya  Lebar

particularly has pointed out that stevedores do  not

come  into this scheme nor do fishermen. It  is  not

possible  to include stevedores in this  scheme  for

two   reasons.  One  is,  there  are  no  stevedores

specifically   engaged  in  loading  and   unloading

Indonesian  cargo. They unload all types  of  cargo.

The  loss of Indonesian cargo means that there is  a

partial  loss of income to them, not a  total  loss.

That is one reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that in the case of such

people like stevedores, fishermen, and even crews on

these   twakows,   there  is  no   employer-employee

relationship. Who are the employers of a crew of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



fishing boat? They all work together on a collective

basis  and a profit sharing basis, and obviously  it

is not possible to get a chief fisherman or the head

of  the crew and ask him to pay one-third the normal

incomes of the other members of the crew, because he

is  equally poor. So for these people, we are trying

to  solve  their difficulties in some other  way.  A

typical problem is for these people in wooden boats.

You  see  quite  a  number of them  laid  off  along

Shenton  Way. There may be about 40 boats and  there

may  be  about 300 or 400 people involved  in  this.

They  used to carry timber from the Rhio Archipelago

- firewood,  timber,  raw sago, attap  roofing,  that

sort  of  thing.  We are trying to  arrange  to  get

alternative sources of timber and firewood for them.

These  alternative supplies are from the West  Coast

and the East Coast of Malaya. We are in consultation

with  the persons engaged in the firewood trade  and

if  it is technically possible, the Government  will

be  quite prepared to advance loans to them to start

industries  on the west coast of Malaya  to  produce

firewood from the bakau timber which abounds there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines says that if the employer

cannot  pay, then what happens? The Member for  Hong

Lim  also says if the employer cannot pay, then  the

Government  should  pay.  Under  this  law,  if  the

employer  cannot  pay,  then  his  assets  will   be

liquidated and the worker will have a prior claim on

whatever is left of his assets on liquidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But both the Member for Tampines and the Member

for Choa Chu Kang are worried about the authority of

the  Director  to  determine  the  normal  wages  of

persons included in this scheme. They think that  he

may try to reduce it or to increase it. They are not

happy. I am not quite sure on what grounds they  are

not  happy about it. The reason is a simple one.  In

most  instances, the pay for August can be  accepted

as  a  reasonable standard. It was a  fairly  active

month  for persons engaged in these industries.  But

you may have the odd



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



case  where a person is sick for a part of the month

or  he  may  have  gone  on leave.  So  under  those

conditions then, the Director will probably take the

previous  month. Anyway he has the right under  this

law  to  vary the basis of calculation in  order  to

ensure  that a just assessment of the average  wages

is  arrived  at.  Obviously, without  this  kind  of

provision,  then either you stick to  a  very  rigid

formula  and  get unfair results because  of  a  few

people  being  sick or being off  work  during  that

month,  or you may get results which will  in  other

ways be equally unsatisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the number of unemployed, Mr Speaker, Sir.

10,000,  says the Member for Tampines; 20,000,  says

the  Member  for  Choa Chu Kang;  30,000,  says  the

Member  for Hong Lim. May I say, obviously  this  is

absolute rubbish? If they want me to believe  it  is

10,000 or 20,000 or 30,000, let me have a list - name

of  firm and number of workers. Then we can add. If

it  comes to 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000, then  it  is

acceptable. But these wild statements made either to

denigrate  the  Government  or  to  demoralise   the

population or to encourage the Indonesians,  are  of

no  use at all. When I say, 1,300, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I give figures.

</pre>



This  is  the  position up to the 14th of  December,

1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines says that he has made

investigations  and  he has  found  that  40  rubber

factories have closed down. I have a list of  rubber

factories   closed  down.  They  are  being   listed

regularly  to  ensure that if they are closed  down,

the  workers come under this scheme. They are  still

operating. So that is that, Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



on  these fantastic claims that 10,000 or 20,000  or

30,000 people are now unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have dealt with the main points raised

by  the  Opposition. There are  a  number  of  minor

points, nagging little points, but I do not think  I

need  waste  the  time of the House in  replying  to

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is nearly five o'clock. I propose

to suspend this sitting till half-past five.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC DEFENCE (DIRECTION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, which is complementary to the Economic

Defence Bill which has been passed by this Assembly,

lays  down, as it were, the second and more positive

line   of   defence  against  Indonesia's   economic

confrontation.  Members will  accept  that  monetary

assistance  and loans to workers laid off  will  not

solve  for  all time the difficulties that  will  he

caused in the employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



field; nor can the engagement or reengagement of the

workers affected be left to the play of free  market

forces. It is therefore necessary to provide for the

direction  of  employment in order  effectively  and

expeditiously  to  reabsorb such  workers  in  other

industries. The purpose of this Bill is therefore to

provide  for the direction of employment for persons

adversely affected by the trade boycott.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direction of employment is not a normal instrument

of  policy, but then these are not normal times and,

without some form of direction, the chances are,  if

confrontation  is  prolonged,  many  of  the   8,000

workers who will eventually be laid off, will remain

unemployed  for  a very long time  after  they  have

drawn  all  the payments under the Economic  Defence

Scheme. I must stress, Sir, that the Bill seeks only

selective  direction, that the dangers of misuse  of

authority have been recognised, and that accordingly

certain safeguards have been provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 gives powers to the Minister to make an

order  to  be published in the Gazette requiring  an

employer  who  is subject to such an  order  not  to

engage  or  re-engage  any  employee  outside  those

registered  with  the  Economic Defence  Department,

without   the  written  consent  of  the   Director.

However,  the  Minister may, before making  such  an

order,   refer  a  draft  thereof  to  a   Committee

appointed by him for its advice. In this manner, the

opinions   of   representatives  of  employers   and

employees will be taken into consideration before an

order  is  made.  I intend to avail  myself  of  the

advice  and  guidance which trade union leaders  and

business  leaders are in a position to offer.  As  I

said in my Budget Speech, this operation can succeed

only  on  the basis of sensible co-operation between

the Government, the workers and management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, however, does not compel any employer to

accept an employee nominated by the Director. He has

the  right  to  refuse to employ such person  if  he

finds him unacceptable, and he may, with the consent

of  the  Director, employ any other  person  of  his

choice. Another safeguard is that the employers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



can  have recourse to an Appeals Board appointed  by

the  Minister if the Director refuses  to  give  his

consent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided that any award made under the

provisions  of  the Industrial Relations  Ordinance,

1960, in relation to the engagement or re-engagement

of  employees by employers, both of whom are subject

to  an  order  made under clause  4,  will  have  no

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final word on Government's policy with regard

to  the  recommendation of workers on  the  laid-off

list to prospective employers. There are two aspects

to  this policy. The first is to ensure, by suitable

grading  of  workers, that those who are recommended

for  employment  will have the requisite  skills  to

perform  the work. The second is to ensure that  the

employment  of  these  workers  will  not  prejudice

industrial   peace   in  the  establishment   or   a

prospective employer. To ensure this then,  laid-off

workers  who are known to have close connections  or

to  have  held offices in pro-Communist unions  will

not be recommended for employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> A black list has been compiled

of  these  persons, both in industries  affected  by

confrontation  as well as in other  industries;  and

this  list  will  be  used  whenever  direction   of

employment is carried out, in this exercise as  well

as  on  future  occasions when Government  wants  to

assist unemployed persons in getting jobs in private

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   after  the  Government  has  introduced   the

Economic Defence Bill, it is now introducing another

Bill  of  the  same  nature - the Economic  Defence

(Direction of Employment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Bills superficially the Government

seems  to have the intention of helping the laid-off

workers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



to  try  and resolve their problems. From the speech

given  by the Minister for Finance, however, we  can

see  very clearly that he has brought political bias

into  the  field of economic assistance for laid-off

workers.  The  Minister for Finance  in  his  Budget

Statement made in this House told this House that he

would  give  careful  and  deliberate  consideration

before he exercises his powers under the law.  These

soothing  talks and beautiful promises made  by  him

not very long ago have now been completely negatived

by what the Minister has said just now. From this we

can  see  that the passing of this Bill will provide

the  Minister  for  Finance and  the  Director  with

extensive and absolute powers. They can make use  of

their  authority  to  monopolise  the  direction  of

employment  for  their political ends.  Workers  who

have   not  been  supporting  the  P.A.P. will   he

prejudiced  against. These words  came  out  of  the

horse's own mouth!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the P.A.P. Government are launching

full-out  on their mean, low and suppressive  policy

which  is  despicable.  From the  Minister's  Budget

Statement,  we  thought that he  would  be  behaving

well,  but  in  actual fact,  he  has  now  made  us

understand that the P.A.P. are trying to make use of

their  political  power to further  their  political

ends of suppression and monopoly; otherwise how  can

they  explain  that the Bill provides  for  them  to

concentrate   all  the  powers  and  management   in

relation  to direction of employment into the  hands

of  one person, the Minister for Finance? Is it  not

very  dangerous to put all the powers into the hands

of one person!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to you, Mr Speaker, the

various  improper stipulations in the Bill,  because

under this Bill the employer has lost his power  and

discretion  in  the engagement of workers.  In  this

respect  the  Minister  has  entirely  deprived  the

employer of his power. Perhaps they will turn  round

and   accuse  us  of  speaking  on  behalf  of   the

employers.  But  I will say that  in  spite  of  the

P.A.P.'s smear, our stand on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



labour  and capital relationship is very  clear.  We

only  oppose  all  those  suppressive  actions   and

injustices  meted  out to the  workers.  As  to  the

fundamental and legitimate rights of the  employers,

we  will respect these rights. But according to  the

provisions  of  the  Bill,  the  discretion  of  the

employer in regard to his power of engaging workers,

is  entirely in the hands of the Minister.  In  this

respect, the Bill has enabled the Minister concerned

to monopolise the power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also stipulates that an Appeals Board

will  be established in case the employers concerned

are  met with a refusal from the Director. They  can

appeal  against his direction. But I would  like  to

point  out that this Appeals Board will be appointed

by  the Minister for Finance himself. Moreover,  the

decision  given  by  the  Appeals  Board   may   not

necessarily be binding and the Minister need not  he

governed  by  it. So what is the use of this  Board?

The power given by the Bill to the Minister may very

likely  be  used  by  him to further  his  political

suppression and persecution, because he may  direct

any  employer not to employ any worker. But I should

say that the Bill should not enable the Minister  to

interfere  with the legitimate relationship  between

the  employer and labour. So from this  we  can  see

that   the   P.A.P.   Government  are   resorting   to

legislation  to further carry out their  suppression

and persecution of the workers and to exploit them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also say that the Bill also provides that

the  employer should get the consent of the Director

in  engaging any laid-off worker, and when he is not

satisfied with the Director's refusal he can  appeal

to  the Appeals Board which, after all, is appointed

by  the  Minister himself. So, how can you say  that

this will give the people the impression of fairness

or  justice  that can be expected from  the  Appeals

Board?  The  Minister has said that only workers  in

the  N.T.U.C. will be given the advantage,  whereas

other  workers who are not in the N.T.U.C. will  be

excluded  from all the benefits. Now, in  this  way,

the P.A.P. will be able to recruit more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



workers  into  their camp and,  at  the  same  time,

intimidate and coerce non-P.A.P. workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we are facing a political crisis

initiated  by the P.A.P.; they are trying to  resort

to legislation to ride over the heads of the workers

to  further their own political ends. If ours  is  a

democracy, I hope the P.A.P. Government in  drafting

this  Bill  will pay full attention to the provision

of  safeguards in the interests and welfare  of  the

workers, and not try to resort to suppression of non-P.A.P. workers who do not support the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully

agree  with the Minister for Finance that the powers

provided  in this Bill should not be used to  direct

those S.A.T.U. activists to any employment. They are

the  persons  who cause hardship and misery  to  the

workers  by  bringing  about  confrontation  through

their  constant agitation. In fact, they  should  be

punished  and  I  propose  to  punish  them  by  not

offering  them  any  facilities of  the  State.  Why

should we offer them these facilities? They are  the

culprits.  They  should be punished and  the  Labour

Ministry  is in full co-operation with the  Ministry

of  Finance  in  preparing a  black  list  of  these

activists.  Once  the names of these  activists  are

entered  into this list, I can assure you that  they

will have no chance of finding employment elsewhere,

especially  in  the  Jurong  pioneering  industries.

However, not all the workers in these unions will be

affected.  Only the trouble-makers will be affected,

and  in  order to give them a chance to  make  their

living, I recommend them to become hawkers or  taxi-drivers. But not all will be given hawkers' licences

or  taxi-drivers' licences. They will be  given  the

posts of assistant hawkers or assistant taxi-drivers

whereby  they can wash the bowls and plates  of  the

hawkers  or wash the cars of the taxi-drivers.  They

may  even  be made to be assistant gaol birds  where

only  second-class treatment will  be  provided  for

them  in  Changi Gaol. I do not see why the  State's

facilities  should be offered to these culprits  and

trouble-makers whose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



main purpose in life is to cause misery and hardship

to the innocent workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the

Minister  for  Finance and the Minister  for  Labour

seem  to  be  very happy when they talk about  their

intention  to fix those who, they say,  have  harmed

the interests of the workers. To those who are power

crazy,  one can be sure that these people will  make

use  of the privileges of this House and abuse them.

It  is  not  surprising that people of  this  nature

should  make  such utterances. In fact,  it  is  not

necessary for them to make such utterances to  annoy

the  Members opposite, because we in the  Opposition

know what they are up to. We are, in fact, very glad

to  have  listened to what they have  said,  because

when  they  are going further and further  into  the

position  in  which they want to abuse their  powers

and  privileges, they are, in fact, one step  nearer

to  death.  So we must give them our blessings,  for

they  are one step nearer to death. But we  want  to

bless them with the hope that they should not end in

the  way that Ngo Dinh Diem has ended. We hope  that

the fate of Ngo Dinh Diem will not befall them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can talk about their powers and privileges,

but  I  wish to point out one matter in relation  to

this  Bill  which gives wide powers to the  Minister

for  Finance. As he has already said in his  speech,

he  is  quite prepared to abuse his powers  to  deal

blows to those so-called Communists. That is his own

admission. So he is quite prepared to try to draw  a

distinction  between non-P.A.P. workers  and  P.A.P.

workers.  As  a  result  of this  distinction,  some

innocent  workers will, under these  powers,  suffer

some  suppression  and misery. In  fact,  they  will

suffer discrimination. Of course, the Ministers  can

do  whatever they like according to their whims and

fancies, but I want to give them a friendly piece of

advice.  If  they want to persist in what  they  do,

they  are  just digging their own grave. There  will

come  a  time when the water will come up  to  their

necks and they will still fail to realise that death

is near.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are quite

clear  about the intentions of the Communist stooges

and  their  friends in the S.A.T.U. unions  towards

their Communist leaders. This, Mr Speaker, to me is

the  best way to achieve industrial peace. Everybody

knows  that  S.A.T.U. controlled  unions  are  pro-Communist and these people are anti-State as well as

pro-confrontationists. These Communist  leaders  and

their  stalwarts in the S.A.T.U. unions can consider

themselves very lucky to be able to enjoy this  two-thirds  salary  benefit, as listed  by  the  Finance

Minister. Mr Speaker, if I had my way, I would  not

let them have the two-thirds salary. They should not

only  be  not given the two-thirds salary, but  they

should  not  be allowed to stay in this State.  They

should  be driven out of this State and sent to  the

Indonesian Communist Party in Indonesia. After  all,

Mr Speaker ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> I am saying that those who love the

Communists must experience starvation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

glad  to notice that what my colleague, the Minister

for Labour, and I have said on this subject has made

an  impact on the Members of the Opposition. This is

only the first step. Now let us not forget that this

is not the final step. Perhaps, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

am  tempted,  just  now, to give  a  review  of  the

history of the fight between the traitors in the pro-Communist camp and the P.A.P., but I think you  will

probably rule me out of order. All I want to say  is

that  we  had  two  decisive engagements  with  them

- September 1962, and again September 1963. They have

lost  the battle and now they are going to  pay  the

penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I once

again make it clear that we are not going to inflict

any  punishment  on the workers, as  a  group?  That

would  be  quite  wrong. We  know  there  are  large

numbers of industrial workers - Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



industrial  workers especially - who are  members  of

the  S.A.T.U. unions. The general body  of  workers

will  be given every protection and will be able  to

enjoy all the privileges under this Bill as well  as

under  other  Bills. But in the course of  our  long

struggle with the treacherous anti-national elements

of  the pro-Communist camp in the trade union field,

the  cultural field, the educational field  and  the

political  field,  we have identified  a  number  of

activists who knowingly - not unconsciously  - support

their cause in the full knowledge that it is a  pro-Communist   anti-national  line.  Well,  they   must

suffer.  And I make no apologies at all  that  steps

will  be  taken  to deal with them. The  Member  for

Thomson  says  that by so doing we  bring  ourselves

nearer  to death. I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  he

means "nearer to political death" and not "nearer to

physical  death" like Mr Ngo Dinh Diem. Because  if

it  was  the latter interpretation, then, or course,

he  is  threatening  an honourable  Member  of  this

Assembly, and, quite apart from being out  of  order

under the Standing Orders of this Assembly, he would

merit  more  severe penalties than just being  ruled

out of order. Well, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not Ngo

Dinh Diems, we are not dictators. Why are they here?

Being  paid  $500  to criticise the  Government  and

propagate  their  pernicious and  treacherous  anti-national  views?  Neo Dinh Diem, Mr  Speaker,  Sir?

Under  Ngo Dinh Diem they would be whisked off  when

they come out of the Assembly into a car, brought to

Changi  Gaol, at six o'clock tomorrow morning  lined

up against the wall, and executed. Instead of which,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in a few days' time  just  before

Christmas  they will certainly be getting $500  from

Government  funds  so that they  can  have  a  Merry

Christmas.  Now, he says that what we are  going  to

do,  our  policy, is to punish the workers who  are

non-P.A.P. and to reward the workers who  are  pro-P.A.P.  Now  that is not the distinction,  Sir.  The

distinction is between a small group - a small group,

Sir  - of pro-Communist cadres and activists, and the

general  run of workers. The general run of  workers

would be unaffected. We give them full support,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



full  protection. But this small group - and we  know

them  now,  having  come into  collision  with  them

through all these years, we know who they are ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young:</b> And you are afraid?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Not afraid. This is only the

first  step,  Mr  Speaker, Sir.  Worse  is  yet  to

follow,  and  at  the end of five  years,  we  shall

review    the   progress   made   in   all   fields.

Confrontation, not between Indonesia  and  Malaysia,

but  between  the  P.A.P. and the treacherous  anti-national  elements. At the end of  five  years,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I assure you, Singapore will be a  far

happier State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the former local government legislation

there  was  provision  for  a  refund  of  rates  on

unoccupied buildings intended for renting. But  when

the  property tax was imposed in 1961, no  provision

was made for a refund of tax on unoccupied buildings

as  the  tax  was  on ownership of  property  as  an

additional  source  of general revenue.  Unlike  the

former  rates,  it  covered  the  cost  of  services

provided by the local authorities. There was also at

that  time an acute shortage of housing and  it  was

intended  to discourage house owners from exploiting

the  situation by holding the houses in  vacancy  in

the hope of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



collecting   higher  rentals  later.  Due   to   the

successful  efforts of the Housing  and  Development

Board and due to extensive private development,  the

housing shortage has eased considerably since  then.

And  it is now possible to allow a house owner,  who

has made a genuine effort to let out his house at  a

fair  rental  but has failed to do so,  to  claim  a

refund  of  tax  for any period his house  has  been

vacant  for  30  days or more continuously.  On  9th

November  last  year I announced that this  decision

would  be made effective from the 1st January, 1963.

This  was  repeated in my Budget  Statement  of  7th

June,  1963.  The object of clause 2 of the  present

Bill is to give effect to that decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present aggrieved property owners may lodge

objections  against  valuations with  the  Valuation

Review  Board. Over the last two years the  majority

of  objections were minor ones which could have been

satisfactorily   settled  by  the   Inland   Revenue

Department. The Bill provides in clause 3  for  such

objections  to  be  lodged  first  with  the   Chief

Assessor, while reserving to the property owner  the

ultimate  right  of appeal to the  Valuation  Review

Board  against  the Chief Assessor's decision.  This

will  make  for  more expeditious decisions  without

jeopardising the right of appeal to the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill will also confer on the Chief

Assessor  the  right to appeal  to  the  High  Court

against  any decision of the Valuation Review  Board

on  any question of law or fact and law. This  right

is  being  enjoyed at present only by  the  property

owner, and not by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill provides for property tax to

be  payable not only from the date of completion  of

the  new  building,  but  also  from  the  date   of

completion  of  any alterations or  improvements  to

buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4, 5 and 8 to 14 of the Bill provide for

minor and consequential amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is quite straightforward,

namely,  to tighten the provisions of the  Societies

Ordinance  in  order  to provide  a  more  effective

measure  of control. It has been found in the  light

of  some  years'  experience  in  administering  the

Societies  Ordinance  that the provisions  have  not

proved  adequate  in dealing with societies  already

registered   or   applying  for  registration.   For

example, there is a large number of societies  which

were  registered many years ago but whose rules have

been  found  to be defective or inadequate  for  the

proper running of the society, with the result  that

some  of these societies have been either improperly

run  or used for purposes other than those fur which

they  were originally registered. Under the  present

provisions of the Ordinance, there is no  power  for

the  Registrar  to require a society to  change  its

rules   once  it  has  been  registered  under   the

Ordinance  and  accordingly clause 4  of  the  Bill

amends  section 17 of the Ordinance  to  enable  the

Registrar  to  require, where circumstances  warrant

it, any registered society to amend its rules. Where

a  society  has been requested by the  Registrar  to

amend  its  rules and has failed, without reasonable

cause,  to do so within three months of the request,

the  Minister may, where he thinks fit,  order  that

such  society should be dissolved. This is the  only

change



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



proposed  to  the provisions of section  17  of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present provisions, the Ministry already

has  powers to order the dissolution of any  society

which  is  being used for unlawful purposes,  or  is

being  used for purposes incompatible with the peace

or  good  order of the State or with the objects  or

rules  of  the society. It has also been found  that

many  societies are being mismanaged by persons  who

are  not  fit  to  be office-bearers.  For  example,

persons  who  while being members of a society  have

been convicted for an offence involving the unlawful

expenditure of the funds of a society or  have  been

convicted for a criminal offence. Clause  3  of  the

Bill is designed to exclude such persons from acting

as  office-bearers of any society in cases where the

circumstances warrant such exclusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill also amends the Ordinance to

provide  that  no registered society shall  use  any

symbol  without  the  consent  in  writing  of   the

Registrar  or an Assistant Registrar.  It  has  been

found  that  a  number of societies and associations

have  adopted symbols which hear resemblance to  one

another  and which have in the past led to no  small

measure of confusion. It is considered desirable  to

rectify the situation by providing the Registrar  or

Assistant  Registrar with powers to  ensure  that  a

symbol adopted by a registered society is such  that

its  identity is not likely to be confused with that

of   another  society  or  association.  When  these

amended provisions become law, the Government  will,

of   course,  allow  a  sufficient  period  for  all

registered  societies  with  symbols  to  apply  for

approval of their symbols, and will only take action

against  societies which have not complied with  the

amended  provisions  after all registered  societies

have been given an adequate opportunity to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present provisions of section 20 of the

Societies  Ordinance,  where  a  society  has   been

dissolved  by the Minister under section 17  of  the

Ordinance,  the Official Assignee in  Bankruptcy  or

any  other officer appointed for the purpose  shall,

after satisfying and providing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



for  all the debts and liabilities of a society  and

the  cost of winding up, divide the surplus  assets,

if any, amongst the members of the society according

to  their rules; and in cases where such division of

the surplus assets is not practicable, according  to

a  scheme  which has to be prepared by the  Official

Assignee or other officer appointed for the  purpose

and submitted to a Supreme Court Judge for approval.

It  has  been  found, however, that  the  provisions

relating to the preparation of a scheme for division

of  surplus assets and the submission to  a  Supreme

Court Judge for approval have, quite apart from  the

cumbersome   procedure  involved,  not  worked   out

satisfactorily   in  practice.   It   is   proposed,

therefore,  that  in  cases where  the  division  of

surplus  assets  of  a  dissolved  society  is   not

practicable  - for  example, in the  case  where  the

assets  concerned are too unsubstantial  to  warrant

the  work  involved  in  distribution  - such  assets

should,  where the Minister considers it  desirable,

be paid into the Consolidated Fund of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amending subsection (2) of

section  9 of the Ordinance to increase the  penalty

from  $25  to $200 hardly needs any comment.  It  is

quite  clear that the penalty of $25 which was fixed

many years ago is inadequate to serve as a deterrent

and  it  is  considered desirable to  increase  this

penalty to the more appropriate sum of $200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we

are now debating the Societies (Amendment) Bill. The

debate  on  this Bill is similar in  nature  to  the

debate  that  we had on the Trade Unions (Amendment)

Bill.  This  Bill gravely infringes  the  rights  of

certain organisations. We pointed out yesterday that

Government  is  utilising its majority  strength  in

this  House and abusing its majority seats  in  this

House  to amend all the Ordinances. These amendments

will  enable  them to deal with certain individuals,

organisations,  political Parties or  certain  trade

unions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying the clauses in this Bill, we find

that these amendments are of a serious nature. These

amendments  in the Societies Ordinance  can  control

and  influence  all registered societies.  They  can

also control any political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the political system in Singapore is based on the so-called democratic parliamentary system. Political Parties play a very important role in a democratic system. They are part and parcel of the democratic system. After this Societies (Amendment) Bill has been

passed,  it will be possible for the P.A.P. to  deal

with  any  political Party if they  feel  that  this

particular   political  Party  will   endanger   the

P.A.P.'s existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us study closely the clauses in this Bill.

Let  us  examine them. In clause 3, new section  9B,

subsection (1)  provides that two types of people are

not  allowed  to hold office in any organisation  or

political  Party. The first category is as  provided

under  (a) .  That  is,  any  person  who  has  "been

convicted  for  an  offence involving  the  unlawful

expenditure of the funds of a society; or (b)  he has

been  declared,  in writing, by the Minister  to  be

unfit to be an officer of a society by reason of any

conviction   for  a  criminal  offence  other   than

specified  in  paragraph  (a)   of  this  subsection,

unless the written permission of the Minister so  to

act  is  first obtained." These two small paragraphs

infringe human rights. These two small sections will

stigmatise a person if he has committed any offence.

They  will  prohibit him from holding any office  in

any   societies  forever.  He  will  be  stigmatised

forever. He will be branded as one who has committed

an  offence. Such provisions are very objectionable.

They  are unreasonable. I do not know why the P.A.P.

want  to  make such legislation after they  came  to

power.  They  have helped criminals  who  have  been

convicted  in the past by releasing them  from  gaol

and  finding  jobs  for them. But  why  should  they

punish a person for his past misdeeds by prohibiting

him from holding office in the society? The offences

may not be the same. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



may  he committed under different circumstances  and

at different times. For example, if a person commits

a  certain offence during a strike; for example,  he

prevents  the car of his employer from  leaving  the

factory,  he  will  commit the  offence  of  traffic

obstruction.  If he is convicted by  the  Court,  he

will  be penalised. He will be deprived of the right

to  hold  office  in any society  or  any  political

Party.  Under  a pro-Labour government  this  person

will  be declared innocent. But under a pro-employer

government, this person will be convicted for having

obstructed  his  employer.  Therefore,  he  will  he

deprived  of  his  opportunity  and  right  to  hold

office. This is very wrong. If the P.A.P. find  that

certain  officials  in a political  Party  are  very

capable  and  they are a threat to the P.A.P.,  then

the  P.A.P. can conveniently dub them as  criminals

and  thus deprive them of their right to work  in  a

political  Party. This is another instance  to  show

that  the P.A.P. want to interfere with the internal

affairs  of a political Party or society.  The  Bill

gives  too much power to the Minister to enable  him

to  interfere  with  those societies  and  political

Parties  which one day may come to power.  It  gives

the  Minister power to stop another political  Party

from  being  returned  to  power  by  depriving  the

officers  of that political Party of their right  to

hold  office. The P.A.P. also intend to get  rid  of

those union officials who do not support them. It is

easy to convict such officials of any offence if the

P.A.P. do not like them on some excuse or pretext.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second page of this Bill clause 3 - new

section 9C reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No registered society shall use any symbol

without  the consent in writing of the Registrar  or

an Assistant Registrar.'



<br><br>That  is,  a  society cannot make use of any  symbol

without the consent of the Registrar. This provision

is  also unreasonable. For example, if there  is  an

election pending and a certain group of people  form

themselves into a political Parts in order  to  take

part  in the election, they must have a Party symbol

to enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



the  people to know what party they belong  to.  But

the Registrar can abuse his power by withholding his

consent  to  prevent  the people  from  knowing  the

symbol  of  this political Party. This will  greatly

affect  the chances of this political Party  in  the

election. If the electors do not know the symbol  of

a political Party, how are they going to elect their

candidates? This is a serious interference with  the

activities  of a political Party. At the  same  time

- new section 9c (3)  - clause 3 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In any case where a registered society uses a

symbol   in  contravention  of  the  provisions   of

subsection (1)  of this section-







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the president, secretary and all members of

the  committee  of such society,  or  if  such

offices  do  not  exist, all  persons  holding

positions in such society analogous  to  those

of  president, secretary and members  of  such

committee; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) all persons managing or assisting in the

management of such society,



<br><br>shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence and shall

be  liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one

thousand  dollars or to imprisonment for a term  not

exceeding  one  year  or  to  both  such  fine   and

imprisonment.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extreme penalty. It is unreasonable to

penalise  all  the office-bearers of a society  that

contravenes  this  particular  provision.  This   is

something like the method used by Hitler or  General

Templer  who  detained a whole  village  because  of

disturbances caused by one or two persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, every provision in this Bill

encroaches  on the basic human rights of the  people

and the principle of the rule of law.  On  the  second

page, clause 4 - new subsection  (1)  of section 17 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever it appears to the Minister that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any registered society is being used for

unlawful purposes; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any registered society is being used for

purposes incompatible with the peace  or  good

order  of the State of Singapore, or with  the

objects or, rules of the society as entered in

the Register of Societies;



<br><br>the  Minister may order that such society  shall  be

dissolved.'



<br><br>What we want to know is what is an unlawful society?

What is meant by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



unlawful  purposes? The P.A.P. can turn  bad  things

into  good things and vice versa. They can  construe

bad things as good and vice versa. After the passage

of  this  Bill  they can deal with  any  society  or

political Party by alleging that they are illegal or

unlawful.  The  word "unlawful" is  very  vague  and

equivocal.  The  Minister  can  make  use  of   this

equivocal term to brand a certain political Party as

being  unlawful or indulging in unlawful activities.

And  then  the words "peace or good order" - what  is

"peace",  what  is "good order"? They can  interpret

according  to  their  own ways. These  are  abstract

terms.   Different   people   can   have   different

interpretations of the words "peace and good order".

Therefore,  it  is  dangerous  to  put  in  such   a

provision.  And  then on page 3 of the  Bill  -  new

section 17 (1)  (c)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever it appears to the Minister that-







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the rules of any registered society are or

have  been  inadequate  for  the  purpose   of

providing   for  its  proper  management   and

control and such registered society has failed

without  reasonable cause to amend  its  rules

within  three  months of,  and  in  accordance

with,  a  request from the Registrar to  amend

its rules for such purpose,







<br><br>the  Minister may order that such society  shall  be

dissolved.'



<br><br>The P.A.P. have not adhered to the law whenever they

do  anything.  The inclusion of such a provision  in

the Bill is very dangerous. I would like to make  an

analogy to show how this Bill can infringe upon  the

rights of a society. If such a Bill is to be passed,

you  can  say, "Your nose should be removed  to  the

back  of  your head." Now if that person refuses  to

obey,  then  the  Minister will take action  against

him.  It would be something like that. If this  kind

of  Bill  is  passed,  then  in  future  the  P.A.P.

Minister can also order a man to put on a cheongsam.

If   the  constitutional  rules  of  a  society  are

inadequate, then the members concerned can amend  or

change them provided they do not go beyond the  law.

Then  why should there be such a provision  for  the

Minister to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



order them to do so? Mr Speaker, numerous laws have

been  introduced and passed by the P.A.P. for  their

own  benefit, but the consequences will be very  bad

and parliamentary democracy may in the end become  a

laughing  stock  and  perhaps there  may  emerge  in

Singapore  a  Fascist political system.  This  is  a

possibility. This can be brought about by their  way

of legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

whenever the P.A.P. Government introduces a Bill, it

is  branded as dictatorial, anti-people and Fascist.

How can they say so? If there are laws which provide

certain  powers,  of course, the  Minister  can  use

those  powers. How can you say that the Minister  is

abusing the powers provided by the law? If there are

laws,  you  cannot say that the action  taken  under

such laws is an abuse of power. What can the Barisan

Members   do?  They  can  only  level   terms   like

"Fascist",  "abusing  power",  etc.  This  Bill,  in

actual  fact,  gives power to the Minister  and  the

Registrar  to control societies, to safeguard  their

members  arid to take action against those societies

and  office-bearers involved in unlawful  acts.  And

yet  the Barisan brand this Bill as a Fascist  Bill.

In  the  Bill it is provided that only when  office-bearers of a society commit unlawful acts, will they

be  dealt  with  by  the law. All those  law-abiding

office-bearers and members have nothing to fear.  If

any  member  of  a  society carries  out  subversive

activities detrimental to the security of the State,

such  as  abetting  Indonesia in her  confrontation,

then   such   activities  are  unlawful.   Any   one

collaborating  with  Indonesia  at   a   time   when

Indonesia  is suppressing and persecuting Malaysians

and  seizing Malaysian properties is deemed to  have

committed  an  illegal and unlawful act  under  this

Bill.  Of  course, it is the responsibility  of  the

Government  to  enforce laws  to  ensure  that  such

activities  can be curbed in order to safeguard  the

legitimate rights and interests and welfare  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Assemblymen have been using terms like

"Fascist", "dictatorial".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



This  attack is futile because our laws provide  for

the  interests  of the majority,  and  not  for  the

minority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of

this  Societies (Amendment) Bill is to regulate  and

suppress   societies  in  Singapore  and   political

Parties. The speech of the Member who sat down  just

now  gave us a clear indication of the intention  of

the Government. Whoever is against the Government is

committing  an  unlawful  act,  and  therefore   the

provisions of this Societies (Amendment)  Bill  must

be applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that this Bill is unnecessary. It is undemocratic. First of all, the new section 9c enables the Government to regulate symbols of all societies and political Parties. In the case of non-political societies, symbols are not so important. But in the case of political Parties,

a  symbol  is very important because during  polling

the  voter  only  votes  for  the  symbol.  We  have

experience  of  the  Government  asking  that  party

symbols  be  changed.  So  section  9c  enables  the

Government to refuse party symbols which  have  been

known  for some time. There is no proviso to assure

political  Parties that symbols which have  been  in

use  will  automatically be approved, and any  party

has  to accept the decision of the Registrar and the

Minister,  without any opportunity of  appealing  to

the  Court. Under this new section, if the  Minister

says that this party must change its symbol, it  has

no  right of appeal to anybody; the decision of  the

Minister shall be final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another undemocratic aspect of the Bill is that

the  Government may ask any society  to  change  its

rules  that have already been approved by them.  Mr

Speaker,  we  know that when rules are submitted  to

Government  for  approval, the  Government  normally

take  some time to consider them, and in almost  all

cases   questions  are  asked  on  the   rules   and

amendments suggested. And now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



we  have a new clause enabling Government to  repeal

or  amend  rules that have already been approved  by

Government.  Let  us suppose the constitution  of  a

party  or a society has been approved by Government.

Now  the  Government want power to amend  or  repeal

those rules,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this power is very undemocratic.

The  Government already have enormous powers to take

action against societies that come under section  17

of  the  Societies  Ordinance.  Clause  4,  amending

section 17, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whenever it appears to the Minister that -







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any registered society is being used for unlawful purposes; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any registered society is being used for purposes incompatible with the peace or good order of the State of Singapore, or with the objects or rules of the society as entered in the Register of Societies; or'.



<br><br>Mr Speaker, this clause gives the Government almost

full  dictatorial powers to close down any  society.

And the Government in addition want not only to have

powers  to close down a society, but also to manage,

regulate  and control a society by a new  provision,

which  is the new clause amending section 17 of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third undemocratic feature of this Bill is

clause  5  which enables the Minister to expropriate

the  funds of members once he closes down a society.

Mr  Speaker, the funds of a society belong  to  its

members,  and  even if the Government close  down  a

society they have no right to expropriate the funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that this Bill is most undemocratic, and that it, together with the next few Bills to be brought up - one of which is the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Amendment) Bill - is meant, in my opinion, to strangle the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I would like to say a few words on this Bill. I

would like to ask the Opposition why they are scared

of  this amendment Bill. If the Bill is passed, they

will not be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



manipulate  societies for their own political  ends.

It  is  the practice of the Communists to manipulate

the societies for their nefarious designs. Likewise,

the Communists carry out their struggle by using the

societies as their tools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say to them that as long as they

carry  out such designs detrimental to the interests

of   the   people,   then  they  will   suffer   the

consequences of their actions. So in this House they

should  not  pretend to believe that  this  Bill  is

undemocratic.  If  we are undemocratic,  surely  the

opposition Members would not be here in this  House.

This  is  unlike the democracy that is obtaining  in

Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in respect of this Bill,  I  feel

that  the difference between the Government's  stand

and  the  Opposition's stand is  this.  We,  as  the

Government,  have  the  right  to  look  after   the

legitimate  rights of societies and  their  members.

But  the  Opposition Members here are asking  us  to

give  latitude to those unlawful members and office-bearers  of  societies to carry out  their  unlawful

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, here is the distinction. The Members opposite

have asked us: what does "unlawful" mean? I will try

to  enlighten  them as to what the  term  "unlawful"

means.  This is a very glaring example. If a society

is   used   to   carry  out  treacherous  activities

detrimental  to the security of the State,  then  we

say  that such actions are unlawful. Another example

of  an  unlawful act is this: the funds of  a  trade

union  without the approval of its members are being

doled  out  after  a meeting of  only  some  of  the

executive  members  to  fellow  travellers.  Another

example  is  when  the society  is  being  used  for

purposes  other than in the interests or in  keeping

with the rules of the society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore there are a great many varieties of

societies, some with aims and objectives  which  are

not in actual fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



directed  at  the  interests  and  welfare  of   the

members, but for the purpose of making money.  So  I

do  not understand why the Barisan Assembly Members,

on  whatever  piece  of  legislation  we  introduce,

should  always support unlawful actions  and  always

speak  on behalf of such actions. They say  that  we

have denied the societies the right to appeal to the

Court,  because  the Minister's  decision  is  final

according to the Bill. But when there are provisions

for  them to appeal to the Court, they will say that

the  Court  may  not be a good means  to  meet  this

situation. They are very eloquent in their  specious

arguments.  They are trying to obstruct the  passage

of  whatever  legislation we want to introduce  into

this House. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Ah, he has said

too  much. You know, all this is bunkum. The  P.A.P.

is  renowned for its integrity and honesty.  We  are

not boasting. Only a handful of Assemblymen opposite

us  are  telling  us that they represent  the  broad

masses  of  the people of Singapore!  How  can  they

claim this?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the Parliamentary Secretary

anything further to say on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, I am

winding up.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not want to appear impatient,

but   let  us  not  have  a  discussion  as  to  who

represents  the  people. We  are  on  the  Societies

(Amendment) Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

talking  about  the symbols used by  societies.  The

Member for Hong Lim expressed his dissatisfaction in

regard  to  the  symbol of his political  Party.  He

realised that it was similar to that used by Nanyang

University and the People's Association; it is  even

used  as a trade mark. The Barisan Members have been

shouting  day in and day out that this  is  illegal,

that   is   no   good   and  that   they   are   the

representatives  of the people. All  this  is  sheer

nonsense.  [Interruption] They accuse  us  of  being

dictators. If we are dictators, these people will no

longer be sitting here today.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I will not take up much  of  your

time. I just wish to clarify a few points. I do  not

think it will take up more than ten minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has accused the Government

of  intending to use this amending Bill to deal with

opposition   Parties  or  societies  that   are   in

opposition to the Government. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

have no intention of abusing our power. In fact, the

whole  purpose of this amendment is to  protect  the

ordinary  members  - the  lawful  members   - of   the

society. For the Member to accuse us of abusing  our

power, I think, is a bit of distortion. In fact,  it

is  people like the Member for Thomson who have been

abusing the power. Take, for instance, the O.B.A.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want the Minister to

make   any   personal   attacks   on   the   Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, take, for

instance,  the old boys' association. The object  of

an  old  boys' association is to promote  friendship

amongst  the old boys of the school in whatever  way

they  can and to promote the welfare of its members.

That  is  the  object  of  most  of  the  old  boys'

associations.   But  what  do  we  find?   We   have

discovered from experience that the O.B.A. has  been

used  for political purposes. In fact, most  of  the

O.B.A.s in Singapore have become the political wings

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  During  the  referendum

campaign  the O.B.A.s played a prominent part.  They

canvassed  among the people against the  Government.

Even  at  the  last  election the O.B.A.s  came  out

actively to campaign on behalf of the Barisan.

course,  such  an  association  is  at  liberty   to

campaign  at the election. But it is not a political

organisation. It is the same thing with the Hawkers'

Union.  The object of the Hawkers' Union is supposed

to  look  after  the  welfare of  its  members.  But

instead  we  find the Hawkers' Union running  around

Singapore and taking an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



active   part   in  the  anti-merger,  anti-Malaysia

campaign, and campaigning for the Barisan. These are

the  people  who abuse the objects of  the  society. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now both

the  Member for Thomson and the Member for Hong  Lim

spoke  of the clause about the symbol. We have found

from  experience  that many of  the  societies,  not

necessarily  political societies, have used  symbols

which  some  other  societies have already  adopted,

with  the result that confusion has arisen. This  is

particularly important when election time comes. And

it  is  to  prevent  this  confusion  that  we  have

introduced  the amendment. Take, for  instance,  the

symbol of the U.P.P. It has been pointed out that it

is a symbol that has been used by many associations.

Take,  for instance, the Barisan symbol - the  circle

and  the  star. I wish to inform the House,  if  the

Members opposite are still unaware of it, that  this

very   identical  symbol  is  used  by  a  Communist

organisation in China. That identical symbol of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  is  reproduced  in  a  dictionary

published  by  the  Government Publishing  House  in

China.  I  would advise the Members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis to be very careful about it. [Interruption]

I  do  not wish to prolong the debate. All that  has

been  raised by Members of the Opposition  has  been

answered by my colleagues. I would only like to  say

here  that  the  purpose of  our  bringing  up  this

amending Bill is not to curb political Parties.  Our

main  purpose  is to protect members  of  societies,

whether  ordinary societies or political  societies,

from  being  manipulated  by  irresponsible  people,

thereby bringing about undesirable results to  them.

The reasons have been given by me just now, and so I

do not wish to elaborate on this.

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a straightforward Bill which makes certain

non-controversial amendments to the Public Utilities

Ordinance   No.  1  of  1963.  The  first  amendment

provides for the appointment of a Deputy Chairman of

the  Public  Utilities Board  who  is  empowered  to

exercise the powers of Chairman when the Chairman is

unable  to  act  or the office of  the  Chairman  is

vacant.  The  Deputy Chairman will also  preside  at

meetings  during  the absence of  the  Chairman.  At

present there is provision in the Ordinance only for

a member to be appointed temporary Chairman whenever

the Chairman is unable by illness or otherwise to be

present,  and this process has to be repeated  every

time  the  Chairman is similarly incapacitated.  The

Bill also seeks to amend the Ordinance so as to make

it  clear  that  only  the  members  of  the  Public

Utilities  Board, its employees and  persons  acting

under  the  Board's  direction who  are  not  to  be

subject  personally to any action, liability,  claim

or  demand  whatsoever for any matter or thing  done

for  the purpose of executing the provisions of this

Ordinance and that the Board itself is not protected

from any such actions, liabilities, claim or demand.

At  present it is possible that section 20 as worded

may  be  construed  as extending protection  to  the

Board  itself  from any liability.  Again,  although

there is nothing in the Ordinance at present to  say

that  the Board can make ex gratia payments  to  any

person  sustaining  any  damage  by  reason  of  the

exercise of any of the powers vested in the Board or

its employees there is nothing to preclude the Board

from  making  such ex gratia payments. However,  for

the  removal of any doubt, the Bill includes  a  new

provision which explicitly states that the Board can

make such ex gratia payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the present provisions of the Ordinance

state that tariffs in connection with the supply  of

water,  gas  and  electrical  energy  and  hire   of

apparatus shall be prescribed by regulations made by

the   Board  and  that  all  regulations  shall   be

published  in the Gazette but any prices charged  by

way  of special agreement do not require publication

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



Gazette. This amendment Bill now provides that other

prices which are charged by special agreement  shall

also  be published in the Gazette as soon as may  be

after the signing of such special agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also, Mr Speaker, given notice of an

amendment which I will move at Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker. Sir, this amendment Bill provides that  the

Public  Utilities Board shall have powers to appoint

a   Deputy  Chairman  who  shall  preside  over  all

meetings in the absence of the Chairman and exercise

his powers in his absence. We know that the Chairman

of the Public Utilities Board is Mr Oehlers and the

Deputy Chairman is a P.A.P. Member, namely, Dr Fong

Kim  Heng. I believe that Members in this House know

that  Mr George Oehlers was the ex-Speaker of  this

Chamber.  Because  he  was very  impartial  in  this

Chamber in exercising his duties he was not prepared

to ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order. Mr

Speaker, I think the Member for Jurong is digressing

from  the principles of the Ordinance. He is  making

specific  references  to  the  ex-Speaker  of   this

Legislative Assembly and I do not think that  it  is

relevant at all to the debate under consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, I rule in your favour, Dr Toh.

I  must  tell the Member for Jurong that we are  not

discussing  the  ex-Speaker here. We are  discussing

this  Bill.  So please, if he has anything  to  say,

confine it to this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

just  mentioned this matter in passing in  order  to

remind  this  House that when the  P.A.P. tries  to

amend the Bill, there is some ulterior motive behind

the  amendment, because of the fear that Sir  George

Oehlers,  who was the ex-Speaker of this House,  may

not  agree with the policies of the P.A.P. and  the

dictatorial behaviour of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. in the Public Utilities Board. This  is  the

amendment  moved  in  order to  meet  this  possible

exigency, so that when Mr Oehlers is away, Dr Fong

can  come in and act on his behalf. But, if you  say

this is irrelevant, I shall stop now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is difficult to

believe how stupid the Barisan Sosialis can  be.  If

they  really  think that the purpose of moving  this

amendment  to  the  Public  Utilities  Ordinance  is

because we are afraid of the present holder  of  the

post   of   Chairman  of  the  Board,  the  simplest

procedure would be not to appoint him at all. We are

not under an obligation to appoint the ex-Speaker of

this  Assembly  as Chairman of the Public  Utilities

Board. I think that is the simplest answer to his, I

would say, not very clever remark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

any  member  of  the Board to  be  the  Deputy

Chairman  of the Board, and if for any  reason

the  Chairman is unable to act or  the  office

of  Chairman  is  vacant, the Deputy  Chairman

may   exercise  all  or  any  of  the   powers

conferred,  or  the  duties  imposed,  on  the

Chairman under this Ordinance.".'.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Public Utilities Ordinance

provides  for a three-year period of office  for  its

members.  This amendment, in effect, -  empowers  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara to exercise  his  discretion

when  he thinks fit to fix the term of office  for  a

period  of  two  years  instead  of  three  years  in

connection  with such appointments. This  allows  for

some    flexibility    in   the   consideration    of

appointments.   The  eligibility  for  re-appointment

still  remains.  This  amendment  also  repeats   the

provision for the appointment of the Deputy Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 to 6 inclusive ordered to stand part of

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of subsection (1) of section

15  of  the  Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

Ordinance,  the Registration Officer is  required  to

complete the revision of the registers of electors on

or  before  the 15th day of September or  such  later

date in that year as the Minister may appoint for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



the purpose by notification published in the Gazette.

The  revision  for  the year 1963 was  not  completed

before  15th  September, and in accordance  with  the

provision  of  subsection (1)  of section  15  of  the

Ordinance,  the date of completion has been  extended

to  31st December, 1963. However, the revision cannot

be  completed before April 1964, and the  purpose  of

this Bill is to provide for the extension of time for

the revision until 30th April, 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons for the delay in the

completion  of  the  revision of the  registers.  The

first  is  the delay in the completion  of  the  1962

revision  of the registers of electors. This revision

was  completed  only in June 1963,  and  consequently

work  on  the  1963 revision could not  be  commenced

early in the year as usual. The second reason for the

delay  was  the  holding of the general  election  in

September  1963. The staff who would ordinarily  have

been  engaged  in the revision of the registers  were

employed in the preparations for and conduct  of  the

election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the clauses in this amending Bill are meant to extend

the  time for the revision of the electoral registers

to  April 1964 or to a day appointed by the Minister.

According  to the Elections Ordinance, the  electoral

registers should be completed by 15th of September of

that  year. Therefore, the revision of the  Registers

of  Electors should be completed this year.  Why  has

there been such a delay? Why has the revision of  the

registers not been completed in time?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Deputy Prime Minister gave two reasons

for the delay. One of the reasons was the election in

September. If you remember correctly, the ex-Minister

for  Home Affairs has said that the revision  of  the

registers  for 1963 commenced in June this  year.  At

the same time, he also said that work had started  in

March  this year. The period from March up to now  is

nine  months. So there were nine months in  which  to

complete the revision of the Registers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



of  Electors.  The Government should have  completed

the  revision  of these Registers of  Electors  long

ago. The Registers of Electors were exhibited during

the snap elections held recently. Lists A and B were

exhibited  to  the  public. Those whose  names  were

struck  off  from  the registers of  electors  could

apply for the restoration of their names within  two

weeks.  The registers of electors should  have  been

completed long ago. The work of this revision should

not entail any difficulty. In fact, we have a lot of

money and we have enough staff. Since the Government

have spent a lot of money and effort on the training

of  youth  leadership, why did  the  Government  not

provide  new  staff and funds for the completion  of

the  revision  of the electoral registers?  We  have

seen  that the revision of these electoral registers

has  been  postponed  from  time  to  time.  If  you

remember correctly, there was a similar amendment in

the  past.  There  were similar provisions  for  the

extension of the revision of the electoral registers

for  1962  from 30th September, 1962, to 30th  June,

1963.  I  would not like to touch on the reason  for

the  delay. In extending the time for the completion

of this work, the P.A.P. intended to exclude certain

qualified  electors from the registers of  electors.

That  is,  those who had attained the age of  21  in

July  1963  were  excluded  from  the  registers  of

electors. At that time, the P.A.P. intended to  hold

the  general  election in 1964. If the revision  was

completed in June, then those who could vote in  the

elections  will be those whose names appear  in  the

registers  of electors for 1962. Thus 50,000  people

who  had  the  right to vote in 1962 will  not  have

their  names included in the Registers of  Electors.

In  doing so, the P.A.P. did not give the people who

did  not support the P.A.P. a chance to vote in  the

elections. The Registers of Electors for  1963  will

have  to  be  extended again to  1964.  Perhaps  the

P.A.P. are playing another game in respect  of  the

revision of the Registers of Electors. They  want  a

longer  period  of time to enable  them  to  include

those people who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



had  no  right to vote in the general elections.  In

the  recent  elections, we heard  that  many  people

could  not  find  their names in the  registers.  By

manipulating  the  registers,  the  P.A.P. hope  to

perpetuate their regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another secret which they dare not reveal to the

public is this. From the speeches of the P.A.P.,  we

have  some  hint that the Member for Moulmein  would

resign her seat to enable her husband to contest  in

a  by-election, so that he could be elected  to  the

Central Parliament, if he was elected. But in  order

to be a candidate, Mr Devan Nair must have his name

entered in the registers. If the registers had  been

completed in September this year, then the  name  of

Mr  Devan  Nair  would not have appeared  in  them.

Thus,  he  would  not have been able  to  stand  for

election  next  year. But if the P.A.P. extend  the

time of revision to next year say, April or June, or

even  later, it will facilitate Mr Devan Nair,  who

has no qualifications, to stand for election - coming

in by the back door. If this is so, then they should

be ashamed of what they want to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to remind the House that the one-man-one-vote system should be carried out in a fair, impartial and democratic manner. If it is just for the sake of the P.A.P.'s interests, if they can revise the electoral registers according to their whims and fancies, or to extend the time of

revision   of   the  registers,  then  parliamentary

democracy will have no meaning, and is turned into a

dictatorship. The one-man-one-vote system  has  been

abused by the P.A.P., that is to say, they make  use

of  this  system, through the powers  of  the  State

machinery  and propaganda machinery,  to  carry  out

unreasonable elections. The P.A.P. have been talking

of  democracy all the time, and so we hope that they

do not undermine or destroy democracy.



<br><br>7.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of

section  15  of  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance is to ensure a clean, fair and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



honest  election  within the  democratic  framework.

This  section  compels the Government  to  have  the

register  ready by the 15th of September each  year,

or,  at  the  latest, the 31st of December  of  that

particular year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we are having this perennial affair

appearing  so often of the Government's  attempt  to

circumvent section 15 of the Elections Ordinance, so

that  the  electoral register of each  year  can  be

delayed  for a maximum period of 12 months. If  this

Singapore  Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary

Provisions)  (No. 2) Bill is passed, the  Government

can  have  the 1963 register ready not  by  15th  of

September. 1963, but by the 31st of December, 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the amendment Bill enables the

Government to complete the register in whatever  way

they  like. They can complete it before the 30th  of

April, 1964, or before the 31st of December, 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the two reasons given by the

Deputy  Prime Minister are not very convincing.  The

first  reason he gave was that because there  was  a

postponement  last  year,  there   has   to   be   a

postponement this year. Next year we shall  have  to

postpone  again and we will postpone every  year.  I

suggest   in  that  case,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   the

Government  should be bold, come forward and  delete

section 15 (1)  of the Elections Ordinance, in  which

case  the  Government will have the full liberty  to

complete  the  electoral register  at  any  time  it

chooses.  They can have the 1963 register  completed

by 1965, 1966 or 1967. There is no time limit ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Are you suggesting an

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes. Then it will not be so

embarrassing, Sir, for the Government  to  bring  up

every now and then a Temporary Provisions Bill  each

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with this cat and mouse democracy, we

see  the  Government every now and then bringing

in Temporary Provisions Ordinances.  The  second

reason given by the Government  is  not very

convincing either,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



because   although  the  elections  were   held   in

September, the Government have completed  its  first

part of the revision - they have asked for claims and

objections  and  returns to be made and  these  have

been done. As far as I know, it will only take a few

more months to complete. If the Government is really

short  of  staff in the Printing Office  or  in  the

Elections  Office - which I doubt very much  - it  can

ask  for  an  extension of one or  two  months  till

February  or March, but they should not ask  for  an

extension until the 31st of December, 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, many people give many reasons for the Government's postponement each year. Some people say the Government can juggle with electoral registers by putting in names of people who do not stay in the particular constituencies. Some people say the Government want to postpone certain by-elections,

particularly  the  by-election  in  Moulmein.   Many

reasons  are  given, but I do not know  the  genuine

intentions of the Government in having this type  of

Temporary Provisions Bill brought up every  year  in

this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I think I have to

emphasise that the staff in the Elections Department

have  a backlog of work this year. They had not only

to  revise the registers for 1962, but, at the  same

time,  they had to do a similar job for 1963.  Under

normal  circumstances,  they  would  probably   have

completed their task. But, as I have stated earlier,

on   account  of  the  general  elections  held   in

September,  the crucial month of the year,  most  of

the  staff,  who would normally be engaged  on  this

work,   were  turned  towards  running  the  general

election itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention that we should

deliberately   defer  or  delay  revision   of   the

registers. Human capacity is limited and, therefore,

we  have  to consider this when taking into  account

when  the  revision would be completed. In fact,  in

the  Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, which

the Member for Hong Lim quoted just now, there was a

specific clause which provides for any undue  delays

that might occur in revision.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong was talking about Mr Devan

Nair  -  I  think  Mrs Devan Nair was  quite  frank

during  the general elections about her standing  in

Moulmein  in  place of her husband.  It  was  not  a

secret  at  all. It was publicly stated  that  at  a

suitable date in the future, she would give  way  to

her  husband and when that happens there  would,  of

course,  be a by-election in Moulmein. There  is  no

secret  about that. That fact was made known  during

the  general  elections. It is obvious that  if  Mr

Devan  Nair's name is not on the electoral register,

no  by-election will be held in Moulmein. I  do  not

know  why the Member for Jurong is making great play

over  that,  as  if it were a secret which  we  were

hiding away from people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Jurong that the system

of  one-man-one-vote must, as far  as  possible,  be

maintained.  It  is because we have  maintained  the

democratic system of one-man-one-vote, that  is  why

the  Barisan Sosialis lost in the Referendum and  in

the general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we give the opportunity to the people

in   Singapore  to  express  their  support  for   a

candidate  or  for  a political Party  by  a  secret

ballot,  I do not believe that the Barisan  Sosialis

will ever win at all. From outward appearances, when

the Barisan Sosialis regimented several hundreds  of

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



supporters to attend mass meetings in their campaign

during the general elections, one would have thought

that they were going to win the general elections. I

think   the   people  of  Singapore  now   are   too

sophisticated   to   be  taken   in   by   such   an

advertisement.   Neither  did  their   attempts   at

bringing in hundreds of their supporters to  certain

constituencies  during  the  general  elections   to

canvass for their candidates help them at all.  Such

intimidation will not work as long as the electorate

can express their will in secret by the ballot box.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just dismiss the Member for Hong

Lim's  insinuation  that we are  fiddling  with  the

registers  so that we can include names  of  people,

who  do  not  exist,  in certain constituencies.  He

should  have thought better before he uttered  these

remarks.  There are always petitions  which  can  be

made  and  it will be very foolish for a government,

or,  for that matter, anybody to try to fiddle  with

the electoral registers.
