<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>POLITICAL NEPOTISM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Appointment of Commission of Inquiry)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

when  will  the Commission of Inquiry on  Political

Nepotism be appointed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer the

Member  for  Anson to my answer to the question  of

his  on the 15th of January. I stated then that  it

would not be possible at any one time to have  more

than  one  High Court Judge available to conduct  a

Commission  of  Inquiry.  It  is  the  Government's

intention  to proceed with the first Commission  of

Inquiry  as  soon as a Judge is available.  I  have

been  informed by the Chief Justice  that  a  Judge

will  be available towards the end of March or  the

beginning of April when another Judge On leave will

be  returning. Then the first Commission asked  for

by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 4</b></font><br><br>



Member for Anson will be set up to inquire into the

Secondary  IV  Examination boycott by some  Chinese

Middle  School students, and to determine  to  what

extent  it  was  brought about by  exploitation  of

students   by  Communists  and  their  open   front

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, and less important inquiry, is to

investigate  the events which developed  into  open

insubordination  and  defiance  of  the  Board   of

Management  by some 130 out of 480 workers  of  the

People's   Association,  and   to   establish   the

connection between these persons and their  leaders

who  are  members of the Barisan Sosialis  who  had

been on the Board of Management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third Commission is to inquire into all

specific  allegations  of  political  nepotism  and

improper  political  interference  with  the  Civil

Service and employees of Statutory bodies,  and  to

make recommendations provided that all Members  who

have voiced these allegations in the Assembly would

undertake  to repeat these allegations  before  the

Commission and to give evidence of such allegations

on oath or affirmation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Commission will be set up as soon as a

Commission  on  the  first  and  second  have  been

completed. The terms of reference will include,  in

the  terms  of the motions passed by this Assembly.

all  specific allegations made by Members  of  this

Assembly in the course of that debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Secretary has written to all the Members who

spoke  on  the debate asking them to indicate  what

allegations they have made which they would wish to

have included in the terms of reference. So far  no

replies  have  been received except  one  from  the

Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson appeared to have

misunderstood  the purport of the  letter  from  my

Secretary  inviting him to mark out any or  all  of

the  specific  allegations made in  his  speech  on

which  he would give or tender evidence before  the

Commission so that these specific allegations could

be  included in the terms of reference. The  Member

for Anson wrote in his reply that it was for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



the  Commission to decide what the procedure should

be. It is the duty of the Government, in accordance

with  the  motion  passed in  this  Assembly,  with

Members of the Barisan Sosialis voting against  and

the  Member for Anson abstaining, to determine what

the  terms  of reference of this Commission  should

be.  Such  terms  of reference  must  set  out  the

specific allegations that have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that the Members concerned will

indicate  what specific allegations they have  made

which they are going to give evidence upon so  that

they could be included in the terms of reference.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do

I  understand from the Prime Minister then that the

Commission  will  not investigate  any  allegations

from the public or any allegations other than those

which were made in this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I

have stated the position. The motion was as drafted

in this Assembly and passed in this Assembly. It is

now  the  duty  of the government to implement  the

terms  of  the motion as set out in that particular

debate. It is as simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, the

motion  that  was  passed  was  a  motion  of   the

Government,  and  it  spoke  of  investigation   of

specific  allegations. There  was  no  question  of

investigation of specific allegations of Members of

the  Assembly. The question I am asking the  Pr  me

Minister  is  whether it is Government's  intention

under   the   terms   of   reference   to   exclude

investigation of specific allegations of corruption

or improper conduct or nepotism which may come from

the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, this was the point which

the  Member for Farrer Park made in the  course  of

the debate. It was taken then because in the course

of  the  debate anybody could voice any allegation,

and any allegation voiced by a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



Member  in  this Chamber would have to be  repeated

before the Commission. I am asking Members of  this

House  who have made their allegations to mark  out

those  passages in order that they be  included  in

the terms of reference.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Only one more question. Sir. It

does not arise out of the original question, but it

was  mentioned  by  the  Prime  Minister.  I  would

inquire  whether the second Commission  he  has  in

mind  with  reference  to the People's  Association

would not incorporate in its terms of reference  an

investigation  into  the  political  activity   and

affiliation of the employees of the Association.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There was considerable debate

on  this  point, if I remember. I am speaking  from

memory now. In my reply to this particular question

put by the Member for Anson, I dealt with the three

points that arose. I think it was made quite  clear

that if there was to be a Commission of Inquiry, as

was  suggested by the Opposition - sorry, not by  the

Barisan  Sosialis  but  by the  Member  for  Anson,

because  I  do not think the Barisan Sosialis  were

ever very keen on a Commission of Inquiry - it was to

be  an inquiry into the acts of insubordination  of

the  130 persons involved and their connection with

the  Barisan  Sosialis. Those records  are  in  the

Hansard, and they hear witness to what transpired.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If I can satisfy the Prime Minister

that,  in fact, the issue sought by certain Members

on this side of the House was an investigation into

the   political  membership  and  activity  of  the

People's    Association,    would    he    consider

incorporating that as one of the terms of reference

of that second Commission?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If the Member for Anson can

persuade me that any Member on this side of the

House has made such a proposal or agreed to such a

proposal, I will certainly do so. I will stand by

what has transpired in the debate, whatever has

been affirmed to and assented to by this side of

the House.

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS ASSISTING GOVERNMENT ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether    he   would   indicate   who   are    the

Constitutional  lawyers assisting  Government  with

reference to the proposed constitutional changes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have been informed by

the  State  Advocate-General that he  has  been  in

communication  with  the  Vice-Chancellor  of   the

University  of  Cambridge, Dr Ivor  Jennings,  and

with Professor Wade and Professor Hood Phillips.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Are we to understand that, in fact,

nobody  has  yet  been  appointed  to  assist   the

Government in these matters?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, as I have indicated in

my reply to the last question, there is no question

of  appointing anybody to, as the word goes, assist

the  Government  in these matters. When  there  are

matters  of  constitutional difficulty  arising  in

which the State Advocate-General considers that  he

requires expert advice, he has this panel to advise

him.  But  it  is  the duty of the State  Advocate-General's  Chambers - persons properly qualified  and

constituted   to   discharge   their   duties   and

functions - to  carry  out  the  necessary  statutory

amendments which will he required.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, if you will permit me

the  Prime Minister informed this House on the 23rd

January  that  the  State Advocate-General  was  in

correspondence  with  Constitutional   lawyers   of

considerable  experience who would be helping  him,

and  was  offering  a contract to  a  Parliamentary

draftsman to assist in the work of drafting.  Would

the Prime Minister inform us whether there has been

any progress on those two aspects?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is exactly the point.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir. Had the Member for  Anson  been

kind enough to refer to or refreshed his memory  on

what was stated, he would have saved us this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



unnecessary straying away from the point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two specific matters. One was legal

advice, and I have named the persons with whom  the

State Advocate-General has been in touch. The other

is  the  question  of  appointing  a  Parliamentary

draftsman  to  do  the  actual  work  of  drafting.

Without   having  to  mention  the  name   of   the

draftsman,  I  would  like to  add  that  what  has

happened   now   is   that  the  Attorney-General's

Chambers in Kuala Lumpur has decided to engage this

person under contract instead of the State Advocate-General's Chambers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Parliamentary draftsman of some experience

was offered a contract by the Singapore Government,

and   I   think   he   was  also  offered,   either

simultaneously or subsequently, a contract  by  the

Federation  Government. As I  understand  from  the

Attorney-General in the Federation, he has accepted

the contract offered by the Federation Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Forgive me, Sir, do I understand

that  the position is this: that in respect of  the

proposed  constitution,  the  only  assistance  the

Government  of  Singapore  will  have  will  be   a

question of reference by the State Advocate-General

to   the  Constitutional  lawyers  named,  of   the

proposed sections and parts of the Constitution  on

which  he  will  be  seeking advice?  Is  that  the

position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The assumption made by the

Member for Anson is that our State Advocate-General

and  his  staff  are somehow inadequate  for  their

duties  and  that, therefore, somebody  who  really

knows  all  about constitutional matters should  be

there  to assist or to be really in charge of these

duties. As I see the task before us, it is somewhat

different  from  the experience of the  Member  for

Anson. He decided in his own wisdom in 1956 to take

an  All-Party mission to London of some 13  Members

of this Assembly. Whether or not it was the unlucky

choice of numbers or for any other reason, the fact

that  the  Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge  University

who  is  now  in  touch  with the  State  Advocate-General, was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



also  there  to advise him on the Constitution  did

not  help  him to succeed. Because it was  not  the

business of the Constitutional lawyer to settle the

Constitution. Constitutions are made by people  who

are  supposed  to know what is good for  their  own

country.  And we have reached basic agreement  with

the    Federation    as   to   the   constitutional

arrangements   with   the   Federation.   And   the

Constitutional  lawyer comes in insofar  as  he  is

able to give effect to the intentions expressed  by

the  two  Governments. He is not there to  try  and

create  a  constitution. He is there  to  implement

one.  And  insofar  as  the State  Advocate-General

feels  that  he  requires  advice  in  respect   of

implementation of details, then he will  seek  that

advice.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE HARBOUR BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FIREMEN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Conditions of Service)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister to

indicate  (a) the average hours of work of  firemen

employed  by  the  Singapore  Harbour  Board;   (b)

whether  these  firemen  are  required  to  perform

duties other than fire-fighting duties; and (c) how

do  these conditions of service compare with  those

of  firemen in other fire-fighting services in  the

State.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I propose to run briefly

through the conditions of service, but I will  also

table it for the information of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average hours -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the answer is lengthy, the

Prime Minister is perfectly at liberty to say  that

he  will  circulate  the  answer  in  the  Official

Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will summarise the oral

reply  to  give the Member for Anson an opportunity

to ask any further supplementary questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the average hours of work a week of firemen

employed  by  the Singapore Harbour  Board  are  as

follows:-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those on day duty-62 hours, in addition to

which the men are required to be on stand-by for 28

hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those on night shift-42 hours, in addition to

which the men are required to be on stand-by for 36

hours.



<br><br>Firemen work alternative shifts each week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the normal fire-fighting duties,

the  Harbour  Board  firemen  also  carry  out  the

following preventive duties:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Salvage - operation of pumps, etc, when a vessel

is in danger of sinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Fire Watch - watch duty on board a vessel with

dangerous cargo (e.g, chemicals).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)Watch Duty - watch duty on board ship when

burning or welding operations are in progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Oil Service - connect and disconnect pipes used

in bunker or vegetable oil operations. Firemen

working on this service are relieved of fire-fighting and other duties and work an 8-hour day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of comparison -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Firemen in the Singapore Fire Brigade work 56

to   60  hours  a  week,  the  actual  hours  being

dependent  upon the operation of the  rota  system,

whilst  those in the Airport Fire Service  work  an

average of 60 hours a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Firemen in the Singapore Fire Brigade

perform  the following duties in addition to  fire-fighting duties:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Rescue work in cases of jammed lifts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) When the exigencies of the service permit, the

firemen carry out other duties for members of the

public on payment of a fee to the City Council,

such as filling a swimming pool or covering a fire

scene for a film. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



fees collected are not paid to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Off-duty firemen are sent to do fire-watching duties at cinemas and at other

public  places of entertainment where  it  is

considered  necessary that a  firemen  should

be  in  attendance. A fee of $3/- is  charged

for  each  duty  period of 2  hours  or  part

thereof.  Half  of this fee is  paid  to  the

firemen  carrying out such work  on  off-duty

hours.



<br><br>Firemen  in  the Airport Fire Service also  perform

preventive  duties  such as attending  refuellings,

spillages  (washing  of apron  of  such  spillage),

defuellings,  fuel  flow tests,  training  flights,

disposal of waste oil, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is the Prime Minister aware, from

the figures he has given, that with a day shift  of

90  hours  a week and a night shift of 78  hours  a

week,  the  Harbour Board Firemen  do  not  have  a

single  day's holiday in the week at all?  Does  he

consider  that  appropriate, or would  he  consider

seeking an amelioration of those conditions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> These are matters which are

looked   after  by  the  union.  My  own   personal

experience  is  that the firemen set  out  to  form

their  own union sometime in 1956/1957 when a group

of them broke away from the Singapore Harbour Board

Staff  Association. It is now a matter  for  debate

whether   the   Singapore   Harbour   Board   Staff

Association  or some other union which they  formed

represents  the majority of the men.  But  whatever

the position is, I would say that this is a subject

matter  for  negotiation, and  not  for  the  Prime

Minister   really  to  apply  his  mind   to   each

particular  case  to  see whether  it  is  just  or

unjust. I would like to point out, however, that 28

hours  out of the 90 hours in the day shift and  36

hours  out  of the 78 hours in the night shift  are

stand-by duties, which means that a man should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



available in case there is an emergency.  In  other

words, if he is going to a cinema, he should inform

his  family where he could be found. If he is going

to  visit an ailing aunt, he should make sure  that

somebody at home knows where the ailing aunt lives,

and so on. If he is out with a guitar serenading by

the  quay-side,  similarly it is expected  that  he

will  inform his friends where he can be  found  if

needed for his other arduous duties. But everything

said  and done, what I would suggest as appropriate

in   this  case  is  that  if  the  men  feel  that

conditions  are too onerous, they have a union - they

have two in fact - and representations can be made to

the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do I understand from the Prime

Minister,  who  is in charge of the  Ministry  into

which   the   Harbour   Board   comes,   that   the

representations should be made to him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Anson

understands wrongly. I am not the employer  of  the

men.  The employer is the Singapore Harbour  Board.

There  is  a  Chairman, there is  a  Board.  It  so

happens  that  for ministerial purposes,  it  comes

under my portfolio. But I think that the Member for

Anson  will  appreciate that if I  were  to  be  in

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT POLICY ON "MASS GRAVES"</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF PEOPLE MASSACRED BY JAPANESE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  the  Government  has  adopted  any  policy

regarding  the reported discovery by the  Singapore

Chinese Chamber of Commerce of the "mass graves" of

people  said to have been massacred by the Japanese

in early 1942.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, questions of

war    reparation,   including   compensation   for

atrocities  and war damage, were the responsibility

of the United Kingdom Government who in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



1951  signed  a  treaty of peace  with  Japan.  The

Government  has  written  to  the  U.K.  Commission

asking  the  U.K. Government to take up the  matter

with  the  Government of Japan to seek  amends  and

atonement for the atrocities that they committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.K. Commission has referred the matter to

London  and sought further information  as  to  the

scale  of  the  present discovery of  the  intended

remains.  They have enquired whether the number  of

the  persons involved may run to several  thousands

or  something  much less. They would like  to  know

whether  this evidence is related to some  hitherto

unrealised atrocities or of one already known.  The

U.K.  Commission  wrote to say that  they  believed

that  this recent discovery is evidence not  of  an

atrocity  as yet unknown but is connected with  the

massacres that had taken place, and were  known  to

have  taken place, though the actual sites  of  the

graves may not have been known in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no reliable figures as to the total

number  of  persons  who  were  massacred  by   the

Japanese  invading forces in 1942.  Some  estimates

put  the figure around 10,000, and some much  more,

but  certainly thousands of families  have  beloved

ones  who  were missed shortly after  the  Japanese

invasion.   All  of  them  were  taken  away   from

screening  camps and were never heard  of  or  seen

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may be difficult to ascertain the actual

identity  of the persons who had been massacred  or

their   immediate  dependents  and   families   for

compensation to be made direct, there is  no  doubt

that  the people of Singapore, as a whole, suffered

by  these  massacres. It is our view that atonement

should   be   made  to  the  people  of   Singapore

collectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also considering the

acquisition of the site where these bones have been

discovered in order that a suitable memorial can be

put  up  in,  memory  of  the  men  who  have  been

massacred. If the area is suitable, a green belt to

provide for a small park may also be designated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Japanese Government

refuses to compensate for this reasonable request,

then what steps will the Singapore Government take

in the matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I need only

point  out that foreign affairs is in the hands  of

the British until independence through merger. I am

quite sure the Barisan Sosialis now understands how

stupid    the   proposal   was   that   the    next

constitutional step for Singapore was full internal

self-government with foreign -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid that answer is

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just

go  on? I was on the point of going to the meat  of

question.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister for Finance was

recently  in Tokyo. He was there in all anxiety  to

foster   good   relationship  with   the   Japanese

Government and Japanese industrialists. May  I  ask

the  Prime Minister whether he did make use of  the

opportunity  just to sound the Japanese  Government

about the cry of the people of Singapore when those

bones were exhumed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not wish to prejudice

private  conversations on this matter, but I  would

like to say that the Japanese officials who were in

contact with our officials and who happened to have

been in Singapore previously fully appreciated  the

feelings on this matter. I think they may  be  more

than  prepared  to  make  some  atonement  for  the

atrocities that had been committed.

<div align="center"><b>NEW POWER STATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister

(a)  whether  Government intends to  build  another

power    station   in   view   of   the    proposed

industrialization, and (b) whether  he  would  name

the site of the station.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would refer the Member

for  Mountbatten to my reply to her colleague,  the

Member for Tanglin, at the sitting of this House on

15th January, 1962, when he expressed his fears  of

future blackouts. I then said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A new power station to meet the needs of

industrial  expansion is also  being  built  and  a

World  Bank  loan  is being sought  for  this.  The

consultants  for  this  project  are   already   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Phase of the new station is for plant

capable  of  generating 60 M.W. which is  scheduled

for commission in 1965. With these developments, it

is  not  expected  that there will  be  any  sudden

shortage  of supply in the future. On the contrary,

our  total generating plant, once installed, should

enable  us  to meet our expanding needs,  including

the Jurong Industrial Development project.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new power station will be sited on land

adjacent  to  the  existing  Pasir  Panjang   Power

Station.  Consideration  is  also  being  given  to

another extension to the existing station.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it true

that if this new proposed power station is built at

Pasir Panjang, to take it to Jurong would cost over

$7 million?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Can I have the actual meaning

of  the expression "to take it to Jurong"? To  take

the  power  to  Jurong, or to take the  station  to

Jurong?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> To bring the power to Jurong,

Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would not like to embark on

minute  subsidiaries of this nature, because  I  do

not   think  the  consideration  of  the  site   is

influenced  only by the cost of laying cables  from

Pasir  Panjang  to Jurong. There  must  be  certain

other  factors,  such as proximity to  the  present

site  for management purposes and so on, which bear

heavily  on these questions. I am not in a position

to give an expert opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



on  these  things.  If the Member  for  Mountbatten

feels  that  she has been sufficiently  advised  or

briefed to question the propriety of the sitting of

the  site,  perhaps notice could be  given,  and  I

would be properly advised on the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

wonder  whether the Prime Minister is aware of  the

fact  that  there  is an oil company  next  to  the

station which has made me raise these questions. If

ever  there is a leakage of oil coming  up  to  the

surface  and  should there be a fire,  and  if  the

centralisation of this station is at Pasir Panjang,

then  the whole of Singapore, including industries,

will  not  have electricity. Has the Prime Minister

given  consideration to that fact, and having given

consideration to that fact, does he not think  that

it  would  be cheaper in the long run  to  have  an

entirely  new  station  at  Jurong - as  other   more

developed countries are doing decentralising  their

power stations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With respect to the hon.

Lady,   that   is  an  entirely  different   factor

altogether.  As  I  see it, the first  question  is

related  to  the  cost of taking power  from  Pasir

Panjang  to  Jurong. Now an additional argument  is

put  forward,  that  perhaps,  to  site  one  power

station next to another is bad, and in any case the

position  is  further  made worse  because  an  oil

company is nearby. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not in  a

position  to  answer  each of  these  questions  in

specificatio. As I have said, if she will put  them

down specifically, I will give the expert's answers

to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will make this one point, Sir. Before the

oil  company was allowed at its present  site,  all

the   experts  had  been  consulted  and  all   the

necessary  rules and regulations had been  complied

with  to the satisfaction of the experts as far  as

fire  was concerned. On that score, I can, from  my

personal  recollection of what took  place  in  the

negotiations, assure the hon. Lady that there is  a

minimum of risk arising out of fire. I am in  fact,

assured by the authorities





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



concerned that the risk is not to the Pasir Panjang

Power  Station.  If  the risk  is  a  risk  to  any

important installation, it is the harbour  and  the

anchorage.

during his time, run by him and was in existence on

the register, but there were no

activities at all on the premises of the T.U.C. So,

similarly, after the split in the T.U.C.,  it  goes

back  to the same position, which means that  there

is no activity now in the T.U.C.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary is

avoiding  the question. What I say is,  if  it  was

recognised  before by the P.A.P.,  why  is  it  not

recognised now? Will he please remember that in the

Industrial Relations Ordinance, the T.U.C. is  the

body  to nominate members to the employees'  panel?

Does  he  realise that? If the T.U.C. is no  longer

recognised, then the Industrial Relations Ordinance

must be amended.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the position

will  be clarified as it develops day by day.  But,

anyway,  in  the  Industrial  Relations  Ordinance,

there  is provision too that the Minister  has  the

classification along these lines is not available.

The Income Tax Department does classify assessable

income according to source, that is to say, income

from    employment,   business   profits,   rents,

dividends,   and   so  on.  That  information   is

available  and  it  might give a  rough  order  of

magnitude  of  tax accruing from salary  and  wage

earners.  For instance, in the year of  assessment

1959, the total income assessable to tax was  $543

million  of  which $250 million was  derived  from

employment. So roughly rather less than  half  the

total  assessable income took the form of salaries

and wages.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are 482 senior officers'

and   311  are  what  are  sometimes  called   pool

quarters. Institutional quarters are quarters under

the   control   of   departments  and   Ministries.

Occupation of institutional quarters is required by

virtue  of the work performed by the officers,  for

example, hospitals, prisons and other places. There

is no problem of vacant quarters here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pool quarters are quarters formerly occupied by

expatriate civil servants and a limited  number  of

local  civil  servants.  In  1955,  the  Government

decided that local officers should be encouraged to

own  houses and that no further quarters should  be

allocated to local senior officers. Those who  were

already  in  occupation  of  such  quarters   would

continue to do so while they remained in Government

service.  With  Malayanisation, a large  number  of

pool  quarters fell vacant and it became  necessary

to lease a number of them to members of the public.

Twenty-four such quarters were leased out in  1960.

Some  of these quarters have been vacant for  three

years or more. At present, as a result of departure

of further expatriate officers, there are 51 vacant

quarters of which 16 are being reserved for experts

and  overseas officers who will be arriving in  the

near future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



The  others  will  be let out  to  members  of  the

public.  They  are  now being  tidied  up  and  big

employers as well as members of the Consulate Corps

are  being  invited  to take  up  leases  of  these

quarters.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not know

whether  I  have missed it, but I do not think  the

Minister  has told us how long these quarters  have

been vacant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The exercise that the present

Government  took  in 1961 covered  a  fairly  large

number of quarters that have been vacant, as I have

said,  for  some three years or more.  Since  1961,

some more houses have become vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some uncertainty about exactly how many

we  can lease out to members of the public, because

the  number of experts and technicians we were then

trying  to  recruit  from  overseas  had  not  been

finalised. But now we have a pretty close  idea  of

how  many  experts and technicians we can get  from

overseas  so  that it is fairly safe now  to  lease

some  35  quarters which have been vacant. Most  of

them will be vacant perhaps for a year or so.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the

Minister  not  agree that as a result  of  the  311

houses vacant for three years -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> - the Government has lost a

great amount of rent?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, not 311 houses vacant. The

311  are what we call pool quarters, that is,  they

are  available for administrative officers  and  so

on. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think you are in occupation

of one of such quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of houses that were vacant for three

years  or  more and which were leased out  in  1960

were 24. Since then, more have fallen vacant.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

position  which indicated a considerable  waste  of

public  money, would the Minister consider  putting

on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



the   market  for  sale  those  houses  which   the

Government is quite satisfied it would not  require

for its own purposes in the future?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have been considering the

sale  of surplus Government houses for a very  long

time and I have not come to a decision yet.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister tell us whether it is true that there have

been   several   applications  from  local   senior

officers  for the use of quarters and from  various

Government   departments  for  their   departmental

purposes and that they have been refused? I  wonder

why these applications were refused in spite of the

fact that the quarters were vacant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If they have been refused, the

reason   is  that  it  is  not  suitable   to   use

residential  quarters  for  office  purposes.   The

practice,  of  course, has been to stretch  to  the

limit  the generous interpretation of this  policy.

For  instance, the Ministry of Labour has got  away

with  quite a number of applications. We agreed  to

allow the quarters along Canning Rise to be used as

offices  because  of their central  convenience  to

members of the public, but where they move off into

residential areas such as Tanglin, I think the hon.

Lady  will agree that it is quite inappropriate  to

use such houses as offices.

establishment  of  the Law Revision  Committee  has

been  referred  to the Judges and to the  Singapore

<div align="center"><b>INSANITARY CONDITIONS IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CERTAIN PARTS OF SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Health and Law whether, in regard to certain  parts

of  Singapore,  (a) he is aware of an  increase  in

flies  and  mosquitoes despite repeated  complaints

about insanitary conditions; and (b) in view of the

failure  of the present system for clearing rubbish

and  drains, he will make a statement  as  to  what

steps he proposes to take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We come back to the subject of

nuisance  mosquitoes and dirty  drains.  There  has

been  an increase of nuisance mosquitoes which  was

worse  than  during the latter  part  of  the  year

following  the strike of the City Council employees

and  consequent  chokage of  outlets  and  roadside

drains.  This  was aggravated by the unsatisfactory

arrangements  for  cleansing of  outlet  drains  to

which  reference was made at an earlier sitting  of

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no appreciable increase in the

complaints  of  flies.  About  seven  to  ten  such

complaints  were received per month and were  dealt

with.  There has been no increase in mosquito-borne

disease  or  fly-borne  disease  according  to  our

hospital  records. The Ministry  is  aware  of  the

deficiencies  in  the  previous  system   for   the

cleansing   of  outlet  drains.  These  have   been

improved, the contract system has been tightened up

with  new  specifications for the  quality  of  the

work,  and the 1962 contracts stipulate the minimum

number  of  workmen to be employed on the  job  for

each  specified area daily. Where about 40 men were

formerly  employed in cleansing outlet drains,  the

present  contract requires a total of 276  for  the

job.  In fact, the condition of most outlet  drains

in the city now has greatly improved and this state

of affairs will continue to be maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of maintaining an adequate refuse

disposal  system, orders have been  placed  in  the

last  nine  months  for  14 new  vehicles  for  the

transport  of  refuse. Of these,  4  vehicles  have

already  been delivered. The Ministry has  recently

decided  to  call for tenders for  the  removal  by

contract of refuse in specified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



areas,  in  specified  bin  centres  and  from  bin

centres  of  the  Housing and  Development  Board's

estates  with  a  view to relieving the  increasing

pressure on the maintenance and extension  of  this

service. There are 16 checkers in the city area and

a  mobile  squad of 14 men for the rural  areas  to

check  on  mosquito-breeding,. Breeding of nuisance

mosquitoes  in  canals,  drains  and  other  places

subject  to  public  cleansing  has  received  full

attention. Education of hawkers and the public  has

been  carried out in connection with the prevention

of  nuisance mosquito-breeding in affected areas by

field staff on their rounds. Radio publicity in all

languages  has  been effected.  The  prevention  of

mosquito-breeding  and fly-breeding  will  require,

besides  positive  measures by  the  Ministry,  the

active  co-operation of hawkers,  householders  and

other  members of the public. All measures to  deal

with the situation are being taken and the position

has materially improved recently.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

whether  the Minister is aware that in some  places

especially  outside  markets  there  are  piles  of

rubbish  six feet high sometimes. I wonder  whether

he  can  assure  us that these will be  dealt  with

immediately  under  the  new  arrangements.  May  I

state,  Sir,  that these are in the most  congested

areas which can least afford such rubbish?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must pass a remark. The

hon. Lady is very fond of bringing in matters which

are  completely  extraneous  and  might  excite   a

debate.  Supplementary questions must be short  and

to the point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, improvements have been

made  in the cleansing service. There was a lot  of

backlog  to be cleared up after the recent  strike

and   recent  enquiries  have  disclosed  that  the

situation has improved considerably.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total

cost  for Malaysia Week, including the cost of  the

exhibition, the cost of "Malam Malaysia",  posters,

decorations,  bunting,  flags,  and  so   on, was

approximately $115,000.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are on Question No. 14. Is

the Minister electing to answer Question No. 15  as

well?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, if the hon. Member is

referring  to  meetings of the Malaysia  Solidarity

Consultative Committee held in Singapore, then  the

expenditure   in  connection  with  the   Singapore

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

according  to what we know, the Malaysia Solidarity

Consultative  Committee has a Secretariat.  What  I

want  to ask is this: are the expenses incurred  by

the  Secretariat  to be paid by the  Government  of

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No. The expenses of the

Secretariat  are  made  the responsibility  of  the

respective Governments concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In that case

then, how much has the Singapore Government got  to

pay?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So far, I think our expenses were

about 12 tapes that we have sent to Sarawak. At the

cost of $6 a tape, they amount to $72.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  Singapore. Two of these meetings were  attended

by Members of the Barisan Sosialis. These were paid

for by the C.P.A. and the rest by the Government.

in  holding the Malaysia Week, (ii) the cost of the

Malaysia Week Exhibition, (iii) the cost of  "Malam

cost of decorations, bunting and flags.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The total cost for Malaysia Week

was  approximately $115,000, of which the cost  of

the  exhibition was $8,932. The cost of  organising

"Malam  Malaysia" was $6,175. The cost  of  posters

was  $2,570,  and  the cost of bunting,  flags  and

decorations and illuminations was $19,176. Most  of

this expenditure was for labour cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

*Question No. 16 reads as follows



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tee Kim Leng: To ask the Minister for

Culture (i) how many artistes from Brunei took

part in "Malam Malaysia"; (ii) what was the cost

of their air passages; and (iii) what was the

cost of their board and lodging during their stay

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me that possibly

it  will  be  convenient for  Question  16  to  be

answered as well now. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes. This is the answer to

Question 16. Twenty artistes from Brunei took  part

in  "Malam Malaysia". The cost of air passages  was

met entirely by the Brunei Government. In answer to

(iii),  as  regards the cost of board and  lodging,

the  visitors  stayed in Brunei House in  Singapore

without  cost; expenditure on food was met  by  the

Singapore Government, and this amounted to $923.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Minister for Culture, in reply to Question

No.   15,  said  that  "Malam  Malaysia"  Cost  the

Government about $6,000. Can the Minister tell this

House  whether the performers and artistes on  that

night volunteered their services or were they  paid

by the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No. As regards the Brunei

artistes, I have indicated that it cost us  nothing

apart  from food. As regards the artistes from  the

Federation, we  put  them  up  at  the  University

Hostel, which cost us $7 per head a day. Those were

the costs incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if - I am not quite sure but am just

recollecting - Members  opposite  have  in  mind   an

allegation that they have made elsewhere that these

artistes  were  professional people of  ill-repute,

may  I  say  that  most of the artistes  are  civil

servants,  workers, who have come here  voluntarily

to  help  celebrate Malaysia Week? I  think  it  is

unfair  to  make such an allegation  against  these

artistes  who  have come here to help us  celebrate

Malaysia Week.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, quite naturally I

appreciate  the generosity of the Brunei Government

and of the

artistes who took part in "Malam Malaysia". I would

like  to  point  out  that the  Minister  indicated

$115,000  as the overall expenses and yet  gave  us

particularisation of only about $37,000.  Could  we

know what was the balance, and a very vast balance,

of $115,000 spent on?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Certainly, Sir. I have the

breakdown figures here. I only answer questions  in

relation to the items here.

<div align="center"><b>RECRUITMENT OF POLICE INSPECTORS AND CONSTABLES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs   (i)   how  many  police  inspectors   and

constables  were recruited in 1960 and  1961;  (ii)

how  many of those recruited were Federal citizens,

and how many were Singapore citizens; and (iii) how

many rejected applicants were Singapore citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number

of  police inspectors recruited were two  in  1960,

both  of whom were Singapore citizens; nine in 1961

of whom eight were Singapore citizens and one was a

Federal citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the number of police constables recruited,

283  were  recruited  in 1960,  of  whom  242  were

Singapore citizens and 41 were Federal citizens. In

1961, 234 police constables were recruited, of whom

223  were  Singapore citizens and 11  were  Federal

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of rejected applicants who were

Singapore  citizens was 1,309 in 1960  and  669  in

1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

will   the  Minister  tell  this  House  why  those

applicants   who  were  Singapore   citizens   were

rejected, whereas those applicants who were Federal

citizens were accepted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, the applications

from  Singapore citizens were rejected because they

were  either  aver-age  or  underqualified.  I  was

informed   that   those  who  were  rejected   were

predominantly underqualified.

<div align="center"><b>OPEN-AIR CINEMAS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  (i) how many permits for Open-Air  Cinemas

were   issued  from  January  1960  to  the  latest

convenient  date; and (ii) how many  were  rejected

and the reasons for their rejection.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it

would  be misleading to speak of the actual  number

of permits or licences issued for open-air cinemas,

since  a  licence is generally valid for one  month

and,  in  the course of a year, there  will  be  12

licences   issued  in  respect  of  one  particular

cinema.  There  are also cases where  a  particular

cinema originally issued with a licence has had its

licence subsequently cancelled. I take it that  the

Member is really interested in the number of  open-air cinemas for which licences were granted and the

number  for  which licences were refused,  and,  on

this  basis,  the information for the  period  from

January 1960 to 5th March, 1962, is as follows:



 <pre>



   (a)   Number of open-air cinemas for which licences were issued                       35

   (b)   Number of open-air cinemas for which licences were refused on application       10



</pre>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

would the Minister tell us what were the reasons

for those rejections?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The reasons for the rejections

were:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Objections raised by the residents;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Unsuitability of the site chosen;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The presence of a permanent cinema within

a one-mile radius; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Secret society activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): With regard to

reason No. (iv), would it be that if we closed down

all open-air cinemas, there would not be any secret

society members around?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> From past experience, it would

appear  that  the closure of open-air  cinemas  has

reduced  considerably secret society activities  in

that particular area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  the case of other cinemas, for example, the big

cinemas, there are also some secret society members

around them. Does the Minister intend to close them

down as well?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

permanent cinemas are better situated, well lit and

better organised.

<div align="center"><b>COMPENSATION AND RESETTLEMENT SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOR RESIDENTS AFFECTED BY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TOA PAYOH SATELLITE TOWN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b> asked the Minister for

National   Development  whether  the  Housing   and

Development Board will be announcing its scheme for

compensation  and  resettlement  of  the  residents

affected   by   the   Toa  Payoh   Satellite   Town

Development Project and whether he intends to  hold

a  mass  meeting of the affected residents for  the

purpose of explaining the scheme to them in  detail

as well as ascertaining their views on the scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, Government's resettlement

policy  and compensation terms for people  who  are

resettled  are  well known to the  Member  for  Toa

Payoh, because when he was still in the P.A.P.,  he

played  an active part in explaining and supporting

the    Government's   resettlement    policy    and

compensation  scheme among Toa Payoh settlers.  The

Government, moreover, provided the Member  for  Toa

Payoh   and  officials  of  the  Country   People's

Association with copies of rates of compensation in

both English and Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, very briefly, refresh his memory as to the

terms that have been offered to the settlers of Toa

Payoh?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A settler who chooses to find his own

accommodation  is  paid compensation  for  whatever

improvements he has made to his land. But a settler

who chooses to move to a Housing Board flat is paid

no compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a hut owner, he can have in

exchange  a newly-built terrace house in  Kim  Keat

Road,   with   electricity,  water  and  sanitation

facilities.  The value of such a terrace  house  is

about $5,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a bona tide farmer he can choose

to  resettle in a farm lot of about two acres given

to  him free of charge in a resettlement area, such

as  Chua Chu Kang or Jurong, where he can carry  on

work  as  a  farmer. It costs the Government  about

$4,000 per acre to acquire and develop the land and

another  $1,000 to provide a basic  hut.  In  other

words,   a   farmer   who  is  resettled   receives

compensation  to the value of some $9,000  in  land

and hut.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also add that the resettlement policy and

compensation  scheme  have been  explained  to  the

settlers who are so affected?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme has been implemented and accepted by

1,500 families who have been resettled in the  past

two and a half years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part of the hon. Member's

question,  he can rest assured that the  Government

will  not only explain once more the scheme to  the

affected residents but also to protect them against

political adventurers who are trying to make use of

rural dwellers by creating confusion among them. We

will hold all meetings and consultations as may  be

necessary  to  help  rural  residents  solve  their

personal and practical problems. But it is not  the

policy  of  the Government to utter falsehoods  and

shout  empty political slogan's hoping  to  exploit

innocent farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it  is

true,  as  a  recent Press report  said,  that  the

Government  would carry out its development  scheme

in April?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. During Question Time, a

Minister  cannot  be  asked  whether  or  not   any

statement in the Press is correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister state whether

the  persons resettled will receive titles  to  the

terrace  houses  and the land, since  the  Minister

speaks  of compensation in the realm of $9,000  and

$5,000, including the value of the properties?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I have said that these

houses   and  the  land  will  be  given  free   as

compensation  to  the farmers or  the  hut  owners.

Obviously they will have titles to these.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

to     remind    the    Minister    for    National

Development - when debating the Budget last year,  he

said  the  Government had revised the  compensation

rates. But, as a matter of fact, the Government has

not  revised  them. May I ask the Minister  whether

the Government will consider increasing the present

rates of compensation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Choa  Chu Kang had spoken at length on this subject

during the Budget session and I had made a reply to

this.  It is typical of him to harp on the question

of  the compensation scheme not being abandoned.  I

stated  very  clearly in this Assembly  during  the

Budget   session  that  from  time  to   time   the

compensation   schemes  had   been   amended.   For

instance,  Sir, I have just mentioned that  in  Toa

Payoh  a special scheme has been improvised.  I  am

quite  sure the Member for Choa Chu Kang  will  not

find  this in the compensation scheme as published.

This  is  one of the things that from time to  time

the   Government  has  adopted  to  alleviate   the

hardships    of   certain   people    in    certain

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of Toa Payoh, a hut owner will be

given  a  house in exchange, because of his special

circumstances, for instance, bean-curd  making  and

poultry  rearing. We have stated in  the  last  few

days  that this scheme is specially improvised  for

the  special circumstances of the people living  in

Toa  Payoh.  If the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  will

refer  to  what I said in this Assembly during  the

Budget session, he will find that from time to time

the  compensation schemes have been  amended.  That

perhaps  will  stop  him from  uttering  all  these

falsehoods.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must ask the Minister to

withdraw the word "false-hoods" enunciated in  this

context,  because  obviously it  is  equivalent  to

"lies".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



He  must  withdraw the word "false-hoods" in  this

context.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> May we know from

the Minister when this compensation scheme was ever

revised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I will have to refer the Member

to the Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think the

Minister should consult his Parliamentary Secretary

whether,  in reply to a question in this House,  he

had  said  that  the  Government  had  revised  the

scheme.  But  from what we have received,  we  know

that  the  Government has not revised  any  of  the

compensation rates.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I might inform hon. Members of this

House  that  the  Member for Toa  Payoh  has  given

notice  that  he  will raise  this  matter  on  the

Adjournment. The matter might come up on Monday  if

there  is  a  sitting. That does  not,  of  course,

prevent Members from asking further questions.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES</b></div>



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly doth agree with the Committee

of Privileges in their Report as contained in Paper

L.A. 1 of 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee of Privileges has met and

considered the resolution which was moved  in  this

Assembly referring to the Committee of Privileges a

matter concerning a breach of privilege. Members of

this  House  will  remember that  on  the  29th  of

November, 1961, the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for  Education, Mr Lee Khoon  Choy,  was

obstructed   from  attending  a  sitting   of   the

Assembly.  This  matter  on  resolution  has   been

referred  to the Committee of Privileges  and  the

Committee  has  indeed  round  that  a  breach   of

privilege has been committed by those persons  who

were   guilty   of  preventing  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Education   from

attending  a  sitting  of the  Assembly  that  day.

Unfortunately,  the police has  not  been  able  to

trace  the  culprits  and,  therefore,  punishment

cannot be inflicted on these culprits. However, the

House  has already condemned the conduct of  these

hooligans  at its sitting on the 29th of  November.

The Committee of Privileges has concluded that this

case be now closed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we in the

Barisan Sosialis agree with the Report that has

been submitted to the House, but I would like to

draw the attention of the House to one fact, that

the Acting Leader of the House at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



that particular time made a highly exaggerated

report to the House about the incident. You will -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

completely  out  of order. These remarks  would  be

properly  passed at the time the incident  occurred

or  at  the  time  the Assembly  was  debating  the

resolution  proposed by the Acting  Leader  of  the

House. The Committee of Privileges merely addressed

themselves  to  the  issue  whether  or   not   the

Parliamentary  Secretary was  obstructed  from  and

insulted when coming to the Assembly, and found, in

fact,  that he was obstructed and insulted. If  the

hon.  Member for Queenstown agrees with the Report,

then,  of course, that is the end of it. But if  he

does  not  agree with that finding, then he  is  at

liberty  to move that the Report be recommitted  to

the Committee of Privileges.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek your

guidance. The Committee of Privileges has  here  in

its   Report  indicated  certain  aspects  of   the

statement made in the debate on the motion  by  the

Minister  for  Education. As I understand  it,  the

Leader of the Barisan Sosialis was seeking to  draw

your  attention to other aspects of  the  statement

which we know to be inaccurate and which were  made

during  the  debate  on  the  motion  to  which  no

reference  has  been  made  by  the  Committee   of

Privileges,  and  which, perhaps,  it  should  have

taken  into  consideration  and  made  findings  in

respect   thereof.  Is  that  not  an   appropriate

procedure, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I have indicated, if any hon.

Member considers that that aspect of the matter  is

relevant  to the issue itself, then, of course,  he

might  now  argue that the Committee of  Privileges

might  have  come  to a different  conclusion.  The

Member  for  Queenstown  commenced  his  speech  by

saying  that he was satisfied with the  Report,  he

agreed  with it, and therefore, by saying he agreed

with it. I cannot see how his remarks are relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, having perused the Report, I note with regret

a complete omission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



of  any  consideration  of the  allegation  by  the

Minister  for Culture that there were  300  persons

who  beleaguered the Parliamentary  Secretary,  and

also  a  further  allegation by the Prime  Minister

that  the  Minister for Education was  not  present

because  he  was beleaguered. Sir, as I  understand

it, those statements had a very considerable effect

in  persuading this side of the House to  agree  to

the  motion.  It  seems to me  that  those  aspects

should  have been made part of the findings.  Those

aspects  which materially affected the  gravity  of

the  conduct  of  the  persons who  obstructed  the

Parliamentary Secretary should have been  commented

on  and their accuracy or otherwise considered  for

purposes of report to this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must make it quite

clear  that the duty of the Committee of Privileges

is  to  find whether or not there has been a breach

of  privilege. The remarks passed by the Member for

Anson  are  remarks,  as I have  indicated  to  the

Member  for  Queenstown, which could properly  have

been  passed when the motion which was set  out  in

paragraph 2 of the Report was being debated in  the

House.  Now,  we  have reached a  stage  where  the

Committee  of Privileges on an issue of  breach  of

privilege  has  made a finding. If Members  do  not

agree  that that finding is correct, then they  are

at  liberty to move reference hack to the Committee

of Privileges.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, the motion to which you refer

on page 1 was in all goad faith passed by this side

of  the  House.  We voted in the  belief  that  the

statements  made  by  responsible  Ministers   were

correct. We had no information at that stage.  What

I  would  like to ascertain now is, would reference

back  to  the  Committee of Privileges raise  these

matters  at all, or is it merely an issue  of:  Was

the  individual  concerned,  in  fact,  obstructed?

Because whether he was obstructed was conduct  that

was really grave conduct - 300 pickets - or whether  it

was  a  passing matter, does have a certain  effect

upon our minds here. The result is the same. It  is

true,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



as  you  say, Sir, the finding will be that he  was

obstructed,   but   the   circumstances   of    the

obstruction surely are part of the Report which the

Committee of Privileges should return.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To cut this matter short, the hon.

Member for Anson is at liberty to file a notice  of

motion rescinding the resolution of the House taken

as  shown in paragraph 2 of the Report. That is the

procedure.  If hon. Members are not satisfied  that

the  resolution  taken by this House  was  properly

arrived at, then the remedy is to move that  it  be

rescinded.  But  the  Report of  the  Committee  of

Privileges  still remains, that is,  on  the  issue

whether  or  not there was obstruction and  whether

there  was  insult. The Committee has  found  that

there  was  obstruction and there was insult,  and,

therefore,  it  was  a  breach  of  privilege,  and

recommends  that this House take no further  action

for  the reasons given. No other Member wishing  to

speak? Dr Toh?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly doth agree with the Committee

of Privileges in their Report as contained in Paper

L.A. 1 of 1962.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of this amending Bill has

three  main purposes. These are, firstly,  to  make

the  Defence Forces Record Officer, instead of  the

Commandant,  Singapore Military Forces, responsible

for all matters pertaining to reservists; secondly,

to provide for the enlistment of youths between the

ages  of  14 and 17 years as drummer boys and  band

boys;  and thirdly, to establish a benevolent  fund

for   regular  member  of  the  Singapore  Military

Forces.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the provisions of section 12

of  the  Ordinance, the executive  command  of  all

members  of  the Singapore Military  Forces  is  at

present   invested  in  the  Commandant,  Singapore

Military  Forces.  These  members  consist  of  two

categories  of personnel. They are (a) regulars  on

"army   service"  and  volunteers   doing   "colour

training"  service on the one hand, and  (b)  those

regulars  and  volunteers who have completed  their

service  of  active  service and  are  not  on  the

reserve  on  the  other.  Whereas  the  Commandant,

Singapore Military Forces, is the correct authority

to  exercise command over all serving regulars  and

volunteers,  the authority responsible for  dealing

with  all  matters pertaining to reservists  should

properly be the Officer in Charge of Records as  in

the  British Army. In the case of the local forces,

the officers holding the appointment of Officer  in

Charge  of  Records  is called the  Defence  Forces

Record Officer. This officer's duties in connection

with  reservists  include,  amongst  other  things,

looking  after  their past records of  service  and

recording  their  up-to-date  addresses;  the   re-engagement  of  a  soldier  (about  to  go  on  the

reserve) for further "army service" if regulars, or

for   further   "colour   training"   service    if

volunteers;  transferring  a  reservist  from   the

reserve  to  the active list; granting a  reservist

permission  to leave the State up to  a  period  of

two'  years; permitting a reservist to wear uniform

on  special  occasions,  etc.  The  Defence  Forces

Record  Officer  is  also  responsible  for  paying

pensions  to retired service personnel and  is  the

"Pensions  Authority"  under  the  Personal  Injury

(Civilians)  Scheme, 1941, for paying  pensions  to

war widows and dependants and for paying disability

pensions to disabled service personnel. In order to

place reservists under his control, an amendment is

required  to section 12 of the Ordinance.  This  is

what clause 4 seeks to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 12 of the Ordinance will

entail  consequential  amendments  to  section   2,

subsection  (1)  of  section 11,  section  42,  and

subsection (1) of section 43 of the Ordinance so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



as  to make provision for the Defence Forces Record

Officer  to take over the duties formerly performed

by  the  Commandant, Singapore Military Forces,  in

connection   with  reservists  These  consequential

amendments are covered by clauses 2, 6, 7 and 8  of

the   Bill.  These  amendments  will  also   entail

consequential amendments to the Singapore  Military

Forces   (Reserve)  Rules,  1957.  These  will   be

effected later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Defence Forces Record Officer has since

1st  September, 1960, been carrying out the  duties

already referred to in connection with reservists,

it  is  necessary to give retrospective  effect  to

this  by  ante-dating the Bill  to  1st  September,

1960. This is what clause I seeks to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 40 of the Ordinance to

allow  for the change of designation of the Officer

in  Charge  Records from his former designation  of

"Officer  in  Charge Forces Record" to his  present

designation  of  "Defence Forces  Record  Officer".

This amendment has already been incorporated in the

Schedule  to  the Departmental Titles  (Alteration)

Ordinance,  and the opportunity is therefore  being

taken  in  this  amending Bill to  make  a  similar

amendment   to   the  Singapore   Military   Forces

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 10 of the Ordinance to

allow  for the enlistment of drummer boys and  band

boys between the ages of 14 and 17 years since  the

present  provisions of the Ordinance  provide  only

for  the enlistment of those who have attained  the

age  of 18 years. The intention in recruiting  such

boys  is  to  ensure  that the  Singapore  Military

Forces  Staff  Band  will have a  regular  flow  of

trained  musicians available to take the places  of

those  bandsmen who will leave the  band  when  the

latter's  seven  years'  active  service  is  over.

Nearly  all  the present 60 bandsmen  and  drummers

were  recruited in 1958 within six months  of  each

other, which means that all of them will be due  to

go  on the reserve about the same time. It is hoped

that  at  least some of them will want to re-engage

for  a  further  period of active  service  but  we

cannot be sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



of   that   in   advance.  A  similar  system   for

maintaining  a steady flow of trained musicians  is

adopted  in the British Army. In 1954, it was  also

the  scheme in force in the Singapore Police  Force

Band.  Band boys and drummer boys of the  Singapore

Military Forces will be .governed by special  terms

of  service and be paid special rates of pay, which

will  be incorporated in consequential rules  based

on this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 provides for a new section with the

object  of  establishing  a  benevolent  fund   for

regular  members of the Singapore Military  Forces.

By  virtue of the rules of the Singapore Government

cooperative  Thrift and Loan Society, which  limits

its  membership  to  permanent  civil  servants  of

Government  only,  regular members  of  the  forces

cannot  join that Society. Nor can members  of  the

forces benefit from the Ex-Servicemen's Association

in  Singapore unless they have taken part in either

World  War I or World War II. Very few, if any,  of

the  present regular members of the forces have  so

served. There is therefore no association or thrift

society to which members of the forces can turn for

financial assistance in a domestic crisis,  or  for

other deserving purposes, unless a special fund  is

created  for that purpose. The creation of  such  a

fund  is  what  clause 9 seeks to do. Consequential

rules  will  lay down the conditions governing  the

operation of this fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> From what the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs   has  said,  it  would  appear  that   the

Government,  particularly  the  Ministry  of   Home

Affairs, have been acting ultra vires the  law  for

more   than  one  and  half  years  and  that   the

appointment  of  the Defence Forces Record  Officer

was  made on 1st September. 1960. It is only  after

l�  years have elapsed that the Government came  to

this House for powers to make that appointment  and

subsequently to ante-date the amendment made to the

Bill today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that such action on the part of the

Government can only be described as high-handed and

that   it  is  typical  of  the  fashion   of   the

dictatorial behaviour of the Government. We on this

side of the House would urge the Government not  to

repeat the same mistakes in future, if at all  they

would  admit  that this is a mistake.  Perhaps  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  will  give  us an assurance  that  similar

oversights  or  errors will  not  be  made  in  the

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I listened with

delight  to  the  stream of language  which  poured

forth  from the Parliamentary Secretary at a  speed

of reading to which I am not always equal and which

prevented me from completely understanding him. But

I  would say this, Sir, he asks us in a great  deal

of  technical  jargon to approve something  because

the  British  Army does it. Well, I  have  a  great

regard  for  the British Army and I have  no  doubt

that  what it does it has good reasons for. But  to

me  it  is not adequate that we should do something

just  because the British Army does it.  Surely  we

have  our own problems. I would like to know, apart

from the fact that we are copying the British Army,

whether  there  is  any  reason  at  all  why   the

Commandant of the Forces should not be in charge of

reservists.  Instead we have to  create  a  special

post, a gentleman to be known as the Defence Forces

Record  Officer, and we would like to know  whether

this officer is being paid more for being in charge

of  reservists  than himself as Officer  in  Charge

Forces Record, which was his previous title; and if

so,  since  when has this additional  payment  been

made?  Has it been made since 1st September,  1960?

Have  we  been  for  1� years making  payments  not

authorised  by  this  Assembly?  If  that  is   the

position,   then  at  least  elementary   frankness

requires that we should be told the truth. I do ask

that the Parliamentary Secretary put away his brief

and  tell us if he knows what really is the  reason

for  the change of title, what is the cost  in  the

change of title and the cost incurred by the change

of  status, and why it is necessary that we  should

remove the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



Commandant  of  the  Forces  from  command  of  the

reservists  and  put in his place  this  gentleman.

What exactly is behind all these manoeuvres? It may

be  that  they are perfectly legitimate. I just  do

not  like  the  sound  of them  because  I  do  not

understand it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have this question of the Singapore

Military Forces benevolent fund. The poor gentlemen

have  nowhere  to  turn to and  no  ex-servicemen's

association. But, Sir, if there is legitimate  need

to  care  for these persons who leave the Singapore

Military Forces, there is surely the Government and

there is the question of their own pension. In  any

event,  would the Parliamentary Secretary  indicate

who is going to make contributions to the Singapore

Military Forces benevolent fund? Is there going  to

be  a public appeal for funds? Or does he not know?

There  is  a comment, Sir, that this Bill will  not

involve  the  Government  in  any  extra  financial

expenditure. Is this a technical truth for today or

is  it  also  the truth for tomorrow? What  is  the

truth about this?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chan Chee Seng, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, with regard to

the charge made by the Member for Anson that we are

copying the British Army, this is in fact true. The

duty  of  looking  after the  reservists  has  been

carried  out  by the Defence Forces Record  Officer

since  1960, and the same procedure is  adopted  by

the Malayan Government. So we are not following the

British style.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also asked how much this

officer  is  being  paid. At the moment,  I  cannot

supply  him with the necessary details. But  if  he

wishes  it,  I  can furnish him with the  necessary

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Chan Chee Seng].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 1 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Clause 1, I take it, is the Short

title and the date of operation, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

In  those  circumstances, I would like to draw  the

attention  of  the Assembly to the  fact  that  his

operation is being ante-dated one and a half  years

for no adequate reasons at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a constitutional principle that one

does not introduce retrospective legislation except

for  the  gravest  reasons. One  does  not  lightly

embark  upon  changing the law retrospectively.  We

are   entitled  to,  and  I  do  demand,   adequate

explanation  of the reason why we should  ante-date

these amendments by one and a half years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I presume it is because

the  Defence  Forces  Record Officer  has  been  in

charge for the last one and a half years.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is  really begging the question. First,  they

commit an impropriety - I will put it no higher.  And

then   they  say  because  it  has  been  improper,

therefore,  it  is now proper to be a  second  time

improper.  If that is the only reason to be  given,

then  I should say the Minister should take a  good

look at whatever officer was responsible and should

make  him  feel ashamed of himself, as I  hope  the

Minister  feels. I for one will refuse  to  approve

this provision.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Member for Anson

has seen clause 5.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Clause 5? Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> "What is in a name" - that is the

answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 accordingly ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Explanatory

Statement  of  the  Bill,  the  second sentence states very clearly

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This will bring the executive command of the Singapore

Military Forces Reserve into  line  with that of the British Army

Reserves where the Officer in  Charge Records is also the Commanding

Officer, Reserve.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



When  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for Home Affairs was replying on the Second Reading

of  the  Bill,  he  emphatically  denied  that  the

passage  of  this Bill in this House was  connected

with  British  traditions or was in line  with  the

British  Army Service. In view of the contradictory

statements   issued,   Sir,   could   we   have   a

clarification from the Government whether this Bill

was  actually  brought in to  bring  the  Singapore

Military  Forces Reserve in line with  the  British

Army   Reserves,   or  whether  the   Parliamentary

Secretary was correct when he denied that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> To bring it in line with the

Russian Army!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, when

I  replied to the Member for Anson just now, I never

said that it  was not in line with the British Army.

I  said that  it  was in line with the Federation

Army  as well.  And  you  can even put it in line

with  the Russian  Army  or  the Chinese Army.

This  is  not something ridiculous. It is something

that fits  in with  the circumstances in Singapore,

and so we  do it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Point of order, Sir. Can

we check  the  records?  I  cannot  recall  that

the Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for

Home Affairs has ever mentioned the Federation Army

just now in his reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member

can  look  at  the Hansard when it comes out.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary

stated  in so many  words - it  is  wholly inaccurate

(he did not use the word, he  says),  it

is  absolutely inaccurate what the Member for Anson

said, that this has anything to do with the British

Army  procedure. All I want from him now is:  would

he  like  to deny that he ever made that statement?

We will check it at a later date. But I say to you,

Sir,  that  he did, in fact, say that he denied  it

totally  as  being wholly inaccurate. My suggestion

was  that the only excuse for these provisions  was

to keep in line with British Army traditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the House is aware that

the  purpose of this Bill is to place the Singapore

Military Forces Reserve under the executive command

of  the Defence Forces Record Officer. Now, Members

of  the  House  are also aware that the  Federation

Regiment  is run along certain lines,  and  we  are

also  aware  that in the future when  merger  takes

place -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Wait for it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - the Central Government will be

in  charge  of  Defence  and Foreign  Affairs,  and

therefore in charge of the Army. So it will  be  in

keeping  with that if in this Explanatory Statement

it  is quite plainly stated that certain lines  are

followed. I see no contradiction at all.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The British Army -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir, I am really astonished to hear the Member  for

Anson   getting  excited  over  the  British   Army

tradition  and, in fact, condemning the  Government

for  following an administrative pattern  which  he

believes in the tradition of the British Army.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The

allegation by the Minister is inaccurate, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The point of order is that he has

completely misconstrued me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is not a point of

order.  It  is  a  point of explanation.  The  hon.

Member for Anson will have an opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Anson's

objection  rests on the fact that we  are  imposing

the  pattern  of  the British  Army  on  our  local

forces,  and  I say this is absolutely  astonishing

coming from -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think it is time for the

Chair  to  intervene. That was not what the  Member

for Anson was alleging. His allegation was that the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  did not make a correct statement  when  he

said  that this was not modelled on British  lines.

That is all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I was referring to his

speech  on  the  Second Reading of this  Bill.  The

remarks  made  by the Parliamentary Secretary  were

consequent  on  what  he  said  during  the  Second

Reading.  As  I  have said, Sir, it  is  absolutely

astonishing for the Member for Anson to  object  to

this  Bill  on the grounds that it follows  certain

administrative procedures -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister is out of order

in  raising that point in clause 2. He should  have

raised  it  on the Second Reading. We  are  now  on

clause  2, which seeks to add to the definition  of

the word "Forces" to insert "with the exception  of

the  Singapore Military Forces Reserve  constituted

under  Part IV of this Ordinance." In other  words,

just  to  take  over command of the Forces  Reserve

from  the  Commandant and give it  to  the  Defence

Ministry. That is all there is to it in clause 2.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the debate on this clause

has ranged rather far and wide. I just want to make

an  observation based on what the Member for  Anson

said  when  clause  2  comes up  for  consideration

before  this Committee. The Member for Anson during

the  Anson by-election displayed four medals before

the electorate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must stop this trend. I am

sure  the  Minister will have another  opportunity.

Let us get on with the debate on clause 2.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You were then a member of the

British Army!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 5 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to quote

Shakespeare to the Prime Minister or his colleagues

would be wasting pearls. But I would ask, Sir, just

what  is  the purpose of this which seems to  reach

the stage of a farce? We want to change "Officer in

charge  Forces  Records" to "Defence Forces  Record

Officer",  and  it requires a whole  section.  Why?

What   is  the  meaning  of  this  absurdity,  this

pantomine?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for Anson is surely familiar with the functions  of

this officer because, when he was a prisoner of war

after  an  inglorious  campaign  in  Singapore,  he

received four medals just like every other  person,

and these were duly displayed before the electorate

in Anson. Now, he had dealings with this particular

officer,  so that he could draw a pension  and  get

free   transport  to  Australia,  I   believe,   to

recuperate.  Obviously this particular  officer  in

the   old   days  performed  functions  which   are

dissimilar  to those which he is performing  today.

Therefore,  a  change  in  nomenclature  is  to  be

expected.  It is quite natural. I do not  know  why

the  Member  for Anson is making a song  and  dance

about this very trivial matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, obviously the

Minister  knows as little about English as  I  know

about the officer in question. I am delighted  that

he has had the opportunity to display yet once more

his  unhappy jealousy at my war record. But I still

ask  the Member, who was comfortable in bed when  I

was  a prisoner for his sake, amongst others - to  my

regret;  I  did  not  know  I  was  defending   the

P.A.P. - just why and what is the difference  between

"Officer in Charge Forces Record". I will repeat it

in  simple English. What is the difference  between

"Officer  in  Charge  Forces Record"  and  "Defence

Forces  Record  Officer". That is what  I  like  to

know.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, in the course of his

military  career,  I believe the Member  for  Anson

went as high as the rank of Lance-corporal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Unpaid!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Unpaid. I therefore assume

that he is not unfamiliar with military usage, much

of  which is incomprehensible to civilians. I  have

never  even  reached  or gone  above  the  rank  of

Private  and  never  had  occasion  to  deal   with

military terminology. I suggest, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that this is a very trivial matter. With respect, I

suggest we get on with the rest of this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I have a reply, Sir, to my

query  as  to who is expected to make donations  to

the  Singapore Military Forces Benevolent Fund? And

whether   the  allegation  or  statement   in   the

Explanatory  Note  that the Bill does  not  involve

Government  in  any extra financial expenditure  is

merely technically true for today, and whether,  in

fact, it is anticipated that the Government will be

involved  in  expenditure in the future  in  making

donations to this benevolent fund?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I would imagine that a large

amount  of  the  donations to this benevolent  fund

would come from members of the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would like to ask a serious

question,  Sir.  There  is  a  statement   in   the

Explanatory Note to say that this does not  involve

the  Government in any expenditure. Is this  merely

technically  true  of today? Are we  to  anticipate

expenditure in the future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if it says it does not

involve  Government  in any  expenditure,  then  no

contribution will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



made to this benevolent fund. On the other hand, if

in some distant future, circumstances are such that

a  Government contribution to this benevolent  fund

has  strong justification, then the matter can  `be

considered.  I  do not really know what  difficulty

the  Member for Anson, is raising. I am saying that

no payment is envisaged now. But we cannot say that

for  all  time  the Government will  not  make  any

payment. There is no trouble at all.

<div align="center"><b>DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Diphtheria Immunisation Ordinance, 1961, was

enacted  by  the  Assembly as a  positive  measure

towards  the  improvement of child  health  in  the

State during the last session of the Assembly.  The

amendments  now  proposed  are  for  the  following

reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to provide for the extension of the

Ordinance  to  enable medical officers  and  nurses

serving with the United Kingdom Forces in Singapore

to  carry  out  intra dermal tests and inoculations

required   under  the  Ordinance.  This   will   be

necessary to cover effectively the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



substantial armed services population who  normally

receive  complete  medical  care  from  their   own

medical  service units. This objective is  achieved

by    amending   the   definitions   of    "medical

practitioner"  and  "nurse" in  section  2  of  the

principal Ordinance to include in its ambit service

medical officers and nursing personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it was found that the principal

Ordinance had no provision for exemption of a child

from  inoculation.  The `principal  Ordinance  made

provision for postponement with a maximum of  three

months  at a time. This might in practice be  found

to  be inadequate especially in the case of certain

debilitating conditions of a permanent nature, such

as  uncompensated heart disease, chronic nephritis,

serious  allergies.  Clause  4  provides  for  such

exemption to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the definition of "medical certificate"

has   been   extended   to   include   such   other

certificates  as  may `be accepted  by  the  Deputy

Director  of Medical Services (Health) as  evidence

of  inoculation. The purpose of this  amendment  is

principally  to  enable suitable  documents  issued

outside  Singapore to be accepted as valid evidence

of  previous inoculation. The definition of medica1

certificate  in  the principal  Ordinance  was  too

restricted and covered only certificates issued  by

registered medical practitioners in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, opportunity is taken to effect the

consequential    amendment   arising    from    the

reorganisation of the Ministry of Health last year,

whereby  the  reference  to Assistant  Director  of

Medical   Services   (Health)  in   the   principal

Ordinance is changed to Deputy Director of  Medical

Services  (Health)  who  will  be  the  appropriate

officer  discharging the duties required under  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Diphtheria Immunisation Regulations are ready

for  publication and will be published as  soon  as

this  amendment Bill has been enacted and  assented

to.  The publication of the Regulations will enable

the  Ordinance  to  be brought into  force.  It  is

expected to be able to do this by April 1962.

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year as a result of strong complaints made

by  Federation postmen about the frequency of  dog-bites  suffered  by postmen while performing  their

duties, the Federation Government introduced in the

Federal  Parliament  the necessary  legislation  to

meet   the   grievances  of   the   postmen.   This

legislation  was  passed  as  The  Minor   Offences

(Amendment) Act, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in the course of negotiations over the

terms   and   conditions  of  service  of   certain

categories of Government officers conducted between

the  Government and the Amalgamated Union of Public

Employees, the Union requested, among other things,

that   the  Government  should  introduce   similar

legislation in Singapore for the protection of  the

State's  postmen.  This  was  considered  to  be  a

reasonable request, and the Government agreed  that

it would introduce a Bill accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, which is based on the Federation of

Malaya Minor Offences (Amendment) Act, 1961,  seeks

to  amend  the Minor Offences Ordinance  so  as  to

provide  that  any person (such as a  postman)  who

enters any house or premises



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



in  the  ordinary course of his duties or with  the

express  or implied permission of the occupier  and

suffers  any  injury  caused by  a  dog,  shall  be

awarded  compensation,  not exceeding  one  hundred

dollars,  to  be  assessed `by a  magistrate.  Such

compensation is to `be payable by the owner of  the

dog,  quite  apart from a fine not exceeding  fifty

dollars  to  which he is liable on conviction.  The

Bill also provides that in any prosecution it shall

not   be  necessary  to  show  a  previous  vicious

propensity  in  such dog or the  owner's  knowledge

thereof or even that the injury was attributable to

the owner's neglect. But an owner is not liable for

any injury sustained by a person as a result of any

wrongful act on the part of such person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, there is a

well-known saying that every dog has its day. Under

the  law,  a dog is entitled to one bite  at  least

before the owner is called to book for it. However,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I welcome this amendment to  the

Minor  Offences  Ordinance.  Although  the  persons

primarily  intended  to benefit  by  this  are  the

postmen,  the  Bill, I think, takes it  beyond  the

postmen to any person who suffers a bite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary provision which enables a Magistrate

to  assess damages to a sum not exceeding  $100  is

welcome.  But I would like some assurance from  the

Government  that  if,  as a result  of  a  bite,  a

prosecution has been launched and compensation  has

been paid by the Magistrate, then such compensation

or  a conviction of the owner will not preclude the

person  suffering  from the bite  from  taking  the

matter  further  in a civil court. Because  a  bite

could result, if it were a bite which the civil law

will  take  cognisance of, in damages greater  than

$100. I do hope that merely because the prosecution

has   been  launched  and  compensation  has   been

ordered,  the person who suffers the bite will  not

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



precluded later, because of the compensation  or  a

conviction,  from taking the matter  to  the  civil

court.



<br><br>5.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a person who has

been   bitten  by  a  dog  and  who  has   received

compensation  cannot  be  precluded  from  bringing

action in the civil courts if he is advised  to  do

so.  I  think the Member for Farrer Park very  well

knows that that is the true legal position.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the Parliamentary

Secretary is not replying?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b> indicated dissent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report that Members of the Select

Committee  have  reached  the  largest  measure  of

agreement possible on the controversial clauses  of

this Bill, and in a spirit of give and take on both

sides,  improvements have been  made  to  the  Bill

designed  to  ensure  that  there  are  appropriate

sanctions  available to the House  in  cases  where

abuse of privileges is committed by a Member  or  a

stranger.  It  is hoped that armed with  these  new

powers,  the Legislative Assembly will be  able  to

carry out its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



functions in a dignified and sober manner.  I  have

no  doubt, Sir, that hon. Members with their  usual

ingenuity will be able in time to develop  a  skill

in  debate which will enable them to sail close  to

the  shoals  and rocks of abuse without  foundering

and  without attracting undue notice from you,  Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  agree entirely with what the Minister  for

Law  said  when moving the Second Reading  of  this

Bill  and  I hope that the occasion will not  arise

when  the  provisions of this  Bill  will  be  used

against  any  Assemblyman.  But  I  would  like  to

express  my regret at certain stipulations  in  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that about ten

months  ago, the Government intended to  pass  this

Bill  through its three stages at one  sitting.  At

that time, all of us in the Opposition on this side

of  the  House expressed our opposition to  such  a

move because the provisions in this Bill would have

affected  us  very  much as they  would  limit  our

freedom  to a great extent. Later on, we asked  the

Government  to  refer the Bill to Select  Committee

for  consideration. We are glad to  note  that  the

Government  accepted  the constructive  suggestions

from  the  Opposition  side.  Although  the  Report

before  us shows that the Government have  accepted

some  ten amendments, there is one clause on  which

we have to express our opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 20 provides penalties

for  dishonourable conduct. If  my  memory  is  not

wrong,  on 17th November, 1961, Opposition  Members

condemned the definition of the term "dishonourable

conduct"  because the Government  did  not  give  a

clear  definition of this term. As Members  of  the

Opposition  we  are  rather  worried  because   our

freedom  of  expression in  this  Assembly  can  be

restricted  by  this  term "dishonourable  conduct"

which  is  not  clearly  defined.  Our  freedom  of

expression  would  therefore  be  limited  by  law.

Although the so-called dishonourable conduct of any

Member is to be decided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



by  the Assembly as a whole, we are rather worried,

from  experience  in the past. If  criticisms  came

from the Opposition side, the Government would very

likely   term  such  criticisms  as  "dishonourable

conduct".  Therefore, we are of  the  opinion  that

without   a   clear   definition   of   the    term

"dishonourable conduct", the freedom of  expression

of  Opposition Members would be greatly restricted.

The  Report  of the Select Committee on  this  Bill

discloses   that   the   most  important   question

discussed  in  Select  Committee  was  the   proper

`definition  of  the term "dishonourable  conduct".

The reduction of the fine from $5,000 to $1,000  in

the  event of an Assemblyman being found guilty  of

dishonourable  conduct is not very important.  What

is  more important is that there should be  a  very

clear    definition   as   to   what    constitutes

dishonourable conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope that the Government can

truly  carry  out  its  duties  in  the  spirit  of

parliamentary democracy. From now on, it should not

try  to make use of any loophole in the law to deal

with  Opposition Members. We sincerely  hope  that,

when  faced  with  possible  criticisms  from   the

Opposition  side, the Government  will  not  light-heartedly  resort to the provisions in  this  Bill,

especially the provisions in clause 20, to restrict

the freedom of expression in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we also hope that the Minister

concerned will assure us that the use of  the  term

"dishonourable  conduct" will  not  be  applied  to

Opposition  Members because we will exercise  self-discipline.  As representatives of the  people,  we

will  be responsible for what we say to the people.

I believe that the speeches of Assemblymen are made

with  a sense of responsibility. They are made from

a national point of view with a sense of good will

and good intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was glad to hear what the

Minister said just now, that this Bill would not be

applied  to Members of the Assembly and members  of

the  public and that there would be no occasion  to

apply  the  provisions  of the  Bill.  If  anything

should go amiss by misusing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



the  provisions of the Bill, then I say I would  be

pessimistic  as  to  the  future  of  parliamentary

democracy.  That is why I hope the Government  will

not  lightly  make use of this term  "dishonourable

conduct" to deal with Opposition Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, it gives me great

pleasure  to  recall the alarm on the part  of  the

Government Front Benches when we suggested that the

Bill  should be sent to Select Committee. What they

enquired  was, "What is the Assembly to do  in  the

face  of  the  wild  men on the Opposition  Benches

without  a Privileges Ordinance in order to protect

them?". I trust they will digest the lesson of  the

valuable cooperation in Select Committee in seeking

to  bring about a provision which was acceptable to

all Parties and also a recognition of the sense  of

responsibility displayed by Members on this side of

the   House  and  the  complete  absence   of   any

foundation for the hysterical alarm they  displayed

during the Second Reading. I do not know if  it  is

appropriate,  but  I  would  like  to   take   this

opportunity  of  expressing  appreciation  for  the

Chairman of the Select Committee who helped a great

deal  in  bringing  about fruitful  cooperation  in

respect of a Bill which now receives the support of

all Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain amount of anxiety has been indicated by

the  previous speaker with reference to the  phrase

"dishonourable  conduct". As  you  are  aware,  Mr

Speaker,  except in respect of mathematical  terms,

it  is  almost  humanly impossible  to  define  any

phrase   with   absolute   accuracy.   The   phrase

"dishonourable  conduct" has, in  fact,  been  left

undefined  by the Select Committee because  it  was

considered best that the matter should be  left  to

the   good   sense  of  successive  Committees   of

Privileges  representing the ideas and feelings  of

their  time  and who, in the context of  their  own

decency  and  their own integrity,  will  judge  of

their   fellow  Members  or  of  strangers  alleged

transgressions.  It is true that  the  majority  on

every  Select  Committee  is  quite  properly   the

Government  majority,  and  in  this  context,   in

respect  of  the immediate future, it is  a  P.A.P.

majority. But I say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  that whatever our views may be with reference

to  the  gentlemen on the Government Front Benches,

it  is  a  fear with little foundation and that  in

practice we have found that though phrases  may  be

wide  and undefined, the ultimate result is  rarely

unjust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one, Mr Speaker, have no hesitation in

giving my complete support to this Third Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to support. I

myself was a Member of the Select Committee. So  it

is  needless for me to say that I support the Third

Reading of this Bill. But I would like to take this

opportunity  of answering the Member for  Choa  Chu

Kang  on  one  or  two matters  which  seem  to  be

exercising his mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang is worried that

because "dishonourable conduct" in clause 20 of the

Bill  as agreed to by the Select Committee has  not

been  defined, conditions may arise in the Assembly

which might place certain Members in the Opposition

at  a disadvantage. Sir, may I refer the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang to clause 3 (1) of the  Bill  which

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Save as is otherwise expressly provided in the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order in  Council,  1958,

and  in  this Ordinance, the privileges, immunities

and  powers  of  the Assembly and of  the  Speaker,

members  and committees shall be the same as  those

for  the  time being held, enjoyed or exercised  by

the  Commons  House  of Parliament  of  the  United

Kingdom  or  the  Speaker,  members  or  committees

thereof.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Member of the Select Committee moved

discussion on the words "dishonourable conduct", if

my  recollection is correct, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it

was pointed out to him, as the Member for Anson has

pointed out, that to define "dishonourable conduct"

is  a  practically impossible task  because  honour

varies  from time to time and from place to  place.

But  it  was  pointed out to the Member  who  moved

discussion  of  the words "dishonourable  conduct",

that  there was available, as a result of clause  3

of  the Bill, a set of decisions which the House of

Commons  has  adopted  with regard  to  the  phrase

"dishonourable conduct". By virtue of clause  3  of

this Bill, all those decisions in the House of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



Commons  on  what is or what is not  "dishonourable

conduct"  would  be  available to  this  House  for

consideration as to what "dishonourable conduct" is

in  the  circumstances in which  that  conduct  was

committed.  So  I would suggest to the  Member  for

Choa   Chu   Kang  that  possibly  his  fears   are

misplaced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to stress here

is  that  this Bill, when it becomes  law,  is  not

going   to   be   entrusted  to  the  Minister   to

administer, but it will be entirely administered by

the   House  itself  and  not  by  the  Ministerial

Benches.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

point  out  to  the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  that

published with the record of the proceedings of the

Select  Committee is a paper which you prepared  on

breaches of privilege and contempts in the House of

Commons  as Paper B in Appendix IV. In this  paper,

Mr Speaker, Sir, you have referred to one case  of

dishonourable conduct which appears in May at  page

116. The precedent that you cited as an instance of

dishonourable  conduct  was  a  case   of   corrupt

acceptance  of payment for disclosure of  a  secret

matter.  Now, if the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang  is

interested  in  going further into this  matter,  I

suggest that he look up May at that page and he can

get  all  the  information that he wants,  all  the

precedents of cases of dishonourable conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's

consent  to proceed with this Bill. Sir, I  beg  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is an important piece if legislation in

that for the first time in the annals of Singapore,

legal provision is being made for the holding of  a

national referendum in this country. This method of

ascertaining  the  popular will of  the  electorate

introduces   another  aspect  of   the   democratic

process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, Sir, this Bill stimulated

considerable interest as evidenced by the number of

amendments which had been proposed, so much so that

the  Second  Reading of the Bill  was  referred  in

order  to enable the Government to study them  very

carefully   in  all  its  implications.   We   have

considered them in full and in detail, and later in

my  speech I will let the House know which  of  the

Opposition  amendments the Government  accepts  and

which  the  Government rejects. The Government  has

also,  after  considering some  of  the  amendments

proposed, decided to put in some amendments of  its

own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose, therefore, to deal with this Bill by

first  explaining it as it stands at  present,  and

then touching in general on the amendments proposed

by   the  Opposition  and  those  proposed  by  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it is drafted at present, the Bill can be

conveniently explained in three parts, namely:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the general principles of the referendum;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the procedure for the holding of a

referendum and the manner of voting; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) provisions of the Bill dealing with corrupt

and  illegal practices in connection with  the

taking of a referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first part, clause 5 empowers

the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  by  Order,  when  he

considers that it is in the public interest  to  do

so,  to direct that any matter be submitted to  the

electorate for a referendum. When such an Order has

been  issued,  the  Minister is  then  required  by

clause  6 of the Bill to notify in the Gazette  the

date of the referendum at least seven days before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



the  date  fixed for such referendum. The Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara is also empowered by  clause  7  to

issue  a  further Order for a referendum if,  after

the  issue of the first Order, he is satisfied that

owing  to  any  cause whatsoever no referendum  has

taken place in pursuance of such first Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of holding a referendum in

Singapore, only Singapore citizens on the electoral

registers  can  vote  at the referendum,  and  they

shall  be  entitled  to  vote  only  once  at  such

referendum.  Those  provisions  are  laid  down  in

clauses  8  and 9 pf the Bill. Clause  11  provides

that  for  purposes of a referendum,  the  existing

electoral divisions and polling districts under the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance

are to be adopted. The Superintendent appointed  by

the  Minister  for  purposes  of  a  referendum  is

required  under  the provisions  of  clause  13  to

publish in the Gazette a notice not later than five

days  before the date of the referendum, specifying

all the polling stations provided by him for use in

the  polling districts and electoral divisions  for

the referendum, as well as specifying the questions

to  be  submitted to the electors and  the  symbols

which he has adopted for use in connection therein.

Under clause 14, polling day has been made a public

holiday   within  the  meaning  of   the   Holidays

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the procedure for the holding of a

referendum,  the procedure has been  largely  based

and  modelled  on the provisions of  the  Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, and those

procedural provisions are set out in Part II of the

Bill.  Bearing in mind, however, that no individual

candidates or political Parties are involved in the

same  sense as they are involved in elections, some

modifications have been made in the procedure.  The

position  of  political Parties in the Assembly  in

connection  with  a referendum is  recognised,  and

political  Parties represented in  the  Legislative

Assembly  may be allowed to appoint polling  agents

and  counting  agents  at  the  discretion  of  the

Superintendent under the provisions of  clauses  17

and 27



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



respectively.  Under the provisions  of  clause  27

also,  when the counting of the votes cast  in  the

referendum  has  been completed, the Superintendent

shall  declare the result of the referendum and  in

accordance with clause 29 he shall forthwith, after

the  result  has been, declared by him,  compile  a

statement  of  the referendum and shall  cause  the

said statement to be published in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner of voting in the referendum is exactly

similar   to  that  at  any  election   under   the

provisions  of  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections  Ordinance. Since everyone in this  House

is  familiar with the manner of voting, there is no

need  for me to proceed with explaining how  voting

is  to  be  carried  out. The  same  penalties  for

offences  in  respect of ballot papers  and  ballot

boxes  as  in  the  Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections  Ordinance are provided for in clause  31

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill deals with corrupt and

illegal  practices arising out of the taking  of  a

referendum  and, in the main, adopts with  suitable

amendments   the   provisions  of   the   Singapore

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance. The  same

penalties  for  offences  in  respect  of   corrupt

practices   and  illegal  practices,  as   in   the

Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance,

are incorporated in clauses 37 and 41 of this Bill.

The  same provisions for prohibition on polling day

of  undue  influence at or near  polling  stations,

unlawful    assemblies,    offence    to    operate

loudspeakers,  and the restrictions  on  referendum

activity are included in clauses 43, 44, 45 and  46

of   the  Bill.  Clause  46  restricts  any  person

attending  a  primary or secondary  school  or  any

person,  against  whom an Order of Supervision  has

been made under the provisions of the Criminal  Law

(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1955, from taking

part in any activity connected with a referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill makes miscellaneous

provisions. Just as for elections, the holding of a

referendum involves the Government in expenditure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



of public money, and based on previous knowledge of

funds  spent  in  connection with  the  holding  of

general  elections, it is estimated that a  sum  of

$400,000  would be required for the  holding  of  a

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the amendments as proposed by

the Opposition. The Opposition amendments could  be

conveniently   divided   into   three   categories.

Firstly,  those amendments which intend  ostensibly

to   ensure  propriety  in  the  conduct   of   the

referendum, the Government is prepared to accept. I

would  first of all, however, like to say that  the

modifications which the Government has made in  the

Bill  with regard to the procedural provisions  for

the holding of a referendum vis-a-vis the Elections

Ordinance were made because no individual candidate

or  political  Parties were involved  in  the  same

sense  as  they were in the case of elections,  and

also  in  order  to simplify the procedure  at  the

polling   stations   and  to   save   time.   These

modifications   were   to   suit   the    different

requirements  of  a referendum. However,  in  order

that  there can be no doubt about the propriety  of

the  conduct  of  the  referendum,  the  Government

accepts the amendments of the Member for Queenstown

with  regard  to  (1) the appointments  of  polling

agents  and  counting agents by  political  Parties

represented in the Assembly themselves, and not  as

in  the  Bill empowering the Superintendent to  use

his discretion in allowing such appointments to  be

made by political Parties; (2) in including in this

Bill   similar  provisions  as  in  the   Singapore

Legislative   Assembly  Elections  Ordinance   with

regard  to  allowing polling agents to affix  their

seals  to ballot boxes and other sealed packets  if

they so desire, and for the opening of ballot boxes

in  the  presence of such counting agents as attend

and for the recounting of votes upon application by

political Parties in the Assembly or their counting

agents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Bill was drafted, it was intended

that  in a referendum on merger since no individual

candidates were involved, the Superintendent should

use his power of discretion allowed to him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



to  propose  to political Parties having  the  same

views  on merger that they may jointly appoint  one

polling  agent to each polling place and  also  one

counting  agent to each counting centre.  This  was

the  purpose  of the modification of the  Elections

Ordinance.  The provisions with regard to  affixing

of  seals  to  ballot boxes and sealed  packets  by

polling agents was to make the procedure at polling

stations  as simple as possible and to  save  time,

bearing  in  mind that at no time after the  ballot

boxes  and sealed packets leave the polling station

until  they arrive at the counting centre are  they

in  the  hands  of  one person,  hut  are  in  fact

accompanied  by the presiding officer and  some  of

the  polling  staff, escorted by  the  police.  The

provision  of  opening  ballot  boxes  at  counting

centres  in  the  presence of counting  agents  was

omitted,  because it was considered from a drafting

point  of  view  that  this was unnecessary,  since

clause   27   (2)   already   provided   that   the

Superintendent  shall  make  arrangements  for  the

counting  of  the  votes in the  presence  of  such

counting  agents  as attend and these  arrangements

for  counting would include the taking out  of  the

ballot papers from the ballot boxes. However, as  I

have said earlier, the Government has accepted  the

amendment of the Member for Queenstown so  that  no

one  can  Question the propriety of the referendum.

Again,  the reason why the provision for a  recount

of  votes on application was omitted was to make it

an administrative function of the Superintendent in

order  to  prevent requests for recounts on  flimsy

and trivial grounds or for obstructive purposes and

although  there  was  no express  provision  for  a

recount to be made, no Assistant Superintendent  in

charge  of  a  counting  centre  would  refuse  any

reasonable application for a recount if made at the

appropriate time. In omitting from the  Bill  these

provisions  which the Member for Queens-town  wants

included,  the  Government wanted to  simplify  the

administrative arrangements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category were those Opposition

amendments   which,   after  careful   study,   the

Government considers to have some sense  and  could

within  reason  be, accepted with modifications  or

improvements.  To  give two  examples, instead  of

total   prohibition  of  flags, banners,  symbols,

advertisements,  etc.,  and  total  prohibition  of

canvassing  either  before,  during  or  after  any

referendum,   the   Government  has   accepted   an

Opposition   amendment  to  limit  prohibition   of

canvassing  only to polling day and  to  limit  the

prohibition on flags, banners, symbols,  etc, only

to  the  period  from  the date  of  issue  of  the

Referendum Order of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  up

to and including the day fixed for the taking of  a

referendum.  As  you  are  aware,  Sir,   we   have

submitted  an amendment to this effect.  There  are

other  instances  also where Opposition  amendments

request  that longer periods of time  be  given  in

respect of certain statutory notifications and  the

Government considers that within reason the  period

of  time  could be extended further. These will  be

gone into more fully at the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of Opposition amendments were

apparently  designed for and would have the  effect

of  creating delay and obstruction and mischief and

trouble   at  polling  stations,  or  inviting   of

intimidation  or  generally  creating   chaos   and

confusion  to  the  voters.  These  amendments  the

Government  obviously must reject if the  views  of

the  people were to be properly ascertained without

any  fear or confusion. At the Committee stage, the

Government   will  give  detailed   reasons   which

Opposition  amendment  it  is  unable  to   accept.

Suffice  it  for me to say at this stage  that  the

reasons for non-acceptance are based on grounds  of

non-justification, causing    delay,    inviting

obstruction and trouble at polling stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Sir, at the Committee stage. I shall be

moving a number of amendments of which I have given

notice  and  I will explain the reasons  for  these

amendments  when  they are moved in  committee.  As

mentioned earlier, these amendments were made after

considering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



some  of  the  amendments  proposed  by   the

Opposition.  Most  of  these  amendments   are   in

connection with provisions for referendum petitions

where  the  Government has put  into  comprehensive

form the Member for Anson's proposal for referendum

petition provisions to be included in the Bill, but

in  keeping with the detailed drafting of this Bill

the  Government  has spelt out the  provisions  for

referendum petitions in greater detail under a  new

Part  V  of  the  Bill. In agreeing to  incorporate

referendum petition provisions, the Government will

also accept with a further amendment the Member for

Anson's amendment to clause 27 with regard  to  the

inclusion of Orders of a High Court Judge  relating

to  the  inspection.,  copying  and  production  of

ballot  papers or other documents required for  the

purpose of instituting or maintaining a prosecution

or referendum petition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the provisions of this

Bill,  the  first  matter to be  submitted  to  the

electors  for  a referendum will be the  terms  and

conditions   of  merger  of  Singapore   with   the

Federation.   Mach  has  already  been   said   and

explained about this merger during the past  months

through  the  radio, forums, meetings,  discussions

and  Press interviews. Much more will be  said  and

repeated  in  the  coming months  until  merger  is

realised  and  Malaysia created in or  before  June

1963.  It is for the people of Singapore to  decide

on  the  manner of the inevitable reunification  of

our two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Bill  before the House, the Second Reading  of

which has been postponed for reasons best known  to

the  P.A.P., seeks to provide for the taking  of  a

national   referendum.   I   emphasise   the   word

"national", Sir, because it is quite clear that  in

spite  of  what the Minister for Home  Affairs  has

said,  the  Bill in its present form and even  with

amendments will seek



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



only  to  provide for a referendum run on  a  party

basis.  It  will not be truly national in character

in   that   there  is  no  provision   for   proper

consultation of other political Parties or for  the

proper and appropriate ventilation of views of  the

people.  There  is  also  no  provision  for  party

consultation in the framing of the question  to  be

submitted to the people. Then there is no provision

for  adequate time and opportunity in spite of what

the  Minister  for Home Affairs has just  mentioned

for political Parties to put their views before the

people  concerning  the  question  posed  for   the

referendum.  Therefore, we in the Barisan  Sosialis

feel  that there must be certain minimum democratic

safeguards that have to be included in the Bill. We

are all too familiar with the -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

P.K.I.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - secret deal of the P.A.P. over

the question of merger. The people will have to  be

ever  on their guard when they are confronted  with

these   same   tricky  politicians   conducting   a

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> You

made a deal with the British.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we are not the least

against the principle underlying a referendum.  But

we  want to draw the attention of the House as well

as  the  attention of the people  of  Singapore  to

possible  attempts  by discredited  politicians  to

make  use  of  the  referendum to  achieve  certain

undesirable  political  aims.  Our  amendments  are

directed towards helping to prevent this happening.

Complete  with  all  the democratic  safeguards,  a

referendum is calculated to ascertain in a truthful

manner the collective will of the electorate over a

clear-cut  issue. It is the duty of the  Opposition

and  indeed of the whole Assembly to see that  this

is  actually so. The electorate is required in the

coming  referendum to decide on the  constitutional

future  of  Singapore, a vital issue the importance

of which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



can  never be overstressed. It is an issue on which

many  views  have  been expressed both  inside  and

outside  the Assembly and, as things stand,  is  an

issue that can he made very confusing, depending on

how  the  P.A.P. Government is going  to  pose  the

question to the people. One would have thought that

since  the  P.A.P. has discarded  the  useful  past

practice  of  an  All-Party conference,  since  the

P.A.P.'s  claim  to overwhelming support  has  been

invalidated both in terms of majority margin in the

House  and  popular sentiments all over  Singapore,

and since the question of our constitutional future

has  to  be decided by the people, the natural  and

logical thing to do is to hold a general election -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why do you chaps not resign?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - in order to have a government

more  representative of the people and a government

fully  equipped with the mandate of the  people  to

fight for our next constitutional advance. But  not

unexpectedly  our  call for  an  immediate  general

election  has now been rejected by the  P.A.P. for

reasons best known to themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are the reason.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All sorts of rationalisations

have been put forward to justify their rejection of

a  general election. I do not think the people will

take them seriously. For example, both the Minister

for  Finance  and  the Prime Minister  twisted  our

preference for general elections to mean that we in

the  Barisan Sosialis fear that the people may  not

have  the intelligence to know how to choose  in  a

referendum -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is what you have said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - whereas the P.A.P. believes

in the wisdom and intelligence of the people in the

referendum. This is the P.A.P. line. Yet the  Prime

Minister,  in  one of his famous  or  notorious  12

talks,  argues that a general election will confuse

the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



because   of  the  multitude  of  Parties  symbols,

platforms and candidates, and because other  issues

brought  out  in an election will be confused  with

the merger issue. The Prime Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder how the Member for

Queenstown  can  relate what he is  saying  to  the

Bill.  The Bill deals with the proposal to  have  a

National  Referendum  Ordinance  and  the  argument

seems  to be that the Member for Queenstown is  not

in favour of the Bill, if he alleges that a general

election  would  be  a better way  of  doing  these

things.  I  might remind the Member for Queenstown.

and incidentally all other Members, that we are  on

the  Second Reading of the Bill and under  standing

Order  67  (2), "a debate may arise  covering  the

general   merits  and  principle  of   the   Bill."

Therefore,  I  cannot see how the  failure  of  the

P.A.P. to call a general election has anything  to

do with this Referendum Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand that. I merely

wanted  to  point  out the illogical  argument  all

along put forward by the P.A.P. I have no intention

whatsoever of dwelling on the subject of a  general

election  or the argument for it. All I  wanted  to

point out was that when they talk of the wisdom  of

the  people they do not really mean what they  say.

When  they  say they believe in the wisdom  of  the

people,  they also say the people will be confused.

Therefore they really mean otherwise. However,  now

that  a  referendum is preferred by the  P.A.P. to

decide  on  the constitutional future of Singapore,

we  in  the Barisan Sosialis, and I believe all  on

this side of the House, are fully prepared for  the

eventuality  of  a  referendum  carried  out  on  a

democratic basis, on democratic lines. But first we

want   to  know  what - of  course,  it  has  to   be

explained - is the issue to be decided upon, and then

we  must also strive to ensure that all the minimum

democratic essentials are not deliberately omitted.

Sir,  we  have  so  far  neither  information   nor

consultation as to how and in what form  the  vital

issue   is  to  be  decided  upon  in  the   coming

referendum.  How is the question to  be  posed?  Is

there to be one question only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



or  are  there going to be two or three  questions?

And  how are the questions to be framed and worded?

Sir,  the Minister for Home Affairs talks of  terms

and  conditions.  What does he mean  by  terms  and

conditions?  Why  cannot he be straightforward  and

tell us all what this is all about?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister for Home

Affairs  had  enlarged on that  phrase  "terms  and

conditions", he would have been completely  Out  of

order  with  reference to this Bill. We  cannot  go

into  details  of that nature. The  Bill  does  not

specifically say that there will be a referendum in

regard  to  merger.  But in  passing.  Members  can

mention this Issue which will be perhaps the  first

issue under this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister did say that it

is  for the constitutional future of Singapore, and

we  can assume that the referendum is about the so-called White Paper of the P.A.P. Sir, these are all

vital  questions  and  we are  glad  to  note  that

amendments have been tabled by the Member for Anson

on, this particular point, because we know only too

well  P.A.P. thinking on controversial  issues.  We

know  how the P.A.P. will try to do things only  to

the  advantage  of the P.A.P. and to  nobody  else.

They have done too -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> For the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - many things arbitrarily in

the  last 2� years and have twisted and turned once

too  often. In fact, Sir, if it is a case of posing

the  questions as regards the constitutional future

of  Singapore,  we would support the  amendment  of

having  only one question, as this would  give  the

people  an  opportunity to give a  categorical  and

clear-cut  answer  whether or  not  they  want  the

P.A.P.'s  White  Paper merger  proposals.  That  is

assuming  that we are talking of their  merger.  We

are  glad  to  note that the United People's  Party

also has come out with a statement that they are in

favour  of  only one question to be  posed  to  the

people for their decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am told that in any social or economic

survey,  there  exists  a very  close  relationship

between the questions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



put and the results that follow. The wording of the

question can also have a very serious influence  on

the  result that follows. Often improper  questions

asked -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The answer is no.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and improper words used may lead to answers that may not correspond with the actual situation. I say, Sir, this is more so in the event of a referendum. Let us assume that the issue is whether the voter is for or against merger as our next constitutional advance - a simple one.

There  can  be so many ways of posing the question.

If  a  voter is asked whether he is for or  against

the  P.A.P. type of merger as outlined in the White

Paper, he may well say no -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On the other hand, he may not say

yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - even though he is not against

merger.  So  you  can  see the  difficulty  of  the

framing and the wording of the question. The P.A.P.

think  they have this trump card up their  sleeves.

But  anyway we will have to watch and find out. But

let me add, Sir, that if the posing of the question

is  going to be fair - since they talk so much  about

fairness - it   must   he  clear,   unequivocal   and

straightforward so that the electorate can have the

chance to answer it in a straightforward and clear-cut manner. We in the Barisan Sosialis believe that

in  view of all this, the Government should  table,

in  the  first  instance  in  the  Assembly,  their

proposal regarding the issue, the question and  its

wording  for examination, discussion and debate  by

Members.  That  is absolutely important.  Then  and

then  only will all Parties be satisfied that there

is  no  juggling or underhand tricks on this  vital

issue of the specification of question or questions

to be submitted to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important thing, as far as we are

concerned, is that the provisions of the Bill  will

prevent corruption, rigging of votes and any unfair

advantage   that  would  make  the  result   of   a

referendum    meaningless,   and   a    meaningless

referendum - a  phoney  referendum - will  give  phoney

legality to discredited politicians



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



to  further  discredit parliamentary  democracy  in

this  part  of the world. The Leader of  the  House

laughs.  We  have  heard a lot about  parliamentary

democracy from some of the P.A.P. leaders and I say

this to them, "Practise what you preach."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Lim Ching Siong does not believe

in that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The hope of democracy does not

lie in the preachings of men but in the practice of

those  who hold power, and unfortunately the P.A.P.

have shown us how they have abused power.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Come off it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We have seen how parliamentary

democracy    can   be   made   into   parliamentary

dictatorship by P.A.P. leaders intoxicated with the

taste of power.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the P.A.P. are prepared to

practise  what  they preach, then I  say  to  them,

amend  the National Referendum Bill so that a truly

fair referendum will be possible. When I talk about

fairness,  the  Minister  for  Finance  laughs  and

yawns.  Obviously, he does not know the meaning  of

the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a referendum is really to reflect the

views  and  wishes of the people, then it  must  be

conducted in a manner that is above criticism  and,

what is more important, above suspicion -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Like Caesar's wife.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - to make the Referendum Bill

such  that  those opposed to the question  that  is

asked will have both the time and the facilities to

explain to the people why they are opposed  to  the

question  that is asked, to make the provisions  of

the   Bill  such  that  there  can  never  be   any

accusation  that the Government seek to fix  things

in  such  a way that the whole business is  a  mere

ritual.  Let  us make sure there is no  mockery  of

democracy and of the people of Singapore. We  want.

Sir, to see parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



democracy work in Singapore. We want all the people

in  Singapore  to see that parliamentary  democracy

can and does work in Singapore, and the P.A.P.,  as

the government of the day, have a responsibility to

see  that parliamentary democracy can and does work

in  Singapore, not just for the benefit of  only  a

section  of the people but for the benefit  of  all

sections  of the people; otherwise even people  who

do  not  have the benefit of a Cambridge University

education will see through the use - or shall  I  say

abuse - of  the democratic machinery for undemocratic

practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the record of the broken promises of the

P.A.P. is  still fresh in our minds. The  way  the

P.A.P. have handled the whole question of  merger,

as  revealed  in the White Paper agreement  between

Singapore  and the Federation, still leaves  a  bad

taste  in  the  mouth. Their secret  deal  in  this

constitutional link-up does not encourage  the  man

in  the  street  to  place any  confidence  in  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments which seek to ensure that

there  can  be  no foul play, no chicanery  can  be

divided  into the following groups. There  must  be

adequate time for a campaign both in support of and

against  the proposed question. The present  clause

in  the  Bill which makes it possible to  hold  the

referendum seven days after the writ is  issued  is

calculated   to   prevent   the   presentation   of

Opposition views. In fact, the period may  be  only

five days, as under the provisions in the Bill  the

Government  need only announce the question  to  be

submitted to the voters not later than five days.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think all these details

could  be  touched upon in Committee. I  think  the

hon.  Member  has  made his  point,  that  is,  the

general point that adequate time should be given. I

think  that  has been conceded by the Minister  for

Home  Affairs.  It  is  a  question  of  debate  in

Committee as to what is adequate time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am only mentioning it in

passing.  The P.A.P. took seven weeks in  Hong  Lim

and  five weeks in Anson to canvass their point  of

view  and even then they thought the time  was  too

short.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You were also canvassing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Therefore, according to our

views,  this period of seven days and five days  is

definitely  far too short for a public  discussion

of  a  question that merits a referendum - a question

that is going to decide the lives and future of all

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed seven-day minimum period is grossly

inadequate  and can only be taken as an attempt  to

hold  a snap referendum so that the P.A.P. can take

full  advantage  of  their  control  of  the  State

machinery  in presenting their case and  preventing

the  Opposition from having either the time or  the

facilities  for presenting the Opposition  case  to

the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Queenstown must have regard to what has  been  said

by  the  Minister for Home Affairs. I  think  I  am

correct  when  I  say that the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs has conceded the point that there should he

adequate  lime. Therefore, the amount of time  that

should  be  given would be a matter for  debate  in

Committee. The Member for Queenstown should  adjust

his speech to meet what has, in fact, been said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> With due respect, Sir, I do

not   think  the  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  has

conceded the point that the period should  be  very

much  lengthened.  The Government  have  given  the

impression  that  they  are willing  to  concede  a

slight extension of the time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is exactly the point

which  I am trying to make. That is a debate  which

can  properly  be  taken in  Committee.  All  those

points can be made. I hope the hon. Member does not

think  the  Chairman is excluding him  from  saying

these  things.  The Chair is only  suggesting  that

those   remarks  could  properly   be   passed   in

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I shall be satisfied, Sir, if

you will allow me the opportunity to stress a point

which to us is very important. In spite of what the

Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



for  Home  Affairs has said, we feel that the  case

has  not  been  presented in  principle  adequately

unless  we  inform the House of the actual  way  we

look at it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

either  trying not to understand me or deliberately

not  understanding me. I have not said that he will

be debarred. He will have the opportunity of saying

what  he  wishes  to say in Committee.  I  am  only

trying  to channel the debate on the Second Reading

of  this  Bill, which is on the general merits  and

principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Skip the details, and you are all

right.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, the clause as it

stands in the Bill which limits the time period  is

a  most  undemocratic provision. Let me just finish

off by telling the P.A.P. leaders this: do not help

ill the creation of an undemocratic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in clause 5, it is the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  who considers when a referendum  is  to  be

carried  out.  In  actual practice,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan means the Minister. Now, a referendum as we

all  know, is a national matter affecting the lives

and  future  of every voter as well as  every  non-voter  in Singapore and, indeed, all Malaya. It  is

imperative,  therefore, that all other  Parties  be

consulted  and given a say in the matter.  Let  the

whole   question  be  aired  and  debated  in   the

Legislative Assembly first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing applies in clause 7. Surely, it

would  be  more  democratic to let the  Legislative

Assembly  be the final authority in this  instance.

Nowadays  the P.A.P. Government have the  habit  of

bringing into the Assembly all sorts of motions and

resolutions on matters which should rightly  belong

to  the  authority of the Government. We have  seen

this  happen during the merger debate three  months

back.  Yet on matters of truly national importance.

on a matter that may possibly occur only once in  a

lifetime, when a matter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



should  rightly  be  debated in the  Assembly,  the

P.A.P.  Government want to arrogate all  power  and

decisions  to  itself.  Under those  circumstances,

where is the practice of parliamentary democracy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of symbols, Sir, it should be

borne  in  mind  that  the purpose  is  to  prevent

confusion, for if symbols are to be used, then  all

the symbols must be such as not to give the idea of

unequal  values  to  the  voter.  Symbols  must  be

neutral.   There   are   symbols   which    signify

prosperity,  and symbols which signify  strife  and

hard-snip in the minds of certain people. Let  this

not be instrumental in influencing the voter in his

real choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me elaborate a little on the principles

of  canvassing.  The Bill prohibits  canvassing.  A

little while ago the Minister for Home Affairs gave

me  the  impression that canvassing will  still  be

permitted in many ways.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Only on polling day.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Only on polling day? Anyway,

they  have all this in the clause on canvassing.  I

think  they are afraid that the truth will be told.

I  do  not  know;  they may be  afraid  that  their

deception  might  be exposed. All the  Parties,  we

feel,  should be allowed to express their views  on

the  questions submitted for the referendum.  Truth

fears  no  exposure. Anyway, it is in keeping  with

the  spirit of democracy. The Government, with  the

monopoly of the radio and Rediffusion, and the help

of  what  has  now  become a very friendly  English

Press,  need not be afraid of canvassing.  Whatever

the  Opposition  Parties can  do,  I  am  sure  the

Government  Party can also do. We have no  monopoly

on  rallies. The P.A.P. can also hold their rallies

and  perhaps there are still a number of people who

will  go along to listen to them and chalk up  more

of their broken promises. We stress very much. Sir,

that there must he freedom of speech and canvassing

in  connection  with  such  an  important  national

issue.  The  question  of merger  affects  all  the

people of Singapore. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



all  the  people of Singapore should be allowed  to

hear  the  views of all the Parties. Then and  then

only  can  it be said that the electors  have  been

given a fair chance to decide for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government say that this Bill has been based

and  modelled  on the provisions of  the  Singapore

Legislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance.  But  we

find  that  many important aspects of the Elections

Ordinance   have  been  omitted,  deliberately   or

otherwise,   in   the  present   Referendum   Bill.

Therefore,  if the assurance given by the  Minister

for  Home  Affairs that canvassing will be  allowed

excepting on polling day, then we say it is a  good

thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of

clarification. Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is it correct that the Minister for

Home  Affairs  said - that is correct,  there  is  no

misunderstanding there, canvassing will be  allowed

except on polling day? Thank you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But even then, Sir, I will

need  further clarification, because I am not  sure

whether  canvassing will be allowed  all  the  time

until  the day of poll. Will canvassing be  allowed

during  the  so-called period of  referendum?  What

does it mean? That is enough, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of information, Mr

Speaker. Sir,I have said in my speech earlier that

canvassing is allowed except on polling  day,  just

as in the general elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am very glad to have that

assurance.  Then  I need not elaborate  on  certain

points  in  order to impress on the P.A.P. leaders

the  importance of a campaign to present the  views

properly and in all perspective to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another principle we wish to emphasise, Sir, is

that  all  political  Parties  represented  in  the

Assembly must he allowed to provide polling  agents

and counting agents. I am glad also that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



Government has accepted our amendment, but I  might

point out that at the present moment the Bill  only

provides  that  the  Superintendent  may   at   his

discretion allow. We feel that we cannot allow  the

Superintendent  such  discretionary  powers  in   a

referendum that concerns all Parties. We feel  that

there  must  be no discrimination and  all  Parties

must be allowed to check and see that everything is

carried out smoothly and satisfactorily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in the spirit of the Elections

Ordinance,  we  feel strict precautions  should  be

taken to prevent possible malpractice in the voting

in the referendum. I see also that the Minister has

agreed  to  certain provisions,  but  I  am  in  no

position  to  know right now, Sir,  what  the  full

implications are. They have to be studied. I  think

precautions are necessary. Now that the  Government

have   given  the  undertaking  that  a  referendum

petition will `be provided for, I will not touch on

that  particular  point. But the Government's  last

minute amendments leave very much to be desired. We

hope  the P.A.P. Government will heed our criticism

of the Bill. We understand the anxiety of the Prime

Minister and his colleagues to rush things through.

But  more  important for the good name of Singapore

and  for the success of parliamentary democracy  in

this  part of the world, let there be no suspicion,

not  even a whisper of dishonesty or foul play. The

amendments  that have been moved in  the  Bill  are

only  for  the  purpose  of ensuring  that  when  a

referendum  is  held,  it  will  be  as  clean  and

praiseworthy  as  the  elections  we  have  had  in

Singapore.  The  amendments  are  to  ensure   that

Singapore's politicians when in power will  not  be

allowed to imitate the election techniques  of  Ngo

Dinh Diem and Syngman Rhee. Let it not be said that

there  is referendum rigging in Singapore. Let  the

referendum be so conducted that it can be  seen  to

be  truly  fair, honest and completely above-board.

Let  there also be no cause for dissatisfaction  or

complaint.  Once there is distrust  in  the  proper

running  of  any part of the State machinery,  then

the rot sets in. Despite what the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



for  Home Affairs has said, we hope the P.A.P. will

still  consider and accept our amendments, and  the

amendments  of  other Opposition  Members,  in  the

proper spirit of service in the cause of the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add, Sir, that the Government might even

give us a categorical assurance that the referendum

will  be binding on the Government. I will not  say

more  on  this subject, Sir, as there is already  a

motion  which  will  deal  specifically  with   the

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me say how unreasonable the

Government  have been in the manner in  which  they

have  notified Members of the Opposition about  the

Government's amendments. The Government may try  to

justify   their  action  on  the  basis  that   the

amendments  have  been sent in within  the  legally

allowable time period. The National Referendum Bill

is  important, because on it will be based the  law

which  will decide the future of all the people  of

Singapore.  But their amendments to the  Bill  have

been  sent  in at the last moment only just  before

the  Bill  comes  up for Second Reading.  Sir,  the

Government  have long ago prepared  the  Referendum

Bill.  The  explanation of the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs  given a little while ago does not  deceive

anybody.  The Second Reading was supposed  to  have

taken  place two months ago. Now `many months after

the preparation of the Bill, amendments are sent in

at  the  last minute. What is the real  reason  for

this  sudden  pouncing on the Opposition  with  all

these amendments? Is it a deliberate attempt on the

part  of the Government to prevent sufficient  time

for   proper  study  of  the  amendments   by   the

Opposition?   Or  is  it  the  intention   of   the

Government to steamroller through this  Bill  with

the  amendments?  Why  is it  that  the  Opposition

Members   have  hardly  24  hours  to   study   the

Government amendments to a Government Bill that had

its  First  Reading four months ago? Is this  not,

Sir,  a  travesty  of the spirit  of  parliamentary

democracy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some really terrible amendments

proposed by the Government. They are some  of  the

most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



undemocratic  proposals that we have ever  seen  in

the whole of Singapore. But we shall deal with them

when  we come to the Committee stage, Sir.  All  in

all,  this is a most unhealthy state of affairs.  I

he  indecent manner in which the Government try  to

keep Opposition Members in the dark about important

national  matters  until the very  last  minute  is

contrary  to  the normal practice of  parliamentary

democracy.  I  may say, Sir, that it is  a  perfect

example of parliamentary dictatorship in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> P.A.P. democracy!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,I

rise  to support the principle of the Bill. I  have

listened with glee to the not so lengthy speech  of

the  Member for Queenstown when he tried to explain

that  a  national  referendum  is  not  a  national

referendum. But I can understand, Sir, why he is so

bitter against his ox-comrades in the P.A.P. I  can

also  feel with him when he described the  remnants

of  the  P.A.P. as being people capable  of  doing

twists and turns, and doing all sorts of things  in

a manner that has a basis of party politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very glad to hear from the Minister in

his  speech  just  now  that  the  prohibition   of

canvassing  in  clause  42  will  be  amended.   He

referred to the amendment sent in by the Government

to  apply  only on polling day. Sir, I  read  these

amendments  yesterday, and since the  Minister  has

made his speech, I have read it again. I would like

to  point  out  to  him, Sir,  that  the  amendment

proposed by him does not carry out what he  intends

to  do.  The prohibition on canvassing is  still  a

total  prohibition, hut in so far as  a  man  going

into a house more than once is concerned, he can go

in more than once so long as it is not polling day.

But  if it is polling day, then that is canvassing.

I  would ask the Minister to consult his colleague,

the  Minister  for Health and Law, on  whether  the

amendment put in by him bears out his statement  of

prohibiting canvassing only on polling day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reference has been made in the Bill, to

referendum meetings. It first appears in clause  34

and   it   comes   in  again  in  clause   45.   No

interpretation   has  been  given   of   referendum

meetings to be held by political Parties. Moreover,

clause 42 - prohibition on canvassing - even with  the

amendments  proposed  by  the  Minister  for   Home

Affairs,  will  prohibit the holding of  referendum

meetings, because a referendum meeting, after  all,

is a sort of mass canvassing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Sir,In regard to the

appointing  of polling agents and counting  agents,

this  right is being confined to political  Parties

represented in the Legislative Assembly. Is it  the

intention  of the Government that in  the  case  of

referendum  meetings, after suitable amendments  to

clause  42,  that  the  right  to  hold  referendum

meetings  should  also  be  confined  to  political

Parties in the Legislative Assembly? If it  is  so,

it should be made clear in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown is very fond of

challenging  the P.A.P. to a general election,  but

he   has   supported  this  Bill  subject  to   the

amendments which he has put in. Surely,  Sir,  with

the  National  Referendum Bill, a general  election

could  be avoided. I think one of the first  things

the  P.A.P. could and should put  forward  to  the

electorate to decide is whether or not the  P.A.P.,

when  they came in with 43 Members, and now reduced

to 26, still have the confidence of the electorate.

Do the electorate want them to remain in cilice for

the  next  two  years? That is a simple  thing.  A

referendum  on  that  matter  would,  I  am   sure,

disclose that to us. There is no need for a genera1

election.  The  referendum  will  disclose  to   us

whether  or not the P.A.P. is as good as  it  makes

itself out to be. And if the P.A.P. is knocked  out

in  a referendum of that kind, there is no need for

a  merger referendum. The answer is the same. If it

is  knocked out, then the answer is there. Go ahead

with  your merger proposals. I would ask the Member

for  Queenstown  to get away from  that  particular

hobby  of  his  that every time  there  must  be  a

general election. General elections would mean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



the  Barisan Sosialis coming out too, and I do  not

think  all the 13 Barisan Sosialis Members  sitting

behind  me will be returned. I doubt it very  much.

Whether or not the P.A.P. after having bluffed  the

electorate  in returning them with 43 Members,  now

reduced  to  a shambles of 26, should  continue  in

office for the next two years would be a very  good

question to pose in a national referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many amendments proposed by

Members   of  the  Opposition  and  also   by   the

Government. We will not therefore waste the time of

the  House on the Second Reading of this Bill other

than  to say that I will have a lot to say  on  the

various clauses of the Bill when the Bill is in the

Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to symbols, there is one thing I

would  like  to  touch on. It is right  that  there

should  be  symbols. But I would ask the Government

to bear in mind that such symbols should not have a

religious character or that such symbols should not

bear  any  relationship to the symbols of political

Parties.



<br><br>7.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, in

most democratic countries vital issues such as  the

constitutional future of the State are decided in a

referendum.  In  this country, the Government  will

sumbit such an issue to the people for a vote based

on that practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the exchange of letters between political

Parties  of  this Assembly and the  Leader  of  the

House, we demanded on the 18th of September,  1961,

that   the  Government  should  submit  its  merger

proposals to the people for a vote in a referendum.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we have  today  this  National

Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, matters have gone very fast

since  then,  and even though the Government  might

have  second  thoughts  about  the  result  of  the

referendum, it is very difficult for them  to  pull

out  from  their position, and we believe they  are

fully  committed to a referendum. What is important

now is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



not  whether a referendum will or will not be held,

but  the  most vital issue now posed to the  people

is,  what will be the question posed to them for  a

decision?  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  it  is  no  use  our

debating in this House whether time will be allowed

for   canvassing,   or  whether   there   will   be

electioneering  facilities  allowed  to  political

Parties in this Assembly during the referendum,  if

the  people  are asked to choose in the referendum,

for  instance, between the devil and the deep  blue

sea; or between a tiger and, alternatively, to jump

into  a  deep  ravine; or either to choose  eating,

like  during the Japanese occupation, ubi  kayu  or

sago   powder.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  feel  that

provisions should be added to the Bill whereby  the

political Parties in, this Assembly should come  to

an agreement on the question to be posed before the

people.   If  the  people,  for  instance,   in   a

referendum  on  merger are asked to choose  whether

they  prefer the P.A.P. type of merger as contained

in  the  White  Paper, or whether they  prefer  the

Malacca and Penang type of merger whereby all  non-Singapore  born citizens would be deprived  of  all

citizenship,  including Singapore citizenship,  and

thus  becoming stateless; if the people in  such  a

referendum  are asked to choose between  these  two

alternatives,  then  what  is  the   use   of   our

canvassing  or asking time to canvass,  because  we

would then canvass for the people to choose whether

they  like the devil or whether they like  to  jump

into  the  deep blue sea? Therefore,  Mr  Speaker.

Sir,  it  is our contention that the most  pressing

issue  is  to request the Government that  an  All-Party meeting be called to discuss the question  to

be posed to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all other technicalities of the

electioneering campaign or the referendum  campaign

are  of  less  importance. These can  be  discussed

among the Parties after this vital issue of what is

the  question and what are the alternatives  to  be

posed before the people has been settled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Do I take it that the hon.

Member is advocating an amendment to clause  5,  or

is  he speaking completely out of the ambit of  the

Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just

emphasising   the  fact  that  the  Bill   has   no

provisions  which  makes  it  compulsory  for   the

Government  to  consult  other  political   Parties

represented   in  this  Assembly,  because   in   a

referendum  the most important thing is,  what  are

the people being asked to' choose? That is the idea

of  a  referendum. It is no use having a Referendum

Bill  if the Opposition Parties do not know or have

no say in what are the questions the people will be

asked to choose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Government would be

greatly obliged and indebted to the Member for Hong

Lim  if  he  could,  with  his  wide  knowledge  of

democratic  practice  in  other  countries  of  the

world,  give  us  a precedent from which  to  copy,

where  the Ordinance or the enactment provides  for

consultation with the Opposition Parties, in  order

that we could give it due consideration? Australia,

for instance. Perhaps he may he able to help us  in

that respect?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful

for  the question posed by the Prime Minister. That

is  why it is all the more necessary that we should

have an All-Party meeting so that we could give our

views to the Prime Minister and to the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. We will have an All-Party meeting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for instance

in Australia, when the Government was going to pass

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



Communist Party Dissolution Bill several years ago,

the  views of the Opposition Parties were obtained.

They were allowed to campaign. They were allowed to

send  their leaflets through the post. At the  same

time,  Government leaflets were allowed to be  sent

through  the  post. These are things which  we  can

bring  to the notice of the Government at  an  All-Party meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we accept

all  these valuable suggestions and proposals  from

the  Member for Hong Lim. If he could point to that

section  of the Australian Referendum Ordinance  or

statute which provides for all these things, we are

bound  to  give it all due consideration.  We  will

accept  all  his valuable suggestions and  we  will

have  an  All-Party meeting to consider  all  these

valuable suggestions. It is most helpful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that is

the case, I suggest that the Government commit this

Referendum Bill to Select Committee, where  we  can

discuss   these  things  and  we  will   give   the

information to the State Advocate-General  for  him

to write to the Australian Government to supply all

the requisite information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a further point of

information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Regarding the example which

the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  has  given  about  the

dissolution of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



the  Australian Communist Party, is he thinking  of

posing  the  question whether the Barisan  Sosialis

should  be  dissolved in a referendum?  Perhaps  he

will get the help of all the, other Parties in this

House. We will send out -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Is the Prime

Minister  permitted to abuse the privilege  in  the

manner he is doing?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Prime Minister rose on a

point  of  elucidation.  Perhaps  he  is  asking  a

question  which the Member for Hong  Lim  is  quite

capable  of answering. I do not think he  will  ask

the Member for Anson to answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it shows that

when  the Prime Minister is confronted with  facts,

he  dare  not  answer the questions straight  away.

Would he agree -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I agreed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - that the Bill be committed to a

Select Committee -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I thought the Prime

Minister  was  just asking for certain  information

from the Member for Hong Lim, that is, what section

of  the  Australian Ordinance on referenda provides

for All-Party consultations? The Prime Minister  is

not running away from facts. Nobody is running away

from facts. We are asking for facts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Therefore, it is our view that

we  commit this Bill to a Select Committee  whereby

we  will  get all the facts as to what happened  in

Australia during the referendum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



they  had  12  years  ago. It is  no  use  for  the

Minister  for  Finance to ask me, what  section  of

what Ordinance was passed in the Eskimo Parliament?

Mr  Speaker, Sir, if he is really keen on  getting

facts,  have an All-Party meeting. We will get  the

State  Advocate-General to write to the  Australian

Government. We will even send a team of people from

the  Elections  Office  and the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs  there to study and follow the practice  of

the Australian referendum held years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, various speakers,

including the Member for Queenstown -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A point of elucidation must refer

to -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, to the Member for Hong

Lim. All that appeal to noble democratic practices.

All  we want is for them to give some instances  of

these   noble   democratic   practices   in   other

countries. Surely it is a very fair question to ask

of   people,   who   evoke  very  high   democratic

principles, just where these principles  are  being

observed  in  the  most  democratic  of  democratic

countries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I have

already said just now that during the referendum in

Australia the voters were posed this question:  "Do

you agree to the Communist Party Dissolution Bill?"

Yes or no. Now, will the Prime Minister just answer

this  question straight away, or will the  Minister

for  Home  Affairs do so later in his  reply?  What

would be the question posed?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must stop the hon.

Member  for  Hong  Lim.  We are  now  debating  the

general  merits  and principle  of  the  Bill.  The

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



is  going  into  details. He wants, in  effect,  an

amendment  to clause 5. I have not seen any  notice

of amendment which he has sent in. Let us now carry

on  with  the general merits and principle  of  the

Bill  and  not  as  to  how  the  Bill  is  to   be

implemented.  If  in Australia the  Government  did

consider  that  the  Opposition Parties  should  be

consulted, that, I take it, was a matter of how the

Bill should be implemented. But whether there is  a

condition in the Australian Ordinance or Australian

Act  that  the  matter  must  be  referred  to  the

Opposition Parties, I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Could I, on a point of

elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I say this, Mr Speaker,

Sir?  When we postponed the Second Reading  of  the

Bill  from January to March on account of the  many

amendments that were proposed to be moved, we  were

accused of wanting to run away from the referendum.

Now,  it is suggested very seriously by the  Member

for Hong Lim that, in all fairness, the Bill should

be referred to a Select Committee in order that all

democratic practices could be incorporated  in  it.

Sir,  far  be  it  from the Government  to  try  to

railroad  through the Bill, or otherwise  give  the

Opposition  no chance - although it has  already  had

two months to consider all the amendments it wishes

to  put in, including any useful provisions in  the

Australian statute - if it is the considered wish  of

the whole of the Opposition to refer this Bill to a

Select  Committee, we are quite prepared to let  it

be a free vote of the Opposition to let the Bill go

to  Select Committee, on condition that the Bill is

reported  back before the end of April, or  by  the

end   of  April.  That  is  the  position  of   the

Government. I do not want it ever to be  suggested'

that we are undemocratic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

said,  the only other thing which I would  like  to

raise is -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, before I forget a

matter.  At the end of the Second Reading, let  the

Member  for Hong Lim move that the Bill be referred

to   a   Select  Committee,  but  the  Government's

condition is that the Select Committee is to report

back to the Assembly before the end of April.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Very fair, very fair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we want this

Bill   to  be  discussed  properly  in  the  Select

Committee.  How could we in the Opposition  make  a

decision  whether  the Bill will  be  ready  before

April  or  not? It is for the Select  Committee  to

push  through the Bill and try to hurry  it  up  as

quickly as possible. But we will move that the Pill

be referred to a Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Now the Barisan is in

difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just

refer  to  one  of the important amendments  to  be

moved  by  the Minister for Home Affairs, i.e.,  if

people  do  not vote, they will be deemed  to  have

voted  with  what is passed by the Assembly,  which

means,  if it is on the issue of merger, the P.A.P.

merger proposals as contained in Cmd. Paper  33  of

1961. Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government  will

be   able,  in  their  reply,  to  quote  in   what

particular  section of other Referendum  Ordinances

in  other  parts  of  the  world  this, particular

provision has appeared.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishing to speak?

Mr Ong Pang Boon then in reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Anson wish to

speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Because if I call the Minister, the

Member for Anson will lose his opportunity.



<br><br>7.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in medieval times

there  were alchemists who sought to transmute  mud

into  gold  and  failed. The P.A.P. has  the  most

unhappy  propensity  of  successfully  transmutting

gold into mud. Sir, the concept of a referendum  is

pure gold. It is a concept of direct democracy, and

direct  democracy is of course, the  ultimate  just

method   of  government.  It  is  in  large   areas

cumbersome  in  practice and  impractical  for  the

normal work of government, and, unfortunately,  far

too   little  used  in  the  British  Commonwealth.

Nevertheless, it has been indicated by the previous

speaker  that it has an honourable history both  in

Switzerland and in Australia, and we have  recently

seen  it working in France. The power of referendum

to  the people is a sign of political maturity.  If

the P.A.P. had it worked as one would have like  it

to  work  in  this  matter, it  could  have  earned

legitimate credit for a valuable measure. But, Sir,

some people are only comfortable when living in mud

and  we  have  had  this curious  position  that  a

valuable  provision in an important Bill  has  been

messed around, manoeuvred in the traditional P.A.P.

style.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member has just said,

"Very fair, very fair!"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We had this Bill for debate on I

think  it  was  the  15th  of  January.  Opposition

Members  put  in amendments by the 4th of  January,

giving  the Government ten clear days at  the  time

for  the  amendments to get from you, Sir,  to  the

Minister and other Members. It is true there were a

number  of amendments. Mr Speaker, Sir, they  had'

ten whole days. With their State Advocate-General's

Department  and  all the Ministers concerned,  they

could not .digest those amendments. If it was  true

that  they could not, they could quite easily  have

submitted the matter to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



Select  Committee  and  between  15th  January  and

today,  14th  March, it is two  whole  months.  The

Prime  Minister suggests that we should now  commit

the Bill to Select Committee -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - and he has very fairly agreed to

the  suggestion with a limitation the  validity  of

which  I can see, limiting the period of six weeks.

We  could have done that and completed the agony of

the  minute  examination of this Bill during  these

two  months.  On  the excuse that  they  wanted  to

consider the Opposition's amendments, ten days were

not  enough for them, Sir. Now we have seven  pages

of  amendments filed two days ago by the Government

containing amendments to seven clauses, and 12  new

clauses  which they expect us on this side  of  the

House to digest and cope with in two days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, many of those amendments

are really amendments to the amendments proposed by

the  Opposition. Instead of giving two  clear  days

notice, we could very well have given no notice  at

all, and in Committee stage move the amendments  to

the  Opposition's amendments. In fairness, we  gave

notice as if they were new amendments. I think  the

Member   for   Anson   must  be   quite   fair   in

acknowledging that we have the right, if we  wanted

to  spring any surprise, to move the amendments  to

his amendments in Committee without notice.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Prime Minister is misinformed,

Mr  Speaker. Sir,If he will look at his list,  he

will  find that none of them are those which  could

have been moved as amendments to our amendments  He

is completely misinformed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All your petitions?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Now, Sir, he refers to my petitions

but   I  take  it  he  means  the  provisions   for

referendum petitions that I seek to incorporate. He

could not have moved those by way of amendments  to

my   amendments,  although,  in  fairness  to   the

Minister -  or  whoever  did  the  work  for   him - I

wholeheartedly agree that the provisions, except in

one  aspect  with which I shall deal in  Committee,

spell out what 1 seek more extensively than I  have

done  myself.  But  they  cannot  be  said  to   be

amendments  to my amendments in any shape  at  all.

They have taken the ideas and incorporated them and

insofar  as  they  go, I have no  complaints,  Sir,

except that I should have liked a little more  time

to  deal  with them. But the interesting  point  is

this.  The  Government find ten days too little  to

examine our amendments, but throw seven pages at us

with  12  new clauses and seven new amendments  and

expect  us to deal with them in two days.  That  is

the unhappy approach of the P.A.P. to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have indicated that the principle of the

Bill  is one that I welcome. In the amendments that

we from this side of the House have tabled, we have

sought to clean up extremely suspicious provisions.

We  have also sought to introduce provisions  where

there is a complete lacuna. I am happy to note that

the  particular lacuna of referendum petitions has,

in  fact,  been recognised by the Government,  even

though it took them two whole months plus ten days'

previous notice in order to put in not merely last-minute  amendments if it please you.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, but more than twelfth-hour amendments, because

these amendments were, in fact, not tabled in  time

for discussion today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Workers' Party would have

liked  to  see  introduced in this  Bill  provision

whereby a percentage of the electors could petition

His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to hold a

referendum at any time - and I am not being  personal

here - as to whether any government in office  should

remain  in  office, as an additional check  to  the

arrogance of absolute power of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



which  the  Prime Minister has so much  experience.

However, we in the Workers' Party -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Am

I  to understand that on the Second Reading of this

Bill, the Member for Anson is introducing a further

amendment of which he has not given notice?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any Member of this Assembly can

comment  during the Second Reading on any  omission

in  the  Bill,  and  this is  an  omission.  He  is

entitled to comment on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is not moving an

amendment, I hope?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Once upon a time, the Prime

Minister was referred to as a young man in a hurry.

Shall we say now he is just a man in a hurry? If he

had  waited,  Mr Speaker, I was going  to  mention

that  we in the Workers' Party are practical people

and  conscious  that this referendum  is  primarily

intended - or  so we hope - to give an opportunity  to

our  people  to vote on the issue of  the  proposed

closer  relations  with the  Federation.  In  these

circumstances, it is not our intention to introduce

what  might  be controversial features which  would

delay the passing of the Bill and which would bring

acrimony to what we had hoped would otherwise be an

easy  passage. There are undesirable'  features  of

this  Bill  which can and should be dealt  with  by

this Assembly. The principal one is that everything

seems  to  be  what the Government will.  The  Bill

seeks to give the Party in power the right to  call

for a referendum when it wishes and in such form as

it  wishes, raising a confusing number of questions

if it wishes, appointing officers in control of the

counting of votes, which I am now glad to hear will

be subject to some check.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To every check.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Now at last, not originally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, there are amendments which this

Government  have  brought to cur  notice  and  with

which I say to you quite frankly I have not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



been able to cope adequately under the pressure  of

other work. But I was very interested to note  that

the  Minister for Home Affairs was as bashful as  a

blushing  stork  hiding its head in  the  sands  in

ignoring    the    rather    horrible    provisions

incorporated in this notice of amendment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person whose ballot paper is unmarked or is

uncertain  shall  be  deemed to  be  a  person  who

accepts or is willing to accept the decision of the

Legislative Assembly on the matter referred [to  in

the Assembly].'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I take it that  ballot  papers

unmarked can belong to those who are dead and I  am

not  surprised that the P.A.P. seek to canvass  the

cemeteries  since they can expect few living  human

beings  who  will support them. But I  should  have

thought -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member suggesting that

there  are  provisions to ensure that blank  ballot

papers belonging to those who are dead are put into

ballot boxes to be counted?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the words are

"Any person whose ballot paper is unmarked".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is just put into the ballot

box.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not necessarily, Mr Speaker,

Sir - "Any  person whose ballot paper is unmarked  or

is uncertain". I think whoever drafted that may not

have  been  aware of the conscious  desire  of  the

P.A.P. to canvass the cemeteries but, in fact, made

such  provision. I would, however, point  out  that

even  if  they do not canvass the cemeteries,  they

must  be  indeed  bankrupt to have  to  scrape  the

bottom  of the barrel to this extent, that whatever

is ambiguous shall be the Government's vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In the Assembly, Sir, they have

this  majority  of  one which  they  have  used  to

steamroller us and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



is  this majority of one which gives them the right

to speak of the vote for the Assembly but, in fact,

it  is  the  P.A.P. seeking these ambiguous  votes,

pleading for these ambiguous votes to be made votes

for the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Anson never

made  this  accusation, Sir,  because  he  probably

never harboured these thoughts; but the Member  for

Queenstown  over a radio forum said that  Singapore

was  so poor in democracy that the people were  not

equipped for advanced democratic processes  like  a

referendum, so that in order to take care of  those

who  might fall into his category of people who are

unable   to  live  up  to  the  matured  democratic

processes  we bring in the aid of the Assembly  for

them.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am indebted to the Prime

Minister. I thought he sought elucidation from  me,

but let us forgive him. I am very interested to see

now  actually put into words by the Prime  Minister

what I understand to be the P.A.P. philosophy.  The

maxim  and  the  foundation  stone  of  the  P.A.P.

approach  to  the  people  is  that  the  voter  of

Singapore  is a blind chicken. Now if  the  Barisan

Sosialis, who retain certain remnants of the P.A.P.

contact,  have  also  got the same  idea  that  the

voters  of Singapore are blind chickens, I am  sure

they  will soon disabuse themselves. But it is very

interesting  to note the parentage  of  this  idea,

that  the  P.A.P. is seeking to look  after  these

blind chickens by claiming them as its own. Anybody

who  cannot  make up his mind, the P.A.P. has  got

him.  I hope that only those with empty minds  will

ever support the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will notice a matter which I know was

stressed to some extent by the Member for Hong  Lim

but  which I fear did not sufficiently receive  the

appreciation which it merited, and that is that the

provisions  of  this Bill permit the  Government  a

confusing number of questions without any check  by

any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



organisation  at all. Sir, far be  it  from  me  to

suggest  that the P.A.P. would wish to be dishonest

towards these blind chickens. They know that  blind

chickens can be driven forward before them, as they

have  driven the poor misguided voters before  them

in  the  last  elections. But I do say,  Sir,  that

there  should be at least a debate in this Assembly

in  respect of the question that is going to be put

to  the  people  and that there should  not  be  an

unfettered  discretion in, the  Government  whereby

the  people can be confused and the people  can  be

misled by the form of the question -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, equal pay for

equal  work  is  the  heart-throb  of  every  trade

unionist,  and wherever workers get organised  this

call is taken up and repeated from time to time. In

Singapore  the demand for equal pay for equal  work

by women teachers and women in other professions in

the Government service dates back many, many years.

And political Parties join in the fight. The S.P.A.

too  stands for parity for women. This  is  a  very

important issue and the Government's acceptance  of

the  principle of equal pay for equal work  is  one

which we welcome and support.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We accuse the Government,

however,  of insincerity, of playing party politics

and  of  using this apparent acceptance as a  vote-catching  device.  We  accuse  the  Government   of

insincerity.  If  it were sincere,  why  should  it

delay full implementation until



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



1965?  And why should new women recruits be engaged

at the starting point of the scales for women? Why

1965, when the natural life of the Government  will

come  to  an end by May 1964? Why 1965, when  equal

pay for equal work was one of its election pledges?

We accuse the Government of playing party politics.

And  we  base our accusation on the fact  that  the

Minister  for  Finance made known the  Government's

acceptance  of this principle through  pre-arranged

correspondence with the Women Affairs Bureau of the

P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Whereas equal pay for equal

work  is a long-standing demand of Government trade

unions. I would not like to say, Sir, that, because

the  Singapore  Teachers' Union is  not  under  the

control  of the P.A.P. that was why this Union  was

conveniently brushed aside in this manner. I cannot

help but recall that in the partial restoration  of

the  pay  cuts, the Minister for Finance made  full

use  of  the Amalgamated Union of Public  Employees

through  their  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the

Minister for Culture. Unfortunately for the P.A.P.,

this  political stunt resulted in the disgrace  and

exposure   of  the  A.U.P.E., because   what   the

A.U.P.E.,  through the Parliamentary  Secretary  to

the  Minister for Culture, was prepared  to  accept

was  thrown  out  by  the  gathering  momentum   of

resentment  of  the large number of civil  servants

who  belong to other trade unions which  look  upon

the  A.U.P.E. as the biggest yellow union.  Why  is

the Women Affairs Bureau of the P.A.P, used in this

particular instance? Is it because the scheme is so

insincere  and  that  the  P.A.P.'s  Women  Affairs

Bureau  can be relied upon to keep mum? As a Member

of this Assembly, I insist that the proper place to

make  such  an important pronouncement is  in  this

Chamber, and the political stunt indulged in by the

Minister  for  Finance  in this  regard  is  to  be

thoroughly  condemned. We accuse the Government  of

using this apparent acceptance of the principle  of

equal pay for equal work as a vote-catching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



device.  The  people  know that  the  P.A.P. as  a

Government and as a political Party is dead.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And they are waiting

impatiently  to do the burial service when  general

elections take place.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> For the S.P.A., is it not?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Although the natural life of

the  Government  extends to May  1964,  the  P.A.P.

cannot  hope to last that long and they  know  that

general  elections will be sooner than  they  like.

Therefore, the P.A.P. are desperate and  must  make

full use of -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - the opportunity while they are

still   in  office  to  cash  in  on  vote-catching

devices.  Women voters form half the electorate  of

Singapore, and so parity for women will provide the

draw they hope.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Mountbatten had

better watch out!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Three years of P.A.P. misrule

have  caused  great  hardship  to  the  people   of

Singapore, and it is the women who suffer the most.

It  is the mothers and wives of the unemployed  and

the  under-employed who suffer more  than  the  men

themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are doing better than you

were doing before, you know.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Do the P.A.P. hope in this way

to  make out that they are the staunch champions of

women's  rights?  Can, they explain,  if  they  are

staunch champions of women's rights, why they  have

refused  to  allow  8th March to be  celebrated  as

Women's  Day?  Such  celebrations  [Laughter] -  the

Minister for Finance may laugh - were allowed  to  be

held even during the reprehensible colonial days -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> And the Lim Yew Hock

Government days.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - and during the time of the

previous Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You embarrassing yourself,

you know.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have raised this matter

on the Adjournment in order to make it clear to the

Minister  that  the  place to  make  any  important

pronouncement  is here, and that he should  refrain

from  indulging  in  playing political  stunts  in,

matters of this character.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not take very much

time, Sir. The P.A.P. has degenerated so much that

even its new-found allies have to attack it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal of equal pay for equal work, as

everybody  knows, is a very insincere vote-catching

device  of the P.A.P. They know that all the  women

in  Singapore as well as women all over  the  world

have been campaigning for equal pay for equal work.

And  just when Women's Day was about to come along,

they  took the opportunity to send special  letters

to  the  Women's Bureau of the P.A.P. and announced

to  the whole of Singapore that now they intend  to

treat women equally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has already been divulged by the Member for

Cairnhill -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Are you a staunch supporter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - this is a belated effort of the

P.A.P. because it was originally a P.A.P. election

promise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We have kept our promise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole idea at the present

moment is to buy votes. That it was really a sudden

impulse and not a thought-out effort on the part of

the P.A.P. to give equal treatment to the women can

be seen from the fact that the Minister for Finance

does  not  even know how much money is involved  in

their  effort  to  please the women  in  the  civil

service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What makes you think I do not

know?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If it were really known, it

would  have  been mentioned in the  debate  on  the

Budget. But no such thing was mentioned. Even today

the  Minister  for Finance does not know  how  much

money  is  involved. This completely shows  what  a

sudden impulse it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agreed this is a very good effort, although

belated,  because  this  is  another  step  forward

towards  the  emancipation of women. But  the  only

unfortunate  part is, as has already  been  pointed

out by the Member for Cairnhill, if they are really

sincere about the whole thing, then how is it  that

they do not recognise 8th March as Women's Day?  I

remember  in  the  heydays  when  the  P.A.P. was

popular,  the  present Minister  for  Home  Affairs

himself  led  a  delegation to see the  then  Chief

Minister about Women's Day. At that time the P.A.P.

wanted the 8th of March to be proclaimed as Women's

Day  as well as a public holiday. But unfortunately

they  have now changed their minds. So how can they

really be sincere about their intention to help the

women in our society?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, one must remember that

there is this merger proposal of the P.A.P. and the

forthcoming referendum. So the P.A.P., knowing that

their  days are numbered and hoping to push through

their  merger proposals all the same, want to  make

sure  that  they gain as much support as they  can.

But  let  us remind the P.A.P. leaders: while  they

say  they  are  trying to help one section  of  the

people, they are also trying to mask the fact  that

they are in fact selling out the rights of all  the

people of Singapore. And in their helping the women

in  the  civil service at the present moment,  they

are  only  helping a small section of the women  of

Singapore. The really deserving cases, the poor who

really need all the help from the P.A.P., have  yet

to  get any support and help from the P.A.P. And we

with that they will see -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are even reading his

script now, is it not?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - about this matter. Yes, this

is written by the Prime Minister of Singapore, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Dr Lee Siew Choh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is another matter that I

would like to bring to the attention of this House.

At  the  present moment, the P.A.P.,  knowing  that

they  will  have  hardly any hopes  in  any  future

general  elections, are now trying to  do  all  the

best  things  they can. They want  to  do  all  the

things that they can do, all the things that appeal

to  the people, and ignore all the really important

and  difficult  tasks. For example,  they  want  to

build houses. Every time they open a school, it  is

advertised  in all the papers. They want  everybody

to  know about it. When they build a standpipe, it

again  is  in  the  papers.  And  again  they  want

everybody  to know about it. All these  are  simple

things  which  can be seen and can  appeal  to  the

people. They want to make sure that they have  some

results to show to the people when the time  comes.

But     the    really    difficult    tasks    like

industrialisation, the education  policy,  and  the

unemployment  problem - what  are  they  doing  about

them? They do not seem to know what to do.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So they ignore the important

tasks  which will help to improve the  lot  of  the

people  and instead do things which they  know  are

insincere, and are not meant to help the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Only three minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as one who

has been fighting for equal pay, I am very glad  to

hear  that  the  Government  is  implementing   the

principle of equal pay for equal work for women  at

last.  But  I  am disappointed that  the  years  of

struggle,  the  years  of  appeal  by  myself,  the

struggle by professional women associations and the

Teachers'  Union have all been ignored.  All  of  a

sudden, from nowhere, out of the blue, the Chairman

of the Women's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



Section  of  the  P.A.P. said in  a  memorandum - and

there  you are, it was granted. Everybody can judge

what it is. There is no need for me to describe it.

But  what  I  want  to draw the  attention  of  the

Minister  to is this. The fact that the  Government

have  accepted this means that they have the money.

I   would  like  to  remind  the  Minister  of  the

injustice  that is still being perpetrated  by  the

Government  concerning the pay cuts. If  they  find

that  they have the money, they should correct this

injustice. When the restoration of the pay cuts was

made,  it  was  said that it was a  result  of  the

closer  relationship  with the  Federation.  May  I

inquire whether this equal pay is also a result  of

closer relationship with the Federation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

story  in Aesop's Fables about a fox. The fox tried

to  eat  some  grapes, but after jumping  for  them

several times, it did not succeed in getting at the

grapes and eating them. So the fox went away saying

that the grapes were sour. Right across this Table,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we see, so to speak, a bunch  of

foxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A vixen!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> A vixen. It is quite

inappropriate for one former Chief Minister to  say

the grapes are sour. Why did he not do it - this vote-catching? And another former Chief Minister saying,

"Hear, hear!" They had their chance when they  were

in control of the Government, Mr Speaker, Sir. All

these  women professional associations, this,  that

and the other appealed for years. They listened  to

their voice which went unheeded in, the desert air -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee remained standing. Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister has very little

time in which to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He has given away.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> During the time of the two ex-Chief Ministers, finance was in the hands of a

colonial  master and he was the man who said  "yes"

or "no", and not the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Poor chaps. You were stooges.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this is a ghastly

admission  that the Government could not  tell  the

Financial Secretary what to do. I mean this is just

a  feeble  excuse and a pretext. The two  foxes  in

this  instance never even attempted the jump.  Sir,

let  us not be so stupid as to say that this  is  a

vote  catching stunt. There is no general  election

round the corner.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. If the

Minister  cannot speak without abuse, I suggest  he

does not speak at all. I take objection to the word

"fox". I take objection to the word "stupid".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think probably the Member for

Anson is a bit too late in taking objection to  the

word  "fox". It was used five minutes ago.  But  as

regards the word "stupid", I think that is  a  very

laudable    parliamentary    word    in     certain

circumstances  and  has been used,  I  think,  very

often by Members of the Opposition Benches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am rather surprised that the

Member for Anson should raise an objection. I mean,

Sir, you must allow me to say that he has a very

rich vocabulary -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In fact, the Chair has more

or less indicated that that is so. The Member for

Anson has a very rich vocabulary. But I do not

think the Minister for Finance should debate that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So, Sir, we will dismiss all

these allegations of vote-catching with the

contempt that they deserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they say, why announce this thing in a

letter to the P.A.P. Women's League? Why not write,

for instance, to the Singapore Teachers' Union, the

professional women's association and so forth?  The

reason is quite simple. On



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



the 3rd November, the Women's Affairs Bureau of the

Party  sent a memorandum to me and, indeed, sent  a

delegation  to  see  me  about  this  matter.  From

November  to  March we had to do some pretty  rapid

calculation  of  what would be the consequences  of

implementing  the proposals that they  set  out  in

their  memorandum. I do not think we have been  too

dilatory about this. The simple fact of the  matter

is  that from November to March the researches that

my Ministry conducted showed that it is financially

possible  immediately to implement this  policy  of

equal pay for equal work. The Member for Queenstown

was  foolish enough to say that we had made no such

calculations. In fact, we did. If it might interest

him,  the cost of this exercise for the next  three

years,  after which the female salary scales  would

be  abolished - it  has  been  worked  out  in  close

detail - amounts to this. This year we will spend  an

additional  $395,000. Next year we  will  spend  an

additional  $92,000, and the year  after  $404,000.

After that, further additional increments the  full

effect  of which will span the whole salary  scales

in  the occupations affected. So it is quite untrue

to  say that this decision came about by way  of  a

sudden  impulse. We clearly stated in our  election

campaign that the Party, if elected to power, would

carry  out the policy of equal pay for equal  work.

Indeed,  if I may be permitted to quote the  actual

text of the speech made by Madam Chan Choy Siong on

8th  March, 1959, when she spoke on behalf  of  the

Party at a pre-election rally at Bukit Panjang:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is no place in a socialist society for

exploitation  of  women. The PAP, believes  in  the

principle of equal pay for equal work. This may not

be  possible immediately. It must he achieved  step

by step without dislocating our economy.'.



<br><br>And the present policy that we are now implementing

is  just  the fulfilment of a pledge that  we  made

before the electorate in March 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, although we announced this policy

of  equal  pay  for  equal  work  in  reply  to   a

memorandum received from the P.A.P. Women's League,

we do not intend to disregard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



the   efforts   and  campaigns  of  other   women's

organisations.  They made their representations  in

the  past.  Unfortunately, these  appeals  fell  on

stony  ground and bore no fruit. But I am sure  the

Member  for Mountbatten, for instance, could hardly

expect  us  to  announce this new  policy  to  such

associations as have never made representations  to

us on this point at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one surprising thing about this issue is

that, strange to behold, the Barisan Sosialis,  the

Workers' Party and the U.P.P. have joined together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not necessarily the Barisan!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As I have said, this is just a

question of sour grapes. The foxes cannot  get  the

grapes and so they say the grapes are sour.  May  I

suggest  to  the  foxes that the  next  thing  they

should do is to cut off their tails?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the gentleman who

has  just  referred  to  all  of  us  as  foxes  is

unfortunately   too  churlish  to   recognise   the

contribution  of  the  Member  for  Mountbatten  in

persuading  him  to come to his fox-like  decision.

Let  us  recognise in this House  that  it  is  the

Member  for  Mountbatten who is  no  member  of  my

Party,  nor  any ally of mine, who has persistently

and  consistently pressed for this matter, who  has

been  asking  questions since I remember  being  in

this  Assembly, questions which were  evaded  in  a

most  pathetic  fashion by the Minister's  Ministry

and his Parliamentary Secretary. It is a matter  of

shame  for the Minister, if he is capable of shame,

that  he  should  be incapable of  recognising  the

contribution of the Member for Mountbatten  to  his

coming  to  his decision in this matter. He  should

also  recognise that it was in answer to persistent

questions  here that he suddenly found it  valuable

to  direct his mind to some petition that came from

a  women's  organisation of the P.A.P. - bless  their

little hearts! And he cannot recognise that  it  is

to this House, and this House principally, -
