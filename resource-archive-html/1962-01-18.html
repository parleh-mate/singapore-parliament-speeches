<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on

Question (17th January, 1962).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly calls upon the Government to

recommend  the  appointment  of  a  Commission   to

enquire into the Government's Education Policy, its

content and administration in all fields other than

vocational  and technical education,  and  to  make

recommendations." -[Mr David Marshall].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  before  the  adjournment  last

evening  I  was replying to the Member for  Tanglin

when he mentioned the subject of character building

in   schools.  I  heartily  agree  with  him   that

education is just not book learning and the passing

of   examinations.  There  are  other  aspects   of

education which have to be met by teachers, and  in

this  respect,  extra curricula activities  are  of

importance  which  the  Ministry  would   like   to

encourage.  That  being so, the Ministry  has  been

thinking for some time of including extra curricula

activities into the school curriculum, because with

our  extremely  large  school  population  and  the

maximum  use  to which school buildings  are  being

put - most  schools  are now on a two-session  basis,

and certain schools are on a three-session basis to

accommodate the adults at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



night -   it  would be very difficult for schools  to

have   extra  curricula  activities  outside  their

school  hours;  in other words, for pupils  in  the

morning  session  to return in  the  afternoon  for

their  normal extra curricula activities, and  vice

versa.  Unfortunately, we are not in a position  to

implement  this for this year since Government  has

decided  to  appoint this Commission of Inquiry  to

review   the  whole  of  the  educational   system,

including the six-day week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin did stress that our schools

should  not be too examination-conscious. Whilst  I

agree  with him in this respect, I must also  state

the  firm  view of the Government that it does  not

favour   the   automatic  promotion  system   which

unfortunately  existed in the  English  stream  for

quite a number of years and has had serious effects

not  only on pupils but also on teachers. With  the

stoppage  of  automatic promotion for  the  English

stream   in   1959,  there  has  been  a   distinct

improvement  in the quality of work not  only  from

the  pupils  but  also from the teachers.  This  is

reflected  in the improvement in the percentage  of

passes  for  the Primary School Leaving Examination

for the last two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to deal with the remarks made by my

former  Parliamentary  Secretary,  the  Member  for

Serangoon Gardens, who is not in the House  at  the

present  moment.  But  he has  said  his  piece,  I

presume, on behalf of the Barisan Sosialis which he

represents today. I must say I am very grateful  to

the Member for Anson for moving this motion instead

of  withdrawing it, although he said last month  he

would,  to give me this opportunity first to listen

to  my  former  Parliamentary  Secretary  who  says

certain things about the education policy, and  for

me to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has stated that he fully supports the

Commission  of  Inquiry that is  to  be  formed  to

inquire   into  the  educational  policy   of   the

Government. But he does not agree that a Commission

of   Inquiry  should  investigate  into   political

activities  in schools. I would like to remind  the

Member  for  Serangoon Gardens that there  are  two

Commissions of Inquiry. The first one would be to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



investigate  into  the  examination  boycott  which

would  also  include  an  investigation  into   the

political  activities and machinations  in  primary

and  secondary  schools. This  Commission  will  be

headed by a High Court Judge, because we feel  that

it  is  most essential that politics should be  got

rid  of  in  our school system. In fact, my  former

Parliamentary  Secretary must  have  had  a  mental

black-out   (after  he  changed  sides   from   the

Government  bench and walked across to be  part  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis)  to  hear  that  under  the

Education Ordinance, 1957, there are published  the

School  Regulations,  1957.  At  page  18  of   the

Regulations, Part XVIII, is a section  which  deals

with  political propaganda in schools. The marginal

heading reads as follows: "No political teaching or

activity  detrimental to the State  of  Singapore."

Regulation 110 reads as follows - I shall  only  read

paragraph  110; there are two sections.

The  first section:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No instruction, education, entertainment,

recreation,  propaganda or  activity  of  any  kind

which  shall be in any way of a political or partly

political nature or detrimental to the interests of

the State of Singapore or of the pupils or contrary

to the approved syllabus shall be permitted amongst

the  teachers  or  pupils either  upon  the  school

premises  or  elsewhere upon the  occasion  of  any

school activity or combined schools activity.'



<br><br>Subsection (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The use or display by teachers or pupils either

upon  the  school  premises or elsewhere  upon  the

occasion of any school activity or combined schools

activity   or  salutes,  songs,  dances,   slogans,

uniforms, flags or symbols which have a customarily

political association shall be unlawful.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens stated that a

Commission   of  Inquiry  should  look   into   the

educational  policy  of  the  Government  which  he

termed  "has many defects in its policy".  This  is

typical  of the Barisan Sosialis type of allegation

and  accusation. They do not mean that. Why did the

Member for Serangoon Gardens not state exactly what

are  the  defects, and what do the Barisan Sosialis

say  should be done? In fact, Sir, it is the Member

for  Serangoon  Gardens, formerly my  Parliamentary

Secretary,  who dissociated himself  from  all  the

decisions taken by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



him  for  the last two years until his  removal  as

Parliamentary Secretary on 21st July, 1961. Was  he

not supposed to be my adviser on Chinese education,

and that I sought his views first before I made any

decision?  So  much so that I had to disappoint  my

loyal colleagues, the Member for Bras Basah and the

Member  for Tiong Bahru, when they had problems  on

Chinese  education.  I had to tell  them  first  to

discuss with the Parliamentary Secretary who is now

the  Member for Serangoon Gardens. They  said  they

were  so  frustrated that it was no use talking  to

him;  nothing was done. That was why  they  had  to

come to me. I should therefore like the Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens to name the number of  occasions

when  I rejected his recommendations when they were

submitted to me, and for what reasons. I notice the

Member  for  Upper  Serangoon is all  smiles,  Sir,

because   he   also  acted  as  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for Education  for  at

least  one  or  two  months  when  the  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens  went  to  New  Zealand   on   a

U.N.E.S.C.O. Seminar. When files continued to drift

into  the room of the Parliamentary Secretary,  the

Member  for  Upper Serangoon came to  my  room  and

said,  "Stop  sending all these files to  me.  Stop

consulting me. You should just decide and carry on.

I  cannot stand the number of files that are coming

to  me. You are the Minister. Get on with the job."

Such  are the types of ex-colleagues we have.  They

wished  to  be consulted, and when we  did  consult

them,  they threw up their hands because there  was

too much work to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do ask the Member for Serangoon Gardens, if

he  must  criticise the educational policy  of  the

Government,  should  he   not  try  to  confine  his

criticisms to the educational policy, if any,  that

appears  to  be  wrong to him  after  he  has  been

expelled from the P.A.P. Government? That is,  from

July  1961  until now. Or would he? The Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens wants me to produce  files  upon

files  in  the Ministry of Education  to  show  his

signature and his initial indicating his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



decisions on matters of Chinese education,  but  he

does  not  want to honour his own initial  and  his

signature. One evening he stated that in the matter

of the 4:2 system for Chinese secondary schools, if

only  Government had postponed the holding  of  the

Secondary  IV examination last year for  one  year,

there would have been no trouble. Sir, I would like

to  ask  who  decided that the  1961  Secondary  IV

examination in Chinese schools should take place? I

will  not  bore the House except to make references

to  certain files - Education File No. 1134/60, folio

36,   - in  which the minutes of the meeting  of  the

Government  Senior  Middle III  Examination  Board,

1960, dated 18th November, 1960, were submitted  to

me  on  23rd  November.  1960.  My  minute  to  the

Parliamentary   Secretary,  now  the   Member   for

Serangoon Gardens, was a short one: "O.K.?" I got a

reply after one week. It takes a very long time for

the  Member for Serangoon Gardens to come  to  .any

decision. In fact, Sir, after his removal,  sad  to

say,  documents, letters, appeals, which  I  passed

down  to  him to attend and to "please  deal  with"

were  found stacked in the drawers, chockful, until

my new Parliamentary Secretary turned up -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Ha, ha!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> What is there to

laugh about?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There were silver-fish and

cockroaches  inside the drawers and he  wants  this

Commission of Inquiry!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Inquiry first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Certainly. It took one week,

Sir, on 30th November, for the Member for Serangoon

Gardens to say, "O.K." to the minute. So the  scope

of  the  first  Chinese  Secondary  school  leaving

examination  (Secondary IV) was  decided.  A  month

later, 9th of December, he addressed a minute to me

suggesting   certain  changes   to   the   proposed

examination of the Chinese Secondary school medium.

On the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



day,  I  minuted,  "Agree  with  the  Parliamentary

Secretary", and the decision went down.  Therefore,

Sir, if in 1960 it was decided to proceed with  the

first  Government  Secondary IV examination  to  be

held  in  1961, it was on the advice of  my  former

Parliamentary  Secretary, the Member for  Serangoon

Gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be very interesting to know that

with  this  controversy between  the  3:3  and  4:2

systems,  at  one  stage  the  Chinese  educational

bodies  were  upset that schools  could  not  issue

their  school  certificates after  an  examination.

Here again, Sir, who decided that the schools could

not  issue  their school certificates in accordance

with  the usual practice? I refer to Education file

1299/61,   folio  (3)  in  which  the  Member   for

Serangoon  Gardens,  as my Parliamentary  Secretary

then,  on the 5th July. 1961, gave approval to  the

issue  of this circular which reads as follows.  It

was dated 11th July, 1961. The circular is numbered

Education 1299/61/39:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Issue of certificates to pupils of Secondary IV

classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the practice of Chinese Middle Schools to

issue  their own Senior Middle III Certificates  to

pupils  who completed their Senior Middle III.  The

Ministry has decided that this practice should  not

be  extended  to pupils who sit for the forthcoming

School  Certificate Chinese examination. Principals

are,  therefore, requested not to issue  their  own

school certificates to such pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. This ruling does not apply to the school

leaving  certificate issued by the  school  when  a

pupil leaves a school at any standard.'



<br><br>Mind you, Sir, this decision was taken in spite  of

a warning by an official dated 4th July that it was

expected that a section of the public would clamour

for  the retention of the traditional practice  for

schools  to  issue  their own school  certificates.

That was my adviser on Chinese education! He took a

decision  and now he would like to make  it  appear

that  he  was  not  consulted,  nor  does  he  know

anything about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the points which he considered the

Commission of Inquiry should look into.  They  were

five  in  number.  The  first  one  was  this.  Did

Government  assist aided schools to  expand,  since

there were so few Chinese aided schools but so many

English Government schools? The answer is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



very  simple,  Sir.  Assuming  that  we  have  done

nothing,  it  can be asked, in whose  hands  did  I

leave the question of looking into the question  of

the  granting of capital aid to schools, which  are

mainly  Chinese? Whose recommendation was I waiting

for,   if   it  was  not  my  former  Parliamentary

Secretary,   the  present  Member   for   Serangoon

Gardens, who sits on files like a hen squatting  on

eggs to hatch?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he referred to the retirement of teachers in

aided  schools whom he said Government has no  plan

to assist. He said that when they retire they would

be  jobless  and  unemployed. Sir,  there  is  this

distinction about teachers being employed in  aided

schools   and   teachers  employed  in   Government

service.  Whereas a teacher wishing to be  employed

in  an  aided  school could approach an  individual

school to see the Principal and get the approval of

the   Committee   of  Management   prior   to   his

appointment, particulars of which, of course, would

have  to  be forwarded to the Ministry of Education

for  approval,  in  the case  of  employment  in  a

Government   school,  there  would   be   an   open

advertisement,  and  should  there  be  a   hundred

vacancies, it is likely that at least 500 or  1,000

would  apply  for such vacancies.  There  would  be

strict  selection by a Selection Board  deputed  by

the  Public Service Commission, and the best people

would  be  selected for service. But the prize  for

being  selected  to Government service  would  mean

that a teacher in Government service is liable  for

transfer  anywhere  within  the  State,  whereas  a

teacher in an aided school remains more or less  in

that  school for a long time. There are  advantages

and disadvantages, whether one happens to serve  in

an  aided school or a Government school. It is  not

very  easy  to  equate the terms and conditions  of

service.  Whereas  the  Government  servant  would,

after  a long period of service, be entitled either

to  a part gratuity and pension; in the case of  an

aided  school teacher, there would be his share  of

the  Provident  Fund; so either a  teacher  gets  a

Provident  Fund or he is entitled to a pension.  It

is up to him to make up his mind what he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



would  like  to  have  in his old  age.  He  cannot

possibly  have both. If, therefore, teachers  would

like to look forward to a pension, they should then

apply  for a post in the Government service.  There

is, of course, this further advantage of serving in

aided schools, as we have examples here, Sir.  They

are  able  to take part in politics and  elections,

get returned and become hon. Assemblymen; whereas a

civil servant would not be entitled to take part in

active  politics. However, the Government is  fully

aware  that Chinese aided schools did not get  full

aid till 1957. The Central Provident Fund, I think,

came  into  existence only in 1957, that is,  about

two  years  before the new Government took  office.

Therefore,  knowing  full well  that  many  Chinese

teachers  in aided schools would not have a  proper

nest  egg for retirement, the Ministry took a  very

lenient view when the subject of the retirement  of

teachers  came  up  for consideration.  The  normal

retiring  age is 55 and the Government has actually

agreed  that  not  only civil  servants,  but  also

teachers  in aided schools could continue to  serve

up  till  60,  provided, of  course,  the  teachers

concerned  are medically fit and also  serve  their

purpose  in  schools; that they have a satisfactory

record of teaching, and could be of service to  the

country;  and even then, Sir, we were  prepared  to

look  into individual cases of Chinese teachers  in

aided  schools who were over 60, if they felt  that

they could still carry on and were given permission

to  have their service extended year after year.  I

handed over to the Member for Serangoon Gardens, as

my  Parliamentary Secretary, the responsibility  to

look  into  individual cases, make  recommendations

and  to allow for extensions. But I hear that there

is  an  impression outside that many aged  teachers

who  wished  to  continue in  service  were  rather

roughly treated by my ex-Parliamentary Secretary. I

am  afraid  I  cannot be responsible  for  his  bad

manners, but that was the impression I got after he

stopped  being my Parliamentary Secretary  in  July

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then touched upon the subject of the bleak

future for students in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



schools  and  mentioned the fact that  many  Senior

Middle  III  and Secondary IV graduates of  Chinese

secondary schools are unemployed. Sir, this is  not

typical  of Chinese schools. The unfortunate  thing

about  the Member for Serangoon Gardens is that  he

is  only able to look from one angle. He is unable,

despite the two years he was under my tutelage,  to

see  education  as a whole. We have  four  language

streams.  In  his  position, he  should  have  been

trained  to  look  at education in  more  than  one

stream. Therefore, I would say that the problem  of

unemployment  in  the ranks of those  who  graduate

from  our  secondary schools, be  they  Chinese  or

English, and in the near future from the Malay  and

Tamil streams, is a fact which this Government  was

fully aware of before it came into office. That  is

why  we have tried to produce our development plan;

it  was  originally meant to be  five  years,  but

because  by the time it was published one year  was

already  over, it became a Four-Year Plan  - 1961  to

1964.   We   were  fully  aware  of  the  unhealthy

unemployment position which would be aggravated  by

the  thousands  that would be leaving  our  schools

seeking   employment.   There   is   a   need   for

industrialisation and a need for the conversion  of

the educational system which we have inherited from

the  past, in order to bring about greater emphasis

and  stress  on vocational and technical  education

and  not academic education as we have known for  a

long, long time. Therefore, before embarking  on  a

large  programme of very expensive  vocational  and

technical  education,  we  decided  to  set  up   a

Commission of Inquiry into Vocational and Technical

Education. This Commission's Report was  tabled  in

this Assembly two months ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens then went on to

make  a  false  statement that  many  Secondary  IV

students  are  not  able to  join  Upper  Secondary

classes. Now, entry to the Upper Secondary  classes

in  the  Chinese medium which started this year  is

through    passing   the   Secondary   School    IV

Examination. Of 2,348 pupils who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



passed  the  Secondary School IV  Examination  last

year,  2,080  or  88  per  cent - close  to  90   per

cent - have been admitted to Upper Secondary  classes

as at 13th of January this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member next alleged that the Ministry has not

recruited   any  temporary  teachers  pending   the

publishing of the results of the Senior Middle  III

Examination  and the Secondary 1V Examination  next

month. This again is not true. We are employing and

will  employ those who have taken either the Senior

Cambridge Examination, 1961, for the English stream

and  those  who  have taken the  Government  Senior

Middle III Examination and the Government Secondary

1V  Examination in the Chinese medium last month as

temporary  teachers  for our  schools.  Of  course,

there  has been a first recruitment of teachers  as

temporary   teachers.  There  will  be   a   second

recruitment  based  on  the  fact  that  the  first

recruitment was on the basis that teacher  trainees

were  regarded as one unit for purposes of staffing

in  the  schools,  and  it has  been  decided  that

teacher  trainees  may have more free  periods  and

could be regarded as .92 unit for 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point which the Member for Serangoon

Gardens made and which he said should be put before

the  Commission of Inquiry was the question of  the

recognition of Nanyang University degrees. From the

answer  given by the Government to questions  posed

by  the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce at  the  forum

debate at the Victoria Theatre on 13th January,  he

said  he understood it to mean that the Government,

after  merger,  would seek recognition  of  Nanyang

University degrees, but that they should proceed to

recognise this now. It would, I think, be  fair  if

the  full questions and answers were stated in  the

Assembly. It is very dangerous just picking out one

line  and then asking questions on that one  line.

It  should  be  in the context of the question  and

answer. It is not very long, Sir. If you will allow

me,  this  is  question No. 15. The question  posed

was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After merger, will the academic qualifications of

Middle  School graduates and University  graduates,

including those of Nanyang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



University, be recognised by the Central Government

of  the new Federation; and will such graduates  be

allowed to teach or enter Government service in any

part of the Federation?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official text of the answer is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The question of academic qualifications of Middle

School and University graduates, including those of

Nanyang University, being recognised by the Central

Government  of the new Federation is a  matter  for

the Central Government of the new Federation. Alter

merger,  the  Singapore  Government  will  put  the

merits  of  the  case  for recognition  before  the

Central Government. However, after merger and  with

autonomy  in  education,  Nanyang  graduates   will

continue  to  be  recruited  for  service  in   the

Singapore   Government  and   in   schools.   Since

Singapore  would enjoy autonomy in education  after

merger,  the  Singapore Government would  naturally

continue  to  recruit Nanyang University  graduates

into  Government  service, including  the  teaching

service."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it necessary to expand on that

question  and  answer. Suffice it to say  that  the

Singapore    Government   has   given   conditional

recognition to Nanyang University degrees, a  stand

the Government took two years ago when the Gwee  Ah

Leng  Review Committee Report on Nanyang University

was  tabled in this House, and I had then  occasion

to   state  the  Singapore  Government's  stand  on

Nanyang University. I refer, Sir, to Hansard,  Vol.

12,  No.  3, col. 143. I will just read one  and  a

half paragraphs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From the Review Committee's Report, it appears

that  the curriculum of Nanyang University shows  a

lack   of   systematic  planning  and  proper   co-ordination,  and  individual  guidance  from  staff

members appears to be lacking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the Singapore Government's stand on

Nanyang University in view of the findings  of  the

Gwee Ah Leng Review Committee? Despite the critical

findings   contained  in  the  Review   Committee's

Report,  the  Singapore Government has  decided  to

employ   Nanyang   University  graduates   and   to

recognise   the  Nanyang  University  degrees   as

equivalent   to  Pass  Degrees  of   a   recognised

university.  Selection  will,  as  usual,   be   on

individual  merits through interview by the  Public

Service Commission.'



<br><br>That  is  the  stand  of  the Singapore  Government

pending the reorganisation of Nanyang University in

accordance  with the main principles of the  Review

Committee's Report. This stand on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



Nanyang  University was a stand in which  at  least

four  Members of the Barisan Sosialis who were then

Parliamentary Secretaries were consulted before the

statement   was   made.  They   included   my   ex-Parliamentary   Secretary,  now  the   Member   for

Serangoon  Gardens, the Member for Upper Serangoon,

the  Member  for  Havelock and the Member  for  Nee

Soon. They were then Parliamentary Secretaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, the Member for Nee Soon said more

than once that by giving Nanyang University parity

of  treatment with that of the University of Malaya

I would become a hero of Chinese education. At that

time,   the  Member  for  Queenstown  was   not   a

Parliamentary  Secretary in the P.A.P.  Government;

he was then an Assemblyman. We took the Assemblymen

into   confidence  before  the   release   of   the

statement, but he objected, as usual, that  he  was

not  being consulted. Everything was cut and  tried

and there was no use of making any contribution.  I

remember he was very agitated. The attitude of  the

Barisan  Sosialis is just like that of  the  Member

for  Queenstown. If he is consulted, then it is all

right - consultation has taken place with the  people

of  Singapore.  But  if he is not  consulted,  then

there has been no consultation in anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, two Members of the Barisan Sosialis,

then   Parliamentary  Secretaries  in  the   P.A.P.

Government,  were  members of  the  very  important

Liaison  Committee which was established, composing

of   Government  members  and  members  of  Nanyang

University,   namely,  the  Member  for   Serangoon

Gardens  and  the Member for Upper Serangoon.  They

had  all  the  chance in the world  to  make  their

contributions to bring about a settlement with Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, this is classic of the Barisan

Sosialis:  Is  the Government going  to  reorganise

Chinese schools according to the English schools as

a  model?  In other words, will Chinese schools  be

anglicized;  will they follow the English  pattern;

will  they follow the colonial pattern? Sir,  every

country



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



has   to  evolve  its  own  education  system,  and

Singapore  is no different. We intend to  take  the

best  of what is available in the four streams.  In

prewar  days, the Government only conducted  Junior

Middle III Examinations for the Chinese schools and

it  was only in 1951 that they conducted the Senior

Middle III Examinations. After a six-year secondary

education, the certificate was only made equivalent

to  the Cambridge School Certificate which could be

taken  after four years in the English stream.  But

whatever  it  is, outside of Singapore,  the  lower

secondary  education system is five years  starting

with Form I to Form V for the English stream before

they   were   ready   for  the   Cambridge   School

Certificate Examination. In Singapore, it is  quite

some time now since children in English schools are

able  to  take  the Cambridge Examination  in  four

years  and not five years. So Singapore is somewhat

unique   in  that  pupils  are  able  to  take   an

examination in four years, whereas in the  rest  of

the  world, including the United Kingdom, they have

to do it in five years. But, of course, if I do not

mention  the Upper Secondary education, the Barisan

Sosialis   will  say,  "There  you  are,  secondary

education only in four years." We have two years of

the  Higher School Certificate and it is just  nice

for  us  having  to  integrate  the  four  language

streams to bring about secondary education  in  two

parts: four years for the first part and two  years

for  the higher upper secondary section so that you

do  six  years  before you go to a University.  Of

course,  times have changed, Sir,In the  good  old

days,   in   fact,   after  the  Senior   Cambridge

Examination   - after nine years  of  education:  six

years  in primary and three in secondary (Standards

I  to  IX)   - it  was possible to do  the  Cambridge

Examination and walk into a University.  Six  years

primary  and three years secondary, and we  are  at

university  level. But standards have  been  raised

here  as anywhere else in the world, and it is  now

necessary  to  have  a 12-year education - six  years

primary and six



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



years secondary - before one is considered reasonably

mature  and adult t& join a University. So  that  I

think  it  is  dangerous talk indulged  in  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  and more  so  I  am  unable  to

forgive  my  former  Parliamentary  Secretary   for

talking  in  this  strain: Is Government  going  to

anglicize the Chinese schools and so on?  At  least

if  he  could have made a suggestion on what  other

model he has to put forward for consideration, that

would   have  at  least  been  constructive.   "The

Singapore  educational system should  be  this  and

that," but there is nothing to offer as a solution.

Here,  Sir,  having raised this question  that  the

Government may want to anglicize Chinese schools on

the  pattern  of  English schools in  Singapore,  I

would  like to refer to one of the files  again - No.

1299/61.  There is a document here 28  (C)  by  the

Assistant  Director of Education (Chinese)  to  the

Chief   Examinations  Officer   - School  Certificate

Chinese Examination:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Parliamentary Secretary [that is, the Member for

Serangoon  Gardens]  has agreed  to  amendments  to

Regulations  governing  the  award  of  the  School

Certificate  (Chinese) [that is, the  Secondary  IV

Examination) so as to bring them in line  with  the

Cambridge  [they  do  not like  to  hear  the  word

"Cambridge" because it is English and therefore  it

is colonial] School Certificate standard.'



<br><br>Therefore, if the Barisan Sosialis have some  model

or  some  pattern to suggest to the  Government,  I

would like them to say so. What pattern is it  that

they would like the Singapore educational system to

follow?  And  not  just hide  behind  a  facade  of

pretence and a silly allegation that the Government

intends to do certain things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore deeply indebted to the Member for

Anson   for  having  proceeded  with  this  motion,

because  it  gave me the opportunity to  listen  to

what  was  said by my former colleague - I think  the

Member for Farrer Park has congratulated me  on  my

loss,  which  is no loss but a gain - and  to  answer

point by point his allegations which are unfounded,

malicious and dangerous, and for which he  and  his

own Party must bear full responsibility.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, having listened to the

speech  by the Minister for Education, I  have  the

impression  that  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  very

satisfied with the present state of affairs in  the

English and Chinese schools in Singapore. According

to   his  speech,  the  people  can  come  to  this

conclusion.  If  there  are  any  problems  in  the

schools  in  Singapore, if the  teachers  have  any

complaints  and  if  there is any  complaint  about

Nanyang  University, they said that these  are  all

created  by the Barisan Sosialis. The Minister  for

Education put the blame for the mistakes and errors

in   the   Ministry  of  Education   on   his   ex-Parliamentary Secretary. Just now, the Minister for

Education  gave  many examples. He said  all  these

were   done  on  the  recommendation  of  the   ex-Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education. From this, if it is so, then the  people

can  see  our Minister in the past two and  a  half

years has been useless. I feel that if it is so, he

should  refund  the  salaries  which  he  has  been

drawing  for the past two and a half years  to  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, later on I shall reply to the

criticisms   made  by  the  Minister   against   my

colleagues.  Let me now express my  views  on  this

original  motion.  Mr Speaker, I  feel  that  this

motion  is  a very constructive one. The Government

should   not  treat  it  as  one  with  which   the

Opposition  want to attack the Government,  because

today   there  are  many  things  on   policy   and

administration  which should be reviewed  since  we

all know that the P.A.P. when they came into office

after  the general elections in 1959 did  not  have

any  long-term plan. It was a result of  historical

developments that they came to form the Government.

Under  these circumstances, on complicated problems

such  as  the  education problem,  any  responsible

Party will not boast that it has all the experience

to  deal  with them. To the P.A.P., when  they  are

confronted with this education problem, it is a new

experience to them when they try



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



to solve it. They should admit that when performing

this   important  task,  there  are  bound  to   be

mistakes. Apart from this, in the matter of policy,

they  have  not  seen eye to eye with  the  people.

Therefore,  today one Member in this  Assembly  has

moved  this  motion  to  set  up  a  Commission  of

Inquiry. This is a very good suggestion. The P.A.P.

Government  should  remember this  motion  and  the

result  of  this Commission will not  only  benefit

those who support it. It is the teachers and pupils

in  the  schools who will derive benefit  from  the

result of the Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me explain why there should be such a

Commission of Inquiry. At the same time,  what  are

the  terms  of  reference  of  this  Commission  of

Inquiry?  First  of all, let me briefly  cite  some

examples.  For instance, in the matter of  building

new schools by the Government, the distribution  of

schools in the island in the past two years has not

been  satisfactory. Has it been satisfactory?  Will

the  distribution of schools enable those who  live

in crowded areas go to a school which is near their

residence? In building schools, does the Government

take  into  consideration  the  confidence  of  the

people who live in this island?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the reunification of all streams of

education,  what should be the criterion?  In  this

respect,  the  P.A.P. never stated clearly  in  its

Five-Year  Development Plan its  education  policy.

They just mentioned the policy of reunification  of

the  four  streams of education without giving  any

concrete   scheme.   Does   it   mean   that    the

reunification of the four streams of  education  is

to  be  based  on  the  policy of  anglicising  all

vernacular  schools?  This  policy  needs   to   be

reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about textbooks used in schools. The

Government  could  only  talk  about  standardising

syllabuses, but they could not give ample  time  to

the  publishers  to print the textbooks.  So  today

there is much confusion and a lot of trouble in the

schools in regard to the availability of textbooks.

For instance, Junior IV students in Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



schools  have  to  spend more money  on  textbooks,

because  there are textbooks on Physics, Chemistry,

Geometry,  Algebra, and others.  In  the  past,  in

Chinese schools every year the students study  only

one  subject.  Now  because of the  change  in  the

system they have to have the same subjects as  used

in the English schools. But these textbooks are not

available  in  the  market.  Therefore,  when   the

schools reopen this year, the students will have to

buy  more textbooks and their parents will have  to

incur a lot of expenses. The burden on the students

as  well as on the teachers will also increase.  On

this  subject  the  Government has  to  review  its

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the P.A.P. came to power, the P.A.P.

Government  adopted  a  new  education  policy   in

respect  of  the training of teachers, that  is  to

say,  the teachers have to teach as well as  attend

training classes every day. As a result, there have

been  a  lot of complaints by the teachers. In  the

morning they have to teach in far-away schools  for

half  a day and in the afternoon they have to  rush

to   the  Teachers'  Training  College  to  receive

training.  Every day about two or three hours  will

be  wasted on transport. Is this kind of  system  a

very  good and ideal system for teachers' training?

This  is another question which causes the teachers

much dissatisfaction and also needs review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is that of the applications from

aided  schools to expand or build new schools.  The

Government's   restrictions  and   regulations   as

regards  these applications have also  resulted  in

many  complaints from the applicants.  Today  there

are about 3,000 teachers who have been teaching for

many  years, but because they do not have  the  so-called   recognised  certificates,  their  position

cannot  be safeguarded and they cannot have  yearly

increments  as  the other teachers  have.  I  think

there  are about 1,000 such teachers and  they  are

very dissatisfied with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about school administration and students

in schools. We know that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



since  the  beginning of this year there  has  been

much  confusion  in schools because  some  teachers

have  been transferred. Because some students  have

also   been   transferred  to  other  schools   and

examination centres, there have also been  quite  a

lot  of  complaints from them.  I  would  ask  hon.

Members in this House to pay attention to them. Can

all these causes be blamed on the Barisan Sosialis?

What  are  the causes? I hope the P.A.P. have  the

courage to admit that they have probably made  some

mistakes. They should have the courage to  confront

these  problems and seek an honest way  to  rectify

their  mistakes  and  not take this  Commission  of

Inquiry  as  something to achieve  the  purpose  of

putting  the  blame on certain people  and  finding

scapegoats. In the past few days, we have heard the

Prime  Minister  say  in  this  Assembly  that  the

Government  intends to form about four  Commissions

of   Inquiry  to  investigate  into  four  separate

topics.  Under these circumstances,  I  am  of  the

opinion   that  it  is  more  necessary   for   the

Government  to ensure that the correct  motive  for

the  establishment of these Commissions of  Inquiry

should  be to investigate into the mistakes of  the

Government  in  order  that  it  can  rectify   its

mistakes.  If  it  does not give this  undertaking,

then  there can be an impression outside this House

that  the Government's intention to establish these

Commissions of Inquiry is to find out who have been

bad  men, who have been evil-doers, who have  taken

part  in strikes, in the boycotting of examinations

and  so  on. Therefore, the Government must clarify

its intention in establishing these Commissions  of

Inquiry.  It  must say that it has no intention  of

trying  to pin the blame on anybody. It should  say

that  this is not the purpose of the Commission  of

Inquiry.  The  work  of the Commission  of  Inquiry

should   result  in  alleviating  the   fears   and

suspicions  in the minds of teachers,  parents  and

students  and the public generally. Only then  will

it serve its purpose. I suggest that the Government

should  establish, first of all,  a  Commission  of

Inquiry to investigate into matters in the Ministry

of Education. After the conclusions are arrived



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



at,  the Commission could look into student boycott

of  the  Government's Junior IV  examinations.  The

Government  should not try to mix up  these  issues

together by allowing them to be investigated by one

Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not intended to talk too

much,  but  just  now  the Minister  for  Education

levelled  a lot of criticisms at my colleague,  the

former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for

Education, in relation to his personal work in  the

Ministry. Therefore, I find it necessary to  say  a

few  words. When I was still in the P.A.P.,  I  was

not  satisfied  with the education policy  and  the

measures   taken  by  the  P.A.P.   Government   in

implementing it. Therefore, at various  conferences

of  Parliamentary Secretaries, I very often said to

the   Prime  Minister  that  in  dealing  with  the

education policy, the P.A.P. Government is  like  a

ship.  Every  year there are a lot  of  passengers,

namely,  the students, who want to board the  ship.

So it would appear that the ship should be enlarged

to  provide for more accommodation. There should be

a   larger  ship  to  accommodate  the  number   of

passengers, that is, the pupils. If the  Government

could  achieve  this, then it would  be  fortunate.

Otherwise,  its  socialist policies  could  not  be

realised.  So  the Government should  try  to  find

appropriate means to advance its socialist aims and

to achieve socialist policies. Therefore, education

has  a great part to play in the Government's  aims

and policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Minister for Education is a very hard-working

man.  But in dealing with the education policy,  he

is  not  very sure of himself. In making  policies,

the  Prime  Minister has to give his  direction  in

respect  of  the political aspect. When the  former

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education  was still in his Ministry, the  Minister

himself   could   not   deny   that   his    former

Parliamentary  Secretary was very hard-working  and

diligent.  He  was very punctual in  going  to  the

office, and very often he even stayed in the office

after  4.30  p.m.  Why  should  there  be  such   a

situation?  Well, it was because in the  policy  of

organisation, the Minister for Education himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



could not make his own decision. So he had to  work

very  hard.  But  politically  he  was  lacking  in

experience. I can give you an example to illustrate

this point. As pointed out by the Minister himself,

I   had   occasion  to  act  as  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Education.  When  I

went there, I discovered there was a terrifying lot

of  work  to  do. This was because almost  all  the

documents relating to Chinese schools in Singapore,

such  as  those  concerning the  teachers  and  the

principals, and even those concerning the  hawkers,

the  ice-cream hawkers, the canteens and the  tuck-shops  in  the  schools had to be referred  to  the

office of the Parliamentary Secretary. Mr Speaker,

you  can imagine that under such circumstances, you

would have to spend even the whole of your life  on

these  papers without being able to make  a  proper

reorganisation of the education system. The  reason

why    the   question   of   education   and    its

administration has not been properly solved is very

simple.  There  is  a  shortage  of  administrative

officers  who  know  Chinese  in  the  Ministry  of

Education. Some of the officers who have to act  as

liaison  officers  between  the  Ministry  and  the

Chinese  schools do not know Chinese. They have  to

speak  in English. Same officers and principals  of

schools   who  do  not  know  English   find   some

difficulty  about  it.  Those  officers  who   know

English  have  no  knowledge of the  conditions  in

Chinese   schools,  and  they   are   also   having

difficulty.  In the primary and secondary  schools,

the  principals do not know very much English. This

is  a  fact. So if the Government does not want  to

reorganise in this respect, that is, to achieve the

aim  of  having good liaison between the Ministry's

officers and the school authorities, then how could

we  improve  our education? It is impossible.  Take

another  example.  Inspectors  of  schools  in  the

Ministry  of Education are engaged on the condition

that  they  must have a good standard  of  English.

They must be able to make reports on their findings

in  the schools in English. So when we engage  this

kind  of inspector to go round the Chinese schools,

he is in a very difficult position.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



It  is  up  to the Ministry itself to get  suitable

officers to do such work. It is necessary for me to

say  a few words in defence of my colleague who has

been criticised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was still a Parliamentary

Secretary,  I found that our views were  not  final

views.  The Prime Minister himself had occasion  to

tell  us  about this. My colleague, the Member  for

Serangoon Gardens, has pointed out that he was  not

satisfied  with  the policy of  the  Government  in

respect   of   capital  grant  for   the   building

programmes  for  Chinese schools.  His  suggestions

were   not   only   expressed   at   meetings    of

Parliamentary  Secretaries but were also  mentioned

at  meetings of Members of the Assembly, so that he

could  get  the  support of other  members  of  the

P.A.P. in   order  to  come  to  a   satisfactory

conclusion.  But after he did this,  there  was  no

improvement  in respect of the building  programmes

for the Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example again. We have given our

views  on  other aspects of education. For example,

the  Minister for Finance has occasion after office

to  go to some schools. He noticed there were  many

cars  parked along the road leading to the schools.

So  he  formed  the opinion that  there  were  many

people  who were car owners. Therefore, he intended

to  increase the school fees to $10 per month  just

because  he  had  seen  so  many  cars  around  the

schools.  But  for  us the Assemblymen  who  raised

objections  to  it, this increase  of  school  fees

would  have been imposed, and if it had been  done,

the P.A.P. would have been in a worse position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the appointment of Inspectors of Schools and

the registration of teachers, the decision was that

the Member for Serangoon Gardens could make his own

views  as  to  the  registration  of  teachers  and

appointment  of inspectors. But today  many  school

teachers  in Chinese schools as well as  principals

will  remember  that in the initial  stage  of  the

P.A.P. taking power, there was really a tremendous

number  of  circulars issued  by  the  Ministry  of

Education. Every day they received at least half  a

dozen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



circulars  from  the Ministry of  Education  asking

them  to  do  this and to do that. These  circulars

were  normally  contradictory. The  first  circular

would ask them to do this; then the second circular

would say, "Oh, you do not have to do this". And  a

third circular would again make another change.  So

if   the  former  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Education had not done  his  best  to

change  the  whole situation, I believe the  P.A.P.

Government would have been ridiculed more and more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the new Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for  Education will not be too  satisfied

with  himself.  The  Ministry is  not  paying  much

attention to the issue of circulars at the  moment.

All the Chinese school teachers know what kind of a

labour man our present Parliamentary Secretary  is.

A  few  days ago I had occasion to meet  a  primary

school teacher in a Chinese school. He told me that

the  circulars issued in Chinese from the  Ministry

of  Education were actually unintelligible and that

in  order to understand such circulars, he must get

a  teacher  of English to refer to the original  in

English  before he could understand the translation

as  to  the instructions contained in the circular.

Perhaps  this  is  because  our  Minister  and  his

Parliamentary Secretary are on top.  They  are  too

high-sounding  and  50 many teachers  are  treating

this as a laughing stock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to take up too

much  of  the time of this House to enumerate  more

examples  of  the  mistakes  made  by  the   P.A.P.

Government  in respect of education.  I  hope  they

will  understand and realise that in  dealing  with

education,  they are inexperienced  and  they  have

made many mistakes which could have been avoided. I

hope  they will not treat the establishment of  the

Commission  of Inquiry as one intended  to  find  a

scapegoat for their own mistakes.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to support the motion to  appoint  a

Commission of Inquiry for four reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first reason is that education today is playing

a greater and greater role



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



than ever before in the progress and prosperity  of

a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second reason is that education has been

internationally recognised as the answer to most of

the  problems  especially of newly independent  and

developing nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third reason is that a policy that was suitable

for  the  Colony of Singapore is no longer suitable

for  a  Singapore  that is rapidly  moving  towards

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and last reason, Sir, is that there are

a  number  of educational problems which,  if  left

unsolved,  will  lead not only to  stagnation,  but

also  to  retro-gradation, discontent and  probably

even disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days when I was a pupil, the duty of

the  teacher  was  to teach the three  Rs,  and  to

prepare  the pupils for a white collar  job.  Today

those functions still exist, but are definitely not

sufficient.  The standard of living of  a  country,

the health of the people, the morals and morale  of

the population, the extent of juvenile delinquency,

depend  upon the system of education today. Whether

there  is a population explosion or not, even  that

depends   on   how  educated  the  population   is.

Prosperity in trade, agriculture, commerce and  the

extent  of crime, all these depend on education  in

the  country.  That is why I feel the  question  of

education  is so vital. International organisations

like the Economic Council of Asia and the Far East,

the  World Health Organisation, etc., do  not  have

education specially placed within their ambit.  But

if you read reports of all these organisations, not

a  single  one  of  them  has  failed  or  has  not

mentioned  education as the answer to the  problems

that are facing especially new nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, a policy that is suitable for

the  Colony  of  Singapore is  no  longer  suitable

today,  because  today loyalty  to  the  State  and

nation of Malaya and national pride must be part of

our  education system today. There are 12 important

matters, Sir, which I feel the Commission should go

into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter concerning the different language

streams  of  education.  The  education  system  of

Singapore  is more complicated than in many  places

in other parts of the world. I am not blaming the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for  Education. He  could  not  help  it.

Because  of  the  multi-racial  character  of   the

population,  different  streams  of  education   in

different languages are necessary, and the Minister

himself  will  admit, I believe, that  the  present

system  is causing discontentment amongst a section

of  the  people. I feel the recommendations of  the

Commission would be very useful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter that I would like to raise is

the  shortage  of teachers. Again, Sir,  I  am  not

blaming the Minister for Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> It is partly the result of

the stagnation of teachers' training and stagnation

of  education  during the Japanese  occupation  and

also  the  rapidly increasing youth  population  of

Singapore.  But I would like to draw the Minister's

attention  to  the  detrimental  effects   of   the

shortage  of  teachers  and  to  urge  him  to   do

everything within his power - I know it is difficult,

but  a Commission of experts might be able to  give

some recommendations to try and solve this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a student of the Senior Cambridge in December

who  depends on adults to run his life for  him  in

December suddenly finds in January that he has been

put as a teacher, an adult running the lives of  40

little children. That sudden switch usually is  too

much  for a youth of 18, 19 or 20 to take all of  a

sudden.  The disaster is not only on him, but  also

on the 40 little children at a most delicate age. I

know  the problem is very difficult -  again I stress

I  am not blaming the Minister - but I do urge him to

do  something to see what can be done to avoid this

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third matter is the shortage of secondary

schools.  Parents are quite concerned because  they

feel  that they have been kept in the dark  of  the

basis of promotion or absorption into the secondary

schools  of  Primary  Schools Entrance  Examination

passes; not that they suspect any foul play, I  did

not mean that, Sir. They feel that they do not know

whether  a  student is promoted  on  his  aggregate

marks, or has he got



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



to  pass  special subjects, or is  there  a  quota,

through  which the promotion into secondary schools

is made. If it is on merit, what is the standard of

merit that they have to reach, and is that standard

consistent  every year? Or does it  depend  on  the

quota  of available seats in the secondary schools?

Parents feel that they do not know all this and the

danger is this. Because of ignorance, it has  given

rise  to  this suspicion. I want to make  it  clear

that I am not making it as an allegation that it is

happening.  I  am  just  making  a  statement  that

parents   have   come  to  me  stating   that   the

Government, in order to show that they have lots of

vacancies  and that they can absorb all the  passes

of  the  entrance  exam  nation  from  the  primary

schools,  are  using what they  call  a  trick,  it

seems,  by  sifting  out  those  students  who  are

absorbed  into  the secondary school  Form  II  and,

after one year, when they get to Form III, for some

reason if they do not reach a certain standard that

is  required, they are sacked. Therefore, more  and

more vacancies are created to get students from the

primary  schools into Form II. Now, this  situation

may  not exist, Sir, and I am not alleging that  it

does.  But  I  am just saying, because parents  are

being kept in the dark as to how the children  from

the  primary  schools  are being  promoted  to  the

secondary   schools,  all  sorts  of  doubts,   and

suspicions are being created. It would be good  for

a commission to sit and inquire into this and bring

to  light  how primary school entrance  examination

passes  are  judged,  and on what  basis  they  are

promoted to secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my fourth subject is discontentment among

Chinese school students. You yourself know  of  the

discontentment.  I  am  not  standing  up  for  the

students.  Where I am concerned,  as  I  have  said

before, and I stand by it, I think the 4 : 2 system

is  better,  because it brings the  Chinese  school

passes  up  to  standard and  they  have  the  same

qualification as the English schools; and  if  they

are  going  to stand for competition for Government

jobs  or  professions, I think it is a  good  thing

that they do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



come  up  to the same level and be reads for  equal

competition.



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth point is discrimination against women,

especially   the   legally  married   teachers.   I

emphasise "the legally married teachers". Sir, this

injustice has been perpetuated for 13 years and the

fact  that this injustice could be traced  back  to

history  is  no  reason  for  justification  for  a

socialist Government, or a Government which  claims

to  be  socialist, which promised in the  elections

that  they  would implement - not only was  it  their

belief - equal  pay for equal work. Two  and  a  half

years  have gone by and nothing has been done.  You

will agree with me, Sir, that unjust discrimination

against anybody at all causes unhappiness and, to a

certain  extent,  an  inferiority  complex.   Women

teachers  are  usually employed in primary  schools

where  they  deal with children of a  delicate  and

tender  age. An unhappy teacher with a  feeling  of

inferiority complex is by no means an ideal teacher

for young children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next subject is textbooks. I quite

appreciate  the  difficulty  of  the  Minister  for

Education  concerning this subject  because,  as  I

have  said,  we  are moving towards an  independent

Singapore  and the contents of textbooks will  have

to   be  changed  from  a  foreign  background  and

atmosphere  to a Malayan background and atmosphere.

National pride and loyalty have to be fostered. The

emphasis on white-collar jobs is now giving way  to

the  importance  of science, and even  moral  codes

concerning   certain  subjects,   especially   with

religious    bodies,   are   changing.   Therefore,

textbooks have to be changed. I quite realised  and

I  appreciate that the Education Department - if I am

not  mistaken - has a Textbooks Committee working  on

this and that textbooks are slowly being changed to

suit the occasion. But, Sir, I urge the Minister to

take an interest in this textbook question and  put

all that he can into it because it is causing a lot

of  hardship.  Changes are necessary.  But  let  me

point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



out  to you that unnecessary changes are causing  a

great strain on the pockets of poor parents.  If  a

poor  man has six children, he expects to  buy  one

set  of  books to be passed on year by year to  his

child  number  two, number three, and  so  on.  But

because of the frequent changes in textbooks, every

year,  a  parent with six children has to  buy  six

sets  of textbooks every year and he cannot  afford

it,  with the result that his children have  to  go

without   education.  That  is  what   is   causing

illiteracy  in  the country. So although  it  looks

very  innocent - the cost of textbooks, say, is  $30:

six  children, $180 (one month's pay or  more  than

one  month's pay) -  the parents cannot afford it and

this is the cause of illiteracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to go into the

question  of  textbooks  very  thoroughly.  Another

point, Sir: the Government does lend free textbooks

to  school children who cannot afford them, but the

number  of  books is limited, and if the Government

or  the  schools  keep on changing the  books,  the

Government too are wasting money because they  have

to  buy  new  textbooks every  year  as  the  books

returned by the previous year's students cannot  be

used  the  next year because the schools are  using

different  textbooks.  That  is  why  I  feel   the

textbook  problem is very important and I hope  the

Minister  will do something about it  and  let  the

Commission go into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My seventh point is syllabuses. I have mentioned

before   that   school-leavers  of  the   different

language streams will have to compete equally  with

the  world  outside for jobs. I do agree  with  the

Minister  that  the  syllabuses  will  have  to  be

streamlined  so that they do reach a certain  level

when  the  children of the different streams  leave

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eighth point is that there are anomalies among

the people of equal qualifications in the Education

Department.  I do not want to go into details,  but

if  the  Minister would like to see me   - if  he  is

interested - I can tell him the different  posts  and

different  qualifications affected. Although  I  do

not   know  the  names  of  the  officers  who  are

involved,   I   do   know   the   posts   and   the

qualifications that are involved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ninth point is the system of having one

principal   running  the  morning   and   afternoon

schools. He is expected to go to one session. He is

not expected to stay the whole of the two sessions.

Therefore, he has to be responsible for things that

happened  during  a session at  which  he  was  not

present. I think the Government Is making an effort

to have senior teachers or something like that, but

I  still feel that even with a senior teacher,  the

principal is ultimately responsible, and he or  she

is responsible for something which he or she has no

control over. I feel that by having two heads - one

for   the   morning  session  and   one   for   the

afternoon - it  gives  more  opportunities  to  young

teachers to rise to headmastership or headmistress-ship  and  it promotes a more efficient running  of

the   schools,   because  whoever   is   there   is

responsible  for  whatever happens  then, and  not

somebody who is at home or attending a class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my tenth point is adult education. Sit, if you

will look at the 1957 census, you will see that  48

per  cent  of  the over ten-year old population  of

Singapore  are illiterate. The sad part  of  it  is

that out of this 48 per cent, which is 455,000,  94

per   cent  are  citizens.  How  I  came  to   this

conclusion  is  this.  We know  that  the  Chinese.

Malays  and Indians (including Pakistanis) are  the

main  races  that form the citizens  of  Singapore.

Other races like Europeans, Australians, Americans,

and  so  on who are citizens of Singapore are  very

few.  You will see that 54 per cent of the  Chinese

are  illiterate; amongst the Malaysians, it  is  38

per cent: amongst the Indians and Pakistanis, it is

25  per  cent. But amongst the other races,  it  is

only   six  per  cent.  Therefore,  the   bulk   of

illiterates are citizens of Singapore. I feel  that

something  must be done. I know that the Government

has  organised language classes and adult  classes,

but  I  tin  not know how much these  classes  have

helped to reduce illiteracy among the citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my eleventh point is education through the

radio.  In  more advanced countries, the radio  has

been regarded as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



a very strong arm of education. But in Singapore  - I

do not know whether, the Minister has been too busy

to  look  into this  - it is an important thing.  The

listening  facilities  in  the  schools   and   the

guidance  of education through the radio is  a  new

subject.  No  guidance has been given  to  teachers

about  education through the radio  except  through

pamphlets  printed  by  the  Broadcasting  Station.

Neither   has   any   demonstration   been   given.

Therefore,  for  lack  of  guidance  and  lack   of

listening  facilities in Singapore,  radio  lessons

are more a nuisance than a help, and are doing harm

than good in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last subject that I would like to touch on is

the six-day week.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Much has been said about its

effect  on teachers, but very little has been  said

about  its effects on children. I feel that  it  is

vital  that we get the opinions of experts on  this

matter. A Commission to discuss the effects of  the

six-day week on children is vital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I would like to urge the Government to

appoint a Commission to inquire into this and other

matters   concerning  the  Government's   education

policy.  The sooner it is done, the better it  will

be for all of us.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy   Speaker.   Sir,   yesterday   the   former

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education said that the Commission of Inquiry  into

Education  should  not touch  upon  the  political

aspects,  but  today  we  have  heard  the   former

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Prime   Minister

saying  that this Commission of Inquiry should  not

he  treated  as  one for which  a  scapegoat  or  a

culprit   has   to   be   found.   Obviously    the

representatives of the Barisan Sosialis are  afraid

of what they did. If the Barisan Sosialis did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



carry  out any political activities in the  schools

and  if they did not make any mistakes, they should

not  be  afraid of a Commission of Inquiry to  look

into the political activities in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that it is the policy of the

Government  that a school student should  be  given

every   chance   to   study  and   enrich   himself

intellectually by other ways, so that  he  will  be

able to serve society well in future. It is not our

policy  that a student should be made  use  of  in

political activities by a political party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now the Member for

Upper  Serangoon said that the former Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Education  had  too

much  work  to do. He also said that there  was  no

systematic work. As regards the complaint of having

too  much work, I would like to say that I had  the

same  feeling when I first took over his duties.  I

have brought many files today to this House not for

show.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I touch upon the aspect as to how the said

two  Members  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  have  been

making  use of their position. I would like to  say

to  my  former counterpart that his turn will  also

come for him to be investigated into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the course of two

years,   my   former  counterpart  did  practically

nothing. This question should be looked into by the

Commission  of  Inquiry  because  it  is   a   very

interesting  subject  [Interruption].  Just  now  a

Member opposite has said that if it is proved  that

in  the course of two years he did nothing, then he

should refund his salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before taking over the post of Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Education,  I  spent

about  1�  months before I took over officially  to

clear  all  the work which the former Parliamentary

Secretary had not done in the course of two  years.

I do not want to bring in too many details, because

it may take me half an hour or even more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th August, 1959, one Mr Tee Chin Loon wrote

a letter from Mei Chin School.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. He is

touching  on  family revelations. I  would  suggest

that  they are out of order in the context  of  the

issues  of the motion. Can we confine ourselves  to

the motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b>   If   the

Parliamentary Secretary is going into details, then

the  Chair  will rule him out of order. So  far,  I

think he has been relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir,I have already said that I was

not  prepared  to go into too many details  because

the  Commission of Inquiry should inquire into  the

education  problems and we must also know  what  my

former counterpart did in the course of two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have many letters written by members of

the  public and addressed to the Minister and  some

to   the   Parliamentary  Secretary.  Usually   the

procedure  was  for the Minister to minute  to  the

Parliamentary Secretary. There is one case in 1959.

I  went  to his office. There were so many  letters

for  reply  and they were not dealt  with  for  two

years.  I  have already made a list, but I  do  not

wish  to  go too much into details. If he wants  to

have  them for reference, he is welcome to  have  a

look  at them. So if the Member for Upper Serangoon

should  say  that  he  was  very  hardworking, his

efficiency would be that of a snail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Parliamentary

Secretary  is trying to distort facts. He  did  not

carefully  listen to what I said. I said  that  the

Minister  for Education had occasion to praise  his

former  Parliamentary Secretary  as  a  very  hard-working man.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I must thank the

Member  for  Upper Serangoon. This proves  that  he

himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



believes  that the former counterpart of  mine  was

not  hardworking;  otherwise, how  was  it  that  a

matter  was referred to him and he did not take  it

up?  Originally  I did not want to  bring  up  this

matter openly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of order.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  just now  the  Parliamentary

Secretary alleged that I did not do certain things.

As  regards all those letters about complaints,  at

that  time there was the Complaints Bureau and  all

such  matters  could  not  be  dealt  with  in  the

Ministry  but should be referred to the  Complaints

Bureau.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think that is not a point of

order.  Of  course, if the Member is not satisfied,

the  Commission  can go into the  details  of  this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have already

decided  not  to let Members opposite interrupt  my

speech. They will be given their chance to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already dealt with the statement as to how

diligent my former counterpart was. Now I  want  to

talk  about  why he is afraid of the Commission  of

Inquiry  looking into the political  activities  in

schools. As far as I know, in the course of the two

years he spent -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.

The  issue of a Commission of Inquiry to look  into

the political activities in schools is not part  of

this  motion,  but  of  another  matter  which  the

Minister for Education has promised. I do  ask  the

speaker to confine himself to the issues.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> For the information of the

Member  for  Anson, last night when the Member  for

Serangoon Gardens was speaking, I think he  touched

on  this aspect, and the Parliamentary Secretary is

but  I think he mentioned that the political aspect

should not be included in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



Commission.   So  far  I  think  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  is  quite correct in  replying  to  that

point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Deputy  Speaker. Originally I had no  intention  to

touch  on this point, but it was because the Member

for Serangoon Gardens touched upon it and said that

the Commission of Inquiry should not touch upon the

political  activities in schools that I talk  about

it as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of two years, as far as I know - and

I can give evidence in the Commission of Inquiry to

prove  what I say - apart from sitting in the office,

all  ho  knew  was how to make his  trusted  people

principals.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Then why pay him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): One of them was

the  Principal of Chung Lee School.  The  Board  of

Directors, including one Mr Seah Yun Chong,  wrote

a  letter which was not replied to for many months,

and then he said, "I want to -."



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

is  going  into  details.  We  are  discussing  the

appointment  of  a Commission of  Inquiry,  and  if

there  was  any  irregularity when the  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens was Parliamentary  Secretary,  I

think it can be brought up before the Commission of

Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Unfortunately

today  there  is  much  surprising  evidence  which

cannot  be  made  public in this House.  This  also

concerns the Member for Pasir Panjang as to what he

did  in the schools. So he can wait to say what  he

likes  in  the Commission of Inquiry. If he  cannot

believe  it, then we will bring up a letter written

by the Sin Min School addressed to me.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think I have already

indicated that we are discussing the motion  urging

the Government to set up a Commission of Inquiry to

go   into  the  education  policy,  and  not  about

letters. But if the Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



Secretary  thinks that these have some bearing,  he

can always refer the matter to the Commission for a

full inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Member for Pasir  Panjang  has

asked  me to bring it up, if necessary, and  if  he

wants  it  I  can  publish it  in  the  newspapers.

Otherwise  ask  him to -wait for the Commission  of

Inquiry  before it is made public. What I  want  to

show  is  that the Barisan Sosialis has started  to

exert political pressure on the schools and try  to

gain control of the schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have no time

for him to clarify. Since it is not possible for me

to  bring  up the evidence, I will go on  to  touch

upon  what  has been said by the Member  for  Upper

Serangoon. He says that our Minister for  Education

is  a  useless  fellow. But  my  view  is  that  my

predecessor  was either useless or was deliberately

trying   to   undermine  the  reputation   of   the

Government  so as to whip up dissatisfaction  among

the  Chinese schools. Just now the Member for Upper

Serangoon  made  a suggestion. It is very  strange.

When they were Parliamentary Secretaries, they  had

ample  opportunity to make suggestions  on  how  to

improve the educational system, but they seldom did

so.  It  is only after they have left us that  they

talk  about  theories  which  are  destructive   in

nature.  They say the Government has to spend  more

money  to build schools. In this respect,  I  would

ask your indulgence to mention the Member for Pasir

Panjang  who  acted as a director of a school.  The

Government already granted the money to the  school

to  put up a building, but as far as I know, it was

the  Member  for  Pasir Panjang who  said  to  many

people -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of order. Sir. Please, Sir,

could we confine the gentleman to the issues of the

motion?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> May I read the motion which is

put before this House by the Member for Anson?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly calls upon the Government to

recommend the appointment of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



a  Commission  to  enquire  into  the  Government's

Education  Policy, [it never specifies  English  or

Chinese]  its  content  and administration  in  all

fields..."



<br><br>that  is  inclusive  of Government  schools,  aided

schools,  and  so  on.  I think  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  so  far  has been  quite  all  right  in

mentioning it in passing. But when he gets  out  of

order, I will say he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It would seem

that  the  Member  for  Upper Serangoon  has  asked

whether the Government is not willing to give money

for  the  building of schools. Now this is  a  very

good  example. The Member for Pasir Panjang  was  a

director  of  the  Pasir Ris School.  There  was  a

school  building fund which was sufficient  and  he

himself  contributed  $50. The  Government  granted

public funds for the building of the school  - but he

told the people in that area that they did not want

to  build  the school as yet. They must wait  until

the Barisan came to power and then they could build

a  bigger school. If the Member wants to deny this,

he  can do so in the Commission of Inquiry. But  to

threaten  the principals, school teachers  and  the

people  in  the area is really wrong. This  is  the

method  of the Barisan Sosialis, it is their  usual

tactics.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Originated from the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Tonight, the

school  will have a re-election of officials.  This

matter should also be looked into by the Commission

of  Inquiry, because in aided schools some  patrons

and  parents are only eligible to take part in  the

re-election of officials. But we can see here  that

some who have made great contributions are not even

nominated. The list of people -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> On a point of order.

(In Mandarin)  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,   Sir,   the

Parliamentary Secretary has spoken on- this motion.

But we have pointed out on many occasions that what

he  is  saying  are  matters of  detail.  If  these

details  are  true and correct, he  can  very  well

bring them up in the Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



These  details  should  not be  allocated  in  this

motion here.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think I have made my ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, but it is not right.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member for

Anson should remember that the House must listen to

the Chairman and there should be  no interjection or

interpretation.  I have made this  ruling.  I  have

listened to the Members of the Barisan Sosialis who

have  spoken.  They have brought out the  point  of

Government aid to aided schools, the policy of  the

Government  to build more Government  schools,  and

also  what  will  be the future  of  private  aided

schools.  That  is  the point,  as  far  as  I  can

recollect, which the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Education is bringing out. But when he

is  going out of the context of the motion or  even

replying to certain points raised by Member of  the

Opposition then surely I will pull him up as out of

order. Mr Lee Khoon Choy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, what I ant trying to prove is  mainly

that  the  Commission of Inquiry should  also  look

into the political activities of certain parties in

the  schools.  The Member for Upper Serangoon  said

that  we wanted to find scapegoats. I believe  that

if  Members  in  this House have not done  anything

wrong  they should not be afraid. If they have  not

done anything wrong, why should they be afraid  of

the  Commission  of Inquiry looking into  political

activities?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. I thought you

ruled that, in fact, that is not part of my motion,

as  it is not. Is the speaker then suggesting, with

your  leave as being relevant, that we should  have

this motion amended?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Member for Anson has

raised this point of order earlier. I have made  my

ruling  during the earlier part of the debate  when

the  Parliamentary Secretary was  replying  to  the

Member  for  Serangoon Gardens. He was replying  to

what he had said last night in this Chamber. If the

Member  for  Anson  thought  that  the  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens was going out of the motion,  he

should have raised it last night. Afterwards I have

ruled   that   it  is  quite  in  order   for   the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  reply  to  the  point

raised  by  the Member for Serangoon Gardens-  that

the  commission of Inquiry should not go  into  the

political  aspects,  and he touched  on  that  last

night.  Since the Barisan Sosialis have touched  on

it, I think it would be fair to the Government side

to  reply  to that. Nobody is going to  amend  this

motion. So far no amendment has been moved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  the Member for Upper Serangoon  has

said just now that education is closely related  to

politics.  Now  I  am  not  trying  to  digress  by

bringing  in  other matters. I am  just  trying  to

reply  to  what  he  has said.  He  says  that  our

Minister for Education only knows how to work  hard

without knowing what politics is like. He says that

politics  and education are closely related.  Since

he says that is so, how is it that he says that the

Commission   of  Inquiry  should  not   look   into

political activities as well?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that my predecessor had a lot of

work.  I  have  already touched upon that.  In  the

meantime, on certain aspects. I admit that  in  the

Ministry of Education the work of the Parliamentary

Secretary is rather heavy. But the Member for Upper

Serangoon  said  that in the course  of  two  years

there  was a shortage of officers who knew  Chinese

and  there was too much work to be done.  Now  when

there  is  a  lot of work, we have to exercise  our

brains. We should not just work blindly. We have to

find  the  proper  system  in  order  to  get  good

results. I believe if my predecessor was really co-operative with the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



Education,  then they could easily have  found  the

means to solve the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Member for Upper Serangoon seems to be

defending   my  predecessor.  He  says   that   the

Government  is now trying to put all the  blame  on

the shoulders of my predecessor. In this respect, I

believe  that  is  not  so.  Frankly  speaking,  my

predecessor  and  I  are still  on  good  terms  as

before.  But  I  think  that  in  doing  his  work,

especially   in  his  attitude  towards   the   old

teachers,  he  has  brought  the  Government   into

disrepute  among the schools. Some  principals  can

still  remember the occasion when he spoke  to  the

old-timers  in  education. He  was  then  not  only

improper  in his attitude, but when the  principals

came to see him he also made them wait, instead  of

asking them to sit down.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> This has no relevance at all

to  the  motion.  I have told the  hon.  Member  to

please confine himself to the substantive motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng:</b> Point of order. (In Mandarin)

Just now, the Parliamentary Secretary has said that

I accused certain old teachers and that I made some

principals stand



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have already ruled that as

out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I mentioned this

matter  just  now  to refute the Member  for  Upper

Serangoon.  He  also  said  that  very  often   the

suggestions  of  the Parliamentary Secretaries  and

Members of the Assembly were not accepted. He  also

said  that  the  Minister  for  Finance  wanted  to

increase the school fees to $10, but this  was  not

put  into  practice as a result  of  the  objection

raised  by  the  Assemblymen. Was he  not  slapping

himself?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again he talked about the circulars issued by the

Ministry   of   Education  which   he   said   were

unintelligible. But he did not produce any evidence

of which particular sentence was unintelligible. I

can  also  say at random that so and so's  book  is

unintelligible. But if I cannot prove which part is

unintelligible, how can I say such a thing at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



random?  He  cannot make such a sweeping statement.

Is  he trying to ridicule the Inspectors of Schools

as being not so well educated as he himself?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as regards the point raised by the Member

for  Mountbatten.  She talked  about  the  entrance

examination.  I  will say that the  Primary  School

students  who have passed the entrance examinations

will be given a place in the secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Education has already said that we are prepared  to

set  up two Commissions of Inquiry. One of them  is

to  look  into  the  education policy.  We  welcome

Members of the Barisan Sosialis and Members of  any

other Party to bring up constructive criticisms and

suggestions. We also welcome members of the  public

and  organisations  to put forward  their  valuable

views  before the Commission of Inquiry. As to  the

other  Commission  of inquiry, I believe  that  all

members of the public will be treated to a  lot  of

exposures.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is time to

suspend  for  tea. I suspend until half-past five p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, originally the motion was intended to

investigate into the Government's education  policy

and  administration, but it is to be regretted that

the   Government  has  distorted  this  basis,  the

emphasis   of   establishing  this  Commission   of

Inquiry.  Members  on  the  Government  side   have

changed  the basis for establishing this Commission

of  Inquiry. They have distorted facts.  I  do  not

want   to   say  it,  but  then  the  Parliamentary

Secretary   to  the  Minister  for  Education   has

mentioned  my  colleague,  the  Member  for   Pasir

Panjang, saying that he wanted to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



control the Sin Min School. I have been teaching  in

the Sin Mm School. I am very familiar with what  is

going  on in it. Everything going on there is  very

clear.  The- Parliamentary Secretary says that  the

Member  for  Pasir Panjang wanted to  control  that

school. This is an entirely baseless accusation. If

the Member for Pasir Panjang and several members of

the  Barisan Sosialis have contributed money to the

school,  they  are,  of  course,  sponsors  of  the

school. Since they are sponsors of the school, they

have, of course, the right to attend when directors

of  the Management Board of the school are elected.

The  Parliamentary  Secretary  has  said  that  the

Member  for  Pasir Panjang was a director  of  that

school  and  wanted  to  control  it.  This  is  an

entirely baseless accusation. He also says that  he

has  information to prove what he has said. I would

like him to produce such evidence or information. I

think  it would be better if he produces the letter

or any evidence so that we can have proof to go on.

After  that,  we  will be in a better  position  to

investigate anything -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think this Assembly

is interested in any evidence at the moment. All we

are  interested in is that a commission, of Inquiry

be  appointed:, and it is the Commission that  will

ask for evidence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I want to give an

instance. At Chai Chee in Changi there is a  middle

school. The principal was not too good, because his

administration   was  not  good.   Therefore,   the

directors   of  the  Management  Board   were   not

satisfied and so he resigned. Then -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of order. I wanted

to  go  into the details of certain schools, but  I

was  ruled out of order as a result of the  Member

for  Anson's objection. I do not know how  this  is

relevant to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion calls for the

establishment of a Commission of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



Inquiry  to inquire into the Government's Education

Policy,  its  content  and  administration  in  all

fields,  i.e.,  the Government's administration  in

all  fields.  I  certainly think that  the  remarks

passed by the Member for Changi in relation to  the

remarks  passed about the Member for Pasir  Panjang

can  only  be  relevant if they  are  in  reply  to

something  which  was  said  by  the  Parliamentary

Secretary.  If that is so, then that  is  relevant.

Now,  the Member for Changi is endeavouring to heap

irrelevance  upon irrelevance, and I think  I  must

draw  a  line  somewhere. All I can do  now  is  to

suggest  to  Members that if they have anything  to

reply to what has actually been said, then they may

do  so.  But they should not heap irrelevance  upon

irrelevance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what I wanted to say was intended to be in reply to

what he had said. I have no other intention. I only

wanted  to  give  an  example  to  show  that   the

principal of the school at Chai Chee, Changi -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of order. I never

raised the question of Changi School.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): You do not

understand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> What school is it then?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I hear the Member first?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I want to say is this. No matter whether  the

directors  and  principals of a School  are  P.A.P.

members  or Barisan Sosialis members, the point  is

entirely  irrelevant.  The  only  point   that   is

relevant  is  that the principal or director  of  a

school  must not introduce party politics into  the

school. I have been in close relationship with  the

Member  for Pasir Panjang. I understand  very  well

that he never tried to introduce politics into  the

school, especially among the directors who are  not

only members of the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis, but are also members of the P.A.P. and of

other political factions; it is also the case among

the  staff.  Therefore, I say that  this  point  is

entirely  immaterial. It is best  that  this  issue

should not be drawn into political turmoil -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Minister for

Education indicate if I am wrong? The request  here

is  a  Commission of Inquiry into the  Government's

Education Policy, its content and administration in

all  fields.  Infiltration by  political  Paris  or

otherwise   would   be  the  subject   of   another

Commission of Inquiry. Am I right'?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Except, Sir, that the Member

for  Serangoon  Gardens  did  say  that  while   he

supported  the proposed Commission of Inquiry  into

the   education  policy,  he  did  not  like   this

Commission  to  look into political  activities  in

schools. That is how the whole thing arose.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That explains it. That is only in

passing  and  possibly the answer to that  is  yes,

this  Commission  of  Inquiry will  not  look  into

political activities. It is the other Commission of

Inquiry. Sc I see that from that little remark  all

the irrelevancies have occurred.



<br><br>5.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I had not intended to waste  the

valuable time of this House. I do not want to spend

too  much of the time of the House to reply to what

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Education  has  accused me, since  the  Member  for

Changi  has  already  made certain  replies  on  my

behalf,  but there are other points which have  not

been replied to. I now want to touch on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Education  has  said

that  the Barisan Sosialis want to infiltrate  into

the  schools. This kind of accusation  is  baseless

and cannot stand any rebuttal. If his allegation is

correct, then I want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



to tell him that when I was one of the directors of

the  said  school, in 1960, I was a P.A.P. Assembly

Member.  Does it go to show that, because I  was  a

P.A.P. member then, the -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister has asked for

clarification. Will the Member give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng:</b> No. (In Mandarin): The present

principal  is  Mr Lim Cher Kheng. He  has  been  a

principal  of  that school for many years.  Because

under    his    administration    the    post

- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary to

the Minister for Education must not get excited. He

has  made  his  accusation. Surely the  Member  for

Pasir  Panjang  must  be  permitted  to  make  some

rejoinder. I am allowing him to make the rejoinder,

but  when I think he is going a bit too far, I will

stop him. The Parliamentary Secretary must not  get

excited about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you  very much. Because the former principal

of  that  school  was  not very  efficient  in  his

administration, and because he made a mess  of  it,

there was no co-operation between the principal and

the Board of Directors. Because of this -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must ask the Member for

Pasir Panjang to reserve all these details - when  he

or  the  Parliamentary Secretary refers to them - for

the  second Commission of Inquiry. It seems  to  me

that  that will be the proper forum where all these

details could be aired. It is certainly not in this

Assembly on this particular motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

just  now the Parliamentary Secretary said that  he

had  listed the patrons and directors,  but  I  say

that  the  people on the list were elected  by  the

sponsors of the schools and not by me alone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No, I will not

give  way.  I  also  know  that  the  Parliamentary

Secretary quoted me as having said that I told  the

people  to wait until the Barisan Sosialis came  to

power  before  bigger schools were built.  This  is

baseless.  If he does not believe me, then  he  can

ask  our Board of Directors. I am surprised that  a

person  who  claims to have the  interest  and  the

welfare  of  the education of the State  at  heart,

could  have  said such a thing. He referred  to  my

contribution  of $50. This was what  I  could  only

contribute  to the school. I do not know  how  many

millions of dollars the Parliamentary Secretary has

contributed   to  the  school!  If  he   wants   to

understand, I would invite him to visit our  school

and perhaps we could arrange a parents' meeting  to

explain to him the conditions in the school.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I do not

wish  to  dwell at length on the motion before  the

House,  but  after  having carefully  followed  the

debate, it appears to me that the speeches of  many

of  the Members who have spoken do not reflect  the

views  of all the people of Singapore. The  Barisan

Sosialis accuse the colonial Government of inciting

communalism, but  since the  debate  started,  the

Members  of the Barisan Sosialis have never touched

on schools other than Chinese schools. This clearly

shows that they are using communalism -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is exhibiting excitement.

Let  us  try and speak with a bit of calm.  If  the

Member  speaks  to the Speaker and  looks  in  this

direction, perhaps he will modulate his voice.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I spoke in that way

because   we  as  Members  of  this  Assembly   are

responsible  not only for a particular  section  of

the  community  but also for all  sections  of  the

community comprising the various races.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  if  they are genuine  Socialists,  they

should not raise communal issues in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when speaking on this motion, I would ask them

to  look  at other aspects of the education  policy

into which the Commission will investigate.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is precisely the point which

I  raised in the debate on merger last November  as

regards the speeches made by the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Prime Minister when he says that the  speeches

delivered  by  the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis

today  indicate  one point, and that  is  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis  do  not  represent  the  various

communities  of  Singapore but that they  represent

only one community -  the Chinese community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A small one.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> The Chinese community is not a

small  community,  Sir. It is  a  very  predominant

community  in Singapore. Let me remind the  leaders

of the Barisan Sosialis that apart from the Chinese

community  in Singapore, there are also the  Malay,

the  Indian,  the Arabic and other communities  who

owe  their allegiance and loyalty to Singapore.  If

they  persist  in  saying that they  are  the  true

representatives  of the people of  Singapore,  they

should  guide  themselves  in  a  manner  in   this

Assembly  which would not only gain the  confidence

of  Members of this Assembly but also of the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look carefully again into the motion

that  is  before  us, it is clearly indicated  that

what is in the mind of the Member for Anson is that

there should be "a Commission to enquire into the

Government's  Education  Policy,  its  content  and

administration in all fields other than  vocational

and  technical  education ..." The  motion  clearly

indicates  that the Commission should go  into  all

aspects of the educational policy of the Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



except  in  the  fields  of  vocational  and

technical education. It does not confine itself  to

Chinese  education; nor does it confine  itself  to

Malay  education  or  Tamil  education  or  English

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the spirit of this motion before us, I on my

part  hope  that when the Government do  appoint  a

Commission,  the  scope of the terms  of  reference

would  be  as wide as possible and would cover  not

only  Chinese education but would also cover Malay,

Tamil and English education.



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  originally we the  United  People's

Party  were  not interested in this  Commission  of

Inquiry, but the problem of education concerns  all

the citizens and their generations. This is a very

important question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I listened with regret to what

the  Minister for Education said. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  think  you  will  agree that we  cannot  achieve

perfection in dealing with any matter. The  purpose

of  this motion is to find out whether the Minister

for   Education  has  made  any  mistakes  in   his

education  policy  so that there  can  be  a  clear

solution.   But   he   has   tried   to   put   the

responsibility  on  others. I  feel  this  is  very

unjust.  I  think the setting up of this Commission

of Inquiry should be above politics. Only then will

it  have any value. This question not only concerns

Members  of this House, but I believe that  outside

this  Assembly,  parents,  students,  teachers  and

management  committees of schools  also  have  many

opinions  and  views to offer on this question.  If

this   Commission  of  Inquiry  gets  involved   in

politics, then the public will not be interested in

it.    I   believe   that   not   only   is   there

dissatisfaction in Chinese schools,  but  there  is

also discontentment in other schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the U.P.P. have three points to put forward.

First,  when this Commission of Inquiry is set  up,

it should be above politics. Second, the Commission

of Inquiry should be composed of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



educationists from the four streams. These are  our

views on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member started off by saying

that  he  had three points to put forward from  the

United People's Party and the interpreters got two.

Would he perhaps repeat the three points?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

let me repeat the three points raised by me. First,

the Commission of Inquiry should be above politics.

Second,  the  composition of  the  members  of  the

Commission  should be agreed to by all Parties  and

the  members should include educationists from  the

four streams of education. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  was

wrong, there are only two points. I did not say  it

correctly, but there are actually two points.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was just this

unfortunate type of debate with its political  mud-slinging and communal slanting that I had sought to

avoid  when  towards the middle  of  last  month  I

approached  the Minister for Education and  pleaded

that  the  Government should accept  the  suggested

Commission. He was good enough to say that I  write

in  and indicate my views. I wrote in, and then  he

was good enough, Mr Speaker, Sir, on 21st December

to  give  an  assurance  in this  House  that  that

Commission would be appointed; and in all sincerity

I  asked leave to withdraw. But I was told I had to

follow  a certain procedure. Mr Speaker,  at  that

time I expressed gratification and appreciation  to

the  Minister. Unfortunately, he seems  to  have

taken it as being personally directed against  him,

and  he  said  that I was gleeful - as though  I  was

celebrating  a victory. I can assure  the  Minister

that that was not the intention in my mind, however

much   he  may  in  his  ultra-sensitiveness   have

misunderstood  me.  But we  all  assumed,  at  that

juncture, particularly as he had indicated that the

Government would not introduce the measures it  had

in  mind  for  the relaxation of the  six-day  week

because of the appointment of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



this  Commission,  that he would forthwith  appoint

that Commission so there would be no undue delay in

respect  of  matters vital to vast numbers  of  our

population.  In  common,  I  am  sure,  with   many

Members,  I  learned  with consternation  from  the

Prime  Minister  in answer to my  question  on  the

Commission  in respect of the People's  Association

that  the  Commission suggested by this motion  was

going  to  be  the last of four that  he  wanted  a

Supreme Court Judge to chair, and that since  there

was  only one Judge available the Commission  would

be  appointed in the never, never future of  P.A.P.

fogland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then, Mr Speaker if you will remember, as

you  were present on the Monday, that I urged  that

it  was  not necessary to have a Judge. He  pointed

out  that  the  second  limb  of  the  motion,  the

proposed terms of reference which I had sent in  in

my   letter   and  which  referred   to   political

machinations  in schools, did require  a  Judge.  I

said,  "Well,  could  you  not  join  that  to  the

Commission  you  have in mind  in  respect  of  the

boycott of the first secondary school examination?"

And  his  reply, Mr Speaker, if you will remember,

was, "Oh, this is a radically new matter. Would you

write to the Minister for Education?" It was  on  a

Monday  evening at about 3 o'clock. The  very  next

morning  on  a  basis of urgency  I  wrote  to  the

Minister  using the words, "I urge that you  should

now  touch on the second limb of the proposed terms

of  reference to the political commission and leave

the  terms of reference including the six-day  week

to  a commission of educationists." And "Would  you

please" - I said "please", Sir, I may use the  Deputy

Prime  Minister's favourite word politely and these

are the words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As regards the first part of my terms of

reference  which  incorporate the words  "including

the six-day week" in the Motion before the House, I

would urge that the only proper body to investigate

this  is  a  body of educationalists and  that  the

appointment of such a body should be proceeded with

with  vigour  and  finalised this  month.  I  would

appreciate  an  indication from you  by  way  of  a

Ministerial  or Press statement on the  subject  if

possible  before the time for consideration  of  my

Motion is reached.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



And when I rose in answer to the call notice of  my

motion,  you  will remember, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I

offered  an opportunity to the Minister to  make  a

ministerial  statement  so that  the  whole  matter

could  be   withdrawn. But no. I  did  this  in  all

sincerity,  Mr Speaker. I sought no  publicity.  I

had no political axe to grind in this matter. I was

seeking  to  avoid  just this very  political  mud-slinging which you have seen. But not only  did  he

reject  the opportunity  - I should be  astounded  and

keep  getting  astounded,  but  I  should  not   be

astounded  by  what the Front Bench  does,  by  the

violence of his attack on me when he said, "if  the

Member  for Anson thinks he can twist and turn  and

write  letters to mc telling me what to  do  before

withdrawing his motion, if he wishes to act like  a

weathercock, turning with every breath of the wind,

he  is  sadly mistaken." Sir, it is the Free Press,

but  I  do not have to read the document to  remind

the House of what was said.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understand the Member for

Anson  was  quoting  from  a  document, if  he  is

quoting, then he must say what that document is.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged. You will

appreciate,  Mr Speaker, at the  time  I  made  no

notes and I am refreshing my own memory as to  what

was  said.  This was, if you please,  Mr  Speaker,

reported  in quotation marks by the Free  Press  of

today, which I am happy to table.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not necessary to table it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I wrote that letter at

the  request of his Prime Minister. He was present.

Did  he  not  hear  it?  Maybe  he  had  the  wrong

spectacles  on. Furthermore, Sir, the Minister  for

Education  has  told us, "We have  already  decided

that  the  second  limb of the Member  for  Anson's

motion    about    political    machinations    and

interference  in  primary  and  secondary   schools

should be referred to the Commission on the boycott

of the Chinese school examination."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



This is a startling statement, Sir, because

his own Prime Minister on Monday morning said to us

that this was a radical departure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of correction, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Certainly, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am afraid, Mr Speaker, he

misquoted  me in this respect. I did  say  that  he

would  bring  the  second limb of that  within  the

terms  of  reference  of the  first  Commission  to

inquire into the examination boycott. But I did not

say  that it had been decided. "We shall do it,"  I

said.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I will be satisfied

with  my own memory and what the record shows.  The

record  shows, and my memory indicates, it was  the

past  tense  that he used that it was decided  that

that second limb should be with that Commission. It

is  an extraordinary thing, Sir. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

if   the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister   for

Education  so dislike each other that they  do  not

talk  to each other, I can sympathise with both  of

them.  But  the point is this: this is a matter  of

collective responsibility of the Cabinet  in  which

at  least they should inform each other of what  is

happening.  And to stand up there and abuse  me  in

that  manner for complying with the request of  the

Prime  Minister  to write in is  one  of  the  most

startling  experiences that I have undergone.  Now,

Mr Speaker -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Point of order. The Member for

Anson  keeps saying that he will trust his  memory.

Since he has taken the liberty of quoting The  Free

Press, would be  quote that portion where I did  say

that  there would be a Commission of Inquiry  which

would    bring   in   political   activities    and

machinations  in schools? Would he just  quote  the

document which he is trying to quote in one respect

but forgetting another respect?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker. I would like to help

the  Minister who has not helped us, who has wasted

a whole day of our time. This is what I have.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



It  may  be that this is not the paragraph,  and  I

will  be  very  glad for an indication  as  to  the

paragraph that he wants if it is not this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Yong Nyuk Lin made a point by point reply. He

said there would be two Commissions of Inquiry, one

dealing with education policy including the six-day

week.'



<br><br>That is the summary of The Free Press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Lower down!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Do indicate the paragraph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yong Nyuk Lin handed in The Free Press.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In fairness to the Minister, perhaps

the Member for Anson will read the paragraph in the

second  column:  "He said that  the  Commission  of

Inquiry ...".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He said that the Commission of Inquiry into the

examination   boycott  in  Chinese  schools   would

include  political  activity and machinations  that

are extant in primary and secondary schools and  it

will be headed by a High Court Judge.'



<br><br>Yes, Mr Speaker, he did. My point is this. I asked

him   to  make  a  statement.  I  offered  him  the

opportunity  to make a statement which  would  have

saved  a  whole day of debate here. No. Instead,  I

got   abused  yesterday  and  today,  `Sir,  I  got

compliments - "I  thank  the  Member  for  Anson  for

raising  the  motion so that I can reply  point  by

point."  Talk about weathercock, Sir. Just  who  is

the weathercock?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in moving this motion I studiously refrained from any acrimony, from any criticism, from even any comment on the educational policy, hoping, even though the Minister had refused the invitation to make a statement which would have finalised it, that the motion would be dealt with on a non-political, non-communal basis. But I must

say,  Sir,  that that is not the way  it  has  been

treated  by  the  Minister. He has sought  to  make

political capital out of it and the Opposition have

done the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these circumstances, I will continue to

avoid  both the political and the communal aspects.

But there is one point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



that I must emphasise and bring to the attention of

this Assembly. The Minister made this extraordinary

statement: since a Commission of Inquiry is  to  be

appointed, it would be improper for me to introduce

the  measures he had in mind for the relaxation  of

the  six-day week. Sir, the pipe in my bathroom  is

broken  and  the whole bedroom is flooded,  but  it

would  be  improper  for him to repair  it  because

there  are  plumbers examining the  whole  plumbing

system.  That  is the most fantastic and  illogical

statement   for  a  long  time  from  an  illogical

Government.  The very fact that he has  in  mind  a

relaxation  of the six-day week means that  finally

he  has  been  convinced that there  is  widespread

intense and genuine dissatisfaction on the part  of

parents  and  educationists who say, "Our  children

need time for human activities, to make friends, to

go  on picnics, to indulge in the many things  that

build  human character. We don't want our  children

to  be  made  into  P.A.P. machines.  We  want  our

educational system to produce decent human  beings.

It  doesn't  matter whether they are fully  stuffed

with  this, that or the other. We want decent human

beings." And you cannot have that if you have their

noses to the grindstone six days a week. Be fair to

our future citizens. We recognise it is legitimate,

and  yet, Sir, they have the gall to come here  and

say to us:

"First, we will postpone the relaxation of the six-day  week  we have in mind. Second, you  will  have

your  Commission  in the never never  land  of  the

foggy future of the dying P.A.P.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the six-day week freeze, as one newspaper has it headlined, is unwarranted. I do repeat that in fairness to our school population, to the parents and the teachers too! (But they, to me, Sir, are not as important as the school children.) Whatever was contemplated by way of

relaxation, let us have now. But it is no  question

here   of   anything  being  sub  judice.   I   say

furthermore,  Sir, that this Commission  should  be

appointed  with all speed. We have had three  weeks

since  the Minister promised us. He complains  that

his former Parliamentary Secretary sat on the files

and the silver



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



fish escaped from his drawer into his Parliamentary

Secretary's  drawer.  It  seems  to  me  that   the

Parliamentary  Secretary's  silver  fish  have  now

escaped into the Minister's drawer, because he  has

had  three weeks, Sir,I for one believed that  he

was quite honest when he said that he was going  to

have  a  commission. I for one anticipated a  Press

statement  at least to indicate the appointment  of

this  Commission.  We have had three  whole  weeks,

Sir - three  whole  weeks in which nothing  seems  to

have been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one small point I would like to correct and which seems to have been misunderstood.

I have been asked why has there been an  exclusion

of vocational and technical  training from the scope

of this Commission. I would like  to remind  Members

that  there  is  a  Commission  on

vocational and technical training. In fact, we  had

a  Report from it on the 25th of October.  That  is

why   I   am  excluding  vocational  and  technical

training from this motion. I repeat, Sir,  that  it

is obvious from the sentiments expressed in fact by

both sides of the House when they were slinging mud

at  each  other  in a curious contest  of  throwing

things,  like  a quarrelsome, ill-mannered  husband

and  his wife who have separated. When matters were

referred   to   which  were  pertinent,   everybody

recognises  the  validity of the request  for  this

motion  whose  intent is not to  criticise  but  to

ascertain after a lapse of time where we are going,

whether  it is in the right direction, and  how  we

are  to  trim our future course. As the Member  for

Geylang Serai has quite rightly emphasised,  and  I

would  like to repeat it most emphatically,  it  is

not  intended to be limited in any sense whatsoever

to any single stream of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do urge that this Government recognise the responsibility forthwith to introduce

the  best measures available for the relaxation  of

the  six-day week, and that the appointment of this

Commission of inquiry into education should be made now.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.28 p.m.

<div align="center"><b>WEST IRIAN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

mention was made in the House the other night of

the mass rally held by the Barisan Sosialis in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



Geylang Serai nearly two weeks ago, when more  than

10,000  people  gathered together  to  voice  their

support   for   the  Indonesian  demand   for   the

liberation of West Irian. This followed our Barisan

Sosialis Press statement on 28th December, 1961, in

which  we  made  it abundantly clear  that  we  are

completely  with  the Indonesian  people  in  their

hopes  and aspirations on this issue, because  West

Irian is a clear-cut example of remnant colonialism

in   this  part  of  the  world.  Here  the   Dutch

colonialists   have  hoped  to   perpetuate   their

colonial rule by force of arms, occupying a part of

Indonesian  territory  in  spite  of  their  having

recognised the independence of Indonesia and having

transferred    sovereignty   to   the    Indonesian

Government  in  December 1949.  It  is  no  wonder,

therefore, that since then repeated calls have been

made  by  Indonesian  leaders to  drive  the  Dutch

colonialists from their homeland and to  regain  in

toto Indonesian territorial integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the campaign to liberate West Irian has

recently  been stepped up, after patience has  been

exhausted. The Indonesian Government have now shown

beyond  doubt their determination to achieve  their

objective this time. Efforts have been made in  the

past  by  well-wishers,  including  the  Federation

Government,  to  bring the disputing  parties   - the

Dutch and the Indonesian Governments - together to an

amicable   agreement  regarding  the  transfer   of

sovereignty  of West Irian from the  Dutch  to  the

Indonesian  Government. So far no  fruitful  result

has come about. The dispute has also gone up to the

Unit-ed  Nations on many occasions since 1954.  But

to this day, the issue is still not yet settled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Indonesia is a foreign country and we have no

wish to meddle in the affairs of a foreign country.

But  Indonesia  is  also our neighbour.  Living  so

close   together,  we  in  Malaya  cannot  but   be

influenced  and affected by events that take  place

only  a stone's throw, as it were, from our shores.

Just as events from the Federation will affect  our

everyday  life in Singapore, so events in Indonesia

will similarly affect us here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



But  it  is  more  than neighbourly  affection  and

sympathy  that has prompted us to move this  motion

before  the House today. We move this motion today,

Sir,  because the struggle of the Indonesian people

is   not  merely  a  struggle  of  the  Indonesians

themselves.  It is not an isolated struggle  but  a

part  of  the global struggle of oppressed  peoples

against colonial domination. It is only a chain  in

the events of historical developments now unfolding

before the world. As you know, Sir, colonialism  is

the scourge of the modern world. It gives cover  to

the   practice   of   racial   discrimination   and

exploitation and to the practice of injustices  and

inequalities on subject peoples. But since the turn

of the century and especially so since World Wars I

and  II,  people all over the world  have  awakened

from their slumber in increasing numbers; and under

the  relentless pressure of the tide of nationalism

and  self-determination of  the  awakening  masses,

colonialism is gradually forced on the retreat  all

over  the  world.  More  and  more  countries   are

regaining their dignity and self-respect. More  and

more countries are gaining their independence,  and

more  and  more countries are today represented  in

the   forum  of  the  United  Nations.  But  though

colonialism is on the retreat, it will not  retreat

of  its  own  accord.  It will only  retreat  under

relentless pressure from the anti-colonial  forces.

We  have  vividly seen colonialism  fighting  last-ditch   battles   against  the   rising   tide   of

nationalism  and anti-colonialism. For example,  in

what  was  formerly French Indo-China, it  was  the

utter  defeat at Dien Bien Phu which finally forced

the  French to retreat from the Far East.  Recently

in  Goa, it was the strength of t-he Indian  people

after   more   than  four  centuries  of   colonial

exploitation  that finally lowered  the  Portuguese

flag  on  Indian soil. But in Indonesia, the  Dutch

are still holding out, still clinging on leech-like

at  the  expense of the Indonesian  people.  It  is

obvious  that Dutch colonialism has not learnt  the

bitter   lessons  of  history  or,  with   stubborn

stupidity, have chosen to ignore such lessons,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not so long ago the Dutch themselves were

subjected  to  the same humiliating  experience  of

having  to  live under the heel of Fascist  hordes.

Their own struggle for freedom should have been  an

object  lesson to the colonialists and should  have

brought  home  to  them that  of  all  basic  human

rights,  one of the most important is the  inherent

right of peoples to be free. Instead, the Dutch now

practise  suppression themselves.  The  Dutch  must

realise that the tide of anti-colonial sentiment is

now enveloping all Afro-Asia and Latin America. But

now  because of their stupid obstinacy to  see  the

writing  on  the wall, an explosive  situation  has

developed  and is still developing in  West  Irian.

Surely  the Dutch colonialist must know  that  t-he

course of world history cannot be held back by  the

intransigence of the imperialists. Today, Sir,  the

Indonesian people have decided on the liberation of

West  Irian.  In  their struggle  to  recover  West

Irian,  in their struggle to bring it back  to  the

fold  of  their  fatherland, the Indonesian  people

will  have to contend with stiff, strong opposition

from   the  Dutch  colonialists,  backed  by  other

colonial and pro-colonial forces. We all know  that

Holland is a staunch member of the Western bloc and

we  have  no  doubt that SEATO will be alerted  for

possible intervention in an effort to frustrate the

Indonesian  nationalist  attempt  to  recover  West

Irian. We have no doubt that the Dutch stand on the

issue  of  West Irian has won them the support  and

sympathy  of  the Western powers. Already  we  have

witnessed   the   eagerness   of   the   Australian

Government  to  come to the rescue  of  the  Dutch.

Headlines on the 12th of January this year tell  us

that  83,000 men in Australia are virtually on call

for  service in West Irian if required. We can see,

therefore, that the Indonesian struggle will not be

against  the  Dutch  alone, but  also  against  the

combined might of colonialism in this part  of  the

world.  It  will therefore not be an easy struggle.

It  is  for  this reason, Sir, that we  admire  the

courage and determination of the Indonesian people.

They have refused to be cowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



by  the show of superior force of warships and  jet

fighters of the Dutch colonial diehards. Sir,  such

a  show  of  superior arms does not hide  the  fact

that,  at the most, the imperialists can only delay

the  day of final reckoning. The strength, the will

and  the  determination of the people  to  be  free

become   an  irresistible  force  that  cannot   be

stopped. Of course, in expressing our sympathy  for

the  anti-colonial movement, we are also expressing

the   hopes  and  aspirations  of  our  people   in

Singapore.  Singapore is still a  colony.  We  have

only incomplete internal self-government. We shall,

therefore,  look  forward to the day  when  we  too

shall be free. As the Federation has indicated that

full  merger  is  not possible, we  must  therefore

think  of  our  next  milestone  in  constitutional

advance -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Take

up arms!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The next step will take place

in the constitutional talks in 1963 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, I think the Member for

Queenstown  must  agree with  me  that  he  is  now

departing  completely from the  motion  before  the

House.  He  is  opening out a debate  on  the  next

constitutional step Singapore should take. I do not

think that is within the ambit of the motion unless

he can persuade me that it is.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I merely mention it in passing.

I  have  no intention of going further into it.  As

regards the motion before the House, Sir, no right-thinking  man  can  disagree  with  the  sentiments

expressed  in this motion. All admire  the  courage

and  determination of peoples who  struggle  to  be

free;  and  the tougher the struggle, the  more  we

admire such courage -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Join

them!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As a semi-colony we do not have

control  of foreign affairs and we cannot interfere

in matters that touch on foreign relations. But you

will agree with me, Sir, that no one can stop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



us  from expressing sympathy and admiration for the

heroic struggle of a friendly neighbour, or of any

people  for  that  matter. As  a  people  who  have

experienced  and  are  still experiencing  colonial

domination,  we  know full well  the  anguish,  the

bitterness,  the  frustration and  the  humiliation

experienced  by  oppressed people. We  share  their

common  hope for the abolition of hunger,  poverty,

ignorance  and disease. We share their common  hope

for  peace, progress, prosperity, equality, justice

and democracy. And we share their common hope for a

better society, a better livelihood for the people,

and   an   increase   in  material   and   cultural

advancement for all mankind. Hence our sympathy for

the   heroic  struggle  of  the  Indonesian  people

against colonial exploitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is heartening to know that there is

already  indirect  or  maybe  even  direct  contact

between  the  Dutch and the Indonesian  Governments

through  the  help of intermediaries. Let  us  hope

that  such  contact  this  time  will  bring  about

fruitful negotiations that will lead to a lessening

of  international tension and to a  final  peaceful

solution to the West Irian dispute, especially  now

that  self-determination  has  been  promised   the

Papuans   by   the  Indonesian  Government.   This,

however,  must  not  mean that  if  the  Indonesian

nationalists  are compelled by the    recalcitrant

Dutch  colonialists to abandon the peaceful  method

of  solution, we should condemn the Indonesians for

using force and so support the Dutch. We have  seen

how  even  Nehru's  patience was exhausted  by  the

obstinate  Portuguese colonialists. Let  those  who

call  for  a peaceful settlement of the West  Irian

issue  bear  in mind that it is not the  Indonesian

people  who  want to use force. Let  them  remember

that  the  Dutch are holding on to  West  Irian  by

force.  If  there is anyone who should  stop  using

force  right now, then it is the Dutch and not  the

Indonesian people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday's and today's news have already

confirmed the earlier reports that the first shots

have  been fired. The Dutch have claimed that  they

acted   in   self-defence  and  have  captured   50

Indonesian prisoners. But the Indonesian spokesman



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



has  made  it  quite  clear that  it  was  not  the

Indonesians but the Dutch who fired first and  that

the  incident  definitely occurred  outside  Dutch-claimed territorial waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whichever version we may accept, the grim

fact  is  that  the situation can  worsen  and  can

further deteriorate. War or peace we in Malaya  are

bound  to  be  affected and we can only  hope  that

saner counsel may yet prevail before it becomes too

late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I repeat, we all love peace and want peace,

and  we  hope and want to have peaceful settlements

to all disputes whenever possible. But it takes two

parties  to come to a peaceful settlement.  Already

there are threats of "racial war" and of white  and

coloured  conflict coming from people who  believe

in  racial  discrimination. This has been countered

by  equally  stern  warnings of "last-peace-offers"

from the Indonesians to the Dutch. In the midst  of

all  this,  it  is indeed unfortunate that  another

attempt  has  been  made on the life  of  President

Soekarno. I am sure the House will join with me  in

condemning such barbaric activities which can  only

add  fuel  to  this  dispute and which  might  well

render  unavoidable a conflagration that the  whole

world  hopes  will not take place in spite  of  the

first shots having been fired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise, Sir, that merely passing a resolution

in   this  House  will  not  materially  help   the

Indonesians  in their struggle against  imperialist

domination. But we are on the side of the righteous

struggle for justice and the struggle for the basic

rights  of nations. We therefore would like to  add

our  small  voice to the forum of world opinion  of

more  than half the people of the world in  support

of the Indonesian people to liberate West Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the motion in support of the Algerian

people  and  the  motion in  condemnation  of  the

murder of Lumumba, our resolution will merely be  a

gesture; but, Sir, it is a gesture full of  meaning

because  the struggle of the Indonesian people  is,

in truth, a part of the world struggle of oppressed

peoples



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



against  colonial and imperialist  domination.  Let

the  Western  powers remember  that  the  winds  of

change are sweeping across the continents. Let them

not,  through  a stupid refusal to read  the  times

correctly,  turn the winds of change into  typhoons

or  hurricanes of devastation and destruction.  Let

us  hope  that those "first shots" will become  the

"last shots".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for our part, we can only confine ourselves

to  an expression of friendship to our friends  and

neighbours. We urge the people of Singapore to give

their wholehearted support to the Indonesian people

in  their  herioc  and courageous struggle  against

colonial domination. Here we are encouraged to  see

that  Malaya  will  not be used by  any  nation  if

hostilities should break out. In addition, Sir,  as

leaders   of   political  Parties  and  Legislative

Assemblymen,   we   have  also   our   duties   and

responsibilities to our people. We should not  only

reflect  and express public opinion but  we  should

also  take a lead in expressing public Opinion.  We

feel  sure  that  no  one  can  quarrel  with   our

expression  of sympathy with oppressed  peoples  in

their  struggle against colonial domination and  we

are glad to note that even the P.A.P. has expressed

support for the Indonesian struggle in principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> A year ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Long ago.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Under the circumstances, we

hope  all  Parties in this House,  whether  on  the

Government  or the Opposition side,  will  join  in

voting  for  our motion. Let me conclude,  Sir,  by

quoting  from the resolution adopted by  more  than

10,000  people  at the mass rally in Geylang  Serai

two Sundays ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We the people of Singapore join in the cry of the

Indonesian  people  for  the  liberation  of  Irian

Barat.  We must strengthen the unity of all peoples

who   love  peace,  particularly  those  who   have

struggled or are still struggling against  colonial

domination, for we are united by a common  colonial

heritage and experience, by a greater understanding

of the reality of freedom, and by a common sense of

suffering and endeavour. Support Indonesia's demand

for the liberation of Irian Barat."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, taking cognizance of the heroic

struggle of the Indonesian people to liberate Irian

Barat from colonial rule, expresses admiration  for

the  determination  and courage of  the  Indonesian

people and expresses full sympathy with their hopes

and  aspirations,  and calls  upon  the  people  of

Singapore to give their wholehearted support to our

neighbours and friends, the people of Indonesia, in

their just and legitimate struggle against colonial

domination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there are really

two  approaches  to this motion on the  West  Irian

issue.  One is in terms of Indonesian politics  and

Indonesian  aspirations. The other is in  terms  of

the  increasing  difficulties and apprehensions  of

the Barisan Sosialis in search of a gimmick. It  is

necessary for us to keep in mind these two  aspects

of  the motion: the West Irian issue in relation to

Indonesia:  and  the West Irian  issue  as  it  has

repercussions in Singapore and in so far as it acts

as  a vitamin pill to restore the waning vigour  of

political  forces which have already passed  in  so

short a time from a juvenile to a senile stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, insofar as it concerns the Indonesian people,

the P.A.P. has made its stand clear long before the

West  Irian  issue came into prominence nearly  two

years  ago.  The P.A.P.'s stand on the  West  Irian

issue  was contained in a joint statement  made  by

the  Prime Minister and Indonesia's First  Minister

Djuanda  when the Prime Minister paid  a  visit  to

Indonesia.  This  recognition of  the  validity  of

Indonesia's  claim to West Irian, as  far  as  this

Government  is  concerned, is  based  on  the  same

principles and arguments which have led many of  us

to support the liberation of Malaysia from colonial

rule.  That  is why, Sir, we find it a little  more

than  odd  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  who   are

fighting  Malaysia tooth and nail  on  a  different

principle,  should  have  at  the  same  time  come

forward  as  fervent champions of  merger  of  West

Irian  with Indonesia. What are the principles  and

reasons  to justify our contention that West  Irian

is an integral part of Indonesia and that the Dutch

should retreat gracefully and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



peacefully from the territory of West Irian? It has

been  contended  by the Dutch that  West  Irian  is

linguistically,    culturally,     racially     and

geographically distinct from the rest of Indonesia,

and  that the ultimate destiny of West Irian is  to

become  a  separate self-governing State under  the

trusteeship  and tutelage of the Dutch.  The  Dutch

objective is self-determination for West Irian. The

Dutch  colonialists say they cannot hand over  West

Irian  to  the  Indonesians  without  having  first

ascertained the wishes of the Papuans,  the  people

of  West  Irian  - whether they want to  be  part  of

Indonesia,   whether  they  want  to   merge   with

Indonesia, and whether they want to exchange  Dutch

rule for Indonesian rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, one would have thought



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> You are quoting the

Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir, I am quoting the Barisan

Sosialis.  Sir, one would have thought  that  these

arguments  by  the  Dutch colonialists  would  have

appealed  to  the  sense of logic  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis, because they have used the same  argument

to  oppose merger and Malaysia. Are we not  handing

over  British colonies in North Borneo to the Tunku

without  first  consulting the people,  the  people

being  defined as the frightened and desperate  men

of  the  Barisan Sosialis? But in the case of  West

Irian,  there is no mention by the Barisan Sosialis

about  consulting  the people  of  West  Irian.  No

question  is being asked whether internal  security

will be in the hands of the people of West Irian or

of the Central Government of Indonesia. There is no

demand that elections should first be held in  West

Irian to determine whether the Papuans do or do not

want to merge with Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from insisting on such conditions, the Barisan

Sosialis,  not  only  in  this  Chamber  but   also

outside,  are ready to support a military  invasion

of  West  Irian  by Indonesia. In  fact,  Sir,  the

Member  for  Queenstown told us earlier that  there

was a rally at which 10,000 people were present. As

far  as  I know  - and it was checked up - the  figures

quoted by the newspapers (both the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



English  and the Chinese) are stated to be  between

5,000  and  6,000. And by the time the  Member  for

Queenstown   ended  his  speech,  he   made   fresh

calculations  and said that there  were  more  than

10,000  people. So in half an hour the  figure  had

slightly increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, Sir, but more important - apart from

saying  that the Indonesians (and we believe  quite

rightly)  are entitled to take West Irian by  force

if  necessary, the Barisan Sosialis supporters, who

want  to  show that they support a forceful taking-over  of  West Irian by Indonesia, have volunteered

to  fight for the liberation of West Irian. Sir, as

an  indication, we had in the Straits Times of  4th

January,  1962,  a  picture and a  story  of  three

Singapore  women  enlisting  for  the  West   Irian

invasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We want to eradicate colonialism from the face of

Asia,"  says  trio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three young Singapore women,

including  a  mother  of four, today  enlisted  for

service with Indonesian forces against the Dutch in

West Irian.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are impressed with very courageous women

enlisting  for  service in West  Irian,  especially

seeing  a  photograph of three  women  prepared  to

volunteer for service in West Irian. This only goes

to  show  that the spirit of chivalry is  not  dead

among  the Barisan Sosialis males. They believe  in

women and children first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has made it quite clear in a

statement  issued that it has no wish  to  put  any

hindrance in the way of any Barisan Sosialis men or

women  who  may wish to participate  in  the  armed

battle for the liberation of West Irian. All we ask

of  the  Member for Queenstown is that  he  should

concede to us non-violent, unromantic stay-at-homes

the  privilege  of  liberating  Singapore  and  the

Borneo  territories from British rule  by  peaceful

constitutional  means. I say this, Sir,  because  I

know  that  the  Secretary-General of  the  Barisan

Sosialis, in a speech delivered during a mass rally

in  support of West Irian, which, according to  the

Member  for  Queenstown,  drew  10,000  people  but

which,  according to other more reliable witnesses,

amounted to between 5,000 and 6,000, drew for us at

this meeting what he called the lessons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



to  be  learnt from the West Irian and Goa  issues.

One   of  the  things  he  said  is  that  in   the

constitutional game there is a lesson to  be  drawn

from  the West Irian struggle, which was put across

to what we say "between 5,000 and 6,000 people" but

which  the  Member for Queenstown says amounted  to

10,000  people. He said  - I quote from  the  Straits

Times of 8th January:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`West Irian, they said, was the symbol of Western

domination  in  Asia  and the Western  powers  were

therefore keenly interested in preserving this ugly

symbol of their past glory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We realise that the moment is coming when we too

will  receive the support and help of other  peace-loving people to free us from colonial domination,"

he said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim called on the people of Singapore to draw a lesson from the West Irian and Goa issues.'



<br><br>This is what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us not for one moment believe that forces

sympathetic to Western imperialism want  to  assist

us in our struggle."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Colonialism cannot be ended by any form of

constitutional imposition,".'



<br><br>"cannot  be  ended  by any form  of  constitutional

imposition". I was not quite clear what  it  meant.

So  I  got  somebody to translate the same  article

from  the Nanyang Siang Pau of the same day. I will

just  give  the  translation which is  a  hit  more

extensive:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Colonialism cannot be ended [says Mr Lim] by

depending  on constitutional arrangement  from  the

top  to the bottom ... In our struggle it is stupid

to  line  up  with pro-colonial forces....  Playing

about with constitutions is useless.".'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I trust the Minister is not going to

embark on a debate on that because that has nothing

to  do  with  the motion. That is quite a  separate

issue. The motion deals strictly with West Irian.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to draw

the  lesson  that this motion put  forward  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis wants to convey to the people  of

Singapore.   This  motion,  as   the   Member   for

Queenstown says, has certain implications  for  the

people of Singapore. I want to convey to you,  Sir,

what  the real implications of this motion are,  in

so far as it relates to Singapore. Is it really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



necessary  for  the people to know that?  What  the

Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis is trying

to  do is to tell the people of Singapore that  the

West  Irian  lesson is simple - that if you  want  to

carry  forward the anti-colonial struggle,  do  not

play   about  with  the  constitutional   struggle.

"Constitutions  are  useless." The  implication  is

quite clear, Sir. If you want to carry forward what

they  call  the anti-colonial struggle in Singapore

and  in  the  Borneo territories,  obviously  other

means are called for. It is very important that  we

should not allow this motion to be approved without

our  making it quite clear that we are not  drawing

the  same  lesson from that motion as  the  Barisan

leaders want the people of Singapore to draw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least it is quite clear to us, Sir, and it is

significant to Singapore that some Barisan Sosialis

members  are  growing weary of  the  constitutional

struggle.  Many of them may believe, as  Communists

do  believe, that power must eventually emerge from

the  barrel  of a gun. That may be the lesson  that

the Barisan Sosialis is drawing from the West Irian

issue.  But our advice to them is that  this  is  a

most  disastrous lesson for them to draw.  Whatever

justifications there may be for the Indonesians  to

use  force for the liberation of West Irian,  there

is  none in Singapore or in Malaya or Malaysia.  In

fact,  Sir,  in the course of the same speech,  the

Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  made

another  equally significant observation   - I  quote

again  from the Straits Times of 8th January.  This

is what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"`We realise that the moment is coming..."',



<br><br>this is in connection with the West Irian rally,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"... the moment is coming when we too will receive

the  support and help of other peace-loving  people

to free us from colonial domination,"'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for many of us, the term "peace-loving

people" might have the obvious meaning. But  for  a

Communist cadre, the term "peace-loving people" has

a  specific  and precise meaning. If you  read  any

Communist document or publication, when they  refer

to "peace-loving people", it is a term they use for

countries which are Communist. So if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



read  it  not as people who are not well versed  in

the  Communist  jargon  but as  trained  Communists

would  read  it,  we realise that  "the  moment  is

coming  when  we too will receive the  support  and

help   of   other  peace-loving  people  of   other

Communist  countries  to  free  us  from   colonial

domination." These are the lessons, Sir, which  the

pro-Communist elements in the Barisan Sosialis want

to  put across to their followers by using the West

Irian issue as a cover -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You sound like McCarthy!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Whether or not that sounds like

McCarthy - this   is   the   term;   here   are   the

quotations - what does the Secretary-General  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  mean  when  he  says  that   the

constitutional struggle is useless?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Non-Communist, democratic, socialist Malaya." He

believes in struggling for this kind of a Malaya by

constitutional means. Here is the man who  says  it

is  useless.  And  in relation to West  Irian,  the

lesson  is  quite  obvious.  The  other  statement,

"other   peace-loving  people,  other  peace-loving

countries which will come to our assistance." Whose

assistance?  Therefore,  Sir,  though  we  are   in

support of the motion, we must make it quite  clear

that  the lessons we draw from the West Irian issue

are  not the lessons that the Barisan Sosialis  and

their   mentors  want  to  put  across   to   their

followers, to their cadres and their organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real lesson that we should draw from West

Irian  for Singapore is not that constitutions  are

useless   but  that  it  is  impossible   for   the

Communists  to halt the unification of  territories

which   the   retreating   colonial   powers    had

administered for so long as a coherent economic and

political unit. Sir, political boundaries are  man-made,  though  the  making of them  may  follow  no

precise and accepted rules. They are established by

many   means;   by  settlement,  by  invasion,   by

conquest,  by sale and transfer, and by many  other

ways.  In Asia the boundaries of many nation States

are  those established by the colonial powers which

exercised dominion over them. What we call India on

Burma or Malaya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



or   Indonesia  are  comprised  within   boundaries

largely drawn up by the colonial powers that  ruled

over  these  territories.  For  example,  Sir,  the

history  and  boundaries of Malaya or of  Indonesia

would have been different if these territories  had

come,  say, under the rule of the British or  under

the  rule  of  the Dutch. But because  the  British

happened to carve up Malaya, Singapore upwards: the

Dutch   starting  from  Sumatra  to   West   Irian;

therefore,   the  boundaries  of   what   we   call

Indonesia,  and  what  we  call  Malaya  have  been

defined  for us by the colonial powers.  Therefore,

though  boundaries  cannot  be  logically  defined,

nobody can say why Malaya should comprise Singapore

and the Federation, or why Malaysia should comprise

Malaya,  Singapore and the Borneo  territories.  We

start  off by accepting that at any given time  the

boundaries  of a State today are those  which  have

been  established as States or colonies which  have

become   independent  or  are   going   to   become

independent.  The boundaries are those  which  were

there  when  the  colonial power was  administering

these  countries as a single unit. Such a unit  may

have  embraced  a diversity of races and  cultures,

but   the   fact  that  the  colonial   power   had

administered  it  for decades or  centuries  as  an

integrated  unit  has encouraged  nationalists  who

have  taken over from the colonial power to  regard

the  colonial frontiers as the national  frontiers.

The   colonial   frontiers  become   the   national

frontiers. The evacuating colonial powers,  on  the

other hand, when they were forced to, have given up

dominion over a colonial territory and have gone in

for  dismemberment of their former empires into new

and  often contending States. That has happened  in

India, in Indo-China, in Indonesia and in Malaya.



<br><br>7.20 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such Balkanisation of former colonial territories

when  they gained independence invariably  resulted

in  the  emergence of weak and unstable States  and

therefore,   far   from  becoming  independent   by

dismemberment, by Balkanisation, they  become  more

amenable to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



control either by the evacuating colonial power  or

by  any  other power which is stronger than any  of

the  individual  units which form part  of  a  more

integrated  territory. That is one of  the  reasons

why  genuine nationalists have always resisted such

Balkanisation  because they quite  rightly  believe

that in the modern world  - I can quite realise, Sir,

why  the Members of the Barisan Sosialis find  some

amusement because it is increasingly quite clear to

them  that they are precisely in the position where

the  Dutch are in relation to West Irian. They  are

the  ones  who  refused merger, as  Singapore  and

Malaya were divided by the British.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> How silly can you

become?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, when we come to the issue on

Malaysia,  we  are going to reveal  how  silly  the

Member  for Thomson can become. Sir, as far as  the

West  Irian  issue is concerned,  they  are  a  bit

uncomfortable because the Barisan Sosialis are  the

Dutchmen of Singapore and Malaya. The fact is  that

they  have brought up the motion on West Irian with

their tongues in their cheeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is something funny!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I am hoping that very soon

there  will be 13-12, I am sorry, Sir,  a  lady  is

there - 12  empty  seats here as the gentlemen  march

off  to West Irian, unless, of course, Sir, as  has

been  the  custom  of  the Barisan  Sosialis,  they

believe  in  using  the women first.  When  we  had

trouble  in  the community centres, the women  were

out   to  fight.  Fortunately,  Sir,  we  took  the

precaution  of  sending  women  police.   But   the

nationalists  have for this reason always  resisted

Balkanisation and fragmentation of former  colonies

by  the  colonial  powers on the pretext  of  self-determination for this or that ethnic, religious or

cultural group, because once you accept that  every

ethnic,  cultural  or racial group  in  a  colonial

territory  should be asked its opinion,  should  be

allowed self-determination first, then there is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



end to it. We can start off with Singapore. Geylang

Serai   probably  can  ask  for  self-determination

because  they  say  that area is constituted  by  a

particular ethnic group, with particular religious,

cultural  and  racial  affinities,  and  therefore,

Geylang  Serai must be given autonomy.  The  Member

for  Havelock  can  claim that Havelock  should  be

given  autonomy  because  it  comprises  a  certain

section  of  clans  from China who  speak  slightly

different  dialects from those in the  neighbouring

constituency of Hong Lim, and so on.  There  is  no

end  to  arguments that can be brought  forward  to

justify  self-determination for this or that  group

in  a  colonial  unit when, in fact,  the  colonial

power  has administered that political unit as  one

unit for hundreds of years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Dutch can, when they say that West Irian is

something  separate. Of course, logically  you  can

say  so.  These people are different. But the  same

argument  which  can  be  used  for  giving   self-determination to West Irian can also  be   used  for

isolating  Celebes or Bali. But the  fact  is  that

they  do  not do so because in the case of  Celebes

and  Bali, they were accepted as integral parts  of

Indonesia simply because they had been administered

as  parts  of Indonesia by the Dutch. On the  other

hand,  Malaya, Singapore and the Borneo territories

have  not  been  regarded  as  parts  of  Indonesia

because  they had been administered as  territorial

units of the British Empire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in unqualified support of the

Indonesian  claim  that  West  Irian  is  part   of

Indonesia,  the Barisan Sosialis are  conceding  to

the  Indonesians what they refuse  to  the  Malayan

nationalists. They are prepared to volunteer -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Only girls are prepared!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - for service in West Irian and

help  take  over West Irian by force and  therefore

prevent   quite  rightly,  the  Balkanisation   and

weakening of the unit that once formed part of  the

Dutch   Empire.  But  when  it  comes  to  creating

Malaysia  by retaining the administrative  and  the

economic unity created by the British, the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis  are all for Balkanisation. Is it  because

they want to see the Malaysian States weakened  and

impoverished simply because they see no prospect of

a Communist take-over of this area?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Indonesia, the Barisan Sosialis,

quite   rightly,  support  the  consolidation   and

reunification of territories formerly  under  Dutch

rule into a strong national State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for their own country, these Malayan patriots,

these Dutchmen of Singapore, suggest Balkanisation.

There  are  no Barisan volunteers to help  liberate

Malaysia  from colonial rule - not even the men  from

the  Barisan  Sosialis   - and  more  important,   to

liberate it peacefully and constitutionally. We are

not  asking for volunteers to come out in uniforms.

We  say we want volunteers who can help bring about

Malaysia  without  any head being  broken,  without

anybody having to go to somebody else's funeral. We

are   suggesting   the   liberation   of   Malaysia

peacefully  and constitutionally. But  the  Barisan

Sosialis  have spent the best part of  many  months

sabotaging  the retention of units which  at  least

under  the  British were administered as  a  single

political, economic and cultural unit. So  we  want

to  know, for whom are the Barisan Sosialis keeping

Malaysia balkanised and weak?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Communist Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is quite clear what the

Secretary-General  of  the Barisan  Sosialis  means

when  he  says that the constitutional struggle  is

useless, and then keeps up the flagging spirits  of

the Barisan Sosialis followers who are beginning to

realise  that perhaps this time they have  launched

out  on an adventure from which there is no return.

Sir,  you  can volunteer for West Irian and  get  a

return  ticket; but in this adventure there  is  no

return  ticket and, therefore, it is necessary  for

the  Secretary-General of the Barisan  Sosialis  to

keep  up  their  spirits by  saying,  "Keep  Malaya

balkanised  because we realise that the  moment  is

coming  when  we  (that is,  not  the  people;  the

Barisan Sosialis) too will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



receive  the support and help of other peace-loving

people."  I  have indicated, Sir, the term  "peace-loving   people"  when  used  and   understood   by

Communists to mean countries where there is no such

thing   as  a  democratic  non-Communist  Socialist

Malaya  or the dictatorship of the proletariat  and

where  there are no Opposition benches.  So  it  is

quite  clear,  Sir, that in the case  of  Malaysia,

they   are   not  prepared  to  concede  the   very

principles  which they have quite rightly  conceded

to  the Indonesians. In the case of Malaysia,  they

want  to  keep it divided and weak. In the case  of

Indonesia,  as  I  have said, quite  rightly,  they

support the taking-over of West Irian by force,  if

necessary, but certainly without consultation  with

the  Papuans,  the people of West  Irian.  No  such

thing  as asking whether elections are to  be  held

first before West Irian is merged with Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this occasion to wish

the 12 Barisan Assemblymen -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Bon voyage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Bon voyage -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - in their enterprise to liberate

West Irian from the Dutch, their political brothers

as  far as Singapore is concerned, because like the

stubborn  Dutchmen  who do  not  realise  that  the

course  of  history is such that no one can  combat

the  force of nationalism, so the Barisan  Sosialis

too  are trying to break up Malaysia when, in fact,

historically, it is inevitable. I hope that in view

of the fact that three women members of their Party

have  volunteered, the other 12 Members would  also

march forward to liberate West Irian -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear! We will cheer

them!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - while we stay at home. We are not

so  adventurous. We will see to it that we liberate

Singapore,   Malaya   and   Malaysia    from    the

colonialists.  Meanwhile,  Sir,  whether   the   12

Barisan  Sosialis men volunteer or do not volunteer

will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



make  one bit of difference to the outcome of  the

struggle  in  West  Irian,  because  there  are  90

million  Indonesians, and they  can  liberate  West

Irian  with  or without the assistance  of  the  12

Barisan Assemblymen because -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thirteen! None have died yet

so far!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> One woman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, one woman, Sir. As far as

this  struggle in West Irian is concerned,  we  are

confident that the Indonesian people will meet with

success  in  their  effort to  regain  West  Irian,

because  the  reunification  of  West  Irian   with

Indonesia is inevitable. Similarly, our efforts  to

liberate Malaysia from the British as well as  from

the  Barisan Sosialis will be  as equally successful

because the emergence of Malaysia is as inevitable.

Just  as merger with Malaya is inevitable,  so  too

the  merger  of West Irian with Indonesia  will  be

equally inevitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last thought for the Barisan Sosialis. The Dutch

are making a stupid mistake when they fight against

the  irresistible  force of  nationalism.  Let  the

Barisan Sosialis also remember that he who takes on

the irresistible force of Malayan nationalism is in

for a bad mauling.



<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  we  in  Singapore and in Malaya have  certain

basic problems common with Indonesia. They are  the

problems  of  the overwhelming masses  of  our  two

peoples   - food,  clothing, unemployment,  education

and  housing. In the case of Indonesia,  they  were

exploited  by the Dutch colonialists. In our  case,

we  were exploited and are still being exploited by

the  British  colonialists.  Their  techniques   of

colonial  rule might differ, but the aims  are  the

same,  i.e.,  the  economic  exploitation  of   the

subject   peoples.   There  is   another   striking

similarity  between our two peoples which  is  very

interesting.  As  the  Indonesian  people  are  now

fighting  for reunification of West Irian and  free

Indonesia, we in Malaya are also fighting  for  the

reunification



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore and Malaya. Who  has  brought

about  such an artificial separation? In Indonesia,

it  is  the Dutch colonialists and in Malaya it  is

the British colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are extracts of a

radio  speech I made over Jakarta Radio on 15th  of

January,  1959, and reproduced in the Sin Chew  Jit

Poh  on the 17th of January, 1959. My speech is  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The impact of the Indonesian revolution has been

felt very much in Malaya. We must thank your people

for the inspiration you have given us. Singapore is

at present still a British colons', but in the next

few months it will be promoted to a semi-colony. As

you  are  fighting  for the reunification  of  West

Irian and Indonesia, we are fighting in Malaya  for

the  reunification of Singapore and the  Federation

of  Malaya  "[and  for  the benefit  of  the  Prime

Minister    and   his   colleagues,    a    genuine

reunification]." It is my belief that there  should

he  more  exchanges  of visitors  between  our  two

countries  such  as  scholars,  political  leaders,

tourists, trade and cultural delegations, etc. Such

an  exchange would help much to bring about  closer

ties  between  the  two countries.  The  masses  of

Singapore and Malaya are very sympathetic' -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen): Order. I think

the Member must hear in mind that we are debating a

motion  giving  full  support for  the  West  Irian

movement; not cultural and trade relations  between

Indonesia  and  Singapore. So  if  the  Member  can

confine himself to the motion, it would be better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will

only take a few lines and you can rest assured that

this is within the limits of the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The masses of Singapore and Malaya are very

sympathetic towards the Indonesian revolution.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Irian fight is a part of the Indonesian

revolution. That is why I bring up the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They will not want to do anything which will hurt

the  bonds  of  friendship of the two  peoples.  We

believe,  through brotherly friendship  and  mutual

aid,  our  two  peoples will  triumph  against  the

common  enemy  and achieve ultimately  a  just  and

prosperous society.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, colonialism is dying out

in  all  parts of the world. Pockets of colonialist

forces  in Asia and Africa are being mopped up  bit

by bit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



We  in  this  Assembly  also  expressed  our  anti-colonial feelings during the time when Lumumba  was

massacred, on the occasion of Algerian struggle for

independence. We in the United People's Party  also

made a New Year announcement of our support of  the

Indian   recovery  of  Goa  from   the   Portuguese

colonialists.  Likewise  we  support  the   present

Indonesian  stepping-up campaign  to  restore  West

Irian   back   to  the  bosom  of  the   Indonesian

motherland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, West Irian has for too

long  been separated from Indonesia and it is  high

time  that  the  people of the  world  rise  up  to

support  the Indonesian people in their just  cause

and  struggle  for recovery of the  land  which  is

theirs.  If the Dutch do not understand the history

of  revolution, as they have not in the  Indonesian

struggle,   then   they   should   face   all   the

consequences. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we hope that

everyone in this Assembly will support this  motion

sincerely  and honestly because we believe  in  the

anti-colonial movement, and we hope, as before  the

Hong  Lim  by-election,  when  the  cases  of   the

Algerian motion and the Lumumba motion were brought

up  in  this Assembly, it will receive a  unanimous

vote from this Assembly.



<br><br>7.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the stupidity

and  silliness of the P.A.P. logic was demonstrated

by  none other than the Minister for Culture in his

speech  just  now. Sir, this is a  motion  on  West

Irian. It is not a motion on Malaysia; it is not  a

motion  on  the activities of the Malayan Communist

Party and Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Dutch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is not a motion that is meant to

provide  opportunities  for  the  P.A.P. to   make

political  propaganda. However, Sir, all  that  the

Minister for Culture was seeking to do was to  show

that  while we support the Indonesian claim of West

Irian, we oppose the reunification of Singapore and

Malaya  and,  therefore,  we  are  like  the  Dutch

colonialists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.44 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to waste my breath answering

the  stupidity of this logic. I am prepared to talk

at  great length on the Malaysia motion. But before

I discuss the motion before us, I want just to make

one  brief remark to dispose of this silly line  of

argument.  Sir,  there is a basic  and  fundamental

difference between the Indonesian claim  over  West

Irian and the P.A.P. plan for the reunification  of

Singapore and Malaya. It is a very simple fact.  In

the  case  of the claim of Indonesia, the Dutch  do

not  support the claim, whereas the P.A.P. type  of

merger is supported by the Colonial Office. This is

a very fundamental -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So the Dutch support -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - point that ought to be remembered. Sir,

nowhere  in  the history of colonialism  has  there

been a colonial power supporting the call -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was struck by the

illumination thrown on this question of  whether  a

plan   is  colonial  or  not  colonial.  Am  I   to

understand  from  the Member for  Thomson  that  he

would  call  the Borneo Federation a colonial  plan

because   it   was   sponsored   by   the   British

colonialists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not interested in arguing Malaysia

over  this motion at this time. The Prime  Minister

can raise the question when the motion dealing with

Malaysia  comes up and I will only be too delighted

to answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, it is not our intention to use - [Interruption]. I hear running dogs barking, but I

can   understand  quite  well  how  pro-colonialist

stooges  ought  to feel when they realise  that  in

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



attempt to compare their sort of independence  with

a  merger plan with the Indonesian claim over  West

Irian, the people laugh at them. But, Sir, this  is

the  only  point  I  want to  make  to  answer  the

Minister for Culture. I do not feel happy  to  call

him the Minister for Culture, Sir, because -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Agriculture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He cannot even qualify to be a Minister

for  Agriculture! But the only point is that  while

the  British Colonial Office support the  so-called

liberation  of  Malaysia, no  colonial  power,  let

alone the British -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You went to see them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - can support the claim of the Indonesian

over West Irian.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

He has forgotten Eden Hall.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know why the

Government Benches are flouting the Standing  Order

so very often. The Standing Order says that when  a

Member is speaking there shall be no interruptions.

I  have  allowed interjections - yes,  interjections

which   are   perhaps   pleasantries   - but    when

interjections  become  a running  commentary,  then

they are completely out of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is very sad!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, West Irian is part of the

Indonesian  nation. This fact  of  course  is  also

conceded by the P.A.P. If Irian Barat is  part  of

Indonesia,  how  is  it that the  Dutch  can  still

control  the  country  and  directly  exploit   its

natural  resources and the people? Sir, the obvious

answer  is that the Dutch are there by force.  They

have  occupied  the place by force  and  they  have

maintained  control by virtue of their armed  might

backed  to the hilt by N.A.T.O., including Britain,

which supports the so-called liberation of Malaysia

plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even today the newspapers talk of Holland's

radar-equipped Neptune air-craft,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



heavily armed aircraft-carriers and warships

that  are  stationed in West Irian. Under cover  of

their  armed  might, they have tried to  set  up  a

puppet  State  on  the pretext  of  granting  self-determination to its populace.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we all have seen the dirt that came

from Katanga with the disclosures of honest men who

wished  to  see peace in this troubled  world.  The

Indonesian  people have tolerated Dutch  occupation

of  part of their territory for more than a  decade

now.  They  have  shown patience and  a  determined

effort  to avoid the use of force in their  attempt

to  liberate  their country. But this patience  has

been  taken by the Dutch colonialists as a sign  of

weakness. The patience displayed by the Indonesians

is  only  matched by that of the Indian  people  in

their  efforts  to  liberate Goa,  Damao  and  Diu.

Despite   15  years  of  attempts  at  a   peaceful

settlement, the Portuguese had adamantly refused to

see   reason.   The   only  language   that   these

colonialists understand is force. Sir, the  Indians

were forced to use force. Even the most Gandhian of

Gandhi's disciples do not condemn the Indian action

and  the  Minister  for Culture is  far,  far  from

coming  anywhere near being Ghandhi's disciple.  He

is  more  close  to people like Hitler,  Mussolini,

etc. Sir, I have known him for a few years now  and

I  told the Prime Minister that if there is one man - in  fact,  there  are two, Sir - in the  P.A.P. who

definitely has Fascist tendencies, it is none other

than  the  Minister for Culture. The  Minister  for

Finance is -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> A gentleman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - coming very close to challenging the

Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Worse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the use of force, as I have said,

was  forced  on  the Indian people  just  like  the

present  build-up of armed might against the  Dutch

was forced upon the people of Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the responsibility for any bloodshed and loss

of lives, in my view, should rest wholly and solely

on  the  colonial  powers. Even according  to'  the

Straits Times - which we know is a pro-colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



newspaper - the first shots were fired by the  Dutch.

I am sure that hon. Members of this House would not

have  missed  reading the headlines in the  Straits

Times  a couple of days ago. Therefore, Sir, it  is

absurd  to  condemn the Indonesian people  for  the

talk  of war to liberate Irian Barat. Sir, even  at

this  last moment, the Indonesian people have  left

ample  opportunity  for a peaceful  settlement.  We

fully support the Indonesians in their struggle  to

liberate Irian Barat. We understand their policy of

open confrontation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why are you chaps so scared of

an open confrontation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No guts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know why the

Government  Benches are being so  disorderly.  That

was not a pleasantry anyway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is their disorderly mentality at

work.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I would urge Members on the

Government  side  not to treat the  debate  on  the

motion before us lightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure you will remember that when the motion

on  Lumumba  was debated in this Assembly  sometime

back, the Prime Minister in moving the motion, was,

in  fact,  making  fun. Sir,  we  understand  these

people  in  the Government have to move motions  to

support  the  call  to  condemn  the  assassins  of

Lumumba,  have  to  support  the  struggle  of  the

Algerian  people, have to support  this  and  that,

because  if they do not do these things, they  will

clearly  expose themselves as people who  stand  on

the side of the colonialists [Interruption]. I urge

them  - perhaps as a respect to the Indonesian people

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to treat the debate on this motion seriously, as I

have no doubt that the Prime Minister and the other

Ministers  know  that  the lives  of  thousands  of

people are involved. To



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



the  Indonesians,  Sir,  this  is  not  a  laughing

matter.  It  is  not  a  question  of  three  girls

volunteering.  I  do  not  know  whether  they  are

members  of the Barisan Sosialis. The Minister  for

Culture  says  they  are  members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. I shall go back and find out. For  all  I

know,  this  is just another line the  Minister  is

shooting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You mean you would be ashamed

if they were.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is not a question of three women

volunteering or the Government Members volunteering

or the whole population of Singapore volunteering -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Provided it is not you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - to go and help the Indonesians to

liberate West Irian. I tell the Prime Minister that

I  am  not - and  he  knows it - as weak-kneed  and  as

cowardly as many of the men who are sitting on that

side  of  the House, and I do not want, as  I  have

said, -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. Is it in

order to call Members weak-kneed and cowardly?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is certainly not in order. It is

completely  out of order if by that  expression  he

was  referring  to  Members of  the  Assembly.  The

relevant  Standing Order states that an expression.

must  be  offensive and insulting. I take  it  that

that  expression  was offensive and  insulting  and

therefore I ask the Member to withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw it.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That this Assembly do now adjourn."-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].
