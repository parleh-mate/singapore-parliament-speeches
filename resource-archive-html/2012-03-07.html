Mr Chairman, Sir, ElderShield is an insurance scheme introduced
in 2002 to provide financial help to those who are unable to take
care of themselves because of severe disabilities. Since the last
revision in 2007, the basic ElderShield payout stands at $400 per
month for 72 months. With medical inflation and the high cost of
nursing care, this quantum is insufficient to cover the basic medical needs of most low-
and middle-income families. Will the Ministry consider revising
this amount in view of the escalating medical cost? Can the Ministry
also give an update on the take-up rate for this scheme?</p>

                  </span>: Mr
Chairman, Sir, in our many helping hands approach supported by the
3Ms of healthcare financing and our family as the cornerstone of elderly
care, the presence of MediShield has been a source of much comfort
and support for Singaporeans. In the area of caring for our elderly
sick, the financial strains can be debilitating. The strains almost
nearly cut across all social classes particularly more acute for
the low income and sandwich class. A person with stroke and in a
comatose condition lying in an intensive care ward for 30 days can
easily chalk up $30,000 on hospitalisation cost alone. Thus, even
with the 3Ms and subsidised assistance, the financial strains can
be crippling. Although I applaud the extension of the MediShield coverage
to 90 years in this year's Budget, I believe we can do more.</p>

a person's life are the period when they utilise the most healthcare.
A person living long beyond the age of 80 would probably have stopped working
for at least 15 years. Thus, it may be the case that they would
have used up most of their savings accumulated in their working
life. Their children may also have progressed to become senior citizens
themselves. Hence, the burden of caring for them may cascade down
to their grandchildren.</p>

behind many countries. We have about 65% women working here versus

no CPF is estimated to be easily about 30%. Correspondingly, a majority
of the 170,000 women aged 65 and above will have no MediShield coverage.
Sir, I would like to ask MOH if our current MediShield coverage

Member)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman, MediShield is a Government-administered
insurance scheme. It is meant to help cover the cost of major hospital
bills. Unfortunately, some of those who need MediShield coverage
the most, like babies
with congenital problems and the very old, are often denied coverage.
MediShield currently covers 92% of Singaporeans. Those who are not covered
include some of the elderly, homemakers and others who have voluntarily opted
out of MediShield. Some are not able to obtain MediShield coverage
due to pre-existing conditions. I would like to ask what the Ministry
is doing to help achieve a higher level of MediShield coverage for
all Singaporeans. What is the Ministry's targeted level of MediShield
coverage? </p>

congenital conditions are either denied MediShield coverage completely
or have their conditions excluded from coverage. This does nothing
to relieve the financial hardship that parents of these children
may face. In order to ensure that these children are adequately
covered under the MediShield, will the Ministry consider providing
pregnant women an option to buy a MediShield rider to cover for
any congenital problems or prematurity-related complications? This
should naturally be done before any problems are diagnosed. It would
be a one-off payment for the rider and it could actuarially be adjusted
upwards for older women as they are at a higher risk of having babies
with congenital problems or prematurity-related complications. This
will provide the insurance coverage if the baby is later diagnosed with
a problem, yet it would ensure a large enough risk pool to cover
the potential payouts. Overall, this change should not require any
increases in premiums.</p>

Budget debate speech, will the Ministry consider doing away with
the age cap of 90 years old for MediShield altogether? There are
currently only about 11,000 Singaporeans aged above 90. We should
be doing all we can to help this small group of seniors who have
made it this far, instead of denying them the insurance coverage
when they need it the most. Beyond age 90, many of them may have
outlived their own children or siblings and have no direct relatives
to support them.</p>

to MediShield coverage may require premium increases. However, based
on the Minister's reply to my Parliamentary Question (PQ), between 2006
and 2010 MediShield collected an average of $131 million more in
premiums each year than it paid out in claims. While I appreciate
the need to set aside a portion of the premiums as reserves, can
the Ministry relook at whether the premiums collected can be used
to cover at least part of the increased coverage, instead of passing
the additional cost entirely to policyholders? Currently MediShield
premiums vary widely according to the members' age from $30 a year
for those aged below 30, to $1,123 for those in their 80s. This
imposes a heavier burden on older members, many of whom may be retired or
have exhausted their Medisave. If premiums can be increased to cover
the additional claims, can they be increased for working adults,
instead of the elderly?</p>

Mr Chairman, our 3M scheme is a good one. Medisave has since its
inception been expanded to cover beyond hospitalisation expenses.
These include its use in Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP),
payment for certain chemotherapy and radiotherapy, dialysis, and so
on. MediShield, on the other hand, is a medical insurance scheme.</p>

to consider increasing the Medisave from $400 to $500 per annum
for the CDMP in view that (i) Singaporeans are having more chronic
illnesses these days, especially with the rapidly ageing population;
(ii) the push towards more ambulatory and outpatient care, which
would mean patients may have to make more out-of-pocket payments; (iii) the use
of new generation and non standard drugs for treatment may end up
with a slightly higher cost for patients; and (iv) the increasing healthcare
cost from market forces. There has been much feedback on the payment
of the administrative fees for CDMP. Can this be waived, absorbed
or reviewed?</p>

have the following suggestions: first, can the upper age limit be extended
considering that Singaporeans are living longer? On the average,
for every eight-hour shift I do at the Emergency Department, there
would be at least two patients who are aged 90 years or more. Can
we also expand the repertoire of riders and companies available
for choice, and, finally, similar to my call at last year's Committee of
Supply (COS), can we extend MediShield for use in congenital diseases,
as well as related familial screening, in a regulated way. Those
affected need regular follow up with multiple procedures and aggressive
interventions. For those with congenital problems that end up living
into adulthood, multiple complications will surface again requiring
intervention. Also, can we do more roadshows to encourage women
to come forward and sign up for MediShield?</p>

Mr Chairman, I would like to request that the Ministry considers
providing free MediShield coverage to the lowest 20th percentile of
Singapore citizens whose per capita income is about $750 and below,

A serious illness can wipe out one's Medisave and cash savings.
Yet many poor families do not have any catastrophic medical insurance
as they are struggling to meet more urgent daily expenses. Homemakers,
children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable as they do
not have incomes. Housewives sacrifice their earning opportunities
to care for their children and the elderly at home. Yet, day in
day out, they are doing work which, if monetised, is worth thousands
of dollars a year. In many single-income families, housewives tend
to scrimp and save and overlook their own medical insurance. Senior
citizens in the lowest income groups have to face many issues. If
they are working, their pay may have already been cut as their job
responsibilities are reduced. If they are already retired, they
worry about making their savings stretch. Either way, insurance
premiums would be higher and less affordable to them. Currently,
the annual premiums for MediShield start from $33. I hope the Ministry
would consider assisting them by helping to pay for their coverage. </p>

Mr Chairman, Sir, many, if not all, in this House understand the
principle behind imposing a minimum sum criteria for Medisave is
to ensure that we set aside enough savings to meet our future healthcare
expenses. Imposing an annual cap on the amount that we can withdraw
from Medisave is in line with this principle as well. It has also
been emphasised to us that we ought to rely on our Medisave, then
MediShield and, when all else fails, do we then rely on Medifund. However,
seniors who have retired therefore no longer have the income to
co-pay for their health expenses and those who are without family
members are unable to tap on another person's Medisave Account and
can only rely on their Medisave for their healthcare expenditure.
However, some of these elderly persons have apparently been compelled
to tap on Medifund while they still have sufficient monies in their
Medisave.</p>

at my Meet-The-People Session (MPS) and he has been asking to use
his Medisave for his medical expenses. He is in his 70s, has a heart
condition and regularly needs medical attention. He believes he
has sufficient savings in his Medisave for his medical bills. He
strongly believes that he should be self-reliant and cannot understand
why his request has been repeatedly rejected. Understandably, his
is a rare case. But his request stems from his belief in personal responsibility
which is a worthwhile value to support. Hence, would the Ministry consider
allowing seniors to have more autonomy such as allowing them to
exhaust their Medisave before offering Medifund to them?</p>

Mr Chairman, I declare my interest as a paediatrician working in
a restructured hospital. The issue of MediShield for children with
congenital diseases has been brought up in this House in previous
Parliaments as well as in this debate. I would just like to add
my voice to the chorus. Sir, the problems faced by these children
and their families are significant. But many of the diseases can be
treated such that these children can lead long, healthy and normal
lives.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-51d824b8-94fc-448c-a690-2437fad623e5">
                  <a name="budget__id-51d824b8-94fc-448c-a690-2437fad623e5"><!--a--></a>The current regulatory
framework lumps together all congenital diseases, when in truth
there are a significant number of conditions that can be treated
in a straightforward manner with a reasonable prediction of cure
and a normal life, and a relatively short hospital stay. If part
of the current policy position for excluding these children is that these
children are expected to not survive, then the policy has not kept
up with advances in medical science.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9f5b81ec-d45b-4b47-8c96-ea23b1d0726d">
                  <a name="budget__id-9f5b81ec-d45b-4b47-8c96-ea23b1d0726d"><!--a--></a>Let me offer some examples.
A ventricular septal defect, a hole-in-the-heart, has about a 95%
chance of complete cure and an expectation of a long and healthy
life. In contrast, a child born with a hypoplastic left heart has
the odds stacked against him. The current policy pushes these two
together. Let me move to an alternative example. An adult, however,
who suffers a significant heart attack has about a 80% chance of survival.
In contrast, another adult who has a ruptured aortic aneurysm has
less than 30% chance of getting out of hospital alive. Both of those
conditions are currently claimable under MediShield. So, the policy
pushes those two conditions together.</p>

brought up in the House previously, and from previous replies, the
main concern is one of risk-pooling and the effect on premiums.
This is true if one treats all congenital diseases as being equal,
and I would suggest that the assumptions underlying that position
are based on out-dated science and medical knowledge.</p>

that a couple be allowed to apply for MediShield for their unborn
child. And as part of that application, there should be a requirement
for high quality antenatal screening, which can detect most of these
conditions in time for appropriate preparation and counselling,
with the final decision about being allowed to have MediShield being
made after the child has been born. These criteria need not be subjective
and can be independently verified.</p>

Management Programme is an excellent initiative to improve affordability
for patients with chronic diseases requiring long-term outpatient follow-up.
It covers many conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke
and the like. This has recently been expanded to include dementia
and bipolar disorder, and is yet another clear and welcome sign
of intent by the Ministry that it will address mental health in
the community. </p>

to consider liberalising the use of Medisave for outpatient use in
certain other circumstances, notably paediatric, cardiological and
cancer specialist care. The reason is that these medical services
are typically provided by specialists in hospital-based specialist
clinics and they require frequent and sometimes costly investigations,
and often involve medications and treatments that are long term
and may be expensive. Patients and their families who are already
struggling with out-of-pocket medical expenses can be tempted to
skimp on certain outpatient treatments to cut down on costs. By
further liberalising usage of Medisave in such situations, we can encourage
better patient compliance with respect to management of these diseases, thereby
improving outcomes and reducing chronicity and disability. Alternatively,
I hope that MOH can explore health insurance schemes for outpatient
care, perhaps as a variation of the managed care systems that are
available in the private medical sector. </p>

raising an additional point that has been frequently brought up by
members of the public, my patients, residents and also, very recently,
by Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef. As noted, patients with chronic diseases
are required to pay a processing fee to settle each outpatient treatment
at the public hospitals when using their Medisave Accounts. Many
patients have given feedback that they are unhappy with this surcharge.
While they can understand that there is an administrative cost involved, they
also feel deep down that they are essentially being charged to use
their own savings. The point is this: if these patients were more
comfortable financially in the first instance, they would have preferred
not to dip into their Medisave in the first place. Hence, I would
like to respectfully request that MOH, perhaps, discuss this with
its partners, the CPF Board and the National Computer Systems, to
see whether there are ways that they can maybe reduce or even waive
this processing fee, considering that in today's society, a lot
of payments are made electronically as well, and I suppose this
can be done fairly cost-efficiently.</p>

to expect one to have multiple illnesses. I have met a few elderly constituents
and their children who shared with me that they have to go to the
different hospitals and specialist clinics in the management of
their different illnesses. In doing so, they have to pay the different
charges and spend more time travelling as they go for their appointments
at these hospitals and clinics. A few have shared with me that at times,
they receive repeated referrals in between the polyclinics and hospitals,
making them confused
and having to pay more. All these create a lot of inconvenience
to the patients and their family members. The families feel that
they end up paying more in the management of their illnesses. In
addition, the children of these elders shared with me that they
usually need to take many days of leave to accompany their parents
to the different appointments at the different hospitals and clinics.
They hope that the Health Ministry will be able to bring a few of
these services closer to their homes, where they are able to manage
their illnesses better. This will result in convenience and possibly more
affordable healthcare.</p>

Mr Chairman, with our ageing population and increasing incidence
of chronic diseases, GPs are well positioned in our healthcare system
to provide accessible, holistic and continuing care. The GPs' overall
share of primary care patients is 81% compared to their share of
chronic disease follow-ups which is only 55%. The GPs may be under-utilised
in this aspect as patients attend polyclinics, emergency departments
in hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics. These institutions
thus tend to get overloaded. There is a need to strengthen and enhance
the public's perception of GPs and primary care. </p>

(1) MOH's call for every family to have one family physician or
a GP; (2) setting up of community health centres (CHCs) in a common
vicinity, tagged with support services such as radiology, laboratory
and allied health services. There could even be visiting consultants
from tertiary institutions who can do this but they, of course,
need to be given dedicated time so that they can work with the CHCs'
personnel; (3) enhancing GPs' qualifications, knowledge and training,
with postgraduate degree and diploma as well as working closely
with the College of General Practitioners; and (4) frequent interactions
between GPs and specialists in tertiary care and even perhaps using
video-conferencing to manage some of the more complex and difficult
cases. This can certainly help to cut down the number of referrals
to the emergency departments and tertiary hospitals to a minimum
and keep it to real emergent problems, thus offloading the tertiary
system and improving waiting times.</p>

Mr Chairman, the World Health Organization defines "palliative care"
as "an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and
their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening
illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means
of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment
of pain and other problems, physical, psychological and spiritual".</p>

very few Singaporeans know what palliative care is, what hospice
does and how its services can be enhanced to cope with the silver

maintain it, improve it through nursing, psychological support and
supporting the family members on this journey.</p>

prepare for an ageing population by putting in place the support
framework and services for senior to live in our community. Besides
national schemes, the Government is also fostering services from
the ground-up. The community has also initiated projects aimed at
enabling a better understanding of the needs of all elderly and
developing new services to meet these needs. Notwithstanding these
moves, the Government will do well to harness the private and people's
sectors to help. In this way, we can broaden the search for new
ideas and enlist entrepreneurs to speed up the process of discovering
seniors' needs and coming up with ways to meet them.</p>

silver enterprises that can provide new services to the elderly?
The need for some of such services may not be that obvious today.

also introduced the Special Employment Credit (SEC) for companies
which employ workers who are older than 50 years old. I think this
will help older workers to secure and hold on to jobs. Nevertheless,
not all seniors want to work as employees in firms. Some may decide
to become entrepreneurs to try to do something in their silver years.
I know of some seniors who have already embarked on such an entrepreneurship
journey. For instance, I know of a Miss Helen Lim who started Silver
Spring. She is a passionate lady who wished to remain active and
contribute meaningfully to the economy and the society. Just like
we have the SEC, might we consider setting up a framework to support
seniors who want to be self-employed or who still have aspirations
to fulfil? This might suit a minority of seniors but can be a useful
complement to SEC.</p>

into this area of silver entrepreneurship. For example, there is
an organisation in the United Kingdom called the Prince's Initiative
for Mature Enterprise (PRIME), founded by Prince Charles, which
helps people over the age of 50 set up business for themselves.
PRIME offers free information, workshops and business networking
events. It can also refer people to accredited advisers for free
business advice and, in some parts of the country, can also offer
free mentoring and advisory services. Would the Ministry therefore
explore similar initiatives to encourage silver entrepreneurship
in Singapore, to help our seniors also achieve their aspirations
despite being in their silver years? </p>

Sir, the importance of delivering integrated care to our seniors

integrated care are, of course, to make the care elder-centric,
that is, to meet their needs for multiple types of care, in view
of the chronic nature of many of their conditions, with as little
fragmentation and duplication as possible. With this in view, could
the Government actively investigate ways to integrate, coordinate or link
the relevant functions or administration of AIC under MOH, which coordinates
the delivery of healthcare to our seniors, and CEL under MCYS, which coordinates
the delivery of social care support services?</p>

Sir, I would like to thank Members for their thoughts and their
feedback on our healthcare policies. Yesterday, I spoke about the
challenges facing us, and our efforts to expand healthcare infrastructure
and the healthcare workforce to support the expansion of services
under our Healthcare 2020 plan. I will now talk about how we will
provide Singaporeans with quality and affordable care.</p>

invested heavily in building up our acute hospitals. They have attained
high standards of care, with some achieving peaks of excellence
and earning themselves a global reputation. At the individual level,
our healthcare professionals have also attained high levels of proficiency.
But there is room for improvement, especially in building up the
intermediate and long-term care sector and outpatient sector as
well as providing more integrated, patient-centric care. Sir, first,
let me share our efforts to facilitate holistic management of patients
to improve the care outcomes for them. </p>

to raise quality of care is to better integrate across different settings
by re-organising the healthcare system into a more hassle-free,
integrated and patient-centric Regional Health Systems. Each regional
system would have an acute general hospital working in close partnership
with community hospitals, nursing homes, home care and day rehab
providers as well as polyclinics and general practitioners (GPs)
within the geographical region to provide seamless and holistic
care to patients. </p>

be better cared for and supported across different stages of their
healthcare journey from diagnosis and treatment to post-discharge
follow-ups. It will also help patients navigate across providers
more easily, enabling and empowering them to manage their own needs
more effectively. This is a point made by Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal
yesterday. The Eastern Health Alliance, for example, launched in November
last year, was the first such multi-party collaboration.</p>

need to be supported by enablers, such as the Agency for Integrated
Care (AIC) which helps patients navigate the system and refers them
to the most appropriate care provider. They also need strong case
management capabilities, to ensure that patients follow up after
their discharge as well as National Electronic Health Records to
facilitate information flow. </p>

for a progress update on the National Electronic Health Records
(NEHR). We are on track to rolling it out to all the public health
institutions and six community hospitals by June this year as well
as the two nursing homes, selected GPs and users of the AIC. Mr
Low also raised concerns about patient confidentiality. Patient
confidentiality is important and it is protected in two ways. First,
we have built the security framework in accordance with international
standards to protect sensitive data.
Secondly, an audit system is put in place for us to identify unauthorised
entry. And as a deterrent, stiff penalties are in place for those
who violate IT security. We will continue to enhance our IT security
in a practical way, striking a balance between regulation and operational
flexibility. </p>

and the prevalence of chronic diseases increases, we can do more
to support our GPs and tap on them to better care for residents
in their community in a more cost-effective way. Assoc Prof Fatimah
Lateef and Mr Heng Chee How asked how the new models of care that
we have shared would increase accessibility. The new models of care
involve four key features. First, encourage GPs to set up Family
Medicine Clinics (FMCs) to provide team-based care for patients.
Second, set up Community Health Centres (CHCs) to support GPs and
provide allied health services for their patients. Thirdly, develop
Medical Centres (MCs) to provide community-based services for patients
who require day surgery and less complex specialist services. And,
fourth, provide portable subsidy to patients under the Community
Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) so that they can enjoy subsidised services
at private GPs and FMCs.</p>

of care, more patients can be cared for outside of the hospitals'
specialist outpatient clinics by GPs in the community. At the same
time, through team-based care, we can help patients slow down their
disease progression, reduce complication rates and, in turn, minimise
referrals to hospitals. We also hope to grow the capabilities to
manage mental health conditions within the community and primary
care, which Minister of State Dr Amy Khor will be speaking on later. </p>

interested parties to set up the first FMCs and CHCs. We plan to
pilot four FMCs this year to test out the model, with more in coming
years if it proves effective in managing patients with chronic diseases
in the community. We are also engaging potential providers to set
up three CHCs this year. Our hospitals are now studying the setting
up of new MCs. These are more complex set-ups and it will take a bit
longer. I will update on our plans when the details are firmed up. </p>

asked how the Ministry was going to upgrade the skills, knowledge
and attitudes of our GPs. Sir, we recently improved the training
of Family Physicians under the Family Medicine residency programme.
We also have other training pathways for GPs to upgrade themselves.
To recognise doctors who have the necessary skills needed for family
medicine, the Register of Family Physicians was set up in 2011,
and made publicly available earlier this year. After eight months,
we have 509, or 25% of GPs accredited. We aim to double this by
the end of next year. </p>

home palliative providers, serving 3,800 patients each year. We

professionals to come together to engage in discussions on care
and treatment preferences. We are scaling up existing ACP programmes

framework focused more on inpatient care. As an ageing population
requires more frequent care in the outpatient, intermediate and
long-term care settings, our financing framework must also evolve
to help Singaporeans meet the new realities. We have thus increased
the subsidies for chronic outpatient treatment at GPs and for intermediate
and long-term care services to benefit not just low-income families
but also the middle income by raising the income criteria. Let me
elaborate. </p>

significant changes to the Primary Care Partnership Scheme – now
you know why I need to change the name – it is now known as the Community
Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), which enables patients to receive subsidised care
at GP and dental clinics. In January, the per capita household income
criteria was raised from $800 to $1,500, and the minimum age lowered
from 65 to 40. Middle income households can now benefit from this
scheme. These enhancements to CHAS have been well received. We have
doubled the number of Singaporeans on this scheme, from 38,000 two
months ago to 77,000 now. I expect applications for the scheme to
grow further as we step up our outreach efforts. Mdm Foo Mee Har
suggested simplifying the application process. We will keep the
process simple and extend the access points for applications to
include polyclinics and GPs who are now in the scheme. We will explore what
more we can practically do to further simplify the process. Together
with the higher Medisave withdrawal limit for chronic disease treatment
of $400, we have reduced patients' cash outlay when they see GPs
for their chronic illnesses.</p>

asked how we can attract more clinics into CHAS. Sir, we now have
460 CHAS GP clinics compared to 420 in December. This is about one-third
of all GP clinics here. We are targeting to reach out to about 1,000,
or 70% of all clinics. We are exploring IT solutions to ease the
administrative load on clinics to make it easier for them to join
in the scheme. </p>

also highlighted the transaction costs incurred by patients when
they make Medisave claims. I think Dr Chia Shi-Lu also mentioned
that. This fee is imposed to recover CPF Board's operational cost
of administering the scheme. We are very mindful and we will ensure
that it does not affect patients' affordability. We recognise that
outpatient care is not the only source of concern for Singaporeans.
Many are worried about the cost of intermediate and long-term care,
especially for those from middle income families who receive little
to no subsidies. As their parents age and need more care and support,
they too shoulder a heavy emotional and financial burden. </p>

care and day rehabilitation centres. The Government will help patients
afford these services. </p>

$8,800 total household income will still be eligible for this scheme.
Details have been announced earlier. And with the changes, up to
two-thirds of the households in Singapore will qualify for the subsidies,
benefiting not only the lower income but also many middle-income
families. As for the community hospitals, all patients regardless
of income will be eligible for subsidies of at least 20%, higher
for lower-income families. </p>

we are also simplifying the means-test criteria in the ILTC sector

are expanded, we also need to help Singaporeans better afford their
share of the costs. Dr Lam Pin Min and Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that ElderShield
payouts be revised to help Singaporeans with the increasing cost
of long-term care. There has been increasing support from Singaporeans
for ElderShield, with the opt-out rate at 8% for the cohort who
turned 40 in 2011. With higher subsidies, a significant portion
of a VWO nursing home bill can now be covered by the basic ElderShield
payout of $400. But this may not be sufficient for the elderly in
future. We will have to revise ElderShield payouts in line with
the increasing costs. But I am sure Dr Lam and Ms Lim are mindful
that better ElderShield benefits will necessitate higher premiums,
so it requires careful study. We plan to review ElderShield next
year to ensure that it remains relevant.</p>

sandwiched class, who are supporting both children and elderly parents.</p>

subsidies in the ILTC sector for Singaporeans, we will widen the
differential between the subsidy levels for citizens and PRs. Permanent
Residents will receive a lower subsidy rate than Singapore citizens
in the same income tier. The same
principle will apply to subsidies at the restructured hospitals.
However, we will be mindful of the impact on the affordability of
low-income Permanent Residents, many of whom are close family members
of Singapore citizens. My Ministry will release more details shortly.</p>

remain concerned about the cost of drugs, especially those required
for chronic conditions, as their cumulative costs can be high over
time. Ms Sylvia Lim asked about drug subsidies. The Government provides
drug subsidies to improve the affordability of commonly used medications.
The list of subsidised medications, known as the Standard Drug List
(SDL), contains drugs that have been assessed to be cost-effective
and essential. Most SDL drugs are capped at a price of $1.40 per
week for subsidised patients in the public sector, while the rest
are subsidised at 50% of the retail price.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-77827909-ecb4-416d-9da4-c2c47b261034">

subsidy for some SDL drugs used in the treatment of chronic conditions
to 75%, for patients with per capita household income of $1,500
or less, halving the cost for them. The previous subsidy was 50%.
Now we have raised it to 75%. In addition, the Medication Assistance
Fund (MAF) assists Singaporeans who need selective but expensive
drugs that are not on the SDL with up to 75% subsidy, also up from
50% previously. MAF has also been expanded to include other non-standard
drugs that are not in the list, if they are assessed to be clinically
necessary and appropriate for the patients.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4a196e31-e829-4c0b-884b-3b5f0ca9e6be">

help to keep drugs affordable for subsidised patients, often significantly
below their cost. We also constantly review the SDL to include more
drugs to help patients. In fact, we will be adding about 20 new
drugs into the SDL and MAF this year. This will include drugs such
as Olanzapine and Quetiapine for the treatment of bipolar disorders,
as well as the antibiotic co-amoxiclav, better known as Augmentin.</p>

about the pricing policy of drugs. Currently, our clusters purchase
drugs through a centralised Group Procurement Office (GPO) where
possible. However, some drugs are better purchased at the individual
cluster or hospital-level for various reasons. For example, where
quantities are small, or if the drugs are specific to that institution,
it is better for them to purchase the drugs directly. Price differences could
still arise, even for drugs purchased via the GPO. For example,
same drugs purchased in different batches may have different prices
because different tenders carry different pricing. So, some hospitals
may be using drugs from an earlier batch or a later batch so their
base price will be different, their costs will be different. Also,
institutions have different cost structures and therefore we have
to take into account giving institutions some flexibility so that
they can take into account their different clinical setups and cost
structures, but they are all subject to general subsidy guidelines.
Some drugs are sold at a higher margin in order to cross-subsidise
other drugs which may be very expensive and therefore need a much
higher discount to keep them affordable. In this way, we ensure
that, overall, drugs are affordable for patients.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-0deccccb-0190-48b9-9d0d-e5dbc58c7725"><!--a--></a>I would like to stress
that contrary to what Ms Lim has said, our healthcare institutions are
not-for-profit organisations. Whatever revenue that is generated
from operations, be it from the pharmacy or be it from drugs, or
charges from consultations, is taken in as overall revenue to the
institution and used to partially defray the costs of operations, including
overheads. These revenues are, however, insufficient to fully cover
their costs. In
FY2010, the public healthcare institutions incurred operating deficits
of over $2 billion, before subvention from the Government. And I
would just like to inform Ms Lim, who mentioned a number of drugs
yesterday, that I took the opportunity to clarify with our hospital
last night and Changi General Hospital told me that their price
for Epoetin-beta 4000 IU had been reduced in June 2011. So, Ms Lim
may be referring to earlier prices and the earlier more expensive
prices were because the hospital was purchasing the drugs on their
own as the quantities were small and now they have joined the GPO scheme
and, therefore, the prices have come down. </p>

patients could fill their prescriptions at subsidised prices outside
of the public institutions. Today, subsidised patients can obtain
their medication at subsidised prices from the public institutions
where they are being treated. A stable subsidised patient who just
needs to fill his prescription without visiting the specialist may
take advantage of the home delivery service introduced by our institutions.
My Ministry will be reviewing alternative, more convenient options
for our subsidised patients to fill their prescriptions of commonly
available drugs easier, nearer their homes.</p>

As an insurance scheme, MediShield works on the basis of risk-pooling
and helps patients pay for their hospital bills, providing peace
of mind for many Singaporeans. Several Members have called for better
coverage and benefits for MediShield. We agree and, indeed, we are
reviewing the scheme. But additional coverage and benefits will
need to be supported by higher premiums paid by policyholders. Hence,
we need to weigh the costs and benefits very carefully.</p>

for congenital and neonatal conditions mentioned by many Members.
Today, conditions, such as hole in the heart and cleft palate, and
medical treatment for newborns, such as jaundice or infection, are
not covered under MediShield in order to keep the present premiums
low. But parents have given feedback that this is an area of worry
for them and Members have also surfaced the issue. </p>

and neonatal conditions under MediShield, we would be able to reduce
parents' financial burden and give them greater peace of mind. But
doing so will also impact the MediShield premiums they would have
to pay for their children at the younger ages. We hope to avoid
the situation where some parents who expect their children to be
well, to be healthy, choose to opt out of the scheme and apply for insurance
coverage for them only later to avoid the higher charges during
the earlier ages. This could undermine the scheme over time. I also
note Dr Janil's suggestion to extend MediShield coverage only to
some congenital conditions, but not all, which we will study further
with medical experts and actuaries.</p>

there is strong public support for MediShield to cover inpatient psychiatric
treatment. Such an extension will be in line with our efforts to

to help the small number of Singaporeans who exceed these limits

will have to update our premiums in line with the claims experiences
to keep the scheme solvent. As MediShield premiums are set to be
sustainable for a five-year period and the last increase was in
2008, we are due for the next update soon. The premiums need to
be adequate to sustain MediShield members' claims and to fund future
liabilities under the scheme. On the whole, MediShield has paid
out 21% more in claims each year between 2008 and 2011, which benefits policyholders,
while the premiums collected grew by only 10% per annum.</p>

estimates, to keep MediShield sustainable and support the extension
in benefits, a 45-year-old may see a premium increase of $7 per
month, with the younger age groups seeing a smaller increase. On
the other hand, an older policyholder at 75 could see an increase
of $20 per month because of the higher risk profile. To offset these
increases, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has announced a one-time
Medisave top-up of up to $400, or $33 per month, for all Singaporean
policyholders, to help cushion the impact of the premium adjustment.
We are still doing consultation and we are still finalising the
premium numbers, so these numbers are just estimates at the moment.</p>

policyholders who are beyond the re-employment age of 65 will receive
direct and long-term assistance via Medisave top-ups under the GST Voucher
scheme, of up to $450 a year or $37.50 per month which can offset
the premium increases in full. Those aged 50 to 60 will also see
a higher contribution to their Medisave accounts due to the higher
CPF contribution rates which we have just announced.</p>

some of the MediShield reserves can help to offset these premium
increases. Sir, these reserves are crucial in ensuring the long-term sustainability
and viability of the MediShield Fund. Their main purpose is to provide
an adequate capital buffer in accordance with MAS guidelines, and
to fund other liabilities, such as future treatment costs and premium
rebates for policyholders when they age. I will talk about the premium
rebates shortly. Ultimately, MediShield operates on a not-for-profit
basis, with premiums actuarially are calculated to cover expected
payouts and meet the MAS risk and reserve requirements. The reserves
ensure that MediShield will be able to honour policyholders' future
claims. We have instead addressed potential affordability concerns
through targeted Medisave top-ups.</p>

about doing so, as there is really limited risk-pooling at ages
far beyond the life expectancy, which currently stands at 82. Although
Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef mentioned that she had met quite a number
of elderly above 90 in her clinics, the total number in Singapore
remains rather small. With the small number of people with a higher
risk profile, the premiums can be very expensive and they may become unaffordable for some
and they will drop out of the scheme. Nonetheless, we will study how
we can help those above 90 in other ways.</p>

MediShield premiums can be increased for working adults to offset
the increases for the elderly. I hope I understand what he meant.
I presume that he is talking about this: as a person when you are
younger, you accumulate more, you pay more and when you get older
you pay less. In fact, MediShield was designed to have an element
of this, where policyholders "pre-pay" a bit more when they are
young, and this amount is then held within the MediShield Fund to
support premium rebates in their old-age. This is the premium rebate
that I talked about earlier. This forms part of the reserves. By
paying more today, younger policyholders will pay less in premiums
when they are no longer working, when they are older.</p>

that we ask the younger generation to support the older generation,
I think that could be problematic. Increasing premiums for the younger generation
to cross-subsidise claims by the elderly, if this is what Mr Giam
is suggesting, may not be viable in the long term. With an ageing
population, each young policyholder will face increasingly higher
premiums in order to support the growing number of elderly policyholders.
This may not be acceptable to the younger generation and the younger
people may choose to opt out, affecting not only the older generation
but also their own insurance. With the GST Voucher for Medisave
and the one-off top up just announced in this Budget, the Government
is stepping in in a big way to help older Singaporeans afford healthcare
costs, without adversely affecting the younger ones.</p>

low income, which is another vulnerable group in our population.
Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested that we extend free MediShield coverage
to them. I am not sure that is the best approach. Low-wage workers,
who qualify for the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (WIS), can
get an average of $1,000 in payouts, which is paid partly in cash
and partly into their CPF accounts, including Medisave. The total
of the WIS payout into Medisave and the worker's own Medisave contribution
from his salary, is more than sufficient to pay for the MediShield
premiums for himself, his non-working spouse and two children. For
a 51-year old earning $1,500 per month, he would have a total Medisave
contribution of $1,700 per year, compared to the total premiums
of $516 for his whole family. This approach encourages self-sufficiency
while supporting their basic healthcare needs, including premium
payments for MediShield. </p>

in the low-income group, those who really cannot afford, or those
who are on public assistance, we will look for other means to help
them including Medifund. With the various support measures through
Medisave, we have achieved 92% MediShield coverage of the population,
surpassing the target of 90% that we set in 2008. We will continue
to reach out to as many Singaporeans as possible. However, there
will always be some who opt out of MediShield because of various
reasons and some of which are valid reasons, sensible reasons. For
example, some of them may have other benefits, other medical benefits
provided by their employers, therefore they see no need to continue to be in MediShield.
Some of them may have applied and purchased their own medical insurance
as well.</p>

the Government to liberalise the use of Medisave, especially for more
outpatient treatments, while Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked to
raise the Medisave $400 limit to $500. Both Medisave and MediShield
are primarily designed to assist with larger healthcare bills, for
inpatient care and selected expensive outpatient treatments such
as chemotherapy. We recently raised the annual Medisave withdrawal limit
for chronic diseases to $400. We must be mindful not to deplete
Singaporeans' Medisave balances prematurely and affect their ability
to meet their post-retirement needs.</p>

the elderly to maintain sufficient balance in their Medisave to pay
for their MediShield premiums, and stay insured for as long as possible.
Hence, while we understand Ms Tin Pei Ling's concern that some elderly
prefer to use their own Medisave monies first before asking for
financial assistance, we must maintain safeguards on Medisave usage
to prevent exhausting the Medisave. I would prefer to see how we
can help them directly through Medifund or other ways. But on a
case-by-case basis, if there are specific cases, like the one that
Ms Tin has come across, I would invite her to write to me. I will
take a look, on a case-by-case basis.</p>

up more Medisave balances, we can study how Medisave can be gradually
extended to cover other healthcare expenses. For those who still
face difficulties with their healthcare bills despite Medisave,
MediShield and subsidies, Medifund will be available for them. Deputy
Prime Minister Tharman announced a $600 million top-up to Medifund
which will increase the total annual quantum of grants available
from $80 million to about $100 million. This will allow us to help
more needy Singaporeans, including the middle income, with larger
bills.</p>

cocktail of immune-suppressants to avoid rejection of the donated
bone marrow. Insurance and Medisave covered $100,000 for the inpatient
bills, and the patient received $13,000 in Medifund assistance to
help with the remaining bill. This is despite the husband earning
above the median income. We do so because of the large expenses
she encounters. To date, the patient has received further Medifund

in healthcare costs is improvements in medical care – technology,
new and improved drugs, better treatments, breakthroughs in surgical techniques
– that improve quality of life and extend life. This is good for
patients and their families. However, as a society, we cannot afford
to support and subsidise all new treatments "at all costs". New
does not necessarily mean better. We need to consider what appropriate
and cost-effective treatment is. </p>

do our best to bend the cost curve – to reduce inefficiencies and
discourage over-consumption. Let me share two key fundamental principles
that will serve us well. First, we must always strive to innovate,
increase productivity and develop new and more cost-effective models
of care. Wherever we can, do more with less. One of the ways we
achieve this is through technology. Take tele-ophthalmology, for
example, which allows ophthalmologists, located in the hospitals,
to "look into" the eyes and the retina of patients in the polyclinics.
The optometrists in the polyclinic prepare the images which are
transmitted to the hospital ophthalmologists for assessment. Those
with minor conditions such as dry eyes can receive the medication that
they need at the polyclinic, and only those with more serious conditions
will need to be referred to the eye specialist clinic for further
assessment. This brings care to the community level, and cuts down
unnecessary visits to specialists, saving costs for patients and
freeing up resources of the hospitals. </p>

and productivity in our healthcare system, we will set aside $20 million
for a fund called Healthcare Productivity in Acute Services Scheme
(Health-PASS). The hospitals can make use of this fund to pilot
and implement projects that improve productivity and efficiency.
A similar scheme will be introduced in the ILTC sector.</p>

principle to prevent unnecessary over-consumption of healthcare
services which will drive up costs. Through co-payment, the patient
shares part of the responsibility of spending his healthcare dollar smartly.
He is more likely to weigh the treatment options or choices of drugs
and choose a more cost-effective option. It will also ensure that
healthcare providers are more cautious in prescribing treatment
to ensure patients can afford the co-payment. We want to avoid the
pitfall of countries where healthcare is virtually free, resulting
in an insatiable demand from patients for healthcare services, runaway
healthcare spending and an increased fiscal burden that is eventually
borne by all taxpayers. </p>

dollars smartly. With the Government enhancing the healthcare system

an attractive combination of elder-friendly housing, professional
management, and care and community engagement services. This will allow
more seniors to live on their own. These seniors may not have children,
or if they have, these children may be living overseas, or they
simply may not want to depend on their children. Retirement villages
will offer them a safe and secure environment in which to spend
their golden years. A village can offer different wards to cater
to different budgets as well. There are already many such retirement
villages in both Europe and the US. I hope this is an option that
MCA and the Ministry will consider.</p>

inclusivity is encouraging and demanding respect, and we would do
well as a society to strenuously reject any moral panic of ageing

my second cut which is on enhancing the quality of eldercare. Mr
Chairman, while many measures have been announced to ramp up the
capacity of elder care, I request that the Ministry of Health and
the Ministerial Committee on Ageing (MCA) also provide us with an
update on how they are addressing the quality of elderly care services,
beyond just infrastructure and capacity improvements alone.</p>

to raise is that the quality of healthcare, as many have already pointed
out, is highly dependent on the quality of the healthcare workers.
The Ministry has announced that by 2020, it will be adding 6,600
nursing home beds and tripling the number of rehabilitative care
places from the current 2,100 to 6,200. Correspondingly, we will
have to increase the number of staff under home healthcare from
4,000 to about 8,000 and 10,000 and under home social care, from
2,000 to 7,500. I would also like to ask how MOH intends to achieve
the target recruitment numbers. What are the plans to attract, train,
motivate and retain these personnel? Will there be a cap on the
number of foreigners?</p>

to this House and the Ministry that based on the complexion of healthcare

difficult. </p>

the quality of services under these trying conditions and also prevent

is this: a critical facet of quality care is a genuine and steadfast
respect for the rights of the person being cared for. I hope that

Mr Chairman, Sir, mental illness is a condition that not only affects
the individual or the public but also the community. I believe that
mental illness will increasingly become an issue for Singapore in
our highly competitive environment. Because of the strong stigma
against mental illness, it may be difficult to observe the actual
prevalence of mental illness in Singapore. The Government should conduct
a study to get a better understanding. We need to look at how we
can manage mental illness in the community, for example, what support
is needed for the patient and their family and how to ensure that
those with mental illness will not become a problem and affect life
in the community, such as throwing things out of the windows, shouting at
neighbours and having unacceptable social behaviour.</p>

requires counselling, social intervention as well as medication.
As such, there is a need for an integrated and holistic approach between
the social service sector and the medical sector. However, at the
moment, MOH and MCYS which provide different services to patients
with mental illness operate separately. Can the services be centralised
so that we have a one-stop service to provide better integrated
care for the patients?</p>

certainly need to increase the number of our mental healthcare professionals.
Importing foreign doctors in this area is not a solution. They will
not be able to function well if they cannot speak the language or
understand our culture. I would like to know what MOH can do to increase
the number of our mental health professionals.</p>

Sir, the recent Singapore Mental Health Study revealed that more
than one in 10 people in Singapore will be stricken by mental illness
in their lifetime. The top three mental disorders have a grave impact
on families and caregivers – depression, obsessive compulsive disorder
(OCD), and alcohol related disorders. Most sufferers do not seek
help and, hence, their ailment goes undetected. </p>

Dr Ng Eng Hen revealed that suicide rates for residents aged between
10 and 24 increased from 5.8 youth suicides per 100,000 residents
in 2004, to 6.1 in 2005, and reached a high of 6.7 in 2007. In 2010,
the figure increased to 7.85. Elderly and the sick are another group
that is susceptible. The next step after the study should be a systematic
review of the problems that it unearthed, so that appropriate help may
be given to make a real improvement in the overall mental health
of Singaporeans. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I
would like to urge MOH to do more to support those with mental health
issues. The World Health Organization estimated that, globally,
one in four people develop some form of mental illness at some stage
in life. This is a significant statistical figure by any account.
However, despite the prevalent of mental illness around the world,
this category of illness continues to be plagued by stigma that prevents
social acceptance and discourages those who need help to step forth
and seek help.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d7d78dc8-1570-49cb-adde-9f4651d0a625">
                  <a name="budget__id-d7d78dc8-1570-49cb-adde-9f4651d0a625"><!--a--></a>Therefore, as I have mentioned
in the Budget Speech debate last week, I hope more can be done to
de-stigmatise mental illness, promote greater social acceptance, enhance
accessibility and affordability to professional mental healthcare
and to strengthen the community support framework. First, we should
combat stigma in order to promote greater social acceptance and
self-acceptance as well as encourage treatment. In fact, I hesitate
to use the label "mental illness" and would much prefer the use
of the phrase "mental health conditions" or "mental health issues".
But for the purpose of simplicity and familiarity, I would use the
former phrase for now.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a5df7073-5417-42d9-a32e-d052f3ffb40e">
                  <a name="budget__id-a5df7073-5417-42d9-a32e-d052f3ffb40e"><!--a--></a>Studies have shown how
information and understanding of various mental illnesses reduce
stigma. Studies have also shown how the media plays a critical role
in propagating and reinforcing negative stereotypes of mental illnesses.
Therefore, would the Ministry share what are the ongoing efforts
to address this issue of stigma and social acceptance? And would
the Ministry consider: (i) working with the mass media to provide
a more objective and balanced coverage of mental illnesses by avoiding
linking crimes of bad behaviours through mental illness, and instead
highlighting and celebrating inspiring models such as successful
individuals who have overcome their mental conditions as well as
showcasing great works by famous persons who have been known to
have mental illnesses, for example, Sylvia Plath, Van Gogh, Beethoven, Abraham
Lincoln and John Nash; (ii) organising a national campaign to promote
deeper understanding of a range of mental illnesses, from depression
to eating disorders to sleep disorders, to generalised anxiety disorders,
to personality disorders to OCDs to bipolar to psychosis, and re-image
mental illness as being no different than any other illnesses that
any person could have at any point in time.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6f866d89-9c8a-41f8-aeef-710b2fffa696">
                  <a name="budget__id-6f866d89-9c8a-41f8-aeef-710b2fffa696"><!--a--></a>Second, we should strengthen
community care and support framework. A recent study done by a group
of Ngee Ann Polytechnic students showed that when one suspects oneself
to have mental illness, one would most likely turn to friends, relatives, family
doctors or even the polyclinics for help and these are very much
part of the community setting. Therefore, I hope the Ministry will
consider making mental healthcare in the community more accessible,
establishing a more structured mechanism to enable referrals and

people with such vulnerabilities or exhibiting mental illness symptoms.</p>

certain anti-social behaviours, but they are not violent which is
typically the lever which the Police uses to intervene. However,
some of them fear
of making their conditions known. Others do not even have an insight
into their condition and, therefore, refuse treatment. Some of them
may not even have family members or even when they have family members,
they are unfortunately uncontactable. In such instances, would the
Ministry consider new levers or measures to help them help themselves?
Would the Ministry also share how mental healthcare will be decentralised
to increase accessibility to professional mental healthcare, and
how monitoring and follow-ups are done with patients with mental
illnesses who are discharged back into the community, and whether
there is a support system in place to help these patients adhere
to their care plans? </p>

manpower by tapping on the local talent pool because having sufficient
manpower is vital in supporting mental healthcare. On this point,
I am heartened that MOH is already looking into increasing the overall

share what is being undertaken to expand the intake of mental healthcare
professionals?</p>

as I was told, has over 200 students majoring in Psychology. Many
are interested in pursuing clinical psychology but had to give up because
of high entry barriers involving enormous time and financial investments
in pursuing a post-graduate qualification needed to practise mental
healthcare. Therefore, in addition to attracting overseas trained
Singaporeans back to Singapore to serve in the mental healthcare
landscape, would the Ministry also consider: (i) expanding the number
or capacity of accredited clinical programmes in Singapore; (ii)
providing more financial sponsorship for aspiring young Singaporeans;
(iii) ensuring better opportunities in career development for Allied
Mental Healthcare professional; and (iv) enhancing the affordability
of mental healthcare. </p>

the 3M framework in Singapore. However, mental health patients face
particular challenges. Many of them, because of their conditions
which are often chronic, are not employable or find it hard to stay
in their jobs. The majority of those with mental illness occur by
the age of 29 years old − this is according to a local study on
mental illness − implying a relatively short, full and active employment
period. Hence, their Medisave is limited. Is the coverage of MediShield
for such categories of illness? And Medifund would likely be their
only eventual helpline. However, patients from the middle income
group may not even qualify for Medifund. Hence, could MOH share
what kind of financial assistance could they look forward to considering
that for some of these patients with mental illness, especially
the more severe form of mental illness such as psychosis, eventually
when they aged, their caregivers would have passed on, or if not,
be so aged and elderly that they are not able to care adequately
for them? </p>

consider is the state of Illinois. The state made it mandatory for
insurers to include mental illness in the group insurances that
employers provide for employees. Would the Ministry consider something
similar to cover Singaporeans with mental illnesses but perhaps
with higher deductibles? I understand from the earlier speech by
the Minister that there is already such an expansion for inpatient
psychiatric treatment but more could be done in this area. </p>

of the mentally ill in a truly inclusive society. We should do what
we can to combat stigma and care for everyone. With timely and proper
interventions, mental illnesses can be managed effectively and we
can help those with mental conditions to become employable, take
care of themselves, rely on themselves and enjoy a better quality
of life. </p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">
                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, Dr
Chia Shi-Lu and several Members asked about the strategies to respond
to an ageing population. Let me share the Ministerial Committee on
Ageing's (MCA) strategies and put in context the various new initiatives
that have been announced recently. Our population will age rapidly
over the next 20 years. By 2030, the population of seniors above
65 years old will nearly triple to reach over 900,000. How many
is 900,000? It is enough to fill nine Toa Payoh towns today. By
then, one in five residents will be over 65 years old, compared
to fewer than one in 10 today.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c74a0916-8943-4113-9afa-07cd54c9f378">
                  <a name="budget__id-c74a0916-8943-4113-9afa-07cd54c9f378"><!--a--></a>Fortunately, the majority
of our seniors are expected to remain healthy and functional. However,
as rapid ageing sets in, the needs of aged care will increase in tandem.
By 2030, 117,000 seniors may be semi or non-ambulant, more than
double the number today. We must prepare for this rapid ageing well
ahead of time. A key focus of the MCA is ageing-in-place. Our survey
shows that our seniors prefer to age in place gracefully and with
dignity, within a closely knit community. We aim to achieve this
in two ways. First, to build an inclusive environment, and, second,
to provide good aged care. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-be510579-f576-4e5b-a64f-9227f1b004c8">
                  <a name="budget__id-be510579-f576-4e5b-a64f-9227f1b004c8"><!--a--></a>Let me start with Inclusive
Environment. We need to make our city "age-friendly" so that our
seniors can move around safely and confidently within their homes
and also within the community. The Minister for National Development
has earlier announced the Enhancement for Active Seniors programme
(EASE) to make our HDB flats safer for seniors. In Marine Parade,
we are also working with LTA and the town council under the City
For All Ages project to improve the environment within the town,
so that seniors can move round easily and safely.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bac8e495-f962-4321-a6d8-313ed8ccd1ac">
                  <a name="budget__id-bac8e495-f962-4321-a6d8-313ed8ccd1ac"><!--a--></a>In tandem, the MCA will
continue to promote active ageing so that seniors can keep their
minds active and their bodies healthy, and enjoy their golden years
to the fullest. We will promote not just health screening but also
follow-up post screening, to minimise the risk of downstream health
complications for seniors. We will also promote senior volunteerism
and lifelong learning.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2b8b0b2f-b16e-47c6-b007-71bd2adb4e07">
                  <a name="budget__id-2b8b0b2f-b16e-47c6-b007-71bd2adb4e07"><!--a--></a>We are already achieving
some success. The Wellness Programme, which started four years ago,
has spread to 42 constituencies touching some 150,000 residents
aged 50 years old and above. Two weekends ago, I attended Hougang
Wellness Family Day. The seniors had a great time and so did I.
Going forward, we want to implement the Wellness Programme work
countrywide to all constituencies and eventually reach out to one
out of two seniors above 50 years old. Senior Minister of State
Heng Chee How will elaborate on our active ageing initiatives during
MCYS's COS Debate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-49b65d28-bfee-4d32-a3f1-04020beeb85b">
                  <a name="budget__id-49b65d28-bfee-4d32-a3f1-04020beeb85b"><!--a--></a>The MCA will also pay
special attention to the group of seniors living alone, which is growing.
For these elderly, it is all the more important for them to get
involved in community activities, build a close network of friends
and neighbours, and avoid the problems of isolation or depression.
MCYS has decided to expand the Seniors Activity Centres (SACs) to
serve seniors beyond those living in rental flats. It will resource
the SACs to serve
up to 48,000 seniors across different housing types by 2020, a significant increase
from the 18,000 seniors served today. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2156</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-074cb196-d8ac-475a-8acf-56fc4da24c8c"><!--a--></a>We have also sought to
integrate eldercare services with housing developments. Studio apartments,
such as the Golden Jasmine in Bishan, come with eldercare centres at
the ground floor that provide social and healthcare services to
the residents residing within the block and in the vicinity. I also
encourage the private developers to develop the kind of retirement
housing that Dr Chia Shi-Lu mentioned. This is a specific area of silver
industry that we should promote and I welcome more ideas from Ms
Tin Pei Ling and others on what more we can do. Let me now move
on to the second area of MCA's focus, that is, to enhance aged care
in terms of better accessibility, affordability and quality.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-edb76f62-6daf-4fde-a63c-df1b9a8f7dd9">
                  <a name="budget__id-edb76f62-6daf-4fde-a63c-df1b9a8f7dd9"><!--a--></a>First, we need to ramp
up aged care services and facilities significantly to improve access.
We have to start now because it takes several years to build the
infrastructure and train the manpower. By 2020, we will increase
the number of nursing home beds by some 70%, from 9,000 today to
15,600 to meet the needs of severely dependent seniors whose families
are unable to care for them at home, as well as those with no family support
at all.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a7f8edcc-35e2-43b0-85e0-b143655e3be5">
                  <a name="budget__id-a7f8edcc-35e2-43b0-85e0-b143655e3be5"><!--a--></a>We will also develop a
range of home- and community-based aged care services to support
families in caring for their loved ones at home. We will more than
double the capacity of home-based healthcare services from 4,000
patients today to up to 10,000 patients, and more than triple the
capacity of home-based social care from 2,000 today to up to 7,500.
We will triple the number of day social and rehabilitative care
places from 2,100 to about 6,200. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-75888c39-f377-472a-9af2-b5a3031c5601"><!--a--></a>The $120 grant per month
for families to hire a foreign domestic helper will help them to
care for elderly family members who are unable to care for themselves.
Coupled with the expansion of the various centre-based and home-based
services, we hope to keep as many seniors ageing-in-place as possible.
We will also step up caregiving training so that they are adequately
equipped. Mdm Halimah Yacob will elaborate on home-and community-based
care as well as caregiver support during MCYS' COS Debate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db20bc11-94f9-4100-8014-5e01c54a11b6">
                  <a name="budget__id-db20bc11-94f9-4100-8014-5e01c54a11b6"><!--a--></a>We recognise the constraints
of voluntary organisations in keeping up with the pace and scale
of our expansion. The Government is prepared to take the lead in
the hardware development of aged care facilities by bearing the
full capital cost of these facilities under a Build-Own-Lease (BOL)
model. This will reduce the financial burden on VWOs who wish to
expand their aged care services. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4dfb3c18-d3b4-44b3-9573-6a5bb21a07f8">
                  <a name="budget__id-4dfb3c18-d3b4-44b3-9573-6a5bb21a07f8"><!--a--></a>In addition to VWOs, we
will also be opening up the provision of subsidised nursing home
services to private operators, through the use of portable subsidies
or inviting the private operator to tender to operate BOL projects.
Today, some 700 beds in private nursing homes are occupied by subsidised
patients under the portable subsidy scheme. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8f49bfde-7f4d-400c-88f7-7ebd738071c9">
                  <a name="budget__id-8f49bfde-7f4d-400c-88f7-7ebd738071c9"><!--a--></a>Second, we will make aged
care affordable. We have just announced comprehensive enhancements
to the subsidy framework for aged care, which will mean a 30% increase of
subsidies amounting to some $250 million this year. Middle income
families will now also benefit from Government subsidies for these
services, while the lower income will enjoy even higher subsidies.
This will ease the financial burden of long-term care for about
30% more patients, or a total of about 40,000 patients.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2157</p>

of aged care, which Dr Chia Shi-Lu had asked about. Our seniors
today had contributed significantly to Singapore's progress and
we should care for them well when they age and become frail. We
will coordinate and integrate services more effectively so that
our seniors can be cared for better. For instance, we will build
Integrated Day Facilities in the community which would be "one-stop"
facilities providing both health and social care for seniors during
the day. I would also like to assure Mr Chen Show Mao that the Agency
for Integrated Care (AIC), which focuses on healthcare integration
and the Centre for Enabled Living (CEL) which focuses on social
care, work very closely together to provide client-centric help
to seniors and their caregivers. We will continue to evolve the
Government's programmes and organisation structures to facilitate
even better coordination for better care of our seniors. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d52f3067-6c05-414b-a03f-40d5f39d8463">
                  <a name="budget__id-d52f3067-6c05-414b-a03f-40d5f39d8463"><!--a--></a>The quality of care in
our aged care facilities must also improve. In my visits to the various
aged care facilities, I was impressed by the dedication and innovation
in this service industry. I have seen how the <em class="ph i">Wii</em> is used
in some day care centres and nursing homes that I have visited,
and it has certainly energised and entertained the seniors there!
You may find that some of the seniors are very tense in the picture
[<em class="ph i">a slide was shown to hon Members</em>]. That is because they
take the <em class="ph i">Wii</em> game very seriously. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2f2273d9-837e-476b-9e2a-0980ef4510d5">
                  <a name="budget__id-2f2273d9-837e-476b-9e2a-0980ef4510d5"><!--a--></a>But unfortunately, there
are also instances of neglect and abuse at the other end of the
spectrum as mentioned by Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Mr Patrick Tay. While
these are few and far between, when it comes to safe care, we should
adopt a zero tolerance policy. One case of abuse is one case too
many.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5082a699-bc21-4704-a419-2f29d938ac9d">
                  <a name="budget__id-5082a699-bc21-4704-a419-2f29d938ac9d"><!--a--></a>The quality of care is
a joint responsibility – the Government must have a robust regulatory
and quality framework in place for aged care, while service providers
must constantly improve care delivery and put in place a robust
framework within their institution to ensure that care professionals
uphold the standard of care required. Seniors and their caregivers
can also participate by being discerning in choosing aged care providers
and providing timely feedback on services. The MCA intends to work
with service providers and the public to enhance care standards
in a number of ways.</p>

standards. In the MCA's recent dialogue with stakeholders in the
aged care sector, there were suggestions that we should have a clearer
definition of what constitutes a good standard of care for the sector,
and I agree. It is timely now to review existing standards and guidelines
for aged care services. My Ministry will involve representatives
from the public, as well as providers and clinicians, in doing so,
so that there is a strong sense of ownership of these standards.
We will start with the nursing homes.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fbcbb34c-aa42-41a6-b6df-d2a1bbb64c60">
                  <a name="budget__id-fbcbb34c-aa42-41a6-b6df-d2a1bbb64c60"><!--a--></a>Second, we want to give
seniors and caregivers new avenues to provide feedback on care.
MOH will set up a Visitors' Programme, where volunteers from across
society will be invited to visit nursing homes, chat with patients
and give providers suggestions on improvements. This is a voluntary
scheme and it is also a useful tool for nursing homes to help identify
areas they have done well and areas they can improve upon. To date,
41 nursing homes have signed up for this programme and we have recruited
48 volunteers.</p>

aged care sector for better care. We have announced significant enhancements
to subsidies for the aged care sector. At the same time, the Government is prepared to help
aged care providers recruit staff, enhance the skills level of their workforce
and improve processes to deliver better care. Minister of State
Dr Amy Khor will elaborate on these manpower initiatives for the
immediate and long-term care sector later on.</p>

be challenging but exciting. We must gear up as a society, for the
pace and magnitude of ageing that will come. Dr Lam Pin Min passionately
argued that Singaporeans had to build a common understanding of
what was needed to create an inclusive society where our people
can age gracefully and with dignity. I agree with him wholeheartedly
and also with Mr Hri Kumar that we need a national plan to address the
issue of developing facilities for the elderly. As he has elegantly
put it and I quote, "This issue is in everybody's backyard". Caring
well for our seniors is a collective responsibility we all share.
Many of the aged care facilities will have to be sited within the
community for the convenience of the seniors. On our part, the Government
will engage advisors, grassroots leaders and residents on our plans
for facility development and to strike a careful balance between
addressing the needs of the seniors and the needs of the residents
in the vicinity. We need the support of grassroots organisations and
Singaporeans themselves to make the community inclusive and welcoming

Lien that any national effort to address the issue of an ageing
population cannot be a Government-driven one alone. It also has
to be community driven. This is indeed what we are doing under the
City for All Ages project, where we seek to share the needs of the
local community with the local grassroots leaders and non-profit
organisations, jointly develop solutions, and empower them to realise
their ideas. In Marine Parade, for example, some 70 seniors participated
in our town audit by walking around the estate at different times
of the day and night, and they surfaced almost 300 suggestions on
how the built environment could be improved to help seniors move
around more safely and with greater confidence. The Town Council and
LTA responded by fixing many of these hardware issues where practical.
We also tapped on the many helping hands in Marine Parade. Senior
volunteers helped us in conducting functional screening of seniors,
aged 70 years old and above, in Marine Parade. The local Seniors
Activity Centre, called "Goodlife"!, responded to the needs of vulnerable
seniors by visiting those who said they were living alone, and I
know that some of the local RC chairpersons personally keep in touch
with these seniors living alone in some of the RC zones. </p>

partnerships in Whampoa, Bedok and Taman Jurong. I am also heartened
to see many ground-up efforts in other constituencies as well, such
as the MacPherson CARE fund to help needy elderly residents in MacPherson
cover medical costs, and the new MediWheels programme in Ang Mo
Kio which will make it easier and cheaper for the frail elderly
and disabled to move around the neighbourhood. In fact, I just launched
the Nurses' Initiative for Community Engagement (NICE) in Hougang,
some two weeks ago, where a group of 100 volunteer nurses commit
their own time outside their working hours to visit seniors in the
community to conduct health checks and give them advice. Sir, the
momentum is rapidly building up and there is great energy on ground.

Khor Lean Suan)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, Minister Gan spoke on the Ministerial
Committee on Ageing's efforts to enhance aged care. Just as we have
made a big push to significantly enhance the capacity and affordability
of aged care, we need a big push on the manpower front too. </p>

Ibrahim and Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked whether we have adequate manpower
to care for our ageing population, and Dr Lam Pin Min spoke about enhancing
the manpower and capability development in the intermediate and
long-term care (ILTC) sector. </p>

the ILTC sector needs to develop a strong base of qualified healthcare
workers. Between now and 2020, we need 11,000 more staff across
all levels, especially nurses, therapists, social workers and healthcare
support workers, to augment the current 4,000-strong workforce.
However, ILTC providers find it challenging to attract and retain
good staff today, given their more limited resources and smaller
scale. The Government will, therefore, support the ILTC sector to
build up its capability and capacity in the following ways.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-86de8e3b-cf56-4719-b933-41c2d00f7c70">

the funding support to enable the sector to be better staffed. Since
last year, the Ministry has provided additional funding to the funded
VWO nursing homes to improve their staffing ratios. We will now
extend this funding support to the community hospitals, so that
they too can increase their staffing to manage more complex cases,
ease the staff's workload, and set aside more training time for
them. This initiative to enhance manpower staffing in the ILTC sector
will cost the MOH up to $20 million in FY2012. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-e203901d-0cdc-468f-8a20-3dcf6e00db7e"><!--a--></a>Apart from helping providers
increase their in-house staffing, we will also increase the external
pool of healthcare professionals that ILTC providers can tap on,
to augment their base of professional staff. We are starting a new
scheme to rotate experienced hospital nurses who have completed
the Advanced Diploma in Gerontology, to ILTC institutions for six
months. The nurses will get to apply their newly-gained knowledge in
helping the institutions improve their services and processes. This
scheme will kick off with 75 nurses from the next two batches of
graduands of the Advanced Diploma course at Nanyang Polytechnic.</p>

can pay competitively. Healthcare professionals in the ILTC sector
play an important role in caring for patients who need longer term
rehabilitation and nursing care. But their salaries have traditionally
lagged behind that of their peers in the acute hospitals, which
makes it challenging for the sector to attract and retain good staff. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-374c3b2c-44ff-4db3-a9be-f428f6ccde8c"><!--a--></a>Going forward, the Government
will set aside up to $12 million in FY2012, to enable the VWO ILTC
sector to raise pay. We will take a phased approach to the implementation.
In the first phase, we are looking at salary increases of between
10% and 25% for nurses and allied health professionals. Doctors
will receive adjustments similar to their peers in the acute sector.
The funding to support the pay increases will apply from April this
year. This will boost institutions' ability to recruit and retain
good professional healthcare staff. </p>

towards funding the next phase of salary increases, as the sector
grows in terms of its capabilities and productivity. Separately,
the Ministry and AIC will work closely with ILTC institutions to
review the job scopes of healthcare support staff so as to make
the work more challenging and meaningful, and to review their pay
in tandem with the enhanced job scope. </p>

with the sector to build its capabilities and boost productivity.
Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim asked about the potential to leverage
on technology and innovation. We agree that there is room to further
optimise manpower use and boost productivity. The Government will,
therefore, invest up to $96 million over the next five years to
work with ILTC providers on various productivity initiatives, such
as bulk procurement, job and process redesign, and leveraging on
IT. For example, AIC has embarked on a pilot to redesign processes
and jobs in three nursing homes which are relocating to new premises,
and will extend this effort to other ILTC institutions. </p>

AIC will set up a new $20 million Community Health Improvement and
Productivity Scheme (CHIPS), to drive quality improvement and productivity
in the sector. ILTC operators who have innovative ideas on how to
improve work processes and harness technology to increase efficiency
and raise quality of care, can seek funding to turn these ideas
into real gains on the ground. </p>

our investment in professional development in this sector. Over
the last five years, we have supported more than 350 ILTC staff
for advanced skills training through the Health Manpower Development
Programme-ILTC or HMDP-ILTC in short, which has been instrumental
in helping ILTC staff advance their skills and deepen their expertise.
One recipient of the HMDP-ILTC Fellowship is Ms Roselind Tan Cheng,
a Staff Nurse at St Luke's Hospital. Formerly an architectural designer,
she made a career switch to nursing almost eight years ago. Roselind
finds nursing in the ILTC sector an immensely fulfilling vocation,
and enjoys learning new ways of caring for her patients. Roselind
has been awarded an HMDP-ILTC Fellowship to pursue an Advanced Diploma in
Palliative nursing, which will enable her to provide better care
for the palliative patients at St Luke's.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-e30a2220-170b-440c-9757-3da467f3f7db"><!--a--></a>Through the HMDP-ILTC
and new upgrading scholarships for milestone professional training,
such as degree upgrading programmes, the Government will invest
$11 million over the next five years in advanced skills training
for locals working in the ILTC sector. The Government will also
invest another close to $10 million over five years to support continuing training
programmes in ILTC-specific areas, such as dementia and palliative care.
Together, these efforts translate into an investment of more than
$3,000 per local per year – to develop core skills in the sector
and upgrade capabilities through advanced training, to raise the
productivity of the entire sector. Altogether, the Ministry will
set aside up to $32 million in FY2012 to support the ILTC sector
in staffing and pay enhancements, and another $117 million over
the next five years for productivity and skills upgrading. I would
like to encourage our ILTC providers to tap on this additional Government
support to invest in the development and long-term retention of
their staff. We believe that with these initiatives, institutions
can attract more and better staff with the skills, aptitude and
compassion to care for our seniors. </p>

Chairman, I am concerned that tobacco is a problem in Singapore
that needs urgent and serious action. There is a disparity between
the increasing evidence of the many harms of tobacco, and the fact
that many youths are unaware of these harms, and that recent data
show an increase in young smokers in Singapore, which is a very
worrying trend. Smoking is dangerous at any age but the younger
people start, the more likely they are to smoke for a longer period,
and to die early as a result of this. </p>

kills is well known. What is alarming though is how many lives are
at risk and can be saved with appropriate intervention. The Health
Promotion Board (HPB) calculates that there are seven tobacco deaths
daily in Singapore. Each day, seven people in Singapore die as a
result of tobacco-related diseases. The World Health Organization
estimates that about 10% of all tobacco deaths are those of non-smokers. A
non-smoker is more likely to be killed by tobacco in Singapore than
by a road accident.</p>

is often cited as a defining moment in our recent history. Its effects
were felt for some time after and continue to influence our behaviour
today. The SARS deaths were tragic and shook all of us deeply. However,

children currently in Primary 6, three children per class will eventually
be killed by tobacco-related diseases.</p>

one in five youths in Singapore thought that smoking was not harmful.
About 70% of those surveyed also said they could stop smoking anytime they
wanted to. This is worrying as it shows that the sheer addictive
properties of smoking and its destructive capabilities are under
appreciated. Nicotine has serious, long lasting, deep-seated effects
on the brain. Smoking biochemically re-wires our neural circuitry,
resulting in profound addiction. Smokers do not exercise the choice
that the marketing suggests they have. They are dependent on nicotine
and need help to break their habit.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, genetic testing is a sophisticated technique necessary to test
for genetic disorders. Genetic tests are used for several reasons, including
carrier screening of a particular inherited disease; pre-natal diagnostic
testing; pre-symptomatic testing for the prediction of certain adult-onset
diseases; and, screening and assessing the risk of developing certain
adult-onset cancers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c54fc4af-ae56-4515-96ba-cb964dbe4d61">
                  <a name="budget__id-c54fc4af-ae56-4515-96ba-cb964dbe4d61"><!--a--></a>Over the last 10 years,
there is an increased demand for genetic screening and genome mapping
with rising expectations, as well as affordability of such tests.
While the physical
risks associated with most genetic tests are very small, particularly
for those tests that require only a blood sample or buccal smear,
many of the risks associated with genetic testing involved the emotional,
social and financial consequences of the tests results.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2164</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-5eb7c241-80fa-42dd-8120-8ff70774f362"><!--a--></a>The probability of genetic
discrimination in employment and insurance is also a concern. Some
individuals avoid genetic testing out of fear of being discriminated against
by employers and insurance companies. In some countries, anti-discriminatory laws
present essentially allows such testing to take place without fear
of being discriminated against by employers and insurance companies.
Will MOH look into the applications of cancer genetic testings and
enact appropriate anti-discriminatory laws to protect the patients?</p>

of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical
Practice and author of <em class="ph i">Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the
Pursuit of Health</em> when he claims that "Early diagnosis is the
sickness, that screening for diseases too often leads to overdiagnosis
and overtreatment of those who are well."</p>

strategy behind early diagnosis is to encourage the well to get examined
to determine if they are not, in fact, sick. But is looking hard
for things to be wrong, a good way to promote health? The truth
is, the fastest way to get heart disease, autism, glaucoma, diabetes,

it. In other words, the problem is overdiagnosis and overtreatment."</p>

the mentality of people who refuse to go for screening, which is not
cheap. They cannot reconcile with the fact that they have to pay
to be told that they are not well or could be dying, or if the screening
turns out negative, they will think that they were fools to have
wasted money to suffer the indignity of stripping and other discomforts
only to confirm that there was nothing wrong with them. This is
particularly true in the case of mammogram screening, where there
are conflicting views whether it does help to detect breast cancer.
The current state of mammography is just too painful for women to
bear, even for those who have the highest threshold of pain.</p>

view this article which seems to throw a spanner in the works as
I believe that the Ministry is already having an uphill task persuading
women to go for screening for all types of cancer? I ran a heavily

for the past two years. The efforts we have put in have also not
yielded the desired outcome. Fewer than 20,000 women in the age
group of 50 to 69 who had not done screening before or were not
screened for three years responded to our roadshows and mailers.
Of these, a few were tested positive and sought treatment.</p>

the Integrated Screening Programme in 2008 to encourage and support
screening for early detection and management of disease. How many
women have responded positively to this programme? What were the
rates of detection? Was there funding or subsidy for women who took
part in this programme? Is the programme ongoing, and how could
one enrol for it? If persuasion does not work, can the Ministry
consider working out a scheme whereby women who reached 55 and have gone for certain
screening would be allowed to buy medical insurance at half the premium

Thank you, Sir. MediShield today still does not cover congenital

worse in the case of Singaporean children born with more severe
conditions, such as rare genetic conditions. I know of some families
whose Medisave balances are wiped out. </p>

the response of "it's just too bad" or that "covering them would
burden everyone else", "we will have to pay higher premiums for
them". Should the decision to extend MediShield to those with congenital
or pre-existing conditions be made through public consultation,
as suggested by the Minister? Ask everyone to agree to pay higher
premiums? Or should the incremental costs be covered by the MOH budget,
just like the way we take care of the vulnerable and those more
at risk in our country?</p>

with at least the same MediShield coverage – ceiling that is enjoyed
by typical Singaporeans – that would assure couples contemplating
babies that whatever condition their newborns turn out to be, they
still have access to basic healthcare insurance. I, therefore, urge
the Ministry to instil a sense of urgency to ensure MediShield includes
all Singaporeans, especially those born with special needs. </p>

One of the critical success factors to improve prognosis of children
with special needs is early detection and quality early intervention.
Although screenings are now conducted during health checks, and
especially when the kids are due for immunisation, outcomes have
been mixed. Detection later in pre-school and formal schools is
not systemic and dependent very much on the experience, workload and
proactivity of the teaching staff. I, therefore, urge the MOH to
improve the current system so that the children might have a better
head-start and access to intervention earlier.</p>

Currently, many herbal medications are regulated as over-the-counter

Handling emerging and new infectious diseases, such as SARS and

means for controlling and managing the diseases and their spread.

                     <strong class="ph b">Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
as Minister Gan mentioned earlier, our healthcare landscape needs
to transform to meet the challenges of a growing and ageing population.
This would include the growing burden of mental disorders. As our population
grows, the number of Singaporeans with schizophrenia is expected
to increase by about 2% per year. As we age faster, the number of
Singaporeans with dementia will increase significantly. We must
enhance our mental health capabilities to cope with this increased
burden. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f37ea02f-be5e-4b8c-8ee7-af3e2e27b6ac">
                  <a name="budget__id-f37ea02f-be5e-4b8c-8ee7-af3e2e27b6ac"><!--a--></a>Our strategy of keeping
people healthy and managing their health conditions well to reduce
the need for costly hospitalisations also applies to those with
mental conditions. Several Members spoke on the issue of mental
health. Since the National Mental Health Blueprint was rolled out
in 2007, we have invested some $180 million in strengthening core
services for mental health conditions. We enhanced early detection
and access to treatment through programmes, such as the Response,
Early Assessment and Intervention in Community Mental Health (REACH),
(this is different from the one that I chair for Feedback Unit),
which helps to provide early detection and intervention to children
with mental health issues, and trains school counsellors to better
manage such children. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-c25b3a7b-3680-4535-94c5-d67b8a1cf33e"><!--a--></a>At the other end of the
spectrum, the Community Psychogeriatric Programme provides home-based
mental health services for the frail elderly, which has improved clinical
outcomes and patients' quality of life. Despite the progress that
we have made, much remains to be done.</p>

in caring for persons with mental conditions in the community. This
is indeed our intent. Over the next few years, we will be developing
a new community-based mental health plan to complement our hospital-based
services. Our goal is to build a network of care and support services
that are integrated with our primary care and long-term care services.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2167</p>

for mental health patients, we will site specialist-led multi-disciplinary
teams in the community, starting with the north and central regions
this year. These Assessment and Shared Care Teams (ASCAT) will be
integrated with our primary care services, so that a person with
a mental condition can visit a clinic near him to receive the care
he needs, instead of having to see the psychiatrist in the hospital.
We target to set up six ASCAT teams by 2016 to manage up to 9,500
patients at any point in time. In addition to the ASCAT teams, we
will put in place more specialised teams to focus specifically on
dementia patients. We will also expand counselling and psychotherapy
services in the community to enable GPs to play a larger role in
treating patients with mild to moderate mental conditions, such
as anxiety and depression. </p>

a mental condition calls for tremendous family and social support.
To this end, community nodes, such as Seniors Activity Centres and
grassroots organisations, play an important role in helping residents
with mental health conditions. We will be piloting a helpline to
provide information to such community organisations, to enable them
to assist patients and caregivers to better navigate the range of
services available. Mobile teams of mental health professionals
will also provide early on-site response for potential crisis situations
where intervention or closer assessment is needed. In tandem, we
will work with the Alzheimer's Disease Association to expand the reach
of its Elder-sit and Home Intervention Services, to help more families
care for their loved ones with dementia. </p>

case management to ensure that persons with mental illness adhere
to their care plans and are connected to the services they need.
Overall, we will spend over $100 million more to support such community
mental health projects over the next five years.</p>

to build up community-based mental health services, we will also
grow some of the other hospital and institution-based services for
those with more severe mental disorders. We will expand the capacity
of the specialised outpatient memory clinics in our hospitals by
about 60% over the next five years, to serve more dementia patients.
Over the next five years, we will also build two new psychiatric nursing
homes, one additional psychiatric rehabilitation home and two more
psychiatric sheltered homes at a cost of about $70 million. </p>

that mental health services are affordable, which was an issue that
Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Patrick Tay and Mrs Lina Chiam raised. Apart
from subsidised treatment at the polyclinics, those who qualify
for the Community Health Assist Scheme can also receive subsidised
treatment at GPs for schizophrenia, major depression, dementia and
bipolar disorder. Medisave can also be used for outpatient treatment of these
conditions. Those who need inpatient psychiatric treatment or residential
long-term care enjoy the same subsidies as other patients – up to
80% in Class C wards or up to 75% in ILTC facilities - and additional
financial assistance via Medifund is also available for needy patients. </p>

up to $150 per day from their Medisave accounts for in-patient psychiatric
treatment, which is generally less intensive than for other medical conditions.
As Minister Gan mentioned earlier, we are considering extending MediShield
coverage for inpatient psychiatric treatment. </p>

will require systematic development of mental health professionals.
I would like to assure Ms Tin and Mr Low Thia Khiang that the Ministry
is actively working on this. We have grown our psychiatry specialist
training capacity to produce about 15 psychiatrists a year over
the next five years, compared to only five a year currently. We
have also increased the local pipeline for clinical psychologists, through
NUS and James Cook University Singapore's postgraduate programmes.
The total intake will reach more than 20 per year by 2012 and will
enable us to meet the projected national demand. In addition, over
the past five years, close to 250 allied health professionals and
nurses underwent advanced training in mental health-related disciplines
under the Ministry's Healthcare Manpower Development Programme.
We will continue to support training opportunities for our healthcare
professionals to pursue advanced training in areas relating to mental
health, to ensure that we have sufficient numbers of adequately
trained manpower to support our national mental health plans. </p>

Mr Low, Mr Chen Show Mao and Dr Lily Neo that there is a whole-of-Government

caregivers. </p>

with other relevant Ministries and Government agencies, such as
MCYS, MOE, the Police and the Health Promotion Board (HPB), to do
so, with AIC playing a crucial role on the ground to manage patient
referrals and implement different programmes. An important part
of their efforts is to help bridge the health and social service
agencies in order to deliver more holistic care for patients with
mental illness. </p>

Tin also spoke on the de-stigmatisation of mental health patients.
This requires a change in mindset, and is not something that can
be achieved in a short time. Siting of mental health services in
the community, and allowing patients to seek treatment at a clinic
near where they live, just like any other chronic disease, is one
step in this direction.</p>

with our mental health education and promotion efforts. HPB reached
out to some 170,000 people last year, and will continue with its
efforts this year. Some notable efforts include empowering peer
support networks among youths, and deploying a roving bus to provide
integrated physical and mental health screening for the elderly.
HPB has a workplace mental health promotion grant to build resilience and
well-being of employees and facilitate early detection and support.
From April this year, the maximum quantum of the grant will be raised
from $2,000 to $5,000 to sustain and augment companies' mental health
promotion programmes. The grant is targeted to benefit 100,000 employees
over the next three years, at a cost of $2.5 million. </p>

efforts to encourage Singaporeans to lead healthier lifestyles.
This is not easy, as many work long hours and eat out. In 2010,

the first Healthier Coffee Shop last month. Over the next year,
we plan to have 20 more Healthier Coffee Shops and 20 more Healthier

you – I have actually gone to the Healthier Hawker Centre, and the
food tastes just as good. In working
with the community, HPB also actively promotes the use of its Healthier Catering
Guidelines to ensure that healthier food choices are available at
the events it co-organises. HPB has also worked with shopping malls,
community clubs, and MRT stations to create opportunities to remind
and encourage people to live healthy lifestyles. We are working
to integrate these efforts to form Health Promoting Constituencies. </p>

to bring smoking rates down to under 15%, which is one of the lowest
in the world. However, even as the rates decline, it is challenging
to maintain our gains with each succeeding cohort of youth, and

we could limit the consumption of trans fat. I agree with the need
to do so, because of the link to heart disease. In Singapore, three
in ten adults exceed the World Health Organisation's daily limit
of trans fat intake, and two-thirds of these are young adults under
the age of 40. HPB has actively engaged food manufacturers to reduce
trans fat in their products and voluntarily label trans fat content.
Since 2009, foods that have less than 0.5g of trans fat per 100g
can carry HPB's enhanced
Healthier Choice Symbol. We are now ready to move one step further,
to regulate trans fat in our foods. </p>

AVA, we will limit trans fat to no more than 2g per 100g product for

about improving our screening programmes and screening coverage.
Screening is a key part of our health-promoting ecosystem. Heart
diseases, stroke, cancer and diabetes contribute nearly half of
the total burden of disease in Singapore, so early detection and
management of these conditions and their risk factors are important
in keeping our population healthy for longer. </p>

Programme (ISP) was launched in 2008 to encourage Singaporeans to
be screened for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and high
blood cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease
and stroke. Singaporeans are also encouraged to be screened for
selected cancers. Ms Ellen Lee quoted an article from Prof Gilbert
Welch about the perils of over-diagnosis – that "there might be
screening for diseases too frequently or we might be looking for
diseases too hard". </p>

but I would like to reassure Singaporeans that the screening tests
used in our programmes, as well as the targeted age group of 40
and above, are based on good evidence, guided by recommendations
of the Screening Test Review Committee, an independent expert committee
under the Academy of Medicine. </p>

40, HPB sends them invitations to go for the recommended screening
tests based on age and gender. The letter indicates eligibility
for subsidised screening, and lists GPs in the vicinity of their
homes that offer the Integrated Screening Programme. And I think
most of us or all of us should have received this letter. </p>

have been screened under this programme, 54% of whom were women
and 46% were men. 53% of those who have gone for screening were detected
with one or more chronic diseases. We will continue to encourage
more people to go for screening, as well as more GPs to support
this programme. Under this programme, Singaporeans pay only $8 for
screening tests for diabetes, high blood pressure, blood cholesterol
and obesity. Low-income Singaporeans do not need to pay for the
tests at all.</p>

worked with HPB on a "one-stop" enhanced integrated screening programme
in the community. This programme adds on the screening of seniors
for functional decline. GPs and dentists in the local community

This "one-stop" enhanced programme will be launched in Marine Parade

will be happy to hear that I have asked HPB to convene a Women's
Health Advisory Committee, which I will chair, to improve screening
and follow-up rates amongst women. This Committee will help HPB
plan and implement a holistic
Women's Health Programme, which will adopt a life-stage approach
and seek to equip women of all ages with the necessary knowledge
and skills to improve their health. In addition, we will build up
a pool of women Health Ambassadors who focus on women's health issues.
We plan to launch this on Mother's Day this year, and we target to
reach out to one million women in Singapore, over three years. And
since we are on the subject of women and women's health, let me
take this opportunity to wish all women in this House, as well as
women outside, in advance "Happy International Women's Day". </p>

Pin Min's point on the applications of cancer genetic testing. The
use of genetic testing in cancer is a complex issue. While genetic
testing is established as part of the care of certain individuals
who are at hereditary risk for cancers, not all genetic tests are
useful or accurate. As Dr Lam alluded to earlier, there are concerns
that the results of genetic tests could be used against the individual,
for example, by employers or insurance companies. While we acknowledge
the potential benefits of cancer genetic testing, there is the potential
for misuse. </p>

not be the answer to the problem of discrimination by employers.
The underlying mindset needs to be addressed. We will ride on on-going tripartite
efforts to encourage employers to adopt fair employment practices.
Employees should be recruited on the basis of merit, such as skills
or experience; other factors unrelated to the worker's ability to
do his job should not be considered. Furthermore, the Singapore
Life Insurance Association has, on the recommendation of the Bioethics Advisory
Committee, put in place a moratorium on the use of predictive genetic information
for life and health insurance products. The Ministry will continue
to monitor the evolving evidence for cancer genetic testing and
review our policies accordingly.</p>

as I have described, requires both top-down and ground-up initiatives.
There are several good examples of ground-up health promotion efforts
in our constituencies today. To foster and strengthen such community
health promotion initiatives, Members will be pleased to know that
we will pilot a new Constituency Health Promotion Grant from April
this year. Each constituency will be given up to $10,000 a year
for grassroots leaders to co-plan, co-develop and co-implement health
promoting activities for their local residents, such as health talks, healthy
cooking demonstrations, exercise programmes or other health interest
groups. HPB will develop a toolkit with simple guidelines and checklists
to help grassroots leaders with planning and implementation. We

me address some specific issues raised by Members. Ms Denise Phua
spoke on children with special needs. Managing children with special
needs is a complex issue requiring close multi-agency coordination
across the social, education and healthcare sectors. Early detection
touch-points include parents and care-givers, pre-school educators
and healthcare professionals. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7a854695-fdf6-423f-8233-ae6f38c98603">
                  <a name="budget__id-7a854695-fdf6-423f-8233-ae6f38c98603"><!--a--></a>HPB has worked with clinicians
to revise the Health Booklet that is given at birth to every child,
to include a more comprehensive checklist of developmental milestones. The
latest revised edition now provides development checklists at four
to eight weeks, three to five months, six to 12 months, 15 – 18
months, two to three years and four to six years. This will help parents detect potential
developmental problems in their child. Parents are encouraged to
track their children's milestones and take them to the polyclinics,
GPs or paediatricians for the recommended developmental screenings.
Our clinicians also train early childhood educators on basic child
development issues so that the educators can detect anomalies. This
would strengthen the first tier of detection, which are parents
and caregivers. Given their close proximity to their children, they would
be the most likely "first touch-point" to identify developmental
problems. </p>

the use of MediShield and Medisave for people with special needs.
Today, MediShield and Medisave are primarily designed to cover hospitalisation
expenses and expensive outpatient treatments, such as chemotherapy. As
Minister Gan had mentioned earlier, we are exploring MediShield
coverage for congenital conditions, while keeping premiums affordable.
Medisave currently also does not cover hearing aids and other physical
aids and health items. </p>

any further liberalisation of Medisave use against the adequacy
of MediSave for one's post-retirement needs. The hospitals also
tap on their endowment funds to offer financial assistance to persons
with special needs to help them purchase hearing aids and other
health equipment. </p>

our national disease surveillance system and pandemic preparedness,

health threats through a comprehensive system of local and global

about the regulation of traditional medications. Dealers and manufacturers
of Chinese Proprietary Medicines, or CPMs, have to ensure that the
safety and quality of their products pass Health Sciences Authority's
pre-market approval process, prior to sale and supply in the local
market. This includes ensuring the absence of prohibited substances and excessive
toxic heavy metal limits, and objectionable or fraudulent claims
on the labels. </p>

or TMs, are not currently subject to pre-market approval but dealers
and manufacturers are responsible for the safety of such products
in the market. This is complemented by ongoing post-market surveillance
by HSA, which monitors adverse events and conducts regular sampling
and testing of CPMs and TMs to ensure consumer safety. HSA is currently
in the process of reviewing the need to implement a risk-based pre-market

I would like to thank the Minister for the very welcome announcement

of $200 million for this exercise, I believe it will be paid for by
the Government for this fiscal year. Can I ask the Minister whether

                  </span>: Sir, yesterday,
I told Parliament that the cost of the wage increases will amount
to about $200 million. And for the $200 million for this financial year,
the Government will fund it in full, mainly because the hospitals
and the institutions have not budgeted for it. Therefore, we need
to help them with this funding. Going forward, the additional wage
increases will be rolled into the normal wages and these normal
wages will form the normal costing of the hospitals and our institutions. And
the Government funding will be based on the usual funding framework,
subvention framework. For hospitals, for example, the funding will
be based on the class of wards that you are in, and the patients
will share in the cost. The Government will continue to provide
the subvention as what we are doing today.</p>

tell us, not all of them will tell us. We estimate maybe between
100 and 150 or thereabouts every year. So we hope to be able to reach out
to more of them, including dentists, and hope that we can bring
back more of these Singaporeans who are studying overseas. We also
have to be mindful that we could only accept students who are in
approved institutions. Other institutions may not be able to qualify.
And in terms of outreach, we organise promotional trips to these countries
where many of our Singapore students are. We organise events to
bring them together and explain to them what PEG is about. We also
share with them what they can do when they come back. And we appeal
to them to consider PEG and come back and serve the Singapore healthcare
sector. We will continue to do that and we also look forward to
having more Singaporeans who are overseas, not just in the medical
studies but for dentistry studies as well, to come back and join
us in our healthcare services. </p>

have been quite encouraging; very few of them decline. Some of them
wanted to keep their options open; some of them already have offers where
they are studying; or some of them are thinking about going into
the private sector. So, there were a variety of reasons, but for
the students we have engaged, I would say, the vast majority of
them are quite encouraged by this option. As for those who did not
accept, some of them may also come back to Singapore on their own
to serve in time.</p>

                  </span>:
I thank the Minister for his responses and I look forward to working
with him to make this Healthcare 2020 Plan work. I have two clarifications,
Sir.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-02098d5e-0eed-488c-ad5e-2f2c8ddf7ded">
                  <a name="budget__id-02098d5e-0eed-488c-ad5e-2f2c8ddf7ded"><!--a--></a>I was not asking to draw
down from MediShield reserves as I know that would not be sustainable.
Instead, what I suggested was that given the very healthy financial
position of MediShield, perhaps not all the annual costs increases
from the enhanced coverage for the elderly have to be automatically
passed to policy holders through premium increases. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2d1881d4-ed9e-4120-a661-6f03fef3fae5">
                  <a name="budget__id-2d1881d4-ed9e-4120-a661-6f03fef3fae5"><!--a--></a>My second clarification
is the point about the cross-subsidy of MediShield premiums across
ages. My main concern is actually the high premiums payable by the
elderly who have no other source of income. I am not saying that
premiums must be equal across all ages but that the enhanced coverage
that I proposed in my cut could come from small premium increases
for the many working adults. I do not think many working adults
will begrudge paying a bit higher premiums to cover the 11,000 seniors
above age 90. </p>

questions: is the Minister saying that MediShield currently has no
cross-subsidy across ages? Is this a key principle of our healthcare
financing approach, or is it only for MediShield? And, thirdly,
how does this gel with the expectation for adult children to use
their Medisave to pay for their parents' medical treatment before
Medifund assistance is provided? Is this not a subsidy across generations
of an even worse kind since many of these are low-income children
paying for retired parents who have exhausted their Medisave accounts?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I
have explained the need for MediShield reserves. And even as we
look into the future when we review the MediShield this year, we
also need to look at the adequacy of the reserves. As we enhance
the benefits and look at the claim experiences of previous years,
we will have to decide how much of reserves need to be put aside
for the coming five-year period. And therefore for every revision
to the premium, we will have to take into account what proportion
of it needs to be put aside for
reserves, partly for the capital adequacy required by MAS and also
partly for the loyalty rebate in future which I explained. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2176</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-85de37b2-8196-455f-a6d3-26ce84487d33">

you are younger, when you are able to earn a regular income, there
is a loading on your premium. This loading is not for other people
but for yourself, so that when you are older, your premium would
be lower than what it would have been. As you get older, you would
appreciate that the number of people shrinks and the claims go up.
And, so, as you get older, for the older cohorts, their premiums
are going to be very high and that is why we have this arrangement
for pre-funding. So, as an individual, you pre-fund yourself; when
you get older, you then draw on this rebate which comes from the
reserves. And so in the design of the scheme, as we move forward,
you will not want to put aside more than what is necessary; but
we need to be advised by the actuaries on what is adequate. So,
I would assure Mr Giam that we will be very careful because we do
not really want to increase premium unnecessarily. But if it is
necessary for reasons of prudence, then I think we ought to do so. </p>

premiums across ages: for MediShield, the design of the scheme is
such that each cohort will be risk-pooled together, so there is
very little cross-subsidy between younger generation and older generation.</p>
            </div>

that, and as the younger generation begin to shrink, you will have a
bigger problem in future for the younger generation to shoulder
the insurance premium for the older generation, if it is built into
the structure of the MediShield. Because once you go on that structure,
that means the older generation is not paying their own premium.
And you will find that as the younger generation grows older, they are
already not paying their own premium and they are relying on the
next generation to pay for them. And this inter-generation subsidy
is between people who are unrelated. So, I think it is a lot more
difficult to persuade the younger generation to accept this. The risk
of that is that some of the younger generation may opt out of the
MediShield scheme and join other schemes that do not have this cross-subsidy.</p>

be very mindful. Even the loyalty rebate I talked about, we also have
to be very careful not to overload a person when he is younger.
Because when he compares his own insurance premium versus premiums
that are available in the private sector, they may ask, "why is
my premium so expensive today?" Because he may or may not be aware
that there is a loyalty rebate that will benefit him in future.
So some of them may actually decide to drop out, and once they drop
out, there will be problem, because they may not be able to rejoin
due to pre-existing conditions. So, as we adjust some of these parameters,
we have to be mindful and be very careful. </p>

sharing between generations. I think I have answered that question
in a previous Parliamentary Question. The answer - and I also mentioned
it in my speech – is that family support remains an important component.
But I also said in my speech that we have to recognise that the
older generation has a lot more burden and we want to make sure
that they too have a sufficient amount to meet their healthcare
needs. And that is why, in this Budget, we have provided top-ups
for the older generation, and the one-time top-up is specifically
to help members pay for the increases in the MediShield premium
when we adjust it. We want to strengthen family support for our
Singaporeans but, at the same time, we recognise that we have to
be very mindful
that the older generation would have a higher burden, and we find
different ways to help them. So, our top-up is one way. </p>

Sir I would like to seek clarification on the MediShield review
which does not cover those with congenital and pre-existing conditions.
I would like to ask the Minister to clarify when the review for
the MediShield coverage for those with congenital and pre-existing
conditions be completed. The review has been going on for some years
now. I wonder if it can be brought forward, because basic healthcare is
not a "nice-to-have" item. It is a basic essential service. And
I also worry about the traditional paradigm and the narrative that
if we want to include people with congenital or pre-existing conditions,
then the fee will have to come out directly from the pockets of
other Singaporeans. I find this underlying assumption not acceptable
because, for example, in education, we never say that if we want
to help the weaker students, then we ask those who are more able
to pay higher school fees. Hence, I would like Minister to clarify
and consider, in the review, to include people with congenital and
pre-existing conditions earlier in the MediShield scheme. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
share the sense of anxiety with Ms Denise Phua. We want to finish
the review as soon as possible and, in fact, we will be going out
for public consultation soon. Public consultation will give us a
better sense of what are the features that the public would want
and the associated costs with it, because for every benefit, there
is a cost. Even if Ms Denise Phua does not believe that they should
pay for it, someone has to pay for it, either the taxpayers or through
the Government taxes or shared among all the parents, all the Singaporeans.
This is the concept of risk-pooling. So, all the participants in
MediShield will share the risk of congenital diseases, and this scheme
will have to be enforced before the child has discovered the illness
so that the congenital disease will be covered. The risk will be
shared by all the parents and that is how we share the cost of congenital
diseases.</p>

diseases coverage, MediShield pay-outs will still have limits. There
will still be deductibles; there will still be conditions of claims.
For cases of children whose cost of care goes beyond the claim limits
or for whatever reason, they cannot be helped by MediShield, we
will look at other ways to help them directly or indirectly, even
through Medifund. So, I think we try to help these children through multiple
avenues; through insurance is one way, and we are also exploring
other ways to help them. </p>

the point about Medisave for the elderly. I take the point that we
want to make sure that the elderly have enough savings in their
CPF to pay for their future healthcare expenses, their MediShield
and what not. But I think for those elderly who have retired, they
no longer have an income, they have no other family members and
they want to rely on themselves. Would it not be better to let them
have more autonomy? Because if they do not get to use their Medisave
now, then they will be using the Medifund. And even if they have
expended their Medisave now, eventually, they will still have to use
Medifund. So, why not let them have the autonomy to choose how they want
to use their Medisave for their medical-related problems at this
stage while they still can?</p>

cases, I am prepared to look at them. But, personally, I would prefer
to help them with Medifund, and allow them to keep their Medisave
for themselves. Because, at the end of the day, a person may find
that he is likely to underestimate the potential healthcare costs
as he grows old. And even if he is old and does not have a job,
no longer working, retired, but he will still have needs in the
future because he may live very long. And if we manage our healthcare
services well, we provide adequate support and healthcare, he may
live very long and he may outlive his own expectation. If that is
the case, he would need all the savings in his Medisave to support
his medical needs when he really grows old. So, I would encourage
Ms Tin to raise the specific cases to MOH and we will take a look

                  </span>: Sir,
I agree with the Member Ms Tin that the media also plays a part
in shaping the perceptions of the public about mental illnesses
and they could actually contribute to the stigma related to this
illness. There are a number of reasons. Of course, it is lack of
awareness or inaccurate understanding of people with mental issues
as well as lack of understanding as to how to interact with them,
and the media can be one of the reasons. So, besides public education,
raising awareness of the public about people with mental illness,
increasing their awareness and understanding through HPB programmes,
we are also looking at possibly getting people who have recovered
from their mental disorders to share about their experiences with
the community, getting the grassroots and community involved in
reintegrating people with mental illness. And, of course, we can
also try and profile some of these cases to the media. But whether
the media will publish it or not, we will have to leave it to them.
We will work very hard towards this.</p>

plans in place to establish another type of step-down care in our
ageing population for right siting,

to train home medical carers, such as doctors, nurses and medical

                  </span>: Sir, I
thought I have explained in my speech earlier this morning our strategy
in dealing with the ILTC sector and they will be looking at encouraging home
care and to support home care. We would not be setting up a home
care centre because home care is at home. But in order to support
home care, I think Dr Neo's point is that it is important to have
support services so that we can allow the patients to be cared for
at home. So, we do intend to set up day-care facilities where the
patient who needs therapy, who needs day treatment, can go down
to the day-care centre to be treated so that he can then stay at
home and does not need to be hospitalised. So, those are the day-care
facilities. We will be setting up what we call the Community Health Centres.
It is another primary care model that will provide allied health
services to support the GPs in taking care of these patients who
are recovering at home. </p>

about the training of the caregivers. Indeed, this is an area that
we are stepping up our training capacity to help prepare the carers
so that they will be able to look after their elderly loved ones
at home. We need to equip them properly. </p>

transition care – how can we help patients who are discharged from
hospitals when they go home. Some hospitals do have programmes to help
settle the patients at home. During the first week or two, when
the patients return home, some hospitals have programmes to visit
them, either with nurses or sometimes with therapists, to visit
their homes, to check on the patients to make sure that they are looked
after, to make sure that they take their medication regularly, for
a few days or a few weeks until the patient is settled down at home
and his family is able to manage him going forward. So transitional
programmes are also available.</p>

some other models to see how we can facilitate transition between
community hospitals and homes. These are in a similar strategy that
we are looking at, to facilitate transitions so as to allow discharges
to be carried out more efficiently, more smoothly and to also help
the family members to be able to care for their loved ones in an
easier way. Training and support, as well as day-care facilities
in the community, are all very important, and these are the areas
that we will be looking at.</p>

Sir, two queries: first, for the Minister because he announced that
we are going to have a public-private partnership and decanting
of some patients into Parkway as well as Raffles healthcare. My
question is, when these patients get sent over, are they going to
have sharing of medical records and, if so, how is it going to be
done? Second, for the Minister of State, on the programme CHIPS,
which is to promote innovation and productivity in the intermediate
and long-term care services, are we going to have something similar
for all the other healthcare institutions that we can tap on? I
am looking, in particular, to see if MOH is interested to look at
an innovative project where we could probably consider using double-decker
beds in some of
the hospital wards currently. That would certainly save space and
also cut down on the number of new hospitals we have to build.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, let
me just clarify that the collaboration with Parkway and the Raffles
Medical Group may be of different models. We have talked a little
bit about Parkway. I have not talked about Raffles because the discussion
is still on-going. Even with Parkway, the detailed operational arrangements
are still being worked out but the principle is that, for Parkway,
our own doctors will be manning the beds that we are taking over
from Parkway East and, therefore, our doctors would have access
to our own patients' records. But, eventually, the idea is that
the national electronic healthcare records would include private
hospitals so that we can share patients' records to facilitate the
care of the patient, because the patient may be in a public hospital
today; but tomorrow he may decide, for convenience or whatever reason,
to go to a private hospital. So, we must facilitate that by making
our national electronic healthcare record portable between hospital
institutions. For Raffles, the arrangement is still being worked out
and we will announce the details of the arrangement when it is done.
I will leave the other question to the Minister of State.</p>

like to thank Minister Gan and Minister of State Amy Khor for the
comprehensive reply. I have three questions to ask. First, is there
a possibility of allowing nurses to work under a system where flexi-hours
are allowed? Second, with the continuous education and upgrading
of skills of nurses, will the basic role of nurses be compromised?
Third, will the Minister allow Medisave to be used to make full
payment for upgrading to integrated shield plan policy for Singaporeans
who are 60-80 years and above? At the moment, they are allowed to
use only up to $800, but sometimes they would want to upgrade to
a better policy plan and would need more, say, $1,100 or $1,200.
Some of these people may be cash-poor because they are retirees and
they would like to make full use of their Medisave to buy all this
insurance.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I
believe flexi-arrangement for nursing is already available. In fact,
many of our healthcare institutions, whether it is acute hospitals,
community hospitals, ILTC or nursing homes, do practise flexible
hours. But, of course, even with flexi-hours, there has to be some
structure and some arrangement so that nurses know when they have
to come and institutions know when the nurses would be there so
that they can arrange the manpower deployment. The flexibility is
there, and we encourage flexibility because this will allow us to
tap on, say, retired nurses, who may not want to work full-time.
This is something that is very important for us to help meet our manpower
needs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a4fa0a55-5116-4c26-b732-de1d9bd88fbb">
                  <a name="budget__id-a4fa0a55-5116-4c26-b732-de1d9bd88fbb"><!--a--></a>On upgrading, I am not
very clear what Mrs Chiam's argument is. She is saying that if we
keep upgrading the skills of nurses, then they will lose the basic
role of nursing. We provide opportunities for nurses to upgrade.
We provide three different pathways: one is continuing with clinical
nursing; the second is for administration and leadership where they
become nursing managers to manage a team of nurses; and there is
another group that will pursue the educational path that will provide
education and teaching to the next generation of nurses. All three
are very important. We have to make sure that we have enough people to continue
with clinical practice so that our patients are cared for. At the same
time, we also need to ensure we have sufficient leaders among the
nurses that will be able to help us in managing nursing. And some
of them will be elevated to advanced practice nurses who will be
able to undertake more complex nursing roles. In fact, in many other
countries, nurses do a lot more than what we are doing today. So,
we are continuing to explore ways to enlarge the role of nurses
so as to meet the manpower needs of our healthcare sector. Education
is also very important because if you do not have nurse educators,
you would not be able to train the next generation of nurses. So, all
the three groups need to be balanced and calibrated. In our manpower
plan, we have to decide how many practising clinical nurses we need,
how many educators we need and how many administrators we need,
so that we have a comprehensive manpower plan to develop our nursing
careers.</p>

integrated plans, today, there is a limit on how much an individual
can draw down to pay for private shield plans. The starting point
is we have to make sure that each individual has sufficient savings
in the Medisave account at least to meet the needs for basic MediShield
and ElderShield premiums. If you allow them to draw more, the risk
is that they may have enough to draw more today for the additional plans,
for example, the upgraded plans that they want, but they may not
have enough for next year or five years down the line. So, we have
to think ahead of time. That is why we have a certain limit to allow
them the flexibility to upgrade if they want to, but we cannot totally
lift the limits because otherwise they may purchase a very attractive
plan today or for the next three years but, after that, they may
deplete their Medisave and they may not even have enough for the
basic MediShield. Their MediShield cover may just lapse, and that
is not desirable. We understand the Member's concern and we want to
be as flexible as we can but, at the same time, we need to balance
it with a need to preserve the savings for their basic healthcare
needs, especially the basic Shield plans.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, when
we talk about accessibility and the regional healthcare system,
we have to bear in mind that these are not physical barriers. As
an individual patient, whichever hospital you go to, the hospital
will look after you. They will not say, "Well, since you are from
the east, please go back to the east; if you are from the west, please
go back to the west." So, wherever you are, if you are in an emergency,
the ambulance will take you to the nearest hospital and they will
take care of you. What is important in the regional system is that
by the time you are discharged, wherever you are, I am quite sure
you will go back to your home. Because you work in the west, and something
happened to you, you go to the western hospital. You live in the
east, so when you are discharged from the western hospital, you
will go back to stay in the east. And when you go back to the east,
the eastern health cluster will look after you because you will
be seeing polyclinics in the east. If you need follow-up with specialists,
you can follow up
with the previous hospital or you can follow up with the hospital
within your cluster. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-f74844da-0aff-4c44-a763-8e9c840af870"><!--a--></a>Once we have the NEHR
fully up, we will be able to communicate between hospitals and the
patient information will then be shared. And wherever you are, you
will be looked after within the region. The idea of a regional system
is to foster stronger collaboration among the various healthcare
institutions in the region so that the hospitals can work with the
community hospital and the nursing home to facilitate patient transfers.
For nursing home patients, for example, if they need acute hospital care,
they can then be sent to a hospital in the cluster. They will have
working arrangements that will facilitate a patient's transfer and
minimise the hassle and administrative procedures. So, when a patient
is discharged and goes home, the polyclinics or the GPs in the cluster
may look after him in the primary care sector and our community
health centres may then be able to provide allied health services
to support him. Our day-care centres will provide the day rehab
to support him. So, it is all within the region. That is the concept
of regional system. It does not preclude individual patients from
any particular hospital. So, your patients do not have to worry,
they just have to go to the nearest hospital that is convenient
to them, and we will take care of them.</p>

to my suggestion earlier on to give free MediShield coverage for
the low-income group and homemakers. I learned from him just now
that 92% of Singaporeans are covered under MediShield. May I ask
the Minister, what about the remaining 8%? I suppose out of this
8%, there will be those that come from the low-income group and
this also includes the homemakers from this group. How will the Ministry
ensure that it reaches out to these Singaporeans so as to encourage
them to get insured, though there is a Medisave top-up? </p>

                  </span>: Sir, I
explained earlier that out of the 8%, a significant number of them
may have good reasons why they opted out. We do not know the exact
numbers because they do not tell us the reasons for opting out.
Some of them would already have insurance coverage by their employers;
some would have bought their own health insurance, so they do not
see the need to continue with the MediShield. Not all the 8% are
from the low-income group. But for the really low-income and those
with no income at all, rather than giving them free MediShield insurance,
we have many other ways to help them. One way is through our Medifund,
through subsidies directly from our health institutions, which can
support them. Because for this low-income group, or if the whole family
has no income or are on public assistance, joining an insurance
scheme may not be the most sensible thing for them. So it is better
for us to provide direct intervention and subsidise them, and support
them when they really need healthcare services.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, the
National Electronic Health Record system is a very complex undertaking.
It will take many years to fully implement it. In fact, many developed countries
have started way before us, and they have not fully completed it. One
of the challenges is that the healthcare system is evolving as we
implement the National Electronic Health Record system, and the
system also has to evolve with the way we structure our healthcare
sector. Therefore, it is quite a complex project. We do it in phases.
As I mentioned to the Member, for the current phase, we are on target.
By June this year, we will roll out our programmes. </p>

point of view, this project is quite critical for us because it
would facilitate the flow of information, and this flow of information
would allow patients to be able to flow between different healthcare
settings. This would improve the care that we can provide for the
individual patients, so when the patient is looked after by a polyclinic,
when he goes to the specialist clinic, the records are there, when
he needs to be hospitalised, the records are there. They do not
have to search for manual records and they do not have to call up
and find out what drugs they have been taking, and so on. So, all
the records would be there and this would facilitate better care
for the patients, and this would also allow the institutions from
different sectors to collaborate, to look after the same patient.
The National Electronic Health Record is a very important part of
the overall healthcare infrastructure that we would be developing. </p>

Perhaps, the Minister can look into linking caregiver's course to
the grant to make it compulsory for caregivers to go for such training
because the explanation now is that when there is a caregiver's
course, they tend to send their maid instead of family members.
My next question is: can the Minister also provide a wider range
of subsidised home-based services that function on weekends so that families
who give their maids day off during the weekend can avail themselves
of these services for their elderly?</p>

                  </span>: Sir, our
training for caregivers is neutral. We also welcome caregivers who
are not maids but family members to attend our training so that
they are better prepared to look after their frail and elderly.
In fact, quite a lot of our participants are family members. Of
course, some of them do send their maids to be trained so that they
can better help the family members look after their loved ones.
With regard to the compulsory day off, it is more a question for
the Ministry of Manpower. I understand that family members do have the option
to provide pay <em class="ph i">in lieu</em>. So if there are circumstances requiring
the maid to be at home to help look after the disabled or those who
are elderly, I think there is flexibility provided. Your other question
is on providing services and facilities on weekends. These are the
things that we would look at to make our training and support facility
services more accessible beyond the working hours. </p>

in fact, the focus really is to allow as many of these patients
who have been stabilised in hospitals to go into the community,
to be cared for in the community so that they can reintegrate into
the community as soon as it is possible. Therefore, what we are
doing is to provide for mental health services within the community
itself to allow patients who are stabilised and discharged into
the community to continue to be cared for in the community by mobile
teams.</p>

beds, that is really for those who have to be institutionalised and
who have to receive care within that setting. We are going to expand
services for home care like dementia patients. Alzheimer's Disease
Association, for instance, is working with us to expand their elder-sit
service. This is like babysitters, but they are eldersitters for
dementia patients, and they will provide therapeutic activities
for these dementia patients. So, you can allow the caregivers to
have some respite from caring for these dementia patients. The facilities
that we are providing are multi-faceted. It is not just institutional
care, but also care within the community. </p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
I have one last clarification and two wish lists. I am impressed
by the massive expansion plan in the infrastructure for healthcare,
and I understand from the statement yesterday that we will require
about 20,000 healthcare workers by 2020. Even with the ramping up
of the training for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals,
I believe we would not be able to meet the target just by tapping on
the local pool. I believe we would probably have to hire from overseas.
Can I just ask the Minister how confident is he in meeting the target
because, if not, we would potentially face a manpower crunch when
the time comes? The two wish lists will be whether the Minister
can consider removing the minimum age limit for the Community Health
Assist Scheme (CHAS) as well as extending the additional FDW grant
for ageing at home to families with younger patients with severe
disabilities that require full-time care by the FDW, if it is not
this year, maybe hopefully next COS.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, the
short answer to the first question is that we must meet the target.
But I think we are confident. We have looked at our pipeline. We
have looked at the potential source of manpower − locally trained
as well as Singaporeans who are now overseas and foreign manpower.
We have to work together, both local and foreigners here and overseas,
to come together to deliver healthcare services for Singaporeans.
On the two wish lists, the minimum age of CHAS: we have just lowered it
from 65 to 40. We have just barely started implementing it. We register
Dr Lam's persistent request and it is duly noted. We would take
a look and see whether it is necessary for us to lower it further.
If Members remember, the main purpose of CHAS was to look after
the chronic diseases
in the community. From our studies, this is more critical for those
who are 40 and above. We will continue to review to see whether
there is need to lower it. On the FDW grant, again, that is more
a MOM cut. But I think we will register his request and we will
review it in due course.</p>

A clarification on the point I made on the role of nursing. What
I meant is that if all these staff nurses are being asked to upgrade themselves,
who takes care of the basic nursing care? Because when I was trained
as a nurse many, many years ago, my nursing was different from now.
As I understand now, we have to move forward and modernise the nursing
care. Who would take care of the basic nursing care like patient
care after surgery, medicine and the usual sort of things? I believe
it must be the Assistant Nurses and some others. Will their job

                  </span>: Sir, as
I mentioned, there are three tracks. One of them is for nurses to
remain in the nursing practice, clinical nursing where the nurses
will continue to be nurses. They are not educators. They are not
administrators. They will remain as nurses. So, the nurses on this
nursing track will continue to look after the patients. Even administrators
will continue to look after patients, although they have a special
focus on administration and leadership. Even nurse educators also
practise. If you do not practise, you will lose the skills for nursing
and then it would be very difficult for you to teach the next generation
when you do not have the skills anymore. Whichever track you are
in, we will also continue to make sure that your nursing skills
remain current. Patients will have nurses look after them, especially
from those on the nursing track.</p>

and specifically the public transport fares. The current Fare Adjustment
Formula for MRT and bus transport has been in place since 2008.
The Minister has said that the formula will be reviewed this year
for implementation next year. I would like to ask him to share with
us his thoughts on whether the formula has produced the desired
outcomes and which aspects of the formula were considered effective
by him and which not as effective. Also, it would be good if he
could share with us the process of the review as to which party
has been appointed to conduct the fare structure review and when
would the findings of such a review be completed.</p>

the uncertain world economic outlook and the recent MRT train breakdowns,
any fare hikes for commuters must be carefully considered. Many commuters
have expressed that they would like to see the PTOs improving their
service standards first before applying for fare hikes. This is
a reasonable request if we consider that commuters have just experienced
massive train breakdowns and the fact that the PTOs' past returns
have been quite good and, in my view, more than commensurate with
the risks that their shareholders bear.</p>

is to listen carefully to the people who elected us. If we disagree

issues on how to make Singapore a more equitable society. Unfortunately,
one group of Singaporeans are still unfairly treated – Polytechnic
students who pay more than their peers in JCs and ITEs. Sir, whoever
I speak to, they all feel that this inequity should be corrected.
The only problem is everybody is saying someone else should bear the
increased cost. And as I said before, if we are prepared to inject
funds directly into the PTOs to improve bus service levels, we should
also, as a Government, be prepared to inject funds to correct this
inequity. I hope the Transport Minister has some good news for Polytechnic
students for us.</p>

to elaborate how this substantial sum would benefit commuters in
terms of service levels and when can commuters start to see these
higher service levels. Additionally, by adding 800 buses or 20%
more capacity, would this not cause more road congestion, especially
during peak periods and, therefore, slowing down vehicle speeds

Under this Master Plan, it was envisaged that the bus service industry
would be opened up for "contestability for the market", potentially
beyond the two existing bus operators. So every few years, the bus
routes would be parcelled out and incumbents as well as prospective
participants can bid for a certain parcel of bus tracks. Sir, I
would like to know if the Minister can confirm whether or not he
continues to see benefits in having contestability for the market
in our bus sector and, if not, if he could share with us his preliminary

this is a valid concern.</p>

carry more people, up to 90 passengers per single-deck bus and up
to 131 passengers for double-deck buses. Thus, buses are much more
efficient than private cars and, logically, we need to accord more
priority for buses on the roads. This is self-evident to most people.
However, there are bound to be pockets of time when certain bus
lanes were not occupied fully and that irked some car users. Indeed, very
often I received complaints from these car users. </p>

had already deteriorated from 19.1 kilometre per hour in 2007 to
17.8 kilometre per hour last year, according to the Ministry of
Transport (MOT). With the planned increased of 800 buses over the
next few years, the bus speed would deteriorate further if we do
not implement any additional measures. The couple of millions of
bus passengers everyday will suffer a drop in bus speed and a longer travelling
time.</p>

more bus priority measures. They argue that they are already paying
a lot for their cars, for the COE and road tax but bus passengers
pay none of those. I can understand the concerns of the car users. </p>

able to share the bus lanes, giving way to buses only when necessary
or when needs arise, much like the YOG bus lane concept. In practice,
this can be difficult. Even ambulances find it very difficult to
get cars to give way to them. Sometimes, the cars may want to give
way to an ambulance on the fast lane but they find it hard to filter
to the left as the cars on the left lane do not want to give way
to them as well. Hence, I urge MOT to consider all stakeholders'
concerns and make a decision that will benefit the entire nation.
We must be careful not to take protest by those who are more vocal

To improve bus speeds, it is more than just expanding 35 bus stops
around the island. We need a series of concerted and bold measures.
I hope MOT can devise a strategy to improve the bus speeds as promised
in the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP).</p>

to smoothen the peak hour traffic is to stretch the morning peak
hour over a longer period of time. So far, the measures to moderate
demand during the morning peak hours on the train concentrate on
providing incentives for people to travel earlier on a voluntary
basis. However, we hear that most people treasure their sleep more
than the few cents they could potentially save. And for road users,
there is ERP to regulate them. </p>

reasons for people to travel earlier or later. To this end, large
organisations could consider staggering their operating hours. Some
of their employees can start working earlier, say, at 7.30 am, while
others can start later at 9.30 am without compromising productivity.
In reality, some people with school-going children may not mind
going to work earlier after sending their children to school. Others
may welcome another half an hour of sleep to start work later. </p>

of view, it might be worth experimenting with the staggered work
hours concept along a major corridor but we need a big push from
the Government. I thus urge MOT to form a high-level working committee
to study possible measures to lengthen the morning peak hours to
ease the traffic congestion as well as the demand for peak-hour
travel on public transport.</p>

on barrier-free accessibility. Sir, I would like to express my appreciation
to LTA for making more MRT stations friendly to the disabled and
elderly passengers. For some cases, even the pedestrian overhead
bridge near the MRT station is also elderly-friendly and the example
is the bridge near the Botanic Gardens MRT station. The Botanic
Gardens MRT station is part of the Circle Line and is one of the newest
MRT stations. This overhead bridge has a lift on each side as shown
in the second picture. Although this overhead bridge is not heavily
utilised during the peak hours at about 8.00 am, these lifts still
come in handy for the elderly. Similarly, the escalator at the overhead
bridge near the Clarke Quay MRT station, as shown in the third picture,
is also very useful. </p>

be said for the overhead bridge beside the Lakeside MRT station,
as shown in the last picture. As Members can observe, this overhead
bridge is very busy even at 7.14 am. I understand that the LTA is
doing a trial by retrofitting lifts at overhead bridges near six MRT stations
but it appears to be taking a bit too long since the last announcement
in early 2011. </p>

especially when there is so much talk about unsatisfactory working conditions

this is a driverless bus. Thus, PTOs must take a two-prone approach
by giving a make-over of the image of bus captains and enhancing
the pay package so that the 550 new buses can be rolled out on our
main roads. I remember SBS Transit launched an initiative to recruit
bus captains in 2003. It commissioned a TV series entitled "She
Drives Me Crazy" with Kym Ng playing the role of a female captain.
SBS dedicated it to all the bus captains. And within three months,
it managed to recruit more than 200 bus drivers. I would urge PTOs
to launch another creative and crazy campaign to recruit more Singaporeans
as bus captains.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, the Minister
for Finance has announced a significant initiative to enhance our
public transport, such as the $1.1 billion funding for buses and
$60 billion for rail. What is the timeline for MOT to ramp up service
improvement and enhance our public transport? If the implementation
is executed well, then this funding should further improve our land
transport. This will likely persuade more Singaporeans to take buses and
increase bus operators' revenues. How will MOT then ensure that
the profitability enjoyed by public transport operators (PTOs) as
a result of this funding will be returned to the Government? Did
MOT clarify how will such funding bring benefits to Singaporeans
in the near term? How does MOT hold PTOs accountable to the good deployment
of the 550 new buses for the purpose of shortening waiting time,
reducing overcrowding, better accessibility and connectivity with
better routes with feeder buses? Does MOT specify guidelines to
ensure that the new buses are not being used to ease PTOs' day-to-day
responsibilities or their bottom lines at the expense of vast optimal outcomes?
How does MOT plan to monitor subsequently as PTOs are private entities and
not under the Government's jurisdiction but receiving Government
funding and an almost
monopoly right? For example, how does MOT ensure that the PTOs are
lean and productive? How much do the PTOs pay their top management?
It was reported that SMRT paid its past CEO, Saw Phaik Hwa, a remuneration
of more than $1.6 million in 2010. May I ask MOT, should the PTOs
be not profitable despite this latest $1.1 billion funding due to
high remuneration for staff and for inefficiency, are they allowed
to resort to hiking transport fares for more profit? </p>

half of our buses now are wheelchair accessible. But with mobility
difficulty and failing vision due to advanced ageing or limited
physical movement of the handicapped, taking public transport is
a hurdle to the elderly and the less mobile. They need a lot more
effort and taking more time, thus delaying other commuters too.
It is better to make available other transport modes to make travelling more
conducive for this group - transport mode that provides assistance
in getting in and out of vehicles, accommodating wheelchairs and
with pick-up and drop-off arrangements. Could MOT play its role
in providing this facility, just like many developed countries which
provide such service, for example, the taxi scheme in London? </p>

Sir, when I heard the Minister announced that 800 new buses will
be added, my eyes were wide open. My residents who have just shifted into
the new BTO flats at Jade Spring and Dew Spring have been telling
me that to get to the nearest MRT station is a chore. These residents
live near two MRT stations – Yishun and Khatib stations. This sounds
like a privilege. Unfortunately, shuttle services are irregular
and overcrowded. </p>

Sir, Polytechnic students are not given similar student concession
as JC and ITE students because they are administratively tagged
as tertiary students, as compared to the tagging of non-tertiary
students for JC and ITE, which then begs the question as to why
we allow an administrative tagging to determine how much concession
the students get. </p>

concession pass for JC and ITE students will cost about $52.50 while
a similar monthly pass for Polytechnic students would cost almost
double at $97. We know that the bulk of the Polytechnic students
and JC students are about the same age and the financial situation
faced by the Polytechnic students cannot be any much different from
the JC or the other students of about the same age. The explanation in the past for this
differentiated concession has always been that if the same concession was
to be extended to Polytechnic students, it would cost the PTOs $28
million; and the public transport operators will have to levy higher
fares from other commuters to make up for this loss of revenue. </p>

lever to enable inclusive growth in Singapore. We have emphasised
the importance of education and the need to ensure that all our
students regardless of background are given equal opportunity to
quality education to develop their potential. Under MOE's education
roadmap, there are various pathways for post-Secondary students
that are offered to our students to develop their skills and to
meet their needs and aspirations. In fact, the tagline in the brochure
asked students to, "follow your strengths, fulfil your potential".
Students have the option of either JC, Polytechnic or ITE. Based
on the cohort of post-Secondary students in JC, ITE and Polytechnic, Polytechnic
students form the largest population of post-Secondary students. </p>

Members and I have raised the issue of making senior citizens' concession
available throughout the day in the House in the past. It was a
long-drawn appeal over many years until finally the PTC announced
so in the latest fare revision last August. And one week before
that in August 2010, then Minister for Transport mentioned in response
to some PQs on bus fares that the public transport operators had to make
the "business" decision on concessions. But given that the two bus
operators are listed commercial entities, I would be surprised that
any of them voluntarily offered to take in less revenue. Hence,
I was not surprised that it was the PTC which mandated it, but I
am now also confused exactly which is the body that has the authority
to do so. </p>

it is the MOT or LTA. It is the Government which should set the

like the Ministry to review the tiers of concession for students.
Sir, in the past, students go on to "A" levels after they turn 16,
before proceeding to University or Polytechnic.</p>

has said, 43% of each cohort goes directly to Polytechnic after
"O" levels, making it the most common next phase of education. Subsequently, about
15% of each Polytechnic cohort makes it to our local Universities;
but by 2015, this will be increased to 20%. If it includes those
who go on to private or overseas Universities, the proportion would
be even higher. So, Polytechnic education is not the same as before
when it was classified as tertiary or the final level of formal
education. It is now more akin to a post-Secondary education, especially
when the students are of the same age group as those in JC. Hence,
I would like the Minister to consider a review of the current tiers
of student fare concessions.</p>

in its recommendations in 2011, included extending the travel fare
concession for the elderly to the full day. This was also hard fought.
While this has proven popular, there are, of course, significant

issue, of course, is the continued rejection of concession to be

my interaction with many Polytechnic students has always revolved
around transport concessions whatever the topic we start off with.
The lack of parity with fellow students in pre-tertiary or post-Secondary
institutions has been a constant issue for many years. The explanation
that Polytechnic students are tertiary ones has been oft-quoted
and used. But, however, this perceived issue of semantics and administrative
pegging has hardly been palatable for many. As more and more of
our students aim
for Polytechnic education, their choice in education should not
become an inequitable one when it comes to transport fares. To compound
matters, the explanation of costs to the operators does not address
the parity issue. The recent estimate that it will cost $28 million
to grant concession to students is also hard to digest for many
of them. This is especially true in light of the 800 new buses and
the $1.1 billion package in the Budget for this year. </p>

of course, that the issue of concession will always be an emotive
and constant one. But a good transport system should be efficient,
inclusive and progressive. As such, I urge the Ministry to undertake
a review of the fare concession issue again, if not for this Budget,
then for one in the very near future. </p>

for review is now, especially with the Government investing $1.1
billion in the operations of new buses for the public transport

constituency in Changi/Simei. It is a small town of about six square
kilometres. The number of residential units is increasing, with
new public and private developments. Last year, we saw the completion
of a new DBSS development. We have two new private condominiums
in the pipeline to be completed by 2014. This will result in a 10%
increase in the number of residential units. In the vicinity, we
will also be having SUTD, the new university to be built by 2017.
This will put a further strain on the current infrastructure and
road capacity with the increasing population, especially during
peak hours. Despite proactively highlighting the concerns to relevant
agencies, there is still no immediate plan to increase road capacity
to handle the impending increase. While the Downtown Line (DTL)
project which is scheduled to complete in 2017 will help over the
next few years, our present road system will prove inadequate and cause
a lot of build-up and congestion which we are already seeing today.

like to cover is noise and the level of noise along the transportation

of noise, and residents in several estates, for example, Bishan,
Jurong, Eunos and Changi/Simei, have complained to SMRT of a noticeable

10 blocks, both private and public, as well as several landed properties

I would like to ask the Ministry what specific steps are being taken
to manage the increase in noise as well as to mitigate both in the
short term and the long term, and are these standards for the noise
limits really appropriate for the population density that we have,

                  </span>:
Sir, residents who stay near to MRT tracks have to put up with noise
of passing trains on a daily basis. In its report, LTA shared that
the train noise is within 80-85 decibels. This is like listening
to loud music in a room and, might I add, not even a song of their
own choice. In June last year, LTA announced that it would embark
on a noise measurement study to be completed by the second quarter
of this year. The study will span an entire length of elevated tracks
island-wide and cover more than 500 flats located near to these
elevated viaducts. The objective is to identify locations which
require special attention. Currently, LTA has installed low noise
barriers at the new viaduct and platform at Jurong East Station
to reduce the noise to the same level before the implementation
of Jurong East Modification Project. They will also pilot such barriers
along the open tracks at Bishan MRT Station. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db1a1810-66cc-4df3-a76c-3a59c68b9852">
                  <a name="budget__id-db1a1810-66cc-4df3-a76c-3a59c68b9852"><!--a--></a>May I suggest that LTA
speed up the noise measurement study and implement solutions to
reduce noise as soon as possible. Secondly, can LTA extend the study
to cover more areas? I have visited shops along Bishan MRT Station
and, indeed, the area can do with more noise barriers. Similarly,
I have visited many homes near Ang Mo Kio MRT Station and visited
the residents living near the station. They, too, face the same problems
as those in Bishan. Many a time, I struggle to hold a conversation
with them because of the passing train and we have to stop talking
for every three or four minutes or so. Can noise barriers be installed
earlier and in more areas to bring relief to residents who may have
been putting up with the high noise level for years?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, first, let me thank Members for their helpful comments, useful
feedback and thoughtful suggestion and, of course, their challenging questions.
Let me start, first of all, by providing an update on the 2008 Land
Transport Masterplan (LTMP) before I move on to deal with some of
the issues that they have raised. I will then outline some of our
key initiatives going forward. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5a4a4a01-3308-424f-aa4a-b48b410a2194">
                  <a name="budget__id-5a4a4a01-3308-424f-aa4a-b48b410a2194"><!--a--></a>2011 saw the completion
of two major rail projects that significantly enhanced the capacity
of our MRT network. We opened the last stretch of the Circle Line,
from Marymount to Harbourfront, in October 2011, and this brought
increased convenience and enhanced connectivity to many commuters.
Because it is an orbital line linking all the main lines, the Circle
Line helped to reduce crowding on existing lines, especially the city-bound
stretches in the morning. For instance, the morning peak loading
levels have decreased by about 5%-10% between Serangoon and Little
India, and about 3%-5% between Bishan and Novena. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2cda78db-daf6-4c74-a5fd-13a7a950e0ea">
                  <a name="budget__id-2cda78db-daf6-4c74-a5fd-13a7a950e0ea"><!--a--></a>The Circle Line also connects
a range of destinations that were previously not served by rail,
such as the NUH, the cluster of R&amp;D hubs at One-North, attractions
like Holland Village, the Botanic Gardens and Haw Par Villa. I hope
the convenience has persuaded some motorists to give public transport
a try, as this is all part of our intention to make public transport
a choice mode. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d898414e-cb2d-4e5b-98c6-6e8b4ca93141">
                  <a name="budget__id-d898414e-cb2d-4e5b-98c6-6e8b4ca93141"><!--a--></a>The other key infrastructural
project that we completed last year, a year ahead of schedule, was
the Jurong East Modification Project (JEMP). This unlocked a major infrastructural
bottleneck in our MRT network. Together with the additional 22 trains
that were delivered progressively from May 2011, we have been able
to inject more capacity along the North-South and East-West Lines,
with more than 800 weekly train trips added. In particular, the
congestion between Chua Chu Kang and Jurong East has seen meaningful
improvements. As a result, the public transport operators (PTOs)
have been able to add 1,300 weekly train trips in 2011 alone, and
another 116 trips so far this year. If we compare this to 2008 when
the LTMP started, the PTOs have increased capacity by about 30%
or a total of 2,900 weekly train trips. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8a78dca7-5cf8-4422-9e74-3453fe6a9adf">
                  <a name="budget__id-8a78dca7-5cf8-4422-9e74-3453fe6a9adf"><!--a--></a>From 19 March 2012, the
SBST will add 60 weekly train trips on the North-East Line between
6.45 and 7.30 in the morning. This will reduce current waiting time
significantly. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e294e361-e497-4388-9810-64f7c9b4b1cc">

Half-Height Platform Screen Doors (HHPSDs) on all elevated MRT stations
along the North-South and East-West Lines has enhanced the safety
of rail passengers and minimised train disruptions due to track
intrusions. I am happy to inform Members that this programme that
was debated quite extensively in past years is substantially completed
and only some outstanding works remain for Kranji Station, which
should finish by mid-March. </p>

that we are making to our rail system, let me dwell briefly on Mr
Cedric Foo's question on the update of the investigations into the
MRT disruptions. As Members of this House would be aware, the Committee
of Inquiry's (COI) public hearings will begin in April. They have
received, I think, 27 inputs from the public altogether. The investigations,
I understand, are still ongoing, and after it is completed, I am
sure that the Chairman will be able to give an update once the public hearings
have started. But let me give an update on the measures that have
been taken between LTA and the PTOs and the other improvements that
have been made thus far. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2197</p>

to improve the incident management processes, learning from the
shortcomings in December last year. They have made good progress.
Both operators have agreed to provide regular bus services free
of charge at designated points nearest to affected stations in the
event of an extended MRT service disruption. This means more choices
for commuters, as they can choose to resume their journeys expeditiously
using the regular bus services or wait for the free bus bridging services.
Plans are also underway to improve bus information provision at
MRT stations, and to install signages to guide commuters to the
designated bus bridging points.</p>

preparedness and training of personnel, LTA and SMRT recently carried
out a joint high level table-top exercise to further improve and coordinate
their plans to manage train service disruptions. This is the first
in a series of exercises that will progress to include ground deployment
exercises and to include more agencies in future. </p>

improvements, LTA has also issued to the PTOs a Code of Practice
(COP) on incident management during service disruptions. The COP
sets standards for compliance on key aspects of incident management,
including information management, crowd management, and incident
reporting by the PTOs to relevant authorities such as the SCDF and
police for timely support and coordination on recovery efforts. </p>

measures is to reduce discomfort and inconvenience to commuters
by ensuring faster information dissemination, timely recovery actions
and better coordination in the handling of train service disruptions.
We will also review other aspects of our current regulatory and
penalty framework with a view to strengthen this further, and will
take on board the COI's more holistic findings, where applicable. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-0460670c-d4d5-47ee-aa20-0bdaa403330e"><!--a--></a>Let me now update the
House on our medium-term plans to improve the rail network. The
North-East Line (NEL) will receive 18 more trains, instead of the
12 that were previously planned. These additional trains will cater
to future demand and increase the train fleet by about 70%. The
Circle Line (CCL) will also receive 16 more trains, increasing the
fleet by about 40%. The tenders were recently awarded and we expect
the trains to arrive from 2015. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b0556343-2822-4cc5-a023-7548ab05a16c">
                  <a name="budget__id-b0556343-2822-4cc5-a023-7548ab05a16c"><!--a--></a>For the North-South and
East-West Lines, we will bring in 13 more trains by 2014. In addition,
we have called for a tender to procure another 22 trains, of which
13 are for the Tuas West Extension due for completion in 2016. If
you take these additional trains coming into the North-South and
East-West Lines and add them to the 22 trains that were delivered
from May last year, it will increase the train fleet by more than
50% compared with what it was prior to May 2011. </p>

trains has to be synchronised with improvements to existing and
new infrastructure. For example, ongoing works to upgrade existing
depots to house these trains will be completed in 2014. In conjunction
with the Tuas West Extension, we are also building a much larger
depot by 2016 in Tuas to house the additional trains needed to enhance the
capacity of the North-South and East-West Lines.</p>

is the upgrade to the signalling system of the older lines. The contract
has been awarded and we expect completion for the North-South Line
by 2016, and the East-West Line by 2018. The upgrade will allow
trains to run at shorter intervals of 100 seconds during peak periods,
instead of 120 seconds today, a potential 20% increase in capacity
during peak hours. The LRT system will also benefit from more capacity
and trains. Last year, we announced the purchase of 13 train-cars
for the Bukit Panjang LRT, increasing the current fleet of 19 cars
by about 70%. These will arrive by around 2014 and will help ease
loading levels. </p>

LRT, we have completed an engineering study and confirmed that upgrading
the Sengkang-Punggol LRT from a one-car system to a two-car system
is technically feasible. This is a major upgrade. It involves changes
to the signalling, communications and power systems, as well as
depot works and modifications to the existing train-cars. The upgrade
will increase the capacity of the LRT during peak hours. We are
finalising the details for implementation, including the number
of additional train-cars that we will buy.</p>

to the existing rail network, we continue to expand the rail network
to bring connectivity to more parts of Singapore. Our next major
rail line is the Downtown Line. The first stage is from Bugis to
Chinatown, and that is scheduled for completion next year. The other
two stages, from Bukit Panjang to Bugis will be running by 2015,
and from Expo to Chinatown, by 2017. We also expect to open the
North-South Line Extension that will run to the Marina Pier in 2014,
and the Tuas West Extension in 2016, extending it beyond Joo Koon,
where it currently terminates today. Beyond 2017, the LTA will also
be building the Thomson Line and the Eastern Regional Line. When completed,
about 400,000 households will be within a 400-metre radius or about
a five-minute walk of a train station. </p>

gauge the receptivity of commuters to the improvement works as well
as their level of satisfaction and areas of dissatisfaction. SIM
University, commonly known as UniSIM, conducts an annual Public
Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey (PTCSS). The most recent
survey was done in October 2011, just after the fare adjustment
exercise, but prior to the December train disruptions. The picture
is mixed. Overall satisfaction with public transport services has
declined slightly from a year ago. The decline in satisfaction levels
for bus services is more significant. This is consistent with other
public feedback that satisfaction is lower compared to 2010. </p>

asked a direct question on whether public transport had improved
compared to 2010. I think this has some bearing, especially as Mr
Cedric Foo had raised this point, on whether fare hikes should precede
or come after service standards have improved. When asked a direct
question on whether public transport had improved compared to 2010,
68% of respondents felt that rail services had improved compared
to a year earlier, while 70% felt bus services had improved. This
suggests that whilst commuters were less satisfied with public transport
services compared to 2010, they did notice the public transport
improvements that had been introduced. I have talked about more
trips on the MRT earlier.</p>

to make small but targeted improvements under LTA's existing quarterly

persistent heavy ridership. </p>

Ministry last year, I spoke about the need for the Government to
partner the operators to significantly enhance bus capacity ahead
of the roll-out of new rail lines. On their own, the operators will
add capacity in tandem with ridership growth to meet the Quality
of Service standards mandated by the Public Transport Council. But
this would not be anywhere close to the level of capacity injection that
would significantly and decisively improve waiting time and congestion
levels from what they are today. </p>

Tharman Shanmugaratham has announced in his Budget Speech the decision
by Government to provide $1.1 billion worth of funding for a Bus Services
Enhancement Programme (BSEP) that will commence this year. Under
the BSEP, 550 buses will be funded with Government's assistance,
which together with the 250 buses from the operators to meet expected
ridership growth, will lead to a 20% increase in the public bus
fleet. The capacity injection will be front-loaded with about 70%
added within the first three years. This is a considerable undertaking.
When we checked back our records, we found that the PTOs took some
20 years to achieve a similar increase in fleet size. So, what we
are partnering the PTOs through this BSEP will translate into a
significant improvement in the quality of bus services over the
next five years. </p>

Government will help to progressively add, about 300 buses will go
towards reducing crowding and improving frequencies of existing
bus services, especially during the peak periods. The remaining
250 will be for new bus routes. The PTOs will be expected to deliver
higher service levels, beyond what the current Quality of Service
(QoS) standards require of them.</p>

required to reduce the loading levels for all basic bus services from
the current 95% to 85%. Commuters can expect about 10% more capacity
along the more crowded stretches of bus routes during peak hours.
With more buses injected to spread the load, bus frequencies will
also go up. Overall, this will mean shorter waiting times for commuters
during peak hours, a higher likelihood of getting onto the first arriving
bus and a more comfortable ride. </p>

have to improve the peak-hour frequencies of feeder bus services,
which play an important role in our integrated public transport
network. We will require 95% of all feeder services to operate within
10-minute scheduled intervals or better, up from the current 90%,
as you can see on the slides. The remaining 5% will operate within
15-minute scheduled intervals, tightened from the current 30 minutes.
In addition, we will require these to be sustained over two hours
during both the morning and the evening peak periods, up from today's
1-hour requirement. Hence, commuters can look forward to more frequent
feeder services. </p>

bus frequencies across the board during peak periods, not just for
feeders, but also for trunk routes. Today, 80% of all basic bus services,
trunks and feeders, already operate within 10-minute scheduled intervals. Going
forward, we will require the next 10% to operate within 12-minute
intervals, and the last remaining 10%, within 20-minute intervals.
These will be a significant improvement from the current 30-minute
requirement. </p>

the connectivity of the bus network over the next five years by
progressively adding around 40 new bus routes. For residents, these
bus routes will improve connectivity to major transport nodes and
to key community and commercial facilities in the neighbourhood.
One such example is a new route that will be introduced in the Telok
Blangah Heights region. Subject to further detailed routing studies
that LTA will have to complete, this new service will help improve
the local connection of this estate to Telok Blangah MRT Station. </p>

as the town continues to expand further with more developments coming
up further away from the MRT station. Residents staying in this hilly
region, and especially the elderly, can enjoy transfer and walk
time savings with the introduction of this new service. Like all
the other new routes that will be introduced under the programme,
LTA will engage community leaders to better understand the specific
needs of residents. </p>

to stretches of the existing rail network, will also be introduced
progressively from the third quarter of this year. We will have
to monitor the performance of these services closely and if necessary,
adjust them, as past experience has shown that commuters still prefer
the faster travel that trains offer, even when the trains are known
to be more crowded than buses. It will take some time for the new buses
to arrive, for supporting infrastructure like bus depots and bus
parks to be built and, more importantly, for the PTOs to aggressively
ramp up their recruitment of bus drivers.</p>

70% of these new buses in operation, there will be tangible and
significant improvements across the bus network. But let me caution
that finite resources mean that there will be many competing demands.
We will have to carefully assess and prioritise all the requests
that are made. And already, many Members are making requests. I
had a conversation with one of our MPs just a few days ago. We were about
to conclude our conversation, and for me to get back to the sanctuary
of the Chamber, when two other Members joined us. They were rather
disappointed that we were about to wrap up our discussion but the
first one very quickly added, "Whatever she wants, I also want."
The second one was no less direct but slightly more specific, "Whatever
she gets, better give me also." So, let me repeat my last line which
is that finite resources mean that the many competing demands will
still have to be carefully assessed and prioritised. But I hope
all Members will support this BSEP fully.</p>

aside about $1.1 billion to fund the purchase and running of the
550 buses for the next 10 years. This includes the salaries of new
bus drivers to drive the additional 550 buses, and all other running
costs that are associated with these buses, including fuel and maintenance.
Just to give some context to the $1.1 billion – the cost of a new
bus is about $500,000, while the daily operational cost of running
a bus is about $600,
or for 10 years for one bus, it is about, I think, roughly $2.2
million, based on the data that we get from the existing bus fleet
of 4,000.</p>

this $1.1 billion will end up unfairly benefiting the PTOs. It will
not be the case. Far-sighted and enlightened as our Minister for
Finance undoubtedly is, it took quite some effort to convince him.
He was not fully convinced until he was very sure that we had the
mechanism in place that the PTOs will not profit from the injection
of the buses and the funds. Our funding for the 550 buses will not result
in a profit for the operators. We will pay the operating costs of
these buses and will recover the revenue derived from operating
them. The $1.1 billion is a budgeted figure, and we will release
funds to the PTOs at a pace commensurate with their incurred expenditures
from running the programme. And in return, the PTOs will be required
to deliver the agreed service level improvements. The LTA will track
and monitor their performance, and work closely with them to ensure
that the resources provided translate into the intended outcomes
to benefit commuters. As an additional safeguard, the LTA will scrutinise
the PTOs' actual costs for the purchase and running of the buses, bearing
in mind that they still have to operate and run efficiently the
4,250 buses that they have to pay for themselves. And should their
costs turn out to be lower than expected, our Government funding
will be reduced correspondingly. So, one way or another, there is
no profit to be made from the funding that we will provide for these
550 buses under this enhancement programme.</p>

the bus companies would not be able to step up capacity and service
levels so quickly. The reality is that the finances of the bus industry have
been deteriorating in recent years and the PTOs' bus operations
have been running operating losses for some time already. From 2006
to 2011, public transport fares went up by a total of 0.3%. During
that same period, fuel prices went up by about 34%, while national
wages increased by about 26%. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam
said in his Budget Round-Up Speech, it would not be viable for the PTOs
to bear the additional costs of the 550 buses using their own financial
resources, unless fares were sharply increased by about 15 cents.
Therefore, the $1.1 billion that the Government is putting into
this programme is, in reality, a subsidy to benefit public transport
commuters so that they enjoy a higher level of service. It is not
a subsidy to the operators.</p>

continue to strive for productivity improvements since they remain
wholly responsible for managing the costs of their own bus fleet.
They will also need to receive reasonable fare adjustments granted
by the PTC to cope with underlying cost increases across their fleet. </p>

direct engagement of the incumbent bus operators to run this enhancement
programme goes against our intention to introduce greater contestability
into the industry. The short answer is no. Our longer-term intention,
as we have shared in the Land Transport Master Plan, is to inject
contestability into the bus industry and this remains unchanged.
What we have in mind is to eventually carve out meaningful packages
of bus routes, some of which will then be competitively tendered. The
intention of competitive bus route tendering is to allow the most
cost-efficient operator to win the rights to run these packages.
This is a natural check to ensure that cost efficiencies are maximised.
But this is a complex matter, and such a major change will take
time to prepare for and execute. It is critical to get the fundamentals
of such a change
right, and for the implementation to be as smooth as possible to
minimise disruption to commuters. We should not rush this, and we
will take the necessary time to study and get this right. </p>

for the BSEP is to ramp up bus capacity significantly and quickly
in the next few years for the benefit of commuters. The most expeditious
way is to add capacity using the current framework. We are mindful
to do this in a way that does not impede us in our longer-term plans.
We also do not preclude the possibility of engaging other operators
to run selected aspects of the BSEP on a limited scale. </p>

to help the PTOs roll out these improvements expeditiously? Mr Seng
Han Thong made a very interesting intervention and has correctly
pointed out that the shortage of drivers is a key factor. We will
consider, of course, Kym Ng or Rui En or one of the other actresses
to perhaps help us out in this effort as well since the previous
effort was so successful. Now, wages for the public bus drivers,
although last raised in 2010, are something that is a challenge
for the PTOs to do more, against the backdrop of the worsening bus
industry financials that I have just mentioned earlier. Many have
commented that bus drivers' wages will have to rise significantly,
and for the profession to be made more attractive, for the BSEP
to succeed. And that is right. I understand that the PTOs are already
looking into this, as they have to prepare themselves to roll out
this programme expeditiously. How the PTOs structure these salary
increases, and what else they need to do to improve the overall
terms of employment to attract sufficient numbers of new bus drivers
and to also retain their existing drivers, these are internal company
matters that I ought to leave to the operators to deal with. It
is also a dynamic situation because the operators have to grapple
with other industries that similarly have to target locals in the
face of a reduction in the intake of foreign labour. But they know
this is a top priority for them and they are working hard on this.</p>

play an important public transport role. Over time, we have made
structural improvements and refinements to better support public
bus financing. We extended the lifespan of public buses, and waived
the need for COE and the 5% Additional Registration Fee (ARF). Such
measures help the bus operators cope with the significant disparity
between rising fuel and wage costs and the fare increases that I
mentioned earlier.</p>

a marked difference between the support that is given to the bus
and rail sectors. For instance, the Government funds the development
and land costs for rail depots, and grants rail operators the right
to generate and retain non-fare revenue such as advertising revenue
in their MRT stations. Such support is comparatively lacking in
the bus sector. </p>

with what is done for the rail industry, the Government will bear
the development and land costs for bus depots and bus parking infrastructure,
and lease these to bus operators at a nominal fee. This will also
lower the entry barriers for new operators when contestability in
the bus industry is introduced, as bus parking and depots are key
infrastructure for running bus services. We will also allow operators
to retain a portion of the advertising revenue from bus shelters,
which today is retained by the Government. This will provide the
operators some help to cope with rising costs in the future. Nevertheless,
these assistance measures that the Government can give to the PTOs,
while helpful, cannot fully insulate them from the rising cost pressures
that they face, and it will still be necessary for them to continue
to be productive
and cost-efficient, and for a sustainable system of fare adjustments
to be implemented, which I will dwell on a little bit later in my
remarks. </p>

hope that the improvement of bus service levels through the BSEP

to look out for opportunities to introduce more bus priority schemes

gone down, and indeed that is true, although we also note that for
the buses that are operating in bus lanes, including the full-day
lanes, there has been a 7% improvement in speeds after the 2008
measures were made. And we also have to do more to make sure that
the Mandatory Give Way to Buses Scheme is taken seriously by all
commuters, especially those who are driving cars and commercial
vehicles. Putting in more buses in place of cars on our roads is necessary
in a compact urban environment like Singapore's, because buses ultimately are
a more efficient use of available road space.</p>

it was improved to 7.45 am, and 30-cent discount. Early data suggest
some positive effect in commuter behavioural change, but I think
it is necessary to give ourselves another few months to be sure

an innovative trial by the National University of Singapore (NUS)
and Stanford University to encourage off-peak travel on the rail
network in Singapore. The trial uses a credit-based system and awards
extra credits to commuters for travel during the shoulder peak.
Since its launch in January this year, about 7,000 commuters have
registered for the trial. Some commuters participating in the scheme have
found the use of incentives appealing. And to quote one of them:
"I am glad that there are initiatives to study commuters' travelling
patterns to work out something that would help to ease crowding
and create a more pleasant travelling experience for the many commuters
like myself." Others find that the incentives and the rewards are something
that we look forward to.</p>

also taken up the LTA's invitation to suggest other ways to encourage
commuters to avoid the most crowded commuting times. Some have expressed that they
would like to travel earlier or later but are constrained by the existing
practices or working hours of their organisations. This is a valid
point. The Ministry of Manpower has been encouraging employers to
put in place flexible working arrangements for their employees,
including giving them a choice of staggered working hours. This
can enhance work-life harmony and balance for employees, and help
ease the strain on our transport system. However, a recent survey
showed that less than one in 10 establishments offered such flexible
working arrangements to their employees. Mr Ang Wei Neng also touched
on this point and he would be pleased to know that Ministers of
State Mrs Josephine Teo and BG Tan Chuan-Jin will co-chair an Inter-ministerial
Workgroup to look into how to further enhance the prevalence of
such flexible working arrangements. The Workgroup will be engaging
stakeholders in both public and private sectors.</p>

works for the pilot programme at the six MRT stations will commence

and our system gets older, railway noise levels have increased.
The residents living close to MRT viaducts are most affected, understandably so.
Mr Ang Hin Kee, Ms Jessica Tan and others on previous occasions
have asked how we intend to address this. Railway noise is a complex
issue. It is often site-specific. Depending on the proximity to
elevated train viaducts, residents are indeed affected to varying
degrees. There are also areas where railway noise is louder, particularly
where train tracks merge or diverge. </p>

will be underground systems, and this limits the extent of railway
noise. Our focus, therefore, is how to address the more problematic
areas along existing elevated rail lines. Today, the NEA's guidelines
state that railway noise levels should not be more than 67 decibels
sustained over a one-hour period. However, passing train noise can
be higher, particularly at locations where the ambient noise levels
are already close to 67 decibels. </p>

that we are taking now to mitigate rail noise, the LTA currently
requires the SMRT to regularly check and maintain the trains and
tracks according to a comprehensive maintenance programme. For example,
the train wheels are re-profiled and tracks are ground frequently
to remove defects that may result in noise. This also contributes
to the complaints about works that are being done in the middle
of the night because this is the only time that we are able to do
such works after the close of running hours. The LTA is working
with SMRT to tighten the maintenance regime further so as to reduce
noise levels caused by uneven wheels and tracks during the running of the
trains. But, again, let me caution that this will also mean more
works that need to be done in the middle of the night. </p>

the benefits of noise barriers at two specific locations. One is
at the new viaduct at Jurong East Station where certain stretches
come as close as 15 metres to HDB flats. Those noise barriers that
we introduced helped reduce noise by about 5 decibels, to keep levels
at around the same as before the implementation of the Jurong East

Bishan MRT. The noise levels there tend to be higher because of what
is known as the "trumpet effect" of the portal, which amplifies
noise when the train emerges from a tunnel to an elevated track.
The implementation of the noise barriers at this location is targeted
to be completed by around the middle of this year.</p>

further trials at three other locations to assess the effectiveness
as well as the cost of noise barriers at locations that have elevated
noise levels and distinct viaduct designs. These trials, together
with the results of the noise measurement study that I talked about
earlier will help LTA develop a cost-effective implementation plan
to mitigate railway noise at different locations. We target to share the

the benefits of Distance Fares that we have introduced so far. It
is not meaningful to do an analysis of the fare savings benefit
beyond October 2011 due to the fare adjustment in that year, so
I will use data prior to this period. Data from August 2011 showed
that the number of commuters who benefited from Distance Fares continued
to increase more than a year after its implementation. 72% of all
commuters saw weekly fare savings, and this is higher than the 63%
that we originally projected in 2009. The savings that they enjoy
amount to an average of 67 cents weekly against what we projected
at 48 cents.</p>

the Ministry, I said that I was most sympathetic to the senior citizens
and their desire for full-day concessions. So, I thank the PTC and
the operators for giving due consideration to this hint when they
extended senior citizen concession hours as part of the 2011 Fare
Revision Exercise. I am still reminded by my senior residents today who
have benefitted from this tremendously, especially for those who need
to commute in the morning hours by public transport to go to work. </p>

have been granted their full-day concessions, the next groups that
I am sympathetic to are the disabled and the Polytechnic students.
And I think for the Public Assistance recipients, many of them actually
already come under the category of senior citizens and for others,
we have other measures to target our help to them, especially through
the public transport vouchers. So, the two groups that I am most
sympathetic to are the disabled and the Polytechnic students. But,
again, I urge Members to be patient as not all of these requests
can be addressed immediately or entirely within a single Fare Revision
Exercise. </p>

a very useful specific question on the role of the PTC. PTC is now
the authority to require the PTOs to give concessions in situations
when there is a fare adjustment. The PTC can do so by requiring
the operators to comply with the condition for concession before
they are granted the fare increase. This was done for senior citizens
in last year's fare adjustment. However, PTC obviously needs to
also bear in mind the impact on fares, especially adult fares, which
are cross-subsidising the revenue loss from the concessionary fares.
For this reason, the PTC, while sympathetic to all these requests
for concessions cannot accede to all of them immediately or entirely within
a single fare adjustment exercise. But I know that when future fare
revisions take place, the PTC, which is acutely aware of the different
requests for concessions, will work with the operators to give careful
consideration to all these appeals. Such concessions will not be
given out in 2012. I shook my head when many Members made their
appeals, as concessions will not be given out in 2012 because there
will be no fare increase and no fare revision exercise this year. </p>

is due for review this year for implementation in 2013. I intend
to appoint PTC member, Mr Richard Magnus, to head the Committee
for the review. He has just joined the PTC recently, and Mr Magnus
will bring a new pair of eyes and a fresh mind to the task. His
Review Committee will seek views widely, study the possible options

we should not rush to implement this year's fare adjustment, even
though we recognise that the operators are facing significant cost pressures,
especially on the bus side. Hence, I discussed this matter with
PTC Chairman, Mr Gerard Ee, and he has agreed to my suggestion that
we suspend this year's fare adjustment exercise. Instead, the new
fare formula, which will be ready in 2013, could take into consideration
the fact that fare adjustments were not made in 2012. So, no fare revisions,
no increases this year and we will also await further future revisions
in order for the concessions to be considered in due course.</p>

on fares inevitably leads to a discussion on whether our current
model for public transport continues to be relevant. Some have argued
that since Government is injecting $1.1 billion into commercially-run
entities to run the BSEP over the next 10 years, why not simply
nationalise public transport services instead? Actually, such thinking mixes up two somewhat
different issues. One is the amount of subsidy that the Government
should be putting into the public transport system. And the other
is whether the operators should be state-owned non-profit entities
or commercially-oriented companies. I think I have dealt with the
first issue earlier. I will now touch briefly on the second, on
whether the operators should be state-owned non-profit entities
of commercially-oriented companies.</p>

the operations of trains and buses to commercial entities, as we
believe the long-term public interest is best served this way. The
profit incentive drives the operators towards higher efficiency
and productivity, which keeps costs as low as possible. These productivity
gains and cost savings are then passed on to commuters in the form
of lower fare increases, as we have seen in our system. Otherwise,
if the system is inefficiently-run, the public will ultimately pay
for the higher operating costs, either through higher fares, or
greater Government subsidies. </p>

examples around the world, we find that, in general, the most efficiently-run
public transport services are provided by commercially-driven entities,
such as the MTR in Hong Kong. And, increasingly, cities like Melbourne
have also privatised their public transport industry to improve
efficiency and productivity. The advantage of privatisation is actually
well documented in the experience of London Buses. Let me share
this with Members. London Buses was privatised in 1985. Between 1985
and 1996, the price per vehicle kilometre dropped 45%, while costs
per passenger trip fell by nearly a third. This is even as ridership
and reliability of the system both increased. Private contracting
led to lower costs and about 10 years on from when the bus reforms
were first introduced in 1985, London saw a 70% decrease in subsidies. </p>

entities to run operations, it is important for Government to take
control in key areas – to plan for rail lines and bus routes, to
ensure a firm regulatory mechanism for fares, to specify service
levels for rail and bus service, and to decide on timely capacity
injection to meet ridership growth. We amended the Road Traffic
Act in 2010, passed it in Parliament, to implement a new rail financing
framework. Previously, the Government undertook the planning and
development of our rail network, while the operator owned and operated
rail operating assets. One of the key features of the new rail framework
is that the Government will take over the ownership of operating
assets and make the decisions on the timing of asset procurement
and capacity enhancement. This enables us to ensure that sufficient
capacity is brought in to meet projected ridership growth in a timely
fashion. The new financing framework also facilitates greater contestability
within the rail sector, spurring the operators to deliver better
service levels. </p>

structure is a major undertaking. The new rail model is more complicated,
and we have not rushed to implement this across the network. We
took the first step last year with the appointment of SBST as the
new operator for the Downtown Line which is the first of the lines
to be placed under the new rail model. For the existing lines, we
will explore the transition to the new financing framework, together
with the operators, subject to mutual agreement. Given that they
are public-listed companies, we are mindful that such decisions
would need to be carefully considered.</p>

introduce contestability, which will be a key element of the evolving

that supports an efficient, well-integrated, commuter-centric bus-rail

                  </span>:
Thank you, Sir. My first cut covers taxis. The taxi sector is a
de-regulated market, and the taxi operators are free to set their
own fares. However, we cannot ignore the fact that ComfortDelGro
has a big share of the taxi market, with over 50% of the market
share, and also its most recent decision to increase fares was quickly
followed by all the other taxi companies, albeit with minor differences.
Given that the taxi market is not regulated, it is important that
the sector is freely-competed and efficient. Fares should indeed
be subject to free market forces. I would like to ask the Minister
if he felt that the market efficiency of the taxi sector is free
and open and whether or not there are other measures we can introduce
to make for a freer and more efficient taxi sector. </p>

if the Minister can give us an update on the outcomes of the recent
fare hikes? How has quality of service and taxi drivers' income
improved? And have the various surcharges that were introduced brought
about the desired effects of inducing more supply to the market,
especially during the peak periods?</p>

to have taxi-sharing scheme in Singapore. This obviously has the advantage
of higher asset utilisation and also for passengers individually
when they share a cab, paying less for the journey than they would
otherwise if they were to use a dedicated taxi. Would the Minister
consider re-introducing such a scheme perhaps, with two queuing
lanes – one for those commuters who are prepared to share taxis,
and another for those who want dedicated taxis? </p>

disabled commuters. During the Budget debate this year, the Finance
Minister talked about the possibility of transport vouchers for
disabled commuters. I would like to ask the Minister, if indeed
such proposals are being considered and also to share with us the
statistics regarding the usage of public transport, whether by bus,
trains or taxis, by disabled Singaporeans. How does he see as being
the best way to help disabled commuters get around in Singapore,
whether it is dedicated
system like taxis or the public system like buses and trains? The
transport vouchers would be especially important for disabled Singaporeans
who need to use taxis to commute to and from hospitals. </p>

of the taxi industry, we have seen the number of taxis increasing
steadily over the years to more than 27,000 taxis today. This means
that Singapore has about 5.2 taxis for every 1,000 residents which
is one of the highest number of taxis per capita among the major
cities around the world. From my understanding, the figure for Sydney
is 1.4, New York is 1.6, Shanghai is 2.1 and London is 2.6, which
is half of the number of Singapore in terms of taxis per capita.
Nonetheless, many Singaporeans still complain that we have insufficient

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, I appeal to the Ministry to reconsider its current position
on taxis as private transportation. Taxis are necessary for passengers with
mobility issues due to their health conditions or age. The disabled,
the sick, pregnant women and the elderly will rely on taxis to get
to their destinations or to "spring" to their destination. In fact,
we should make taxi services so affordable that Singaporean car
owners are motivated to sell their cars to rid themselves of the
costs and trouble of keeping and maintaining them. Most people who
are sick should be able to take a taxi and limit the spread of germs.
Remember how we had to track down a number of cases of SARS through
their taxi journeys in 2003? Imagine if they had taken the MRT or
buses instead! In addition, there are always the occasions of personal
and family emergencies where taxi services are indispensable. Without
a doubt, taxis are an important component in our public transport
system, providing an essential service to the public which buses
and the MRT cannot. If taxi drivers are properly trained and monitored,
as a group, they can help improve our driving culture and road safety,
goals which are difficult to achieve with individual drivers. Would
the Ministry please consider increasing the number of taxi services
while reducing the number of private cars correspondingly, and update
us on the measure to improve the frequency and service levels of
taxis? </p>

                  </span>: Yes,
Sir. First, utilisation of taxi vehicles. Mr Chairman, the taxi industry
was liberalised in 2004. And since then, the number of registered
taxis on the road has increased from about 20,000 plus to the current
27,000. So, over the last eight years,
we have seen the increase of about 7,000 taxis on the road. It is
estimated that about 30% of the 27,000 taxis are operating on one-man
operation (OMO). This means that the current fleet of taxis is under-utilised
to serve the commuting needs of the public. So, we should review
the statutory obligation of the taxi companies; shift the focus
from hiring out their taxis to one that they need to ensure full
utilisation of every taxi they hire out. </p>

statutory obligation of taxi companies, I urge the Government to
provide strong incentives to help taxi companies have the necessary capability
to monitor who are driving their taxis and how their fleet of taxis
are utilised. We should have a comprehensive system to match reliable
relief taxi drivers to their principal hirers. This way, I believe,
most one-man operated (OMO) taxis hirers would welcome it as they
would find it easier to find suitable relief drivers to lighten
the burden of their daily operating cost. More fully utilised taxis
would also mean that the supply of taxi service would be higher
throughout the day to fulfil the demand for taxi service, without
the need to put more taxis on the roads. By making taxi companies
more productive in supplying taxi service, it would benefit both
the taxi drivers and the public commuters.</p>

for Euro V cars. Sir, the Government has reduced the annual special
tax paid by the private diesel car owners. The message to the private
car owners is clear: please convert to use Euro V compliant diesel
car. If the policy objective is to reduce carbon emission by diesel
powered cars, the Government should send the same message to the
heavy users of diesel powered cars, that is, taxi companies. The
same special tax incentive should apply to Euro V compliant cars
which are registered as taxis. This would make our taxis greener
and, most importantly, also lower the annual operating cost of taxi
drivers who are paying for all the taxes imposed on taxis through their
daily taxi rentals. In short, taxi should also enjoy the 70% reduction
in the special tax. This will reduce the operating cost of taxi
drivers as higher tax means higher rental to them.</p>

transport system, in particular, buses with less travelling frequency
due to lower ridership on Saturday, it is timely for LTA to consider
relaxing the CBD rules on Saturday to allow taxi to pick up its

or otherwise known as the "Super Seniors", as coined by Dr Chia,

are plans to gear up the public transport sector to move in tandem
with the developments of the healthcare sector. This is to ensure
that our transport system is ready to provide the necessary support
for transporting our elderly to medical facilities for their medical
consultations. While I understand that, currently, there are already
taxi companies providing dedicated transportation services to those
who have mobility issues, I think the Government could consider
going a step further to equipping more taxi drivers with the necessary
incentives, knowledge and skills in assisting the transportation
of elderly or persons with mobility issues, especially those who
are wheelchair-bound. </p>

a status symbol but as a utility to help them cope with their busy
schedules and multiple responsibilities. There have been concerns
expressed by Singaporeans in newspapers and online that the inclusion
of taxis in COE Category A could have an effect of pushing up the
quota premiums for this category. This is because the private car owners
have to compete with taxi companies for a limited number of COEs.
In addition, buyers of these smaller cars are often less well-off
than large car buyers. The Ministry of Transport has said previously
that taxi's bid for COEs in Category A in recognition of the fact
that they are a part of the public transport spectrum albeit at
the higher end. Could the Minister explain why taxis are in Category
A which is for smaller cars and not Category B which is for larger
cars even though many taxis, like the Hyundai Sonata, in fact, have
engines larger than 1,600 cc. </p>

378,706 private cars distributed among 35% of local households.
By 2008, the vehicle population had risen by 26% to 476,634, but
the proportion of households which own cars only grew by about 3%.
Does this suggest that the private car population is becoming more
concentrated in a certain segment of the population? Could the Ministry
look into ways to adjust the way the COEs are allocated so that
families with children are not competing directly with individuals
and companies who are able to afford to place higher bids for their
COEs? </p>

Mr Chairman, I am just elaborating on Mr Seng's preceding question.
The plans to replace the Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR) Scheme with
the new Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) is aimed at promoting
what has been touted as cleaner new diesel technologies.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-32777627-9f05-409c-a559-8b708f51c69e">

Tax for diesel vehicles that comply with Euro V emissions standards
by 70% with effect from January 2013 is also aimed at promoting
the use of new diesel technologies that are considered cleaner in
a carbon sense.</p>

laudable, but it bears noting that focusing on carbon emissions,
and the diesel vehicles that help to lower such emissions, is only
part of the overall equation when it comes to safeguarding the quality
of our air. Simply narrowing the focus to carbon emissions neglects
other pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. </p>

that an increase in the percentage of Euro V diesel-powered cars
in passenger cars, in particular, will result in reductions in carbon
emissions, but also increases in particulates, nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbon emissions. Particulates have become a matter of concern
across many Asian cities. In Beijing and Hong Kong, for example,
there has been sharp debates surrounding PM2.5 – which is fine particles that
are 2.5 micrometres in diameter – especially since both cities have
been choking in smog in recent years. PM2.5 is considered more hazardous
as these finer particles can penetrate the lungs and other organs
more deeply when inhaled.</p>

been calls for the National Environment Agency to provide more timely
data on PM2.5 levels. And even though we have been monitoring PM2.5 levels
since 1998, our Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) currently still
cites PM10 levels – which are larger particles 10 micrometres across
– on a more regular basis. It is heartening to hear the Minister
for the Environment and Water Resources said yesterday that more
data on PM2.5 would be made available for the public on a regular
basis.</p>

the World Health Organization's aspirational guideline of 10 micrograms

lie in phasing out diesels completely, of course. Diesels work best
in large and heavy vehicles as well as for higher speeds and longer
distances, such as buses – which we will soon see more of on Singapore
roads. What is needed is the right balance between diesels, petrol
and hybrid vehicles that will result in reductions in both carbon
and other emissions. And a pollution surcharge on diesel passenger
vehicle based on annual fuel usage could keep in check any substantial
increase in their numbers. Exceptions could be given to commercial
heavy vehicles most suited for diesel.</p>

Sir, it is quite common in private estates for households to have
multiple cars, especially where adult children continue to live
with their parents. In certain housing estates, roads are marked
to disallow roadside parking. This could be the case where the roads
are close to HDB estates or where the roads may be used by larger
vehicles for access to deliver services. However, such markings
pose daily problems for families where their home compound does
not cater for any car parking or is insufficient to cater for the
number of cars owned by the household. These residents have been
issued summonses by LTA for parking outside their homes.</p>

attitude of LTA in trying to solve specific issues concerning residents
parking in my constituency. In one instance, LTA studied the situation
with an open mind and agreed to change road markings to allow parking
on one side of the road. However, I believe this issue of residents
being summoned is not uncommon in other estates as well. Is LTA
looking at a more systematic solution to the problem, for instance,
could certain roads be designated for residents' parking only? </p>

Sir, whenever there is a popular eating outlet located along a main

This is very dangerous because pedestrians trying to cross the road
and motorists trying to exit from side roads find their view of
sight blocked by the illegally parked cars. An example of this would
be along Tanjong Katong Road where there are many popular eating
outlets. Some of these car owners would even park illegally along

Sir, I do understand that ERP is necessary to manage our road traffic
demands, especially during peak hours on weekdays. However, if you
have driven along Collyer Quay towards Esplanade Drive on Saturday
afternoons, you cannot help but feel puzzled as to why ERP gantries
are in operation there. There are clearly very few road users there

fact, it does feel like the roads are being under-utilised. And
the situation is the same in some locations like Nicoll Highway

strategies on Saturday. Perhaps, we can switch off some of these

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, in November last year, the question of weekend Electronic
Road Pricing (ERP) charges in the Central Business District (CBD)
and shopping districts was raised. Indeed, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr
Lim Biow Chuan and myself, we called attention to this issue. The
Ministry's reply then was that they would look into it, adding that
this is unlikely to be well received by businesses.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-34c05828-6295-4a37-8ab8-9f472ebfd6b4">
                  <a name="budget__id-34c05828-6295-4a37-8ab8-9f472ebfd6b4"><!--a--></a>Since then, I have engaged
three associations for their feedback. The three associations are
Singapore Retailers Association, Orchard Road Business Association and Marina Bay Business
Association. They all did their respective survey amongst their members
and with stakeholders. The results: a resounding "yes" to remove
ERP charges on Saturday – a view, I must say, shared by a very,
very significant majority. </p>

days and there are clearly no office crowds then, so implementing
ERP on these days certainly, as what Mr Liang had said, seem puzzling. From
the surveys, the most common reason cited for the removal is that
this would encourage more shoppers into the precinct and benefit
the retailers – not a cost to the business, the businesses love
it. So, it is a win-win situation. As one of them told me, and I
quote, "any great shopping street in the world is crowded. Crowds
attract crowd. This kind of congestion and crowd is a positive problem
as opposed to the negative image of ERP." </p>

congestion might be there, and we are not sure to what extent is
that worry valid. So, I propose – as what Mr Liang too, earlier
– that a pilot trial be conducted to switch off the ERP on Saturdays
in these districts and monitor the situation. I am quietly, in fact,
I am pretty confident that this switching off can be a permanent
one. It can be a win-win-win not just for businesses, but for motorists
and shoppers alike. I hope the Minister will consider this.</p>

Mr Chairman, Sir, cycling is fast gaining popularity in Singapore.
I am sure the ERP has nothing to do with that. More cycling paths
and facilities are being built, cycling groups are growing in number
and mass cycling events are attracting thousands of participants.
Sir, I am heartened that many more Singaporeans are taking up cycling
as a sport, as a leisure activity or as a mode of daily transport.
Cycling has many benefits and regular cycling will significantly reduce
the risk of cardiovascular diseases. I am glad that the Government
is investing in resources to promote cycling. However, I feel that
there may be some gaps.</p>

with the issue of cycling as a form of commuting. Our roads are getting
more congested as it has been recently described, and as we grow
our population at some point in the future we will have to stop
increasing the number of cars. The growth in our population cannot
be matched by a similar growth in the number of cars. It is unfeasible
for reasons of space, congestion and the effects on the environment.
The Government has correctly identified a need to encourage more people
to move towards public transport. Yet, there remains a need for
personal transport, and an increasing number of people are turning
to cycling to fill this gap. Sometimes to get exercise along with
their commute, sometimes to take advantage of the flexibility it
provides, and sometimes for the sheer enjoyment of it. Cycling is personal
transport, there is an emotive component. Can we look ahead 20 or
25 years and see that an increase in cycling infrastructure now
will not only respond to a current need, as it will also frame the
mindset and expectations of our society for the next generation?</p>

initiative as it provides residents with connections to different
parks and leisure activities in Singapore. But could the network be
used to address a need for utilitarian personal transport? I realise,
of course, that the Park Connector network is under NParks, which
is under MND, and so MOT would have some difficulty at looking at
the routes to consider the obstacles to them becoming part of an
alternative cycle commuting network which, conveniently, brings
me to my next point. </p>

a number of Ministries and bodies none of whom see it as their priority.
LTA, and hence MOT, looks at cycling on the roads. NParks, and hence MND,
looks at the Park Connectors. SPF, and hence MHA, are responsible
for the safety and enforcement issues. Sport cycling, presumably,
SSC and hence MCYS and then, in terms of planning, URA, HDB and
the Town Councils for integrating cycling with other amenities,
facilities and access points. For the integration with public transport,
again LTA gets involved together with the PTOs. Nobody wants to
completely own and deal with cycling. Suggestions for improving
cycling infrastructure are usually met with a response indicating
which other Ministry really should get involved. Whose KPI is it? Whatever
the arguments of the merits of cycling, an increasing number of
people are actively engaging in cycle commuting, and this sector
is not adequately overseen.</p>

that we have a regulatory authority to oversee and advocate for
cycling as a commuter modality, one with heft and weight. One that
can take matters across Ministries and statutory boards to solve
problems for the benefit of all, because poorly designed cycling
infrastructure affects pedestrians and drivers as much as cyclists,
because people will continue to cycle, and increasingly so.</p>

amongst many that in Singapore it is too hot and too humid to cycle,
especially over more than a very short distance to the nearest MRT station.
This is clearly wrong. If you go down to Kallang, Geylang or Redhill,
you will see many of the "uncles" in their long pants and t-shirts
cycling with ease. If you look at the foreign workers, they do not
require high-tech lycra shorts and expensive cycle shoes, and yet
they manage to commute quite effectively, rarely even breaking into
a sweat. If you look at the number of cyclists in our neighbouring
cities around South East Asia, cities that share our weather conditions
are full of cyclists. Just look at the cyclists on our roads. It
is all a matter of expectation and conditioning.</p>

is a viable modality of personal transport that will become increasingly
important as car ownership becomes less accessible, I would like
to ask the Minister whether he will consider subsidising or supporting
bike sharing programmes? The argument to wait for a critical mass
of cyclists first does not quite bear weight because cities like
Barcelona and London saw an increase in the number of trips made by
bicycle after the introduction of bike sharing programmes. The introduction
of a bike sharing programme can work to offload some of the pressure
that our public transport system is under.</p>

for cycle lanes to be established to improve the on-road safety of
cyclists. In discussing this, we first have to understand that cyclists
are required to ride on the road as they are banned from pavements,
except in certain cycling towns. One argument against bicycle lanes
is that we are land-scarce. It is hard to understand how London
and the Island of Manhattan, two of the most dense and congested
cities in the world can effectively implement bicycle lanes to good
effect, but we cannot. However, in lieu of bicycle lanes I have
an alternative suggestion.</p>

cars overtaking a bicycle do so with a 1.5-metre clearance to the
right of the bicycle, assuming that the cyclist is in the left-most lane
which is where he should be. Judging this 1.5-metre clearance can
be difficult. Why do we not make it easy for drivers to comply with
the existing law by painting a line down the left-most lane, 1.7
metres in from the kerb? This is cheap, uses no extra land, does
not require any new legislation and, most importantly, does not
affect the flow of traffic, as there are already cyclists in that
lane and the cars currently already need to overtake them. We would
simply be making it easy for all concerned to do the right thing and
obey the law.</p>

of this suggestion to me is that it emphasises that the road, just like
our island, is a shared space, and we all need to share it graciously.
Cyclists, just like drivers, need to follow the Highway Code. In
closing, Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister if he would
consider increasing awareness and the requirements for cycle helmets
to improve safety of cyclists.</p>

over the ability of our roads to cope with the increased travel
demand posed by a growing population, especially around the Changi-Simei
area. We are aware of the need to improve and expand our road infrastructure,
even as we continue to promote the use of public transport. This
is because roads cater to many users – private cars, taxis, buses
and commercial vehicles as well as motorcycles and yes, bicycles,
too! We will carry out improvements judiciously so as to balance
between the need to maintain an efficient road system, shorten travel
times and relief from traffic jams, and the desire to preserve our
living environment. Balancing all these different factors together.
We will also continue to leverage on technology to optimise traffic flows.
Specifically on the Changi-Simei area, I believe LTA has been in
touch with Ms Jessica Tan last November to share some of their plans,
not all of which will be implemented immediately, but together with
the construction of Downtown Line 3. Plans like new roads, expansion
of existing roads, and so on.</p>

several points raised by Mr Gerald Giam. He proposed to restructure
the COE bidding system such that Singaporeans with families will
have a better chance to secure COEs and also to consider whether
taxis should bid in Category B rather than Category A. Let me deal
with the latter issue first.</p>

really a concession. If we were to have taxis bid in Category B
– which is entirely possible – the fact is that because of the higher
COEs, the rentals for taxis will also go up, and how that impacts
the taxi drivers who are renting taxis will also have to be carefully
considered. So, it is, indeed, a concession that has been given
in order that the rentals can be kept low. </p>

of COEs – it is basically done using an open bidding mechanism.
Any potential car buyer is able to participate freely to bid for
the right to register a vehicle – less so to deal with any social
policies, but an instrument to control ownership and the growth
of the car population. So, the proposal to shift it in favour of families
may indeed sound attractive, but the implementation is actually
not a straightforward matter. We know that people, different families
have different needs. The issue of who is deserving of a COE is
inherently a subjective one.</p>

with aged parents may regard a car as a necessity to ferry his aged
parents to their medical appointments. But is he more deserving
than a young family with a newborn? Or with two children, or with
three young children? How about single-parent families? How about
individuals not yet married living together with their families
as increasingly more of them do so because they are marrying later?
It would be quite onerous to further burden the COE system with
deciding who is more deserving or which family is more deserving.
Our key thrust is to continuously improve our public transport system
so that more people, with families or otherwise, will consider it
a choice option. This is the more sustainable option in the longer
run. </p>

our public transport system, no matter how efficient, can never

Eng Hwa, Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Lim Biow Chuan has asked for the
removal of ERP on Saturdays, especially on certain roads leading
to the CBD where traffic may be more smooth-flowing. Overall, ERP
has been a useful tool in managing traffic congestion. We are, however,
prepared to fine-tune the system where there is room to do so. Members
may recall that LTA announced several such adjustments in late 2011.
These include the shortening of the evening ERP operating hours
of the gantries along the northbound CTE and southbound Singapore
River Line. The Nicoll Highway gantry, which forms part of the Bugis-Marina
Centre cordon, will also be relocated later this year. Thereafter,
motorists will be able to access the East Coast Parkway and route
back to Shenton Way if they wish without paying ERP charges on Saturdays,
while those who enter the Bugis-Marina Centre cordon will continue
to pay ERP. </p>

patterns is a key factor in making any adjustments. In the case
of the CTE, we observed heavier traffic flow after 8 pm, which is
the new ERP cut-off time. Fortunately, the recent widening of the
CTE has helped to moderate the impact of increased traffic on travel
speeds. However, there is very limited scope to widen roads in the
city centre. Any surge in traffic volumes would significantly impact
travel speeds. This is why we have adopted the cordon concept for
the CBD area, as there is only so much traffic that we can tolerate
within the CBD if we want to keep it relatively free of congestion.
This applies also to Saturdays and let me explain why. Leaving one
road leading to the cordon that we are interested in unpriced would
simply lead to a surge in traffic entering the cordoned area and
creating congestion within, for example, the Bugis area. </p>

commuters. One, those going into Orchard Road – shopping, meals,
leisure, and so on. And the other using it as a thoroughfare to connect
to the Bras Basah area. After we introduced ERP at Orchard Road
in 2005, we saw no discernible variation in traffic bound for Orchard
Road, but the proportion of those using Orchard Road as thoroughfare
decreased from 35% to about 20%. So, roughly the same number of
vehicles went into the area, but a lot less using it as a thoroughfare.
And, hence, more of these commuters, who are driving, are using
it to enter and to be in Orchard Road itself. Our concern is how
that would change if we were to make wholesale adjustments to the
ERP at Orchard Road.</p>

lifting of ERP on Saturdays would not be ideal. We would revert
to the congestion we experienced prior to the introduction of ERP.
However, I am prepared to examine if there is scope to consider
some reduction in the ERP operating hours on Saturdays, just like
what we did to the CTE. Because we would preserve the principle
of offering some choice to motorists – smoother-flowing traffic
during ERP operating hours, and possibly more congestion outside
of those hours. We are doing that study, and LTA will announce the
outcome of this review when it is ready.</p>

Ms Sylvia Lim have both touched on the issue of illegal parking.
Indeed, there are some hotspots, such as near popular eateries,
with higher incidence of illegal parking that affects traffic flow
in the area. The suggestion to offer free parking in nearby car
parks would really depend on the facility owners who may or may
not welcome those who park there without the intention to patronise
the facilities. However, I suspect that generally, convenience and
not pricing would be the key consideration. But the larger issue
is whether we should take it upon ourselves to provide free parking
nearby just because there is an illegal parking problem – the right and
proper thing to do is that the driver simply has to pay to park
in a proper parking lot.</p>

roads within private estates is quite a complex one. Some residents
park their cars outside their houses. The way LTA approaches it
is that it adopts a consultative enforcement approach for such situations.
Where residents are prepared to exercise some tolerance and cooperation,
LTA normally does not restrict parking unless it impedes the safe
and smooth flow of traffic. Where necessary, LTA works with the
grassroots leaders and residents to come to a reasonable parking restriction
arrangement. Not everyone, obviously, will be fully satisfied but,
where there are no over-riding policy considerations, the views
of the majority of residents ought to be given greater weight.</p>

to the carbon emissions-based vehicle system. The land transport
sector is a major emitter of carbon, accounting for about 19% of
our total emissions, the second highest after the industry sector.
The sector, therefore, has an important role to play in our drive
to deal with climate change. Cars and taxis account for roughly about
half of the total land transport emissions. LTA has been studying
a replacement for the current Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR) scheme,
which has been in place since 2001. This is due, in part, to the
modest take-up for the GVR, because less than 2% of our total car
and taxi population is incentivised under the current scheme, partly
because the scheme is limited to specific engine technology types. </p>

widely for views and suggestions, ranging from a public e-consultation

members of the public, to gather ideas on how to more effectively
influence people towards cleaner, low-emission models.</p>

announced, we will introduce a new Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle
Scheme (CEVS). This will replace the current scheme for cars and
taxis in January 2013. Unlike the previous GVR scheme, the new CEVS
will adopt a broader, outcome-based approach that considers whole-of-vehicle
innovations in fuel efficiency. This is because improvements in
fuel efficiency can be achieved through many different ways, whether
in the design of the engine, the transmission system, the use of
materials to reduce weight or friction losses, or through energy
recovery braking systems. </p>

slide [<em class="ph i">A slide was shown to hon Members</em>], under the CEVS, all
new and imported used cars, including taxi models, will be banded
into three broad categories based on their CO<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> emissions
per kilometre (CO<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>/km) performance as derived from standardised
test cycles. Low-emission models will be in the incentive category and
given rebates off their Additional Registration Fee (ARF). There
will be four levels of CEVS rebates, from $5,000 up to $20,000,
depending on the emission band of the model, subject to a minimum
ARF payable of $5,000. High-emission models will incur a registration
surcharge between $5,000 and $20,000. In between, there will be
a "neutral" category of car and taxi models. </p>

known as a "fee-bate" scheme and it draws reference from similar
schemes which have been implemented in other countries. By widening
the price differential between low-emission models and high-emission
ones, the scheme will help to accelerate the switch towards low-emission
cars. </p>

much higher mileage than cars. Therefore, the CEVS "fee-bate" amounts
given to them have been set at 50% higher, to shift our taxi fleet
towards low-emission models, and likewise the surcharge will be
50% higher if they choose to pay for the high-emission models.</p>

about the expected impact of the CEVS. Currently, about 60% of cars
purchased, using last year's data, fall under the neutral band.
The remaining 40% is equally distributed between the rebate and
surcharge bands. I expect that there will be an impact as the intent
is to effect some change in buying behaviour, although it is going
to be difficult to accurately forecast the impact as this ultimately
depends on consumer behaviour. I know most Members are very interested
in this slide and the next slide to follow, because this tells you
the models that are under the rebate, and the next slide will tell
you the models that are under the neutral as well as the surcharge.</p>

expectation is that from 20%, some 30% to 40% of all new cars will
qualify for CEVS rebates. Likewise, we hope fewer car buyers will
choose the high-emission models. Our objective is not to raise money
through the introduction of the
CEVS – let me be very clear about that. Our preliminary estimate
is that the CEVS will cost the Government about $34 million a year,
more than double the total annual incentives that have been given
out under the previous scheme.</p>

Mr Seng that the categories of cars that would be subject to payment
of surcharge would actually be the high-end models, and there are
going to be enough family-friendly MPV models that are not subject

to these price signals after we announce the details of the CEVS.
On this slide [<em class="ph i">A slide was shown to hon Members</em>], (b) is
the neutral band and (c) will be the surcharge band, including the
Ferraris and Bentleys. There are many car models in the neutral

CEVS is a significant policy change. Therefore, we will implement
the rebates first, starting in January 2013, with the surcharges
applicable from July 2013. This will give consumers and the industry
additional time to adjust to having to pay surcharges for carbon-intensive
models. The CEVS structure that I have outlined will be in place
for two years until the end of 2014. We will then review the scheme
and examine the impact on motorists' purchasing decision, advances
in vehicle design and technology as well as the progress of Singapore's
overall carbon mitigation plan. </p>

information dissemination and education are important in shaping

emissions, and its CEVS banding. LTA will also set up a new FELS

concerns that the various tax changes do not take into account the
emissions of other pollutants, such as PM and nitrous oxides (NOx).
I would like to assure him that the Government is mindful of the
importance of managing these other types of pollutants and is indeed
keeping a close watch on the best practices adopted by other countries.
The diesel tax reduction and CEVS rebates only apply to Euro V cars,
which have significantly lower PM and NOx emissions compared to
models of earlier emission standards. All the 550 buses that we
are purchasing under the Bus Services Enhancement Programme (BSEP)
will be required to meet the Euro V standard, ahead of MEWR's 2014 requirement. LTA
will release further details on the CEVS later so that we can be
more updated on what will happen.</p>

taxis. A number of Members have spoken on this subject matter. As
Mr Gan Thiam Poh has pointed out, taxis provide commuters with a personalised

our diverse transport needs. </p>

all, expressed an interest in a taxi sharing scheme, whether it could
revived because this was something that was disbanded in 2001 due
to a lack of interest. We are prepared to try again if there is
sufficient demand for us to do so. He also expressed concern that
the taxi industry is dominated by a few major players. The setting
of fares and the supply of taxis were deregulated in 1998 and 2003
respectively, to inject greater competition within the taxi industry.
Market forces determine the supply and pricing of taxi services
that best meet their demand. </p>

commuters can now choose from seven taxi companies – previously,
it was only three. Competition within the industry has also led to
a decline in the market share of the largest player, ComfortDelgro
– it was 86% in 2003 and it is now down to about 58%. And for competitive
reasons, all the companies have to think carefully about the interests
of the commuters and about their drivers before they initiate any
fare changes. </p>

Neo expressed concern about the affordability of taxi fares for
the disabled and the needy. I understand their concerns. The way
to address this in a de-regulated market is really through providing
financial assistance to the deserving cases. Persons with disabilities
may apply to the Centre for Enabled Living for taxi fare subsidy
to cover trips to work or school. LTA actually works together with
the Centre for Enabled Living to operate this scheme. It is a tiered
subsidy given out based on the per capita income of the family.
The amount of help that a beneficiary receives is really dependent
on his or her household income level and circumstances of the family.
Some taxi companies have also, as part of their corporate social
responsibility, introduced programmes to provide free or subsidised
taxi trips for the needy. These measures are over and above the
financial assistance that Government provides to the low income
for basic living expenses through the ComCare Fund. And, of course,
we know what MCYS works together with VWOs, for example, the Handicap
Welfare Association as well as Caring Fleet to provide such services,
although I understand that because of resource constraints, these
are not available on Sundays and public holidays.</p>

are of the view that the quality of taxi service requires improvement,
and I agree. The LTA has carried out a comprehensive review and
will raise the Quality of Service (QoS) standards for taxi services.
The LTA will also introduce a number of changes to the Taxi Operator
Licence (TOL). Let me briefly run through some of the key changes. </p>

received, the LTA has identified the waiting time for taxis and reliability
in securing taxi call bookings as the two attributes that most require
service improvements. The QoS standards for the key steps in the
taxi call booking will therefore be tightened. As shown in the slide,
we will raise the standards for the "Call Answer Rate", the "Waiting
Time to Answer Call", the "Cater Rate", which actually measures
the likelihood of you being assigned a taxi after the call gets
through; and, finally, the "Waiting
Time for Taxi to Arrive". This raising of standards will improve
the overall experience for commuters when they call-book a taxi.</p>

all taxi companies are required to provide call booking service,
it does not stipulate the minimum number of taxis that are able
to handle call bookings within each fleet. Going forward, LTA will
require taxi operators to equip their entire fleet so they can identify
taxis within the neighbourhood of a caller and assign call-booking
jobs to taxis in the vicinity. The LTA will also require taxi operators
to equip their fleet with a centrally-controlled "On-Call" display
to minimise the misuse of "On-Call" taxi signs. To ensure that individual
taxi operators have sufficient critical mass to provide an adequate
level of service to commuters, the minimum fleet size requirement will
be increased from 400 taxis to 800 taxis.</p>

Mr Ang Wei Neng pointed out that there is room for taxi companies
to increase the availability of their fleets so that commuters will
have easier access to taxi service when they need it. I fully agree.
From 2006 to last year, the taxi fleet grew by about 20%. The kilometres
run by taxis remained the same. The utilisation of the fleet is
something that we need to pay more attention to. I have asked LTA
to study the feasibility of regulating taxi companies to have a
certain minimum availability for their fleets, particularly during
peak hours when availability is crucial. LTA will also study Mr
Seng's suggestion for taxi companies to better match hirers with
relief drivers to facilitate more two-shift taxis as well as other

two other suggestions – very good ones – related to the taxi industry.
The special tax for diesel cars was previously set at a relatively
high rate because of concerns over the pollutive effect, especially
that of PM emissions. We are referring to diesel cars. The Euro
V diesel cars have significantly lower PM emissions, comparable
to petrol cars. And therefore, we decided to reduce the special
tax for Euro V diesel cars so that it is roughly equivalent to the
annual fuel tax paid by an equivalent petrol car. However, the treatment
that we are now according to Euro V diesel cars is the treatment
that we have given to taxis all these years; because the taxis have
a much higher mileage, approximately averaging 150,000 km per year
when we looked at it then. We set the special tax for the taxis
at $5,100, which actually is a slight discount from what it would
be if we had set it at full level, but that is how we arrived at
the scheme for the taxis similar to what we are adopting for the
Euro V diesel cars today. And that is why we did not make any change
to the special tax for taxis. So, the current special tax rate of $5,100 for taxis
is simply the equivalent of the petrol tax payable for the high
annual mileage that taxis chalk up. </p>

that LTA consider further easing the CBD Taxi Rule restriction hours.
In response to the feedback from the National Taxi Association,
we had further shortened the restriction hours to align them with
the operating hours for full day bus lanes and we removed the Vocational
Licence Points System demerit points for violations from 1 March
2012. We want to allow these changes to stabilise but we will be
prepared to consider further reductions if they are indeed possible.</p>

about how the recent fare increases have affected waiting time as
well as the revenues for the drivers. When we compared – and now
several months have passed although the situation, I would say,
is not fully stabilised – the data that we have comparing before
and after show that the revenue for the drivers have gone up somewhere
between 4% and 6%. Waiting time, whether is it the CBD area, at the
fringe of the CBD or outside the CBD area, has actually improved
quite a bit.</p>

that we ought to consider whether there is a different way to meet
the needs of the disabled community through private transport measures.
We recognise that members of the disabled community actually do
want the option of using public transport just like other Singaporeans.
And we want to make Singapore an inclusive society. So, LTA and
the public transport operators have been working together to make
our system more accessible to wheelchair users, the elderly and
the less mobile. I think this approach will also stand us in good
stead to cater to our ageing population, which is something that
Ms Tin Pei Ling has noted.</p>

with disabilities can have unique travelling needs, as described
in the Enabling Masterplan that was just released recently. Taxis
play an important role in fulfilling these needs, something that
is noted by Dr Lily Neo, Mr Cedric Foo, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, among
others. We have been working with MCYS, taxi operators and other
stakeholders to see how best to cater to this demand moving forward.
And I believe MCYS will touch on this during their COS on Friday.</p>

that the Government help to expand the current pool of taxi drivers
who are so-called medical chaperones to cater to our ageing population.
We have been partnering the taxi industry to support the skills
development of taxi drivers. The medical chaperone course conducted
by the Singapore Taxi Academy is one such example. It certified
172 taxi drivers as medical chaperones since its inception in 2006. While
STA has discontinued this scheme due to a lack of demand, we are
prepared to consider this together with the Singapore Workforce
Development Agency if there is enough interest to do so. </p>

Dr Janil has spoken very passionately and eloquently on this matter.
He, amongst others, asked us to consider whether we can introduce
on-road cycling lanes. He also suggested, I think, a painted visual
guide on the existing left-most lane for motorists to provide a
1.5-metre clearance when passing cyclists.</p>

suggests that demarcating on-road cycling lanes might in fact give
both cyclists and motorists a false sense of security, which can
lead to an increase in accidents involving cyclists. In fact, I
was a little bit surprised on this because I asked LTA to go, run
through the studies that were done, look at their data. And interestingly
enough for a number of the cities that introduced this demarcation
back in the 1980s
subsequently reported an increase in the number of accidents; and
one of the reasons that they alluded to was that it gave both parties
a false sense of security. </p>

our National Cycling Plan, is, as first priority, to facilitate cycling
for intra-town travel and for connectivity to major transport nodes.
Weighing the various pros and cons, the provision of dedicated off-road
cycling paths proves to be the safer and more land-efficient option
while achieving our purpose of facilitating intra-town cycling.</p>

the "Cycling Town" initiative in 2009; and I noticed it was very actively
championed by <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mr
Teo Ser Luck</span>. So far, seven towns have been identified
as "Cycling Towns". To date, 6.4 km of dedicated off-road cycling
paths have been completed in these towns. And by 2014, not too long
from now, cyclists can look forward to at least 50 km, close to
eight times more than what we have today, of intra-town cycling
paths as well as another 16 km at the Marina Bay area.</p>

there. In mature estates such as the East Coast and Jurong Lake,
LTA is working with HDB under the Remaking Our Heartland plans to
incorporate connectivity for cyclists. New HDB towns will also be
planned with basic cycling infrastructure provisions. Dr Janil has
rightly pointed out that our extensive Park Connector Network can
offer cyclists, who go beyond intra-town commutes, an alternate
cycling network. And this is indeed being looked into. We do not
work in isolation, certainly, and I know that LTA works closely
with NParks to have these cycling paths built by LTA linked up with
those built by NParks in their park connectors. It is an integrated
approach. This has taken us beyond the localised "Cycling Town"
initiative towards a broader National Cycling Plan, which will see
an extensive cycling network islandwide being developed over the
longer term. But full implementation obviously will be some years
away and it will take time for the infrastructure to be rolled out.</p>

bicycle sharing schemes similar to several other cities: We are

we would consider having a single regulatory authority for cycling.
I think the issue is less about having a single regulatory authority
for cycling, but more
of whether it is possible and desirable, at this stage of our cycling
development, to have a single set of cycling regulations and plans
across the whole island. While LTA provides the infrastructure such
as cycling paths and bicycle racks at transport nodes, and the Traffic
Police oversees the enforcement regime, ultimately, it is community involvement
that really is the key success factor from what we have seen so
far in cycling towns. The community is involved in planning the
cycling paths, and they are also mindful to balance the concerns
of other residents by encouraging their cyclists to adopt safe cycling
habits. This means that the local communities can decide how fast
cycling initiatives should be rolled out and where, and what would
be the acceptable practices and trade-offs between cyclists and
other members of the community.</p>

the use of cycling helmets. The Traffic Police has taken the approach
to promote the use of helmets through education, as mandating their
use through legislation may not necessarily be that effective. Cycling
interest and advocacy groups can also partner LTA and the Traffic
Police to encourage the use of helmets in the cycling community.
But it is something that I personally would actually actively encourage
cyclists to do so.</p>

of the use of helmets, there are other public education efforts undertaken
by LTA, the Traffic Police as well as interest groups like Safe
Cycling Task Force. One key initiative is the publication of an
"Intra-Town Cycling" Handbook, which will serve as a reference on
good cycling etiquette and share safety tips for intra-town cycling.
I note that the LTA and the Traffic Police, beyond what they have
done in education, have also stepped up their enforcement efforts
against errant cyclists with the help of the local community to
make cycling a safer activity for all concerned.</p>

that our limited land space means that mutual understanding and
courtesy between cyclists and other road users is really all the
more important. And working together is an on-going process. By
doing so, as a community, and through improving our infrastructure,
our continuing efforts on education and enforcement, we can create
an environment where cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists can co-exist

largest growth area for the aviation industry currently is in low

glad that MOT has announced

for approximately 10% of Changi Airport's total flight when the
Budget Terminal was opened in 2006. This has grown to 28.6% in 2011,
a mere five years later and it is getting crowded at the Budget Terminal.

present Budget Terminal, the contrast between the somewhat dated
look of the Budget Terminal and the sophisticated, timeless look

why it should deviate from the general image that the other Terminals
portray. Flying budget is no longer just for those who cannot afford
full-service airlines but also becoming more and more relevant to
the average traveller who will expect more from a Singaporean airport. Terminal
4 too will need to move with the times. It was reported that aerobridges
would not be made available at Terminal 4. I feel this facility
should be made optional so that carriers who prefer them can opt
for them. Passengers certainly prefer it, especially on rainy days,
which is not all that uncommon in Singapore.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, I thank you for allowing me to join this debate. I
would also like to thank Dr Lily Neo for saying a lot things which
I wanted to say. Sir, in 2011, Changi Airport handled 46.5 million
passengers and 302,000 flights, an increase of 10.7% and 14.5% respectively
over the previous year. In addition, 1.87 million tonnes of cargo
were handled in 2011, an increase of 2.8% over the previous year.
Changi Airport is now the seventh busiest international airport
in the world and serves more than 100 international airlines flying
to 210 cities worldwide. But this comes at a cost.</p>

from Changi Airport will tell you, it has been quite common to find
yourself sitting in your plane well past its departure time, waiting
for your flight to receive clearance for take-off. This is frustrating
for travellers and it is a departure from the efficiency one normally
expects from a Singaporean institution. Crucially, this might be
one of the last glimpses of Singapore a visitor might experience; and
it is not a great way for one to end a visit here. I would be grateful
if the Minister could
let us know if there has, indeed, over the years been an increase
in air traffic control delays at Changi Airport. And, if there have
been such delays caused by air traffic congestion, what steps are
being taken to reduce these delays? I do not think the ERP gantries
would work in this case. </p>

Aviation Authority of Singapore has recently implemented more efficient
use of two runways for take-offs and landings. However, while there
is a third runway at Changi Airport, this is used solely by the
RSAF for military aircraft, and it is not linked to the passenger
terminal buildings. The third runway has been in existence for some
years already and it is still not available for use by civilian
aircraft. </p>

the two other runways, could the Minister let us know when it is
intended for taxi ways to be constructed to link the third runway
to the passenger terminal buildings to enable the third runway to
be used by civilian aircraft, and thereby reducing the load on the
other two runways, making for more pleasant departure experience
from Changi Airport?</p>

announcements by the Changi Airport Group that the Budget Terminal
will be closing this September to make way for the new Terminal
4. Now low-cost carriers have taken off in a big way in Singapore
and many passengers have found travelling on low-cost carriers to
be a viable alternative compared to travelling with full-service
carriers especially on the shorter routes. The plans for the new
Terminal 4 include more amenities for passengers which are a good
thing but I am concerned that this would come at a greater cost
to travellers who choose low-cost carriers precisely because the
fees are lower; who, in exchange are happy to live with limited
facilities currently available at the Budget Terminal.</p>

as to what sorts of fees and taxes will be charged at the new Terminal
4? And how will this be compared to the current fees and taxes being charged
at the Budget Terminal? And with the temporary re-location of airlines
to Terminal 2, will there be an economic impact to travellers travelling
with those airlines? </p>

Terminal handled 4.6 million passengers in 2011. It has a capacity
of 7 million passengers a year. It appears that there is still significant
amount of headroom in that figure. Given that the Budget Terminal
is only five years old, could the Minister please clarify why he
feels that it is now the right time to demolish the Budget Terminal
in the light of its relative youth, as well as the fact that it
is well below its passenger handling capacity at the moment?</p>

air hubs? It has to be noted that Dubai – for example, has been,
by many, many counts whether it is passenger arrivals, whether it
is connectivity to cities – has been doing very well recently. I

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, Sir, good afternoon. Before I start, I want to declare
that I am the President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce
&amp; Industry, Chairman of the Board and Governing Council of the Singapore
Maritime Institute, and MD of Pacific International Lines. In my
speech today, I would like to touch on four subjects.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3c59d982-9f56-4be2-933d-b22b3644c94a">
                  <a name="budget__id-3c59d982-9f56-4be2-933d-b22b3644c94a"><!--a--></a>Firstly, setting up of
an agency to facilitate inter-government and private sector co-operation.
In my Parliamentary speech last Tuesday, I called for the Government
to set up an over-arching agency to oversee the smooth introduction
of policies which cuts across several Government Ministries, to
address issues faced by business affected by such policies. Let
me share with you an example of cross-agency collaboration which
I found useful.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-199fd4ea-3a58-473e-a383-273460764623">
                  <a name="budget__id-199fd4ea-3a58-473e-a383-273460764623"><!--a--></a>The Singapore Maritime
Institute (SMI) was formed last year as a joint effort by the Maritime
and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the Agency for Science, Technology and
Research (A*STAR) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) in partnership with
local institutes of Higher Learning. These agencies are from different
Ministries and could have pursued their interests independently
but instead, the MPA has pledged $200 million towards this initiative
with another $150 million by A*STAR and EDB as announced by Deputy
Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratham in his parliamentary speech
on 17 February. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9c48f904-5c11-4932-89d2-f212eb879a7e">
                  <a name="budget__id-9c48f904-5c11-4932-89d2-f212eb879a7e"><!--a--></a>They have come together
to leverage on each others' strengths, to pursue a common vision
of growing Singapore as a maritime knowledge hub, to enhance Singapore's overall
competitiveness as a leading maritime centre. In the process, we
are also able to fulfil other objectives such as strengthening our
research capabilities and grooming of manpower. The maritime industry
has been very receptive to this initiative. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8f0d6f91-4894-4b2f-bcd6-e64c0dc56bac">
                  <a name="budget__id-8f0d6f91-4894-4b2f-bcd6-e64c0dc56bac"><!--a--></a>Secondly, on foreign worker
dependency ratio and its impact on the harbour-craft industry. Last
year, Singapore maintained its position as the world's busiest port
by vessel arrival tonnage with a record high of 2.12 billion gross
tonnes (GT), or 10.4% increase from the previous year. We also remained
as the world's top bunkering port, with record bunker sales of 43.15
million tonnes, an increase by 5.6% over 2010. This is quite an
accomplishment, especially when our harbour-craft fleet only comprises
300 tug boats and 270 bunker tankers to escort vessel arrivals and
refuel them in Singapore's port waters and anchorages. On a daily
basis, they service more than 1,000 vessels in our port, playing
a vital role in bringing economic benefits, while ensuring maritime safety
in our waters. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7fbf3d9f-1900-4cc0-a258-3b5b35131699">
                  <a name="budget__id-7fbf3d9f-1900-4cc0-a258-3b5b35131699"><!--a--></a>The bulk of the harbour-craft
crew are trained foreign seafarers who have undergone years of training
to carry out complex shipping operations on our tug boats and bunker tankers.
This training is in line with international best practices and cannot
be reduced without
compromising safety standards. I would like to add that the tug
boats and bunker tankers that serve our port are already heavily-automated
with the minimum number of crew needed for safe operations. Our
harbour-craft crew also work shifts in a physically and mentally
demanding environment on 24x7 basis. Hence, I can understand why
such jobs may not appeal to many locals even though the pay is high.
Promoting and encouraging Singaporean school leavers to embark on
a seafaring career is an ongoing joint effort by the shipping industry,
unions and Government agencies but the take-up rate has never been
too impressive. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2230</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7cac032d-2cc2-4c82-9b89-e59f1297f367">
                  <a name="budget__id-7cac032d-2cc2-4c82-9b89-e59f1297f367"><!--a--></a>We are aware that some
who have undergone seafaring courses end up working onshore and
even in non maritime related industries. Thus, I urge the Government
to re-look and be more flexible at certain sectors that are unable
to meet the dependency ratio ceiling despite their best efforts.
They will be hampered in their businesses without foreign skilled
labour.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4bfd9044-d9a9-47bf-bcc0-df4498109345">
                  <a name="budget__id-4bfd9044-d9a9-47bf-bcc0-df4498109345"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, expanding the
scope of MSI-AIS scheme: removal of withholding tax on interest
payments for container leasing. I am happy to note that the Maritime
Sector Incentive-Maritime Leasing (Container) Award (MSI-MLC) has
been enhanced. Container leasing companies are now granted automatic
withholding tax exemption arising from loans taken to finance qualifying
containers and intermodal equipment. Other than container lessors,
container shipping companies also take loans to finance purchase
of their containers. However, they are excluded from enjoying this enhancement. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7b666646-b55e-4bef-89d4-5bbb6c5d44ef">
                  <a name="budget__id-7b666646-b55e-4bef-89d4-5bbb6c5d44ef"><!--a--></a>I would like to propose
that the MSI-AIS scheme be further enhanced to allow loans taken
to finance purchase of containers by container shipping companies,
to also qualify for the automatic withholding tax exemption for
foreign loans on their containers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-09656e92-7e4c-4069-bd05-ec89de72fd6a">
                  <a name="budget__id-09656e92-7e4c-4069-bd05-ec89de72fd6a"><!--a--></a>Last but not least, removal
of withholding tax on interest payments for foreign loans on ships.
In last year's Budget Statement, the Minister had announced that
qualifying payments made in respect of qualifying foreign loans
taken to finance the purchase or construction of both Singapore-flagged
and foreign-flagged ships would be granted automatic withholding
tax (WHT) exemption. This is a good initiative. However, we would
like this extended beyond 31 May 2016. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-294b32dd-232b-48cf-a583-713d8b2b5deb">
                  <a name="budget__id-294b32dd-232b-48cf-a583-713d8b2b5deb"><!--a--></a>In conclusion, our shipping
industry is currently going through a very difficult period. Especially
for shipping lines in the container, bulk and tanker sectors, the
headwinds are even stronger than the 2008/2009 downturn. I would
like to urge the Government to heed our industry's concerns, understand
our problems and to address them, so that together, we can sail
through this rough weather like we have done so many times before,
and further strengthen Singapore's status as an International Maritime
Centre.</p>

plans to transform Singapore into a leading international maritime
centre. For us to remain well placed to capture the potential and future
growth, I believe to be able to do so, it is imperative for us to
develop a strategic plan to build our own maritime workforce, comprising
a core pool of Singaporeans who are proud of their jobs, who have
access into good jobs, so that we can also safeguard our national
interests.</p>

that the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) take steps
to engage the relevant stakeholders to map out a maritime manpower
master plan for the industry? We should involve MOM, WDA, ITEs,
Polytechnics, employers, unions and associations, so that everyone
can take ownership in the design, development and implementation
of such a master plan. We can and should together identify ahead
of time what a future-ready workforce for the maritime industry
should comprise; what are the competencies and skills required?
And what is the number of workers needed ahead of time? Do we therefore
have the sufficient training capacity and the types of trainers
needed to train, for example, people in the harbour-craft industry? Similarly,
what is the timeline MPA needs to set in place so that we can develop
a pool of Singaporean core for the maritime industry? </p>

I believe we can help companies attract local workforce and such
manpower needs and training should not be an "afterthought". MPA
needs to plan ahead of time to prevent a manpower shortage in this
industry. Our growth as an international maritime centre should
not be hampered as a result of a shortage of skilled local workforce.
We want Singaporeans to be able to take advantage of the nation's growth
in the maritime industry. But, more importantly, we want Singaporeans
to have a headstart. For those who are not in the industry, they
can gain access to join the industry. For those who are already
working in the industry, they can grow into new areas and acquire
new skills. If and when we have a detailed and clearly mapped out manpower
masterplan, we can prepare Singaporeans on what to expect in the
maritime trade. It will also send strong signals to everyone that
the industry is serious to offer good careers, promising prospects,
good salaries and upgrading opportunities. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ccdfeaa0-d3af-489e-aabb-182371a0623c">
                  <a name="budget__id-ccdfeaa0-d3af-489e-aabb-182371a0623c"><!--a--></a>There are many deeply-skilled
jobs that require Singaporeans to fill. Mr Teo mentioned earlier
that they are paid very well in the harbour-craft and various other types
of jobs in the maritime industry. Many low-skilled jobs are also
being converted to higher-skilled and better-paying ones. Many of
such jobs are competency-driven rather than by academic qualifications.
I hope the MPA can provide information about the industry and let
the structured career progression pathways be made known to everyone,
that is, the students and job seekers, so that those who are contemplating
the choice of courses in schools can consider this industry. And
those who are in a job but looking for a change in career, can consider
maritime as a career option. For instance, MPA can work with the
ITEs and Polytechnics to ensure that the supply from the pre-employment
training (PET) route is adequate, and that they should make a conscious effort
to find out why students who take up this course eventually do not
make a career out of the same industry. We must make every effort
to make sure that the graduates in this course stay in the industry.</p>

the PET route alone is not able to provide a sufficient pool of ready
workers needed for the industry. Can MPA consider tapping from the
Continuing Education and Training (CET) route, ie, the existing
workforce? Take advantage of other well-trained Singaporeans who may not
know of a good industry, good career, that is available here. Look
at various ways to attract people to do job conversion and switch
to the maritime trade through attractive and well-funded conversion
programmes, apprenticeship and Place-and-Train programmes. Provide
jobseekers easy access to join the industry with a strong focus
on competencies, rather than purely on academic qualifications.
Can MPA also harness existing training resources and expand current expertise?
Put in place the appropriate trainers, facilities and funding schemes
to grow this industry and eventually, make sure that manpower needs
and training are not seen as an "afterthought".</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, although we sit very closely together, I can tell you that
we are "same-same" but different. First and foremost, I would like
to thank the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the Maritime and Port
Authority of Singapore (MPA) in moulding Singapore into an international
maritime hub. The maritime industry has contributed over 7% of our
national GDP. With the MOT and MPA's efforts, there are more than
5,000 maritime companies and more than 4,000 Singapore-flagged ships, which
are ranked among the top10 fleets in the world. And this has created
relatively well-paid jobs in the maritime industry. I understand
that today, there are about 170,000 personnel employed ashore and
at sea, and they constitute about 6% of our national workforce of
some 3.2 million. Sir, how many of these 170,000 personnel employed
are Singaporeans? Presently, there is an employment ratio being
practised in the Singapore harbour. However, on the ocean-going
vessels, no such ratio exists. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0b5bd29e-ca68-4fc3-9de8-7bc833d79c79">
                  <a name="budget__id-0b5bd29e-ca68-4fc3-9de8-7bc833d79c79"><!--a--></a>Before I go further, Sir,
I would like to declare my interest. I am the Executive Secretary
of the Singapore Maritime Officers' Union (SMOU) and a Director
of Wavelink Maritime Institute Pte Ltd, a training provider. Allow
me to highlight what I meant by well-paying jobs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7d8cc3af-0a2b-4f2a-9db7-4a8fe1133e7d">
                  <a name="budget__id-7d8cc3af-0a2b-4f2a-9db7-4a8fe1133e7d"><!--a--></a>Firstly, the Habour Craft
Port Limit. Just now, Mr Teo Siong Seng mentioned that it offers
a well-paid job. I understand from our members that wages can range
from S$3,000 to S$6,000 per month, depending on their ranking onboard
the ship. Secondly, for ocean-going ships, an entry-level Third
Officer can earn an average of S$3,800 per month. A sea Captain
can earn up to S$10,000 per month. However, for specialised vessels,
a Captain can earn as high as S$19,000 to S$25,000 per month. With
wages that are much higher than the existing national median wage,
should we be doing more to encourage Singaporeans to pursue a sea
career?</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-7873c693-cca0-4308-ae88-a5fc26b744a1"><!--a--></a>In recent years, it is
very encouraging to note that there are more young Singaporeans
with good GCE "O" level results coming forward to apply for Direct Admissions
into the Diploma of Nautical Studies and Diploma of Marine Engineering Programmes
offered by the Singapore Maritime Academy (SMA) at the Singapore Polytechnic.
On average, about 180 potential seafaring officers are trained annually
in SMA. Of this number, I understand that over 90% are Singaporeans
yearning for a job that pays higher wages. Sir, the SMA has the
capacity to train more young Singaporeans for this promising and
rewarding sea career. However, they are not able to do so because
they find it challenging to secure training berths onboard ships
for the required 12 months of sea-time that the cadets will have
to complete. This is despite the fact that we have more than 4,000
Singapore-flagged commercial ships.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2233</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-35daae37-0146-4340-bc12-ee1d12e534f7"><!--a--></a>Is this shortage of available cadet training
berths onboard commercial ships for our young Singaporeans a reason
for them to deprive our youth from better jobs and better wages?
A career at sea does not confine one to spending almost an entire
lifetime at sea. The many colleagues whom I work with very closely
are former sea-going officers as well. The shore-based career opportunities
in the maritime industry are just as wide. Many from amongst the
top shipping management in the maritime sector were once sailing
as nautical or engineering officers at sea. They are also earning
no less than what they used to earn at sea.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-eb57fa06-0d7e-4284-8ade-dbae69cf04bb">
                  <a name="budget__id-eb57fa06-0d7e-4284-8ade-dbae69cf04bb"><!--a--></a>I would like to applaud
the MPA for the collaborative initiative with WDA, e2i and harbour-craft
employers, for introducing the 21-month Certificate of Competency
(COC) for Special Limits (ships that are sailing within Singapore
water). We should have started earlier, but it is better late than
never. This is an example of a positive initiative that has trained
Singaporeans with secondary school education or "N" level equivalent
for a well-paying job in our harbour. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd250ec1-4535-4d02-b62e-3af70847e9d0">
                  <a name="budget__id-bd250ec1-4535-4d02-b62e-3af70847e9d0"><!--a--></a>Another similar initiative,
but with a tripartite element, is the Tripartite Nautical Training
Award (TNTA), which was introduced in 2009 as a pilot Place-and-Train programme
administered by e2i, funded by WDA and a small portion from the Singapore
Maritime Officers' Union, and supported by Singapore Shipping Association, which
at that time was led by the then-President, Mr Teo Siong Seng, seated
beside me here, and 11 different shipping employers. To date, we
have trained some 56 Singaporeans for ocean-going ships sailing
worldwide and currently 31 are still out there at sea. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4448c05d-9784-4df5-9eb4-51033539b713">
                  <a name="budget__id-4448c05d-9784-4df5-9eb4-51033539b713"><!--a--></a>Sir, TNTA illustrates
how constructive tripartism can serve the industry, create well-paying
jobs for working adult Singaporeans with "N" level as well as a
minimum requirement and yet provide a good career path. Many of
them have already completed their National Service. It also gives
the opportunity of a promising alternative career to working adult
Singaporeans to succeed and earn better wages to have a better life
for their families. I understand that this is a very tough job,
but it can be rewarding. Perhaps, if this same spirit of tripartism
is adopted by the entire shipping industry, the bottleneck may be
cleared. More employers can make available training berths on their
ocean-going commercial vessels and more Singaporeans can have the
opportunity of a sea career. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-bb87ede6-fb83-4eee-9875-bdf05b0641c7"><!--a--></a>Sir, Singapore being an
international maritime hub, I feel that it is important for us to maintain
a core base of Singaporeans in the shipping industry. I echo the
same view of Mr Ang Hin Kee, and I would like to ask the Minister:
(i) What is the Government's projection of the long-term maritime
manpower needs in Singapore? (ii) What are the Ministry of Transport's
plans to develop Singaporeans for maritime jobs for both shore-based
and sea-based? (iii) If persuasion fails, would the Minister consider
introducing some form of incentives for shipping companies to provide
training berths for Singaporean cadets on board Singapore-flagged
ships? and (iv) Would the Minister also consider setting up tripartite
initiatives to promote the employment of Singaporeans in the maritime
sector? </p>

city, connecting ideas, people and goods across the region and the
world. Aviation is a vital enabler of our global connectivity, which
helps many other sectors, such as financial services, manufacturing,
and tourism to flourish. Aviation is, in fact, a very diverse sector,
comprising airlines, airport, aerospace and aviation services. These
different activities provide exciting and rewarding jobs for more
than 40,000 people. </p>

Chong asked about the performance and prospects of our aviation
sector. Aviation did well in 2011. Our air hub, Changi Airport,
had a good year. Many airlines operating at Changi were affected
by the unfortunate natural calamities elsewhere, including the Tohoku
earthquake in Japan, and the flooding in Thailand. Airlines were
also affected by weaker sentiments and economic uncertainty in Europe
and the US. Despite these challenges, Changi recorded 10.7% growth
in the number of passengers handled in 2011. Mr Charles Chong had
shared some of these numbers. We have a new high of 46.5 million
passengers handled. This is more than double the global growth rate
of 5.1% for the year. Air freight volumes also rose by 2.8% to 1.87
million tonnes, compared to 0.7% globally. Reflecting the higher
levels of business, aircraft movements at Changi grew 14.5% in 2011,
exceeding 300,000 movements for the first time.</p>

about the change in structure, where we now have the Changi Airport
Group (CAG) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).
The creation of CAG has allowed it to focus on airport operations
and for CAAS to focus on air transport regulation as well as development.
So far, this arrangement has worked well, as shown in the growth
figures. CAG, in fact, now has greater flexibility to innovate, such
as to introduce schemes that will attract and retain airlines.</p>

continues to be challenging. Besides concerns over the global economy,
further hikes in fuel prices could dampen the performance of airlines. As
a result, we expect our air hub to continue to grow this year, but
at a slower pace. </p>

the record traffic of the past year has led to delays in aircraft
arrivals and departures. This has occurred when Changi's runways
and taxiways are heavily utilised during peak periods. There are
seasonal fluctuations but, on average, about one in 20 aircraft
departures at Changi faced some delay in 2011. To upkeep the service
excellence expected of Changi, CAAS and CAG aim to do better. </p>

has been put in place by a taskforce led by CAAS and CAG. For example,
within safe parameters, the interval between departing aircraft
has been reduced. More planes can now use the runway within the
same time period. </p>

as a result of these measures. During peak periods, runway and taxiway
operations are smoother. Departure delays have decreased in January
compared to November and December 2011, even with the surge in travel
over the Lunar New Year. The taskforce is monitoring the situation
and will make further enhancements
to minimise delays. I am pleased to let Mr Chong know that ERP gantries are
not one of the measures we are contemplating.</p>

first terminal, was originally designed to handle a larger proportion
of connecting travellers who do not leave the transit area. However,
as Singapore's attractiveness as a destination grows, more travellers
are making stopovers instead of just using Changi as a transit point.
We can, therefore, expect public areas, such as the meet and greet

profile of travellers, Changi will embark on the Terminal 1 Expansion
Project. The open air car park between Terminal 1 and Changi's iconic
control tower will be redeveloped into a multi-use complex. This
new complex will be integrated with the existing building, and will
increase Terminal 1's public areas, pick-up driveways, and car park
spaces. With this expansion, Terminal 1's handling capacity will increase
from 21 million to 24 million passengers per annum. </p>

Terminal 1's accessibility to the MRT station will also be improved.
In addition, the new complex will have dedicated facilities to support
fly-cruise and fly-coach initiatives, which are important options
to a rising number of travellers. More retail spaces and traveller
amenities will be provided to enhance the overall experience of
airport users. The Terminal 1 expansion project requires detailed and
careful planning. CAG will provide more updates in due course.</p>

Changi's Budget Terminal will be redeveloped into a new "Terminal
4". When completed, Terminal 4 will be able to handle 16 million passengers
per annum, more than double the capacity of the existing Budget
Terminal. In terms of facilities, CAG has indicated that Terminal
4, like the present Budget Terminal, will not have aerobridges.
This is to keep open the option of a no-frills model which some
low-cost carriers (LCCs) prefer. </p>

what will happen to the fees and taxes. It is a little too early
to say right now because the new Terminal 4 is scheduled to be completed
in 2017. But there will have to be some sort of pricing differential
maintained between Terminal 4 and Terminals 1, 2 and 3 because of
the different services that are available at these terminals.</p>

an opportune investment for Changi to tap on the growth of LCCs.
LCCs are a growing and an increasingly diverse segment of the air
transport industry. Today, some LCCs adopt the classic model of
short-haul, point-to-point and no-frills operations, while others
now fly long-haul, offer transfer services, and even business class
options. LCC travellers are equally diverse, and include even business travellers as well.
Dr Neo will be pleased to know that these travellers will enjoy increased
comfort and ambience, as well as more parking spaces at the new
Terminal 4.</p>

carriers, LCCs have boosted Changi's connectivity. They now offer
services to 50 cities in 16 countries. In fact, several of Changi's
city links are served solely by LCCs. These include Yogyakarta,
Shantou, Krabi, and Tiruchirapalli in India. We expect more LCCs
to offer services to new destinations from Changi. For example,
Scoot, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, will start long-haul
services to Australia's Gold Coast later this year.</p>

using LCCs at Changi has grown dramatically at the rate of 35% per
year over the past five years. As a result, LCCs now take up a 25%
share of Changi's total passenger volume, compared to just 7.7%
in 2006, when the Budget Terminal first opened. By way of comparison,
LCCs make up 30%-35% of total passenger volumes in more mature markets,
such as the US and Europe, whereas compared to what is at Changi
today, it is 25%.</p>

market matures, and more people travel, LCCs are expected to grow
in importance. Therefore, gearing Changi for LCCs is gearing Changi
for growth. I hope that also addresses Mr Charles Chong's question
on why it was that the Budget Terminal, being a relatively youthful
terminal still has to be torn down and redeveloped. It is really
because the growth potential is vast and we think that it makes
better sense for it to be redeveloped to cater to that growth potential.</p>

Terminal 1 and the new Terminal 4 will raise Changi's overall capacity
from the present 73 million to 85 million passengers per annum,
a 16% increase in capacity. For an air hub to thrive, capacity and
connectivity growth must go hand in hand. Besides physical expansion,
we need to further liberalise air services agreements with other
countries, a point which was noted by Mr Cedric Foo. This strategy
of securing more air rights is vital to growing our air connectivity
and strengthening our air hub. </p>

benefits arising from this strategy is the progressive liberalisation
of Singapore's air services with China, which has allowed airlines
of both countries to seize market opportunities and cater to growing
demand. The liberalised air rights regime between Singapore and
China took effect in 2005. In the six years that followed to 2011,
passenger traffic between our two countries has grown by 50%.</p>

liberalisation has reaped dividends. Just 10 years ago, Changi was
linked to 139 cities in 50 countries. Today, with a wider network
of air services agreements, Changi is linked to 211 cities in 62
countries around the globe. </p>

else are we seeking to have air services liberalisation. Actually,
in the ASEAN region, our immediate neighbours are one area of priority,
and this is because we are very keen to see the implementation of
the intra-ASEAN open skies agreements which have already been signed.</p>

is a key enabler of our globalised economy. It helps Singapore attract
and anchor multinationals and top talents. It enables our home-grown enterprises
to tap opportunities and markets worldwide. On a personal level, connectivity
enriches the lives and broadens the perspectives of Singaporeans.
We will continue
to champion air liberalisation and the growth of connectivity, to
the benefit of Singapore.</p>

Members some noteworthy developments amongst airports, which is
also Mr Foo's question on which airports are we looking at. Several
leading air hubs are upping their game and taking a long-term view
on capacity building. To our north, Kuala Lumpur International Airport
is building KLIA2, a much larger LCC facility with a capacity of
45 million passengers per annum. KLIA2 is designed to facilitate transfers
between LCC and full service flights. </p>

ambitions to position Incheon International Airport as the gateway
to Northeast Asia, a region comprising China, Japan and Korea. It
is also developing an "Air City", an island 10 times the size of
Ang Mo Kio, with residential, industrial and commercial zones, including
a casino, hotels and conference facilities. Such "airport city"
developments are emerging as a key strategy for air hub competitiveness. </p>

− Mr Foo also mentioned this − whose volumes were only half that
of Changi a decade ago, now handles more passengers than Changi
does each year. It is still aggressively expanding, and will open
a dedicated A380 concourse later this year. This will be a world
first. </p>

Hong Kong International Airport has announced its Master Plan 2030
which involves building a third runway to meet future needs. In
fact, Hong Kong has successfully extended its reach beyond its traditional
catchment areas for passengers. Using coach and ferry, travellers
at Hong Kong International Airport can connect to and from more
than 100 cities in the Pearl River Delta. The airport is, therefore,
tapping a hinterland of 120 million people, far greater than the
seven million living in Hong Kong itself. With these sea and land
links, the airport has captured an additional four million passengers,
or close to 10% of its passenger traffic, in 2011. Within the next
two decades, all these airports that I have mentioned are likely
to grow capacities and be able to handle 100 million or more passengers
each year.</p>

its position as a vibrant global city, Changi must work hard to
stay ahead. Changi was first conceived in 1975. The first flight
at Changi took off in 1981. It took another 27 years for Changi
to reach its present capacity and scale, with the opening of Terminal

of aviation in Singapore. To guide Changi's growth over the next
quarter century, and take it to the next major milestone, the Ministry
of Transport will set up the Changi 2036 Steering Committee. The

of development for related infrastructure, facilities and transport links
to support Changi's future growth. The Committee expects to consult relevant

did well last year. Container throughput grew over 5% to reach 29.9
million TEUs – just a little above the previous highest level in
2008 before the financial crisis. Our annual vessel arrival tonnage
grew 10% to reach 2.1 billion gross tonnes – doubling in just seven
years. We also remain the world's top bunkering port with a 5% increase
in annual bunker sales last year.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-bb7f2d29-3dba-42d1-b6cc-d89dbe17c701"><!--a--></a>The port is part of a
larger ecosystem. It needs shipping lines and operators to generate
cargo volumes. They, in turn, need shipbrokers to arrange business
deals, shipping banks to provide financing, maritime lawyers to
oversee transactions, and many other supporting services. In other
words, the maritime sector is more than just the port. It is an
entire ecosystem of sea- and shore-based activities that offers
many exciting career opportunities. Growing this ecosystem is an
important part of our vision to make Singapore a leading International
Maritime Centre. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d1aec930-50ff-48b2-ac57-479f782ac3ec">

Centre is making good progress. Today, there are over 120 international
shipping groups in Singapore compared to about 30 groups 10 years ago.
We are widely recognised as having one of the highest concentrations
of shipping groups, covering the full spectrum of activities, from
container, tanker and bulk shipping to the offshore energy sector.
Established players like the Swire Group, the NYK Group and the
AP Moller-Maersk Group have set up their regional headquarters here
to be at the heart of the Asian growth story. Similarly, in the
area of maritime law and arbitration, there are now over 30 law
firms with maritime practice in Singapore, compared to about 20
in 2003. </p>

has also grown nicely. When Lloyd's of London, which is recognised
as the world's leading specialist insurance market maker, first
set up its Singapore office in 2003, there were only two Lloyd's
syndicates involved in underwriting marine insurance. Today, there
are 18 of such syndicates. </p>

now a healthy ecosystem with more than 5,000 companies contributing
some 7% to Singapore's GDP. As Mr Teo Siong Seng has pointed out,
with the addition of the Singapore Maritime Institute, we are further
building up Singapore as a maritime knowledge hub. I am also confident
that Mr Teo, as the first Chairman of the Institute, can bring together
Government, industry and academia to strengthen maritime education
and catalyse maritime research and development in Singapore.</p>

that we can do to strengthen our IMC. One area is ship finance.
The number of banks in Singapore with shipping portfolios has grown
from 15 in 2003 to more than 25 today. We believe there is further
scope to narrow the gap with other leading maritime centres, especially
in terms of ship financing options and specialised expertise. Another area for
development is our freight derivative market, which provides industry
with more risk management tools. The Maritime and Port Authority
(MPA) of Singapore is actively following up on these areas.</p>

account the cyclical nature of the shipping business, the last few years
have been exceptionally volatile. During the boom years of 2003
to 2008 when freight rates and volumes were high, many shipping
companies ordered new vessels, most of which have started coming
on-stream just as global trade is softening. These factors, coupled
with rising fuel prices, are squeezing the margins of shipping companies.
Many shipping lines have either reported or are expecting heavy
losses. As shipping is the key driver of our maritime cluster, we
expect growth for the cluster to be slower in the next one to two
years.</p>

the industry will recover, but shipping lines are already taking steps
to stay lean and tide over the current difficult period. Major lines

to streamline operations and enhance productivity. </p>

Singapore's status as an International Maritime Centre (IMC), the
Government adopts a three-pronged approach: First, we will invest
in infrastructure ahead of demand; second, we will sharpen our policies
and schemes to meet changing needs; and, third, we will grow a core
of local talent to support the future growth of our maritime industry. </p>

Despite the current uncertainties in the shipping market, we are
pressing ahead with the expansion of Phases 3 and 4 of the Pasir
Panjang Terminals to cater for future growth in container volumes.
When completed and fully operational, the new berths will add about
50% more capacity to the Singapore Port. At the same time, we will
continue to dredge and deepen the main approaches to our port to
accommodate the mega vessels that will soon be calling here. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6a243af5-114e-4d60-b58b-5251362d9dce">

ensure that our policies and assistance schemes for maritime companies
remain relevant. To refine these schemes, we hold regular consultations with
industry. For example, to provide greater upfront tax certainty,
we have included tax exemption for vessel disposal gains for qualifying
ship operators and lessors under the Maritime Sector Incentive.
In addition, to help reduce business costs for ship charterers in
Singapore, we have granted withholding tax (WHT) exemption of charter fee
payments to non-residents. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-846e0275-98d5-492c-beab-806c43c4106f">

of container leasing in Singapore, we have also refined our Maritime
Leasing (Container) award to make it more business-friendly, including
the extension of automatic withholding tax exemption for interest
payments to container lessors. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2240</p>

to the third prong on developing local maritime talent, a subject
Ms Mary Liew, Mr Ang Hin Kee and Mr Teo all spoke about. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b0ca1027-8920-425f-ad6f-66c839db3494">

as an International Maritime Centre, it is critical that we grow
and maintain a core of local talent to support the many maritime
businesses here. I fully agree with Mr Ang that it cannot be "an
afterthought". Let me explain why we believe people are important
to our goal of becoming a leading IMC. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e98b7ad-acf8-49c5-b123-ab0b36111ea9">
                  <a name="budget__id-9e98b7ad-acf8-49c5-b123-ab0b36111ea9"><!--a--></a>The global nature of shipping
requires people with an international outlook, and who can adapt
to diverse cultures and markets. This is true of a broad spectrum
of roles in the business. At its heart, the maritime industry is
also a relationship-based business. More often than not, deals are
secured through trusted personal contacts. These are precisely the
qualities that maritime companies find and value in Singaporeans. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3f2bb2cb-2a1f-466a-9c51-b9776f8d01a2">

policies can also be built up by our competitors, quality human
capital provides our IMC with a more lasting and valuable competitive advantage.
Our challenge, therefore, is to ensure a steady pipeline of locals
entering the maritime sector and that the sector is able to attract
and retain a fair share of local talent. </p>

170,000 people employed in the maritime sector, about 75,000 are
locals compared to around 50,000 locals 10 years ago. However, maritime manpower
needs have grown faster than our local pool can provide, much like
in other sectors of the economy. We see this as an opportunity for
us to invest in growing the local pipeline and to enable more Singaporeans
to take advantage of the good careers available in maritime, a point

of the maritime sector, has worked closely with unions, industry
and educational institutions to put in place a comprehensive manpower development
framework. The key objectives of this framework are to, firstly,
attract and retain a core of Singaporeans to the maritime sector;
secondly, continuously develop and upgrade their skills and competencies;
and, thirdly, encourage maritime companies to invest in their human
capital.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-4e2e6df9-76a6-4369-a701-2d9fde668b40"><!--a--></a>I should add that our
approach is to recognise the difference between seafaring and shore-based
careers. A seafaring career requires specialised skills and experience, which
can be built up through an internationally-mandated roadmap. The
lifestyles of seafarers are also different – not 9-to-5. In fact,
it is more like 24x7. It can involve several days or weeks at sea
and sometimes even months at sea before getting to spend concentrated
time with family. Therefore, our developmental programmes must help potential
seafarers adapt to these special requirements.</p>

that seafarers have opportunities for good career progression, regardless
of the point of entry. An entry-level harbour-craft steersman can
be promoted to helmsman and be upgraded to work on vessels operating
in waters around Singapore − in other words, not just the harbour
but the waters around Singapore, which is a wider geographical span.
Thereafter, he can be further upgraded to work on larger harbour bunker
tankers and eventually be a Captain. So, we are talking about larger responsibilities,
bigger vessels and, of course, higher pay. If a seafarer wants to
transit to a shore-based career, his seafaring experience is also
an advantage. </p>

need for multiple entry points and not being too focussed on academic
qualifications. This is indeed the case. Take, for example, Patrick
Chua. That is the picture of Patrick looking very smart [<em class="ph i">A slide
was shown to hon Members</em>]. After his "N" levels, Patrick worked
variously in the Navy, as a salesman and even at his mother's hawker
stall. In 2009, at the age of 38, he joined the pioneer batch of
the harbour-craft steersman "Place-and-Train" programme. His first
qualification came after three months on-the-job training at sea
and an oral test. The first test was an oral test, not a written test.
It was really his three months on-the-job training at sea that helped
him to qualify. Over the next 12 months, he clocked enough sea time
and experience, and he also passed further tests to be a qualified
helmsman, which is bigger responsibility, earning a monthly salary
of more than $2,500. This was significantly higher than what he
was previously drawing before he took up the course. Patrick can
move higher up the career ladder by taking up bridging courses and
gaining more experience at sea.</p>

Helmi Bin Kamsani took a different path to become a seafarer. After
his "O" levels and National Service, Helmi was awarded a scholarship
for diploma studies at the Singapore Maritime Academy. Apart from
course fees, the scholarship provided him a monthly allowance plus
a guaranteed position with his sponsor shipping company ‒ APL. Helmi
graduated in March last year and is now serving as Third Officer
on board a merchant vessel. The exciting part comes now. In about
six years, when Helmi is just around 30 years old, it is very likely
that he will be commanding a ship. This could easily be an asset
worth over US$100 million, carrying a crew of around 30 people.
Helmi is building up the necessary experience and will need further
certification, but being a ship Captain will be well within his
reach.</p>

Patrick and Helmi benefited from joint programmes between MPA and
tripartite partners. In Patrick's case, the "Place-and-Train" programme
was developed with the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) and the
Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). In Helmi's case, it
was the Seafaring Alternative€¦An Investment for Life (SAIL) Scholarship

companies. </p>

pleased to know that to target youths like Helmi, MPA together with
the industry launched the MaritimeONE platform to raise awareness
of maritime careers through outreach activities. In addition, our
students can pursue specialist degree and diploma courses at NTU,
NUS, Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic, leading to
both seafaring and shore-based careers. Students in other degree
and diploma courses can also take up maritime modules. Last year,
some 1,000 students were enrolled in these programmes. </p>

on another important target of maritime manpower development – shore-based

Law and Practice programme, offered by the University of Southampton.
This is quite an iconic training programme for maritime law and
we brought it to Singapore. Another programme that has created quite
a buzz in the local maritime scene is the P&amp;I Insurance and
Loss Prevention Course offered by the North of England P&amp;I Club.
You may ask, what is the North of England P&amp;I Club? For the
benefit of other Members, the North of England P&amp;I Club is a
very well established cooperative among shipping companies. These
are all very prestigious programmes that we are very pleased to
have been able to bring into Singapore. These courses enable maritime professionals
to raise their skills to internationally-recognised standards. There
are also other courses that help PMEs from other sectors pick up
relevant skills to make a career switch into the maritime sector.
MPA and its partners will continue to widen the reach of these programmes,
and identify other opportunities to facilitate more PMEs entering the
maritime sector.</p>

to attract and develop talent, we need maritime companies to also
invest in human capital development. This is why MPA set up the
$50 million Maritime Cluster Fund for Manpower Development. This
Fund can be used by maritime companies to support staff development
efforts. One such company that has benefited is local shipbroking
firm, Eastport Maritime, an SME that employs about 60 people in
Singapore. It received funding to support and send an Assistant
Manager, Sharon Teo, to its Shanghai office in 2009 to broaden her
industry knowledge and sharpen her business skills. Sharon joined
Eastport immediately after graduating and she has no seafaring experience.
Sharon was subsequently promoted and currently leads the company's
Research &amp; Analysis Department. Since 2008, the Maritime Cluster Fund

more than 1,200 companies.</p>

I would like to thank the Minister and Minister of State for their
replies. On the point of public transport fare structure, the Minister
mentioned that between 2006 and 2011, the public transport fares
actually only rose by 0.3%, cumulatively. That is correct. So, it
is not annually but cumulatively − only 0.3%, whereas fuel and wages
rose by 20-odd percent or 30-odd percent. I think that presupposes
that the starting point in 2006, the returns with which PTOs were
enjoying at 2006 was a fair and risk commensurate one. It is only
if you start from that position can you then say that because revenue
rises more slowly than costs, the PTOs have to be compensated. But
I checked the numbers. I think in 2006, the two public transport
operators' return on invested capital was about 12% to 15%. And
even in 2011, after the fact that revenue has risen more slowly
than their costs of operations, their returns, in my view, are still
fair and reasonable. I would like to ask the Minister what, in his
view, is a fair return for companies like these, and what kind of
levels of returns would be considered reasonable?</p>

I thank Mr Cedric Foo for the clarification. Indeed, that was one
of the factors that the Public Transport Council took into account
over the years, when they looked at the amount of fare increase
to award or, in some instances, actually to bring about a reduction
in the fares because of economic considerations.</p>

and compare the transport companies to the utility companies and,
therefore, it would be right to say that while it is declining,
and it has declined over the years, the ROTA for these companies
are on the relatively high side. Part of the reason for this is
because of the way we have structured rail financing in the past,
which allows the companies to operate assets and derive revenue
from these assets, without them being on their books, meaning that
they remain on the books of the LTA. Because in the licence agreement
that was derived back in the nineties, the operators only need to
buy over the assets after a certain point in time, hence, what has
happened is that they enjoy the use of these assets in the meantime
while the assets are not yet on their books. This is a situation
that increasingly, going forward, will be different from what it
is today because they do have to buy over the assets.</p>

will be different, also going forward, is because of the rail financing
framework and the amended Act was passed in 2010, which actually
changes what it is today from the Government being the planner and
developer and the PTOs being the owner and operator, to the Government
being the planner, developer and owner and the operators being the
operator.</p>

Downtown Line that was put through a competitive tender process

it is for them now to pay a licence charge comprising a fixed as

Thank you, Mr Chairman. There is a formula which addresses the fact
that operators are leasing in or paying royalty charge, as opposed
to owning the assets and, that is, return on invested capital. This
formula does not appear in the current fare structure and I take
pains to talk about this because the formula will be reviewed and,
as the Minister said, the Committee will be chaired by Mr Richard Magnus.

on invested capital as opposed to the ROTA that has been used in
the formula in the past, as a check, has been quite good actually.
They were moderating in the teens and, even in 2009, the returns
on invested capital of both the operators were not affected by the
global financial crisis, and it reflects the underlying low risks
which such companies were operating in. My question for the Minister
is relating to the point that he talked about – asset ownership.
In response to my question on the funding of the buses, could he
clarify, for the 550 buses that the Government will provide, would
the Government continue to own these assets and would it then lease these
assets to the PTOs, or would it actually sell the assets to the
PTOs?</p>

point on the fare formula and whether it should be ROTA or ROIC,
I think that is something that the Committee can look into, in light
of the work that they will do to come up with a new fare formula
that will be applicable in 2013. Today, ROTA is used as a check.
I think he is familiar with the formula. It takes into consideration
inflation, it takes into consideration wages, but there is a productivity extraction
that we get from the operators in order to incentivise them to become
more productive.</p>

funding of the buses. This is a programme that will run for 10 years.
So, the buses will be owned by the operators and, after 10 years,
if we do not continue with the programme, there are two options.
One is that they return the buses to the Government or they will
buy over the buses at their residual value. That is the way it is
structured.</p>

the Minister for his response to my point about Saturday ERP charges
in the Orchard Road shopping district and the CBD. He said that he
is prepared to, and I quote him, "fine-tune the system" and that
he will make a decision pending the outcome of a LTA report. Well,
I hope it is not a fine-tuning but a major tuning. My first clarification
is: when is this LTA report due? Obviously, given the prospect of
a slowing economy, I think the earlier we can come to a decision,
it will be good for all the businesses in the areas that I mentioned

I hope that when he considers the options, the options should include
the one which I mentioned, that is, a pilot phase. I want to stress,
a pilot phase to remove this for a period of time. If it does not
achieve the results – but I think it will − then by all means, we
go back to the current system. When we do that, I am equally sure
that the key associations that I spoke to − the Singapore Retailers'
Association, the Marina Bay Business Association and the Orchard
Road Business Association − they and their members will fully understand.
So, I hope the Minister can address this.</p>

when the study by LTA is due, it is a matter of a few months. So,
I do expect them to look at it carefully and to conclude their study
very soon. I hear his point about a pilot to remove it completely.
Indeed, it may be, so that the merchants would fully support this.
I am mindful that there are a variety of users and a variety of
perspectives that we need to take into consideration, rather than
allow one perspective to determine exactly what it is that we may
want to do. I want to make sure that we are also taking on board
other perspectives as well. Hence, when I said that I am not in
favour of a wholesale removal of the ERP, it is because of my concern
of us reverting to the period of congestion that we experienced
prior to 2005 in the Orchard Road area.</p>

while, after the introduction of ERP in 2005, we did not see any
significant variation in the vehicles in the Orchard Road area,
there was a significant drop in those who used it as a thoroughfare
connecting to the Bras Basah area. I am mindful of not reverting
to a situation where we increase congestion levels significantly
because people, who are using it as a thoroughfare, will come in
and congest with those who may, otherwise, be coming in for shopping
and recreational purposes. My preference is to make sure that whatever
we do, we preserve the element of choice. ERP-free hours where there
is possibly more congestion and motorists who want to use it during
those hours can choose to do so, and hours with ERP in operation where
those who are prepared to pay a certain price, will do so.</p>

decision of somebody who chooses to drive in and pay the parking
charges in Orchard Road? This is something that needs to be looked
at carefully. As I said, I am prepared to look at how we can fine-tune,
whether slightly or significantly, but I want to preserve the element

the Finance Minister announced the carbon-emission based system
and I am very happy to see the categories A, B, C that you have
labelled. Why not re-categorise the entire COE system based on the
current categories now ‒ A, B and C? And that would obtain immediate
buy-in from the public because you will have fixed numbers in Category
A, fixed numbers in Category B and fixed numbers in Category C.
And let the market forces decide whether they want to go green.
And, definitely, you have a fixed number. Can the Minister elaborate?</p>

you, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister about the CEVS system.
Is there an intention to include motorcycles in that type of approach?
I know they may

a low carbon-based form of transport, as far as possible, I wonder

again, I just wanted to clarify a few points with the Minister. I
do appreciate the work of the Ministries and the agencies. I think
Singapore is one of the most amenable cities to cycling but I am
in the minority in that view. With respect to the studies that he
quoted about the safety issues with cycling lanes, I wonder if there
is some confusion about what I am suggesting. My understanding from
the examples cited was that those were studies where there is a
separation of traffic, so there is a specific cycling lane and a
specific car lane which leads to this false sense of security because the
car can swerve one way and the cyclist can swerve another way. That
is not what I am suggesting. I am suggesting measures to help people
share the existing lanes better and so the false sense of security
should not happen.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-12781c65-05e3-45f5-a9e8-4cc0c9d678e2"><!--a--></a>The other reason for potential
decrease in safety in the studies, if these studies are right that
I believe he cited, where there are separated lanes, is the Bernoulli
principle where a very rapidly moving vehicle causes a pressure
wave which can unbalance the cyclist. So that again, it only happens
where you have a separation of flow because the traffic in the right-hand
lane continues at high speed and the cyclist is affected. That is not
what I am suggesting because here the cyclists have to be overtaken
by the car and so, in this case, any change in safety from the Bernoulli
effect would actually be improved by the increased clearance.</p>

                  </span>: I thank
Dr Janil for that clarification. Indeed, we are talking about markings
on the lanes rather than a segregated lane. Those studies in the
1980s, and which we are very happy to share with the Member, referred
to what has been done in European cities where they actually mark
out a line, a visual guide on the same road space rather than segregated
lane. I found it very interesting that the accident rates went up
so I asked LTA to further explain this to me. One of the reasons,
in fact, I think that the studies themselves cited was that, there
was what they thought the complacency factor. Today, you will find
that by and large, motorists do give quite a wide berth to the cyclists.
As wide a berth as we can. With a visual marking, one may think
that as long as I keep to that visual marking, I have given 1.5
metres and I have done what is necessary. For experienced cyclists,
that 1.5 metres may well be sufficient. But where you have somebody
who is relatively inexperienced and wobbles a little bit, actually
it might end up a little bit more dangerous. So, that is part of
what they explained to me: why in the European experiments, it actually
resulted in more accidents. We will be happy to share some of that
with the Member and to see what we can do further together. </p>

                  </span>: Thank you
very much, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah. For the programme that we talk about
under the BSEP, basically, it is going to be over the next five
years, doing what the operators did in 20 years. So, we compressed
that into a five-year programme – 800 buses. There are competing
priorities: one, the existing routes that we need to improve. Routes
parallel to the MRT lines that people have been asking for, and which
we will do during the morning peaks, as well as the other new routes
that I mentioned. Seventy percent of those buses are going to be
brought in within the next three years, by end 2014. So, 70% of
what we hope to do is going to be done within the next three years.
The priority is to improve the existing routes, feeders as well
as trunks, what I have talked about. It does not mean that we are
neglecting the new routes, they will be done, but they are also
going to be progressively rolled out over five years. I know more
Members will lobby me even harder; it has already begun. I will
listen to you but, as I mentioned, it has got to be phased in over
time.</p>

what were the other options, including whether a third operator
could be brought in to do this. The challenge is such and let me
explain it. We have 300 buses that are going to augment the existing
routes, better frequencies, more capacity and so on. We have 260
routes today. We believe that about half of them will require augmentation
in one form or another. So, you are essentially adding, maybe, a couple
of buses to each route to complement what the operators are themselves
putting in today. It is actually very difficult for a new operator
to come in and try to merge the one or two additional buses for
each route with what the current operators are doing. It is very
difficult. And so those buses, you really have to pass them on to
the current operators, SMRT and SBST, to bring about improvements
in the bus services.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-da1fbde2-7344-479c-8fb0-103701a42018"><!--a--></a>For the other 250 buses
that will go towards serving the new routes, these will be geographically
dispersed because there are needs in many areas. There are 87 of
you here, and all of you would want to try and ask for something
for your own constituencies and GRCs, and I see that, too. This
means that you have 250 buses that are geographically dispersed
throughout the country, in all likelihood. The difficulty is what do
you do for the depots and parking? If you disperse them, it means
that your overheads of running multiple depots and bus parks are
going to be high. If you concentrate it, it means that you have
a lot of dead mileage because you have got to deploy the buses to
the start points and bring them back. There is, inherently, a difficulty in
exploring a third operator to run these routes. What we want to
do is to make sure that the bus financials are fundamentally sound.
We will look at parcelling out packages of routes that we can put
out for competitive tendering and that is the longer term intention of
the Ministry.</p>

                  </span>: I would
like to ask the Minister this: earlier, he mentioned that there will
be three locations in the third quarter that he would install sound
barriers. First, what are the three locations? And if a decision
has not been made as to which are the three locations – I have made
reference to places, such as the Ang Mo Kio MRT Station, which is
neighbouring Bishan – could he also consider those as options to
deploy sound barriers?</p>

                  </span>: Okay, the
three locations are at Tampines, Jurong East and Toh Guan. They
are different from what we have done today. So, I just use Toh Guan
as an example. In Toh Guan, you actually have tracks that are merging
and diverging. And that is
quite different from what we have done in the Jurong East Modification
Programme where the sound barriers are just by the side of the track
as well as at Bishan Station where it is a portal that is coming
out from the underground into the open and there is a trumpeting
effect. So we are choosing these three additional locations in order
to experiment with different configurations, recognising also that,
in certain instances, the cost of the larger area that we have to
cover is going to be more significant than what we have done so
far. I hear your point about Ang Mo Kio. I will ask LTA to get in
touch with you to better understand your situation. But as it stands
now, this is what they are planning to do. </p>

Mr Chairman. At last I have caught your eye. Sir, I like to seek
clarification from Minister on the transport fees hike. Minister
earlier said that and I quote, "Rising costs pressures for PTOs
are inevitable". May I ask the Minister how does he reassure commuters
on their concerns on transport fare hike? I asked earlier in my speech
whether PTOs will be allowed to resort to increasing transport fares
for their profitability, should they prove to be inefficient or
unproductive. And Minister said that MOT would scrutinise PTOs closely
but Minister also said that ‒</p>

catch your eye any more tonight, Sir. Thank you very much. Minister
also said that internal matters, when he referred to wages or remuneration,
are for PTOs themselves to deal with. Therefore, I am not convinced
for I am concerned how PTOs are going to have any say on private
entities and, therefore, have any control on future transport fare
hikes, despite the $1.1 billion funding by the Government.</p>

                  </span>: Basically,
the $1.1 billion is ring-fenced for the 550 buses. So, the $1.1
billion is not going to be used in any way for their existing 4,000
buses, nor for the 250 buses that they will bring in on their own.
The operations of that are for the PTOs to deal with. $1.1 billion
is strictly for the 550 buses.</p>

which was the Member's other point, how do we deal with it? Well,
if you know, there is a formula, you apply the formula and PTC exercises judgement
on whether to give the full extent of what the formula allows to
the operators. Certainly, I believe in the last five years, they
have not done so.</p>

the point that was raised by Mr Baey Yam Keng, the PTC also, together

close eye on the affordability, and affordability, we look at the
second quintile, from 21st percentile to the 40th percentile of
households, and how much of their household income is spent on transport.
If you look at it, in part, because the transport fares have cumulatively
increased by 0.3% from 2006 to 2011, the percentage of household
income for that 2nd quintile spent on transport has gone down from
more than 5% to now, the last, I believe, it was 3.7% of household
income. That is some indicator of the affordability of transport
fares.</p>

or families that have specific needs, we also give out transport
vouchers, and, indeed, there were 200,000 transport vouchers that
were made available as part of last year's fare increase. In fact,
we went out for two exercises to give out the vouchers because the
first exercise, we gave out 100,000 vouchers and so we went out
for the second exercise after the fare increase was introduced.</p>
