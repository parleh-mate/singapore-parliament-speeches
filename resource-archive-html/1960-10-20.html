<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>CITY COUNCIL EMPLOYEES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Non-Singapore citizens)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister  what is the total number of City  Council

employees  who  are not citizens of Singapore,  and

the  total  amount of salaries and allowances  paid

monthly  to such employees; and whether it  is  the

Government's  intention to  retain  such  employees

until they reach the retirement age.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker, I have been asked by the Prime Minister to

reply to this question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are approximately 3,789 City Council

employees  who are not citizens of Singapore.  They

are  in  receipt  of  salaries  and  allowances  of

approximately  $713,586 each  month.  Although  the

Government  is conscious of the need  to  safeguard

the  employment opportunities of its citizens under

healthy   economic  circumstances,  the  Government

hopes  to continue employment until retirement  age

of  all  its  good workers although they  are  non-citizens.

<div align="center"><b>STREET LIGHTING IN RURAL AREAS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister  if  he  will  make  a  statement  on  the

Government's  plans  to provide street-lighting  in

all  the rural areas, and approximately when  those

plans will be fully implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker, I have been asked by the Prime Minister to

reply to this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any programme for street lighting in rural areas

must take into account (1) population density,  (2)

traffic, (3) availability of electrical supply, and

(4) the cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priorities have to be drawn up taking these

factors into account. I am able to supply the  hon.

Member  with  a list showing the number  of  street

lights  in  the programme for 1960. Copies  of  the

list* will be tabled for

circulation to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Appendix I, cols. 821-2.

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1960/19601020/19601020-HA-0130821.pdf"">Appendix I-STREET LIGHTING IN RURAL AREAS (Cols 0821-0822)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class A street lights are from 250 to 400 watts

and  are  installed on main roads at a  maintenance

fee  of  $16  per month. Class B street lights  are

below  250  watts  and  are  installed  on  housing

estates and lesser roads at a maintenance fee of $9

per  month. Kampong lights are ordinary  lights  of

about  80  watts at a maintenance  fee  of  $9  per

month. By this programme, 187 Class A, 481 Class  B

and  309  Kampong  type street  lights  are  to  be

installed this year of which 24 Class A, 164  Class

B  and  40 Kampong type have been installed  and  a

further 130 special street lights, being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



the balance of the Class A lights, are on order for

the  Airport  Road. Street lighting for  the  rural

areas  this  year will cost $521,000.  The  Kampong

type   lighting  is  for  the  benefit  of  Kampong

dwellers and is a new programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to say that a street lighting

programme  is ever completed, as it is a continuous

process over the years according to population  and

development   trends  and  is,   therefore,   never

completed.  A  similar amount  of  money  has  been

entered  in  the Estimates for 1961 for the  street

lighting programme.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT LAND ON PULAU BUKUM KECHIL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Lease to Shell Company)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b> asked the

Prime  Minister whether the Government proposes  to

lease Government land on Pulau Bukum Kechil to  the

Shell  Company;  when will the lease  be  effected;

whether the present occupants of such land will  be

moved  off,  when and to where; what  will  be  the

number  of  families  that will  be  affected;  and

whether,  and  how, the Government will  compensate

those people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker,  I  have  also been  asked  by  the  Prime

Minister to reply to this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shell Company have applied for approximately

8½  acres  of land adjoining their own land  (17.65

acres)   for   future  expansion.  There   are   18

inhabitants  living  on the  land  under  Temporary

Occupation Licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shell Company have indicated that they are

prepared  to  pay compensation for the resettlement

of these inhabitants if they are given a lease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application is under consideration. Suitable

arrangements  for resettlement and/or  compensation

to   those  affected  would  be  made  before   any

alienation is approved.

<div align="center"><b>FERRY SERVICE FACILITIES FOR ISLANDERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohamad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohamad Akib</b> asked the

Prime  Minister whether he is aware  of  difficulty

experienced by residents of St. John's  Island  and

Pulau  Sakijang Pelepah in travelling to  and  from

Singapore, and what steps he has taken or will take

to  improve  the  ferry service facilities  between

those Islands and Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua) (for the Deputy Prime</b>

<b>Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by

the   Deputy  Prime  Minister  to  reply  to   this

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a regular ferry service between St.

John's  Island  and  Singapore.  Marine  Department

launches  leave St. John's at 6 a.m.,  10.30  a.m., 2.30  p.m. and  7.15  p.m., and  from  the  Master

Attendant's Pier at 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 6.45  p.m.,

all  on  week-days only. This service is  primarily

for school children and Government staff working on

St.  John's  Island. However, islanders  from  both

islands,  St.  John's and Pulau  Sakijang  Pelepah,

also have the benefit of this free service provided

the  passenger  capacity is not  exceeded - which  is

rarely the case except on festive occasions. If the

capacity  is exceeded, the islanders will  have  to

make  alternative  arrangements or  use  their  own

boats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new proposal now under consideration by the

Marine Department is for the early introduction  of

a  commercial service along the same lines  as  the

private service operating between Changi and  Pulau

Tekong Besar. The new service will be according  to

a fixed schedule, at rates yet to be decided.

<div align="center"><b>SWEEPSTAKES DUTY COLLECTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Finance  how  much  duty  on  sweepstakes  was

collected  (i) from 1st January to 31st May,  1960,

and (ii) from 1st June to 31st August, 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck) (for the Minister for</b>

<b>Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, I have been asked to reply

to the question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The duty collected on sweepstakes from 1st

January to 31st May, 1960, was $1,213,656, and (ii)

the  duty  collected from 1st June to 31st  August,

1960, was $840,809.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty collected from 1st June to 31st August

does  not include all the monies collected  as  tax

from   the   August  season  which  extended   into

September.  The  figure  therefore  for  the   full

season,  1st  June  to  30th September,  1960, was

$972,226.30.

<div align="center"><b>WORK BRIGADE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b> asked the

Minister   for  Labour  and  Law  to  state,   with

reference  to  the Work Brigade,  how  are  persons

recruited;  the  total number  of  persons  in  the

Brigade as at 31st August, 1960; of this total  how

many are members of the People's Action Party;  the

nature  of work the Brigade is doing; and in  which

parts  of  Singapore Island are the  various  units

stationed.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> To the first part of the

question, "how are persons recruited" into the Work

Brigade, the reply is that they were recruited from

the  Special Squad before it was wound up  on  30th

September, 1960, and from those who are willing  to

work  on  national development projects  under  the

discipline  of  work  camps.  If  those   who   are

interested offer themselves for this work  and  are

considered  suitable by an interviewing  committee,

they  are  selected.  The  original  batch  of  men

officers  was selected from members of the  Special

Squad,  who completed a course of training  at  the

Singapore Military Force Ulu Pandan camp,  and  the

women officers were selected from those who offered

themselves  for  this work after  training  at  the

Police  Training  School.  Future  men  and   women

officers  will be selected from serving members  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



Brigade of proved ability, and their selection  has

to  be  approved  by the Ministerial  Committee  in

charge of the Work Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second part of the question, "the total

number of persons in the Brigade as at 31st August,

1960" was 1,073.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the third part of the question, "of this total

how many are members of the People's Action Party",

the   answer   is  that  recruitment   depends   on

suitability  and vacancies, and not on  a  person's

Party  affiliations.  Therefore,  we  do  not  keep

records of Party affiliations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fourth part of the question, to indicate

"the  nature  of  work"  on which  members  of  the

Brigade are engaged, this is the type of work  that

they do:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) widening of streams and digging new channels

for such streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) constructing weirs across streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) erecting prefabricated and prototype

structures which house the members of the Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) masonry work, carpentry, plumbing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) constructing link roads, including side

tables, kerbs, side drains and metalling of roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) clearing building sites, making agricultural

roads, side drains and other earth works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) drainage work in resettlement areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) vegetable farming and poultry rearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) preparing building sites for resettlement

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fifth part of the question, asking for an

indication  as  to which parts of Singapore  Island

are  units of the Brigade stationed, the answer  is

that they are now stationed at Pasir Ris,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



Jalan  Kaki  Bukit, Paya Lebar Airport, Jurong  13½

milestone,  Andrew  Avenue  in  Sembawang,  and  at

Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Are there no units

stationed in the Southern Islands, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have mapped out a

number  of projects which will engage the attention

of  the Brigade from now till the end of the  year.

Fifteen such projects are being mapped out, and  we

have   so  far  been  working  on  seven  of  these

projects. These projects co not include any work at

present in the Southern Islands.

<div align="center"><b>(Statistics)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for Home Affairs how many persons, classified under

countries of origin, acquired the status of citizen

of  Singapore (i) by registration under section  9,

and  (ii) by naturalization under section 15 of the

Singapore  Citizenship Ordinance, 1957, during  the

period 1st July, 1959, to 31st August, 1960.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

regretted    that    the   information    regarding

classification  of  citizens  under  countries   of

origin  is  not available, and no such records  are

kept in the Citizenship Registry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No separate figures were also kept prior to 1st

January,  1960,  of  persons registered  under  the

various   sections  of  the  Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the above in mind, from 1st July, 1959,

to  31st  December, 1959, a total of 8,195  persons

were  registered  as citizens under  the  Singapore

Citizenship Ordinance. From 1st January,  1960, to

31st  August,  1960, a total of 5,049 persons  were

registered   under  section  9  and   885   persons

registered  under  section  15  of  the   Singapore

only  303  trained  teachers, the  balance  of  297

teachers being only trainee teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the teaching of Malay in English and Chinese

medium schools, the position was pathetic when this

Government took office. Statistics show that  there

were  only 34 Malay teachers. As the present  total

school  population, excluding those  in  the  Malay

schools,  is about 320,000, it is not practical  to

talk  of  making the National Language a compulsory

subject  in  our font-Malay schools at the  present

time.  But  the new Government wasted  no  time  in

getting on with the task of providing the teachers.

Language  classes  were started  in  the  Teachers'

Training   College,   and  the   Ministry   devised

examinations to ensure that accepted standards were

established.  To date, two examinations  have  been

held,  and a total of 2,718 teachers, of whom 2,304

are  from the English medium, 409 from the  Chinese

medium,  and 5 from the Tamil medium, have sat  for

the  Std. I examination, while 41 teachers, of whom

31  are  from  the English medium and 10  from  the

Chinese medium, have sat for their Std. II



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



examination,  and 2 teachers have sat  the  highest

examination,  which  is  Std.  III. In  the   next

examination in March 1961, it is expected that  306

teachers,  of  whom 201 will be  from  the  English

medium, 101 from the Chinese medium and 4 from  the

Tamil  medium, will sit for the Std. I examination,

while 1,113 teachers, of whom 845 will be from  the

English medium, 264 from the Chinese medium  and  4

from  the  Tamil medium, will sit for the  Std.  II

examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional advice which I have received on

the  teaching  of the Malay language  is  that  for

teaching in primary schools, a teacher should  have

obtained   at   least  a  Pass  in  the   Std.   II

examination, and to teach in secondary  schools  it

is  desirable that teachers should have passed  the

Std.  III  examination. I am also advised  that  to

provide  adequate  instruction for  all  pupils  in

schools, it would be necessary to have on the staff

of  each school at least one teacher in every three

who  is proficient in Malay. This, in terms of  our

present  staffing  figure,  means  at  least  4,000

teachers  proficient in Malay, but  if  account  is

taken,   as   it   must  be  taken,   of   staffing

requirements in other respects, then the figure  of

teachers of Malay is likely to be nearer the  6,000

mark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when there are enough teachers and facilities

to  teach the National Language in all schools will

the teaching be made compulsory in all schools.

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sailors' Institute, commonly known as Connell

House,   was   established  in  1924,   under   the

provisions  of  the  Singapore  Sailors'  Institute

Incorporation Ordinance (Chapter 321 of the Revised

Edition), to provide accommodation and recreational

facilities  for  members of the  mercantile  marine

using   this   port.  Being  the   only   statutory

institution providing such facilities at that time,

it  was necessary to have some system of priorities

in   dealing  with  a  large  number  of   visiting

seafarers seeking accommodation there. Hence it was

provided  in  section 4 of the  Singapore  Sailors'

Institute  Incorporation Ordinance that  preference

was  to  be given in all cases to British subjects.

But  as  a  result  of the general improvement  and

expansion in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



accommodation facilities at the Sailors' Institute,

and  after the establishment of the Singapore Asian

Seamen's  Club, it has been found  that  it  is  no

longer  necessary for any such system of priorities

to be adhered to, and accordingly this preferential

treatment has, in practice, been discarded over the

last few years. Therefore, the Government seeks, in

clause 2 of the Bill presently before the House, to

regularise the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in the past, it was common for all

matters   connected  with  shipping   and   seamen,

regardless  of  whether they  were  concerned  with

technical   matters   of  port  administration   or

shipping,   or  merely  recreational   or   welfare

activities,  to  be  left under the  administrative

control   of  the  Master  Attendant.  Under   such

circumstances,  the  Master Attendant,  a  nautical

officer who should only be concerned with technical

matters, was, under the provisions of the Singapore

Sailors' institute incorporation Ordinance, charged

with  responsibility for management of the Sailors'

Institute in his ex-officio capacity of Chairman of

the Committee of Management appointed under section

7   thereof.  With  all  seamen's  welfare  matters

recently transferred to my Ministry, the Government

seeks,  through  clause  3 of  the  Bill  presently

before the House, powers to enable, me, as Minister

in  charge,  to  appoint a member of the  Committee

other  than the Master Attendant to be chairman  of

the  Sailors' Institute Committee. This would leave

the  Master  Attendant  free  to  devote  his  full

attention  to  those  technical  duties  for  which

purpose he has been appointed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all shipping and seamen's matters were in the

Attendant,  the  Singapore  Asian  Seamen's   Club,

which, provided   accommodation   as   well    as

recreational  facilities  for  visiting  and  local

Asian  seamen, was also left under his charge.  For

this  reason,  the  Singapore Asian  Seamen's  Club

Incorporation Ordinance, Chapter 319 of the Revised

Edition, provides under section 7 thereof  for  the

administration and management, of the  Club  to  be

vested  in a Committee of Management of 12  members

with   the   Master  Attendant  as  its  ex-officio

Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are aware that the Master  Attendant

is  a nautical officer with technical knowledge and

experience  of  port administration,  shipping  and

other related matters. The Government feels that it

would  be  a  waste of such technical knowledge  to

responsibilities  for running  the  Asian  Seamen's

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion standing  in

the name of the Prime Minister, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to section 19 of the

Rubber  Dealers  Ordinance (Chapter 199),  resolves

that the grant by the Prime Minister to the Malayan

Rubber Export Registration Board of total exemption

from all the provisions of the said Ordinance or of

any rules made thereunder, with effect from the 1st

day  of September, 1960, as contained in Paper S.L.

28 of 1960, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion is the result of an

application   from   the  Malayan   Rubber   Export

Registration  Board  for total exemption  from  the

provisions  of  the Rubber Dealers Ordinance.  This

Ordinance,  which  controls  dealings  in   rubber,

requires licences for the purchase of rubber, or to

treat or store rubber, prescribe duties on licences

and  impose  penalties for breach of the provisions

of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is a

pan-Malayan statutory body set up under and for the

purpose  of  administering the Rubber Shipping  and

Packing   Control  Ordinances  of  the   State   of

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. One of  the

duties  of  the Board is to ensure that the  rubber

packed and exported from Malaya is of the grade and

quality  contracted  for, and generally  to  ensure

honest shipment. Accordingly it examines and  deals

with  quality  and other complaints  received  from

overseas  buyers  of  rubber from  Malaya.  In  the

course of its duties, the Board receives samples of

rubber complained about which, after the complaints

have  been  dealt  with,  are  either  retained  or

disposed  of  locally  by the  Board.  It  is  more

desirable  that  the Board, as a disciplinary  body

with quasi judicial powers, should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



maintain  a  position of dignity and  prestige  and

command   the   respect  of   the   rubber   trade.

Accordingly it is appropriate that it should not be

required  to  be  licensed as  an  ordinary  rubber

dealer.  In order to perform its functions  without

contravening the Ordinance, the Board  seeks  total

exemption under the provisions of section 19 of the

Rubber Dealers Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 19 provides that such exemption may be

granted  by  the Minister but shall not  come  into

force until it has been approved by the Legislative

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to section 19 of the

Rubber  Dealers  Ordinance (Chapter 199),  resolves

that the grant by the Prime Minister to the Malayan

Rubber Export Registration Board of total exemption

from all the provisions of the said Ordinance or of

any rules made thereunder, with effect from the 1st

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges the Government to take

immediate   steps  to  Malayanise  all   expatriate

administrative officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is one of Hong Lim's 16 resolutions. I

am  grateful,  Sir,  that I  am  being  given  this

opportunity to debate this issue in this  Assembly.

It  is indeed absurd to find it necessary for me to

introduce   this  motion  five  years   after   the

publication  of  the  report of the  Malayanisation

Commission, one of whose members on the  Government

benches  is  the Minister for Culture. It  is  even

more  absurd to find it necessary to urge  the  so-called  P.A.P. Government to fulfill and  implement

Malayanisation policies laid down by a Labour Front

Government and endorsed by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the administrative class in the Government provides the key to the power of control

of the State. Let



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



me  just refer to page 25 of the Interim Report  of

the  Malayanisation  Commission,  which  quoted  an

extract  from "The Civil Service Today"  by  T.  A.

Critchley. It is about the administrative class  in

a modern state. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the modern administrative civil servants are the

permanent links between the Cabinet and the bulk of

the   Civil  Service.  They  are  the  "intelligent

amateurs" to whom the day-to-day government of  the

country  is  entrusted.  They  are  concerned  with

policy,  with  directing  the  business  of   whole

Departments, with  preparing new  legislation  and

drafting  regulations and circulars, with assisting

and  advising  Ministers in the  conduct  of  their

Parliamentary   business,  and   above   all   with

constructive  long-term  thinking   and   the   co-ordination of the activities of government.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this shows the importance of the administrative class. The expatriate administrative

officials very often occupy top positions  in  this

administrative class - that is, in the administrative

class  hierarchy.  There  is  no  need  to  further

emphasise   the   vital   importance   of   British

administrative officials in the power of the State.

It  is  sufficient to say that they are the  people

who  keep  the  Union Jack flying in the  colonies.

They run the British Empire. Our Prime Minister  is

aware  of  this  position. In  1956,  he  said,  in

Hansard Volume 2, No. 15, dated 5th December, 1956,

column 1088:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is little time left for us to take over the

whole  apparatus of state and to make  it  function

more  efficiently  than it did under  the  colonial

system.   In   this   apparatus   of   state    the

administrators are a decisive factor.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on 5th December, 1956, the Prime

Minister  said - please  refer  to  column  1080   of

Hansard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...the major recommendations of this White Paper'-



<br><br>The  Prime  Minister was referring in 1956  to  the White  Paper  on  the Malayanisation  statement  of

policy  of  the Lim Yew Hock Government  (Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 65 of 1956):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...the major recommendations of this White Paper

were  acceptable to most Members of the Opposition,

namely  the  acceptance of the principle  that  the

control  room  of the civil service will  be  taken

away  from  the white man and put into local  hands

immediately.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...We are not supporting this statement of policy

because  we  believe that if this  White  Paper  is

implemented   Malayanisation   will    become    an

accomplished fact. We support it because  once  the

principle  of  handing over  the  control  room  is

accepted and implemented, then the flood gates  are

opened, and the white men will be swept out of  all

positions of administrative control in the next few

years.  That  is why we have accepted in  principle

the  statement  of policy laid down in  this  White

Paper.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, we never make quotations out  of

context  and  try  to  destroy the  meaning.  These

speeches of the Prime Minister were made four years

ago.  Yes,  Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  the  correct

basic  stand on this issue of Malayanisation to  be

taken  by  every  true and loyal  patriot  of  this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, the Malayanisation Commission - please

refer  to  page  29  of  its interim  report - stated

categorically   that   the,  whole   administrative

service   of  the  Singapore  Government   can   be

Malayanised   in   two   years.   In   1956,    the

Malayanisation  Commission  stated  that   we   can

replace  British administrators with local officers

within  two  years,  that is by  1958.  Why  is  it

necessary for us today to bring up this motion? Why

is  it we still have in Singapore, five years after

the  sitting of this Commission and more  than  one

year  of  the  P.A.P. forming the  Government, the

presence   of  expatriate  administrative  officers

holding  key positions in the State - as a matter  of

fact,  holding more important positions  than  they

did under the Lint Yew Hock Government? Despite the

fact   that   the   Lim   Yew   Hock   Government's

Malayanisation policy had varied in  some  respects

from the recommendations of the Commission, it  was

still generally acceptable and its broad principles

were  accepted  by the P.A.P. and endorsed  by  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar in the  debate  in  this

Assembly   in  1956.  It  is  a  shame  that   this

Malayanisation  issue, which has been  endorsed  by

all  parties concerned, should today be the subject

of  a  debate.  Mr Speaker, Sir, it  is  a  debate

urging  the so-called P.A.P. Government to expedite

Malayanisation  and  also to repatriate  expatriate

officials who are already Malayanised - I repeat "who

are already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



Malayanised" - but whose terms were extended both by

the previous Government and by the present

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since the new Government was formed, it has never made any clear stand on this issue of

Malayanisation,  The  Lim  Yew  Hock   Government's

Malayanisation   policy  of  1956  still   requires

implementation   and  accomplishment.   Could   the

Government  clarify its intentions and  give  us  a

progress  report  of  the Malayanisation  situation

department by department?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, events during the past one

year  have raised doubts in my mind about the Prime

Minister's stand on this important issue. I  simply

cannot  understand  why  we  can  allow  expatriate

officials  to  exercise  so  much  control  in  the

State - in  fact,  to exercise tighter  control  than

they  did  during  the days of  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government. For instance, Mr Speaker, Sir, what is

the    purpose   of   retaining   George   Thomson?

[Interruption].  You  cannot  smile  it  off.   The

Malayanisation  Commission had already  recommended

in  page 37 of its interim report that the post  of

Public Relations Officer (which George Thomson had

occupied  in  1955)  can be  replaced  by  a  local

journalist.   The  Prime  Minister  supported   the

Malayanisation Commission Report. The Lim Yew  Hock

Government's Malayanisation policy laid down,  that

the  post  of  Public Relations  Officer  could  be

retained  for  a  year  and,  according   to   this

statement,   George  Thomson   should   have   been

repatriated in October 1957. However, the  previous

Government  extended  his  stay  till  the  general

elections  in  May  1959.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   we

understand  and forgive the Labour Front Government

for  extending Thomson's stay and contract  despite

its  declared policy, because we, all know that had

Thomson  been dispensed with, many of the Ministers

in  the  previous Government would have been unable

to  make  coherent political speeches. But what  we

cannot  understand is why should George Thomson  be

retained under a P.A.P. Government? Does he provide

the same services?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> After quoting extensively

from me, you -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I will come back to that, Mr

Prime Minister. He wrote your speech at the opening

of the Art Exhibition for India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister supported both the White Paper and the Malayanisation Report on this matter. It

has  also been pledged in the general elections  to

the  people that George Thomson must go under'  the

P.A.P. regime.  But  is that  the  case?  No,  Mr

Speaker.  George Thomson is still  here,  going  as

strong as Johnny Walker! In fact, he is occupying a

far more important position than he ever did in the

previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are not interested in, attacking personalities. Since the P.A.P. crisis, we have

confined   our  debates  on  principles   and,   on

political  issues.  We wish to make  it  manifestly

clear  that  in  today's debate on  the  expatriate

officials we are not making any comment on them  as

private  individuals  but only  in  so  far  as  it

involves  their  official duties. These  expatriate

officers may be honest and capable officers.  If  I

may  say  this, all these fights boil down  to  the

struggle  for political power between  the  British

colonialists on the one hand and the people on  the

other  as  to  who  shall guide our  destinies  and

decide  our  fate.  Once upon  a  time,  the  Prime

Minister  liked to attack harshly and  ridicu1e  on

this  side  of  the  House the private  persons  of

expatriates like Goode, Sutherland and  others.  He

once remarked that he would kick the white men  out

into  the  sea.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  we, are, not

interested in driving any people into the sea,  for

that  matter  the  British included,  We  are  only

interested in putting an end to this evil system of

colonialism. And for that matter, all  the  peoples

in  the world, particularly in Asia and Africa, are

now   up   in   arms   against  this   system   of

colonialism - an   evil  system  of   political   and

economic  exploitation by Imperialist countries  of

subject  peoples,  of human indignities  and  moral

disgrace.  Was it not so long ago that  the  United

Nations  adopted  a  unanimous  decision   to   end

colonialism as a clear declaration of the wishes of

all the peoples? We are fighting a system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



and  not  its individuals. British individuals  can

remain here as friends but not as masters. Why  did

the  Prime  Minister several years ago  attack  the

British in a personal way about their comforts  and

their  clubs here? Was it because he admired  their

privileges? However, once he himself enjoyed  those

same  privileges when he became Prime  Minister  he

ceased  to  fight  and those whom he  had  attacked

suddenly  became  his close friends - as  the  saying

goes: "A friend, guide and philosopher."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, so today, Mr Thomson became a friend, guide and philosopher of our Prime

Minister. The Prime Minister wanted to retain  him.

Why?  I  am  still searching for the  key  to  this

riddle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You have forgotten Meadows!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> We will come to him later on,

We  will  go slowly, and take in every one of  them

step by step, Mr Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few months of the new Government,

the  Prime Minister indicated his desire to  retain

George  Thomson. He said that he would  be  a  good

ghost  writer  and  that he would provide  research

material for speeches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. I

absolve  the  Member for Hong Lim from any  secrecy

because I make no secret of this. I would like  him

to  quote the time, place and instance where I ever

said such a foolish thing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is such a blatant lie.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister must not

rise on a point of order and then not speak to  the

point of order. If it was a point of clarification,

he  should have said so and it would be up  to  the

Member for Hong Lim to give way. It is not a  point

of order. Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Then on a point of

clarification



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if a statement is made

which is a blatant lie -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the Prime

Minister  is  probably a bit excited, but  he  must

know that "a blatant lie" said of an expression  of

a   Member   of   this   Assembly   is   completely

unparliamentary.  He must not use  that  expression

even if he thinks it is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I then, in more cultured

and  genteel terms, say that if an untruth  uttered

in  this  Assembly in the presence of  someone  who

knows  it to be an untruth goes unchallenged,  then

it will be believed? I therefore deem it my duty to

say  that it is out of order for any Member of this

House -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister is

probably challenging the ruling of the Chair and he

cannot   do  that.  The  Prime  Minister   has   an

opportunity to speak, in one of two ways: one is to

ask  for clarification if the Member speaking gives

way; and the second is to wait until it is his turn

to speak. I do not know whether the Member for Hong

Lim has given way for clarification. He appears  to

have given way for clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I have, very simply, the

time,   place  and  circumstance  in   which   that

statement was made?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not carry a

tape-recorder whenever the Prime Minister speaks to

me,  nor  do I keep a diary of every word he  says.

But later events prove the truth of my charges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The time and place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Prime Minister said that

George  Thomson  would be a good ghost  writer  and

would  provide research material for speech-making.

You  should  have  been  more  patient.  Mr  Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Hong

Lim must remember that he is addressing the Chair.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Thomson is a walking

encyclopaedia - better   than    the    Encyclopaedia

Britannica! But it was difficult to retain  him  as

the  Director of Information Services  because  the

duties  of  that post had been taken  over  by  the

newly created post of the Minister for Culture.  So

for  the  first  few  months,  George  Thomson  was

occupying  a  room on the third floor of  the  City

Hall  (the  Prime  Minister being  on  the  second

floor) writing some speeches for the Prime Minister

and  doing  some  staff  training.  Whether  George

Thomson was providing political blueprints for  the

Prime Minister, I am not in a position, however, to

know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it is often believed

that if you repeat a lie often enough, it might  be

passed  off as a truth. I challenge the Member  for

Hong Lim to repeat that outside this Assembly,  and

I  will give him an opportunity to prove it in  the

Courts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan, on the point of

clarification with a challenge, which is partly out

of order!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do believe

that  the  Prime  Minister  does  always  like   to

challenge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Coward!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> You know this is true.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Did I understand the Prime

Minister to call the Member a coward? If he did, he

must    withdraw    the    expression.    It     is

unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I hope the Speaker would

sometimes  not be so sensitive of hearing,  because

there  are a few things which perhaps, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  one  could  often miss in  the  asides  of  a

debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister is

a  bit  unfortunate in that my right ear is not  as

deaf  as my left! But perhaps he will withdraw that

word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I withdraw it in so far

as it connotes moral turpitude. But in so far as it

is  an  involuntary expression of moral indignation

on my part, I am sorry I could not contain myself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, the Prime Minister must

remember that a withdrawal must be unqualified. And

the  word "coward", even by itself, if it connotes

a different meaning, is still unparliamentary. Will

the  Prime  Minister please withdraw, and  withdraw

unqualifiedly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, at your behest, I

withdraw it for the sake of peace and good order of

this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not in

the fortunate position to have four good lawyers to

give  me  free  legal service and a host  of  other

British lawyers who are always willing to give free

service to our Hon the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of further

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Could he tell me who my

moment?  Because I would like to know  where  I  am

getting all this valuable advice from.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> For instance, Mr Green, your

been giving you free legal service.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether Mr

know  whether he likes me! Will the Member  please

remember that he is addressing the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, -

does not wish to give the information, he need  not

do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

appointment of George Thomson was not all quiet and

peaceful,  as  today's  proceedings  show.   George

Thomson's  speeches appeared now and  then  in  the

newspapers  and there were comments  everywhere.  I

managed  to  pick  up  a few clippings  during  the

weekend - George  Thomson laughing merrily  with  the

Minister  for Culture at a meeting of the  Tourists

Information Bureau. George Thomson laughing merrily -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated in the past

that  if  a  newspaper  is to  be  quoted  from  or

referred  to, that newspaper ought to be  produced.

Unless  the Member can satisfy me that  it  is  not

possible  to  produce  that  newspaper,  then,   of

course,  I might be prepared to allow him to  refer

to  a  cutting. But I think I am correct in  saying

that copies of all past newspapers are retained  in

Assembly House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The one I mentioned just

now - where  Mr  George Thomson was sitting  in  the

centre of the audience and the Minister for Culture

sitting next to him -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Does the Member assure me

then  that  the original paper, or a  copy  of  the

whole paper, is not available?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot get

a copy of the whole paper, but I can only produce a

cutting.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed, and identify that

cutting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> It is from the Nanyang Siang

Pau  of 17th February, 1960. The picture here looks

like  Mr  George Thomson all right, and  the  name

says  so.  With  him  sitting in  the  centre,  the

Minister  for Culture on one side and on the  other

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Culture. And this paper, it shows who is the boss.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member for Hong Lim

aware that he was a Member of the Government then?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister must not speak

until he catches the eye of the speaker. If it is a

point of information or clarification, he must wait

until  the Member speaking has sat down.  Is  it  a

point of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of explanation,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of explanation, Mr Ong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> remained seated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He has given way. I think he

is so flabbergasted that he is giving way every

time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must be quite

certain whether the Member for Hong Lim has given

way or has not just been pushed back!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Has the Member for Hong

Lim given way? It is a point of information or

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On the point of information

which the Prime Minister wants, I give way.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member then take his seat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Now, Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I indicate that there was

a  slight  inference that I might have  intimidated

the  Member  for Hong Lim into going  flat  on  his

back? But I can assure you, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that

I  am  unarmed,  and I have no intention  of  doing

anybody  any harm. All I wish to ask the Member  is

this:  whether  he  is aware, as  a  colleague  and

member  of  the  same Government in February  1960,

that  it  was his duty, if he had thought that  the

Minister   for  Culture  had  sold   out   on   the

Government,  to  have brought  the  matter  to  the

attention of his other colleagues?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  is unarmed here because of the  rules  of

the  Assembly,  but  he has  mastered  the  art  of

unarmed combat!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, George Thomson's speeches appeared now and then in the newspapers and there were

comments   everywhere.   About   a   dozen   P.A.P.

Assemblymen who attended a study course on the 19th

October, 1959, were shocked to see George Thomson's

entry  into the lecture room at Fullerton  Building

and  he started lecturing to them on the principles

of  Western democracy. That was the subject.  I  do

not  know  what he had introduced. The  Assemblymen

there and then protested and wanted to stage a walk-out,  and  the Prime Minister had to call  them  up

immediately  to  explain  matters.  He   told   the

Assemblymen  that  we can use Thomson's  knowledge.

The  Assemblymen  could think  for  themselves  and

discern  whether  George Thomson  was  telling  the

truth  or not. The murmurs and grumblings grew  day

by  day within the rank and file of the P.A.P. and

among the masses of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in August 1959 the Central Executive

Committee of the People's Action Party decided that

George Thomson must be dismissed. Nobody dared  put

on  record objections to that motion, not even  the

Prime  Minister.  Since that meeting,  the  Central

Executive Committee of the People's Action Party -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, not even the Prime

Minister,  in  spite  of his knowledge  of  unarmed

combat, telepathy, manipulations from the rear, can

lodge  an objection when he is not present  at  the

meeting. It is not possible. And there are  minutes

to show I was nott present at that meeting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister

may  be good at unarmed combat, but definitely  not

telepathy, otherwise the three of us would  not  be

sitting here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early August 1959, the Central Executive

Committee of the People's Action Party had  decided

that  George Thomson must be dismissed. Since  that

meeting  the Central of the P.A.P. held  fewer  and

fewer  meetings, and any meetings  that  were  held

thereafter   were   discussions   of   a    routine

administrative nature, until they almost ceased  to

exist.  However,  this unanimous  decision  of  the

Central  of  the P.A.P. was never carried  out;  no

disciplinary  action  was ever  taken  against  the

culprits,  because it is just an impossibility  for

the  Secretary-General of the People's Action Party

to   sack  the  Prime  Minister  of  the  Singapore

Government. Despite the decision of the Central  of

the P.A.P., George Thomson was retained -



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order, Sir. About the

remarks of the Member for Hong Lim, I would like to

ask whether they are relevant to the motion that is

being debated in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order is whether what

the  Member  for Hong Lim is saying is relevant  to

the  motion.  I  have  been listening  to  it  very

carefully and up to now he is, I should imagine, on

the  borderline;  but I think he  is  relating  his

remarks  to  the  pith or the meat of  the  motion.

Therefore,  up  to  now  I must  rule  that  he  is

relevant. But once he becomes irrelevant,  then  of

course I will have to stop him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, we have always

tried  to  keep  to the subject of the  debate.  To

those  who have listened to these Assembly  debates

and  to  those  who  have  not - they  can  read  the

Hansard -  they can see that that has always been our

stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the decision of the Central, George

Thomson was retained. His contract was extended and

he was given a position more significant and with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



more  authority than what he had enjoyed under  the

previous  Government. In October 1959 the Political

Study  Centre  was  instituted and  George  Thomson

became its Director, assisted by a full-time  staff

tutor,  the  ex-Labour Front Organising  Secretary,

Gerald  de  Cruz.  Here  in  this  Political  Study

Centre, these two anti-P.A.P. stalwarts before  the

elections were -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have had occasion in the

past  to  ask  Members  to modulate  their  voices,

because,   firstly  it  upsets  my  hearing,   and,

secondly,  I  think  the sound  equipment  of  this

Chamber is very good!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, anybody in this

position would feel the same amount of anger.  Here

were  George Thomson and Gerald de Cruz who, before

the  elections,  were anti-P.A.P. stalwarts.  Now,

under   the  P.A.P.  Government,  they   set   upon

themselves the vital task of brainwashing the civil

servants.  However, the brainwashing of  the  civil

servants in the name of political studies was  only

part  of the duties of George Thomson. He became  a

Krishna  Menon,  the  roving Ambassador - a  Minister

without   portfolio - getting  paid   officially   as

Director   of  the  Political  Study  Centre.   His

presence  was  felt  everywhere  in  Singapore.  He

delivered  lectures  at  meetings,  symposiums  and

forums.  He was sometimes found close by the  Prime

Minister when the latter delivered speeches. He was

present at television -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Just name three occasions

when the man referred to as George Thomson was

close by when I was delivering speeches and

prompting me. I repeat this once more. Say this

outside the Chamber -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister, I think, is

forgetting that he is addressing the Chair. I am

afraid I cannot name these three occasions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Can the Member for Hong Lim

give    three   instances   where   I    was    the

ventriloquist's  dummy and George Thomson  was  the

ventriloquist? And if he just repeats that  Outside

this  Chamber, then we will have a battle royal  to

establish  whether  the Prime  Minister  right  now

standing  before him is a ventriloquist's dummy  or

whether  he is prepared to speak his own  mind  any

time, any place, and in any circumstance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, that was not the

case during the special Party conference. Why name

three instances -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Give us three instances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Why name three instances? The

Prime Minister knows that the papers only came  out

with   one.  The  others  were  not  published   as

photographs  in  the newspapers. In one  particular

instance which I recollect, we could see the  Prime

Minister  standing up, with George Thomson  sitting

next  to  him, addressing a meeting of headmasters.

Was that not right?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of information?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member for Hong Lim

then  drawing the inference that the Prime Minister

was saying things under the prompting of Mr George

Thomson, that he has no mind, no speech of his own,

and no thought of his own?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, unless the

Prime Minister is guilty-conscious, I never made

that allegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I ask what is the

abstruse significance of having Mr George Thomson

by my side on one occasion?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Inspiration!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Was he protecting me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> George Thomson became a Krishna

Menon,  a  roving  Ambassador, a  Minister  without

portfolio, getting pay as Director of the Political

Study Centre. He will be seen -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a further point of

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is he suggesting, therefore,

that since I have my deputy, Dr Toh, sitting at my

side,   he  is  another  Krishna  Menon,  a  roving

Ambassador  who is giving me a constant  source  of

prompting  and  encouragement as to  how  I  should

deport myself?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy

Prime  Minister still earns some respect  from  the

people of Singapore, and he is a good screen to  be

provided for you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

Leader  of  the House is flattered or  not.  He  is

alleged  to  be a screen for the Speaker.  I  trust

that is not the meaning of what the Member for Hong

Lim has just said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you do not

need  a  screen.  I  mean a screen  for  the  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes ask myself which Ministry he is

looking  after.  George Thomson  seems  to  have  a

finger in every pie. How can he do it, unless it is

under  the express directive and with the  sanction

of the Prime Minister, who is above all Ministries?

No  Permanent  Secretary has been in that  enviable

position. Mr Speaker, these brainwashing  lectures

in the Political Study Centre are an utter disgrace

to  the  Government and to the P.A.P.  Two  of  the

staunchest opponents of the P.A.P. before May  1959

are being paid fat salaries to organise classes  to

brainwash civil servants and others under the guise

of  political studies. Civil servants in groups  of

about   twenty   are  compelled  to  attend   these

indoctrination classes every working day, six  days

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



week, for a duration of about three weeks, from 2.15 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. The day

session starts with

so-called general lectures, very often innocent and

harmless ones, by some Ministers -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What has this rubbish that he

is saying to do with the motion -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, the first thing

the Minister for Finance must do is to withdraw the

word "rubbish". Will he withdraw the word

"rubbish"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I withdraw the word and -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Unqualifiedly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Unqualifiedly, and may I

substitute -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No. The motion before the House is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges the Government to take

immediate steps to Malayanise all expatriate

administrative officials.



<br><br>And I take it that the Member for Hong Lim is

giving these details to indicate that there is at

least one administrative official who should be

immediately malayanised. If that is what the Member

for Hong Lim means, then, of course, he is relevant

up to that point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is what

the  civil  servants have been supplied  with,  the

word just used by the Minister for Finance. The day

session  starts  with so-called  general  lectures,

very  often  innocent and harmless  ones,  by  some

Ministers,  Parliamentary Secretaries or  Political

Secretaries -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Hong

Lim  is probably going into details which is taking

him  a little too far from the motion itself. I  do

not  think  he  will  be justified  in  going  into

details  as  to  what  actually  happened  in   the

Political Study Centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, unless I give some

little  details, it is impossible to  convince  the

people that such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



posts  can be taken over by local people.  The  day

session starts with a so-called general lecture  by

some  respectable person to provide  a  screen.  It

just  boils  down to nice but empty talk.  After  a

break  for tea the real stuff, in the form of small

discussion groups, began, like the tutorial  system

in  the  universities under the guidance of  George

Thomson  and  Gerald de Cruz.  This  is  the  media

through  which  indoctrination  is  hoped   to   be

effectively  carried out. In this  tutorial  system

several  people,  who once hated the  P.A.P.,  talk

about  Communism and other subjects  to  the  civil

servants,   occasionally  casting   aspersions   on

individual Ministers they do not like. It  is  free

discussion. Everybody is encouraged to express  his

thoughts, and you, Mr Minister for Labour and Law,

are included in the aspersions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Hong  Lim is not only forgetting that he must  keep

to  the  motion  itself, but he is also  forgetting

time and again that he is addressing the Chair.  He

must remember that he is addressing the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I apologise, Mr Speaker. It is

a  free  discussion.  Everybody  is  encouraged  to

express  his thoughts. They often invited lecturers

from outside the Government, mostly Europeans.  The

more  they  hated the P.A.P. once upon a time,  the

more  welcome  they  are now. In  these  discussion

groups, the civil servants will sit there and  hear

anti-Communist   stories  and  sometimes   personal

castigations like old worn-out gramophone  records.

This is one of the agencies that the Prime Minister

can use to spread his smear campaigns against those

he does not like -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been very lenient, but

I really think that the hon. Member for Hong Lim is

now straying very far away from the motion. He must

now  try and convince me that what he is saying is,

in  fact, relevant. I understood him to say that he

is advocating that that type of work could be taken

over  by a local man. I that is what he means, then

perhaps he can go on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue of

George  Thomson  has been fought for  more  than  a

year.  He is now occupying the post of Director  of

Staff Training. I wonder whether that post has been

openly   advertised,  and  whether  it  has  passed

through   the   P.S.C.  Despite   the   fact   that

brainwashing  methods in the  second  half  of  the

twentieth  century have been developed into  almost

an  exact science, I still cannot be convinced that

colonialists  like George Thomson, who  was  openly

hostile to the P.A.P. not long ago, can suddenly be

converted into P.A.P. missionaries. This issue  was

fought a long, long time. There was a fight in  the

Central  in August 1959. There was a fight  in  the

P.A.P.  Special Party Conference in  June  1960  on

this issue of expatriate administrators. In between

these  two  dates, the fight went on unabated,  and

one  of the casualties in this struggle was Tan Gak

Eng,  former Assistant Organising Secretary of  the

P.A.P.  In  the  month preceding his  dismissal  in

November  1959,  he waged a constant  and  fearless

battle  for  the  dismissal of George  Thomson  and

other  expatriate  officials. A  secret  trial  was

planned  by  the  Prime  Minister  against  him  in

November 1959 and he was subject to a great ordeal -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What is this secret trial

that I had staged?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just trying to trace the point

of order, Mr Prime Minister. Perhaps a point of

explanation, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. I want to know how this

secret trial came into this motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A point of explanation for the Member

for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister knows what a secret trial means. I wonder -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The point that worries the

Chair now is, how is that relevant to the motion?

Will the Member for Hong Lim link that secret trial

to the motion?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  was trying to ask me to explain  what  is

this secret trial. It is not related to the motion,

and,  therefore, I am not dealing any further  with

the  secret trial. I wonder if it is not a  strange

coincidence that on the eve of the debate  on  this

subject Tan Gak Eng was arrested -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is the point. I think,

before the Member expands on the arrest of Tan  Gak

Eng,  he should convince the Chair that that arrest

is relevant to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was trying

just  now  to  explain to this  House  the  various

phases of the struggle against the repatriation  of

expatriate administrators, and, as such, this  part

of the struggle is also important.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Logically, Sir, is there any

connection between a person's, arrest in connection

with threats having been issued to an Assemblyman,

and the sending of a knife, and the repatriation of

Europeans who were never in any way in the picture?

Logically -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is what I would like to

hear from the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I have explained just now that -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Logic, logic!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - there are many phases in the

struggle   for   the  repatriation  of   expatriate

administrators  and  that  this  is  part  of   the

struggle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What struggle?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. I have not seen the

logical   connection  yet  between  the   different

phases.  From the phase of a person being  arrested

in  connection with threats to Assemblymen, to this

phase about repatriation of officials. That is  all

that I -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was waiting for the Member

for Hong Lim to continue. He has said that there is

some  connection  and, as the  Prime  Minister  has

pointed  out in another point of order, he has  not

as yet explained what that connection is. If he can

do so, then I will be in a better position to rule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, broadly

speaking,  I  could outline for you  the  different

phases  of  the fight. The first phase was  on  the

formation of the. Government till August  1959,  at

the   meeting  of  the  Central  Committee  of  the

People's  Action Party. The second phase culminated

in  the  dismissal of Tan Gak Eng from the People's

Action  Party. The third phase ended in the special

Party  Conference of June 1960. Today  is  more  or

less the beginning of the fourth phase.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member for Hong

Lim  alleging then, as a matter of fact,  that  Mr

Tan Gak Eng was arrested because he was against the

retention  of  this administrative officer?  Is  he

alleging that as a matter of fact?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. That is what

I asked the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order? Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What have these four phases

got  to do with the motion, assuming that there are

these  four  phases?  We all have  to  stretch  our

imagination  very  far and very hard,  and  we  are

quite  prepared to do that. But what have they  got

to do with the motion?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understood the Member for

Hong  Lim  to say that, in his view, the arrest  of

Tan Gak Eng was because he opposed the retention of

the  services of George Thomson. That is  what  the

Member  for Hong Lim has alleged in this  Assembly,

and  he is entitled to allege that. Whether he  has

any  foundation or not it is not for me to say. The

Member for Hong Lim is a responsible Member of this

Assembly  and he must first have grounds before  he

makes an allegation of that nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can find no

other reason for the arrest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not cleared this point

yet. Well, in that case I must rule that the

reference to the arrest of Tan Gak Eng has no

relation whatsoever to this motion, if it is only

on hypothesis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Tan Gak Eng

was   dismissed  from  the  People's  Action  Party

because  he was charged with smearing the  name  of

the  Secretary-General by retaining Blades, Meadows

and Thomson. It is relevant to my debate today.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the Member for Hong Lim

then alleging that the man was arrested because  of

that?  If  so, has he grounds for it?  That  is,  I

think, the pith of the whole matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, as I have said

just  now,  I  have known Tan Gak  Eng's  political

activities  and  his  past  associations  with  the

P.A.P., the manner he was dismissed and the charges

that  were  brought against him, and I cannot  find

any  other reason. If the statement about the knife

is true, then the Prime Minister will charge him in

court.  If  his association with the  gangsters  is

true,  then  he will be charged in court.  Tan  Gak

Eng, with 20 years experience; will not sign G.T.E.

Action  Group,  which means Gak  Tan  Eng's  Action

Group.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Hong  Lim is now embarking on a defence of Tan  Gak

Eng.  I  do not think that can be permitted. Having

touched  on that subject, he should now proceed  on

to another aspect of the, motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  feels  very sorry for George  Thomson  to

leave.   He   will  miss  his  friend,  guide   and

philosopher. Due to the growing discontent on  this

issue,  I  understand there may be some changes!  I

believe  the post of Director of Political Training

will shortly be Malayanised. There is one good way,

though,  to thank the staff tutor, Gerald de  Cruz,

who  has  worked  hard behind the  scenes  for  the

Government.  As  a matter of fact,  few  people  in

Singapore  know  that today Gerald de  Cruz  exerts

more  influence  on  the  long-term  policies   and

decisions  of  the  Government  than  many  Cabinet

Ministers of the P.A.P -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry I have to

interrupt,  but  I think I must try  and  keep  the

debate  within the four walls of the motion.  I  do

not  know whether the hon. Member for Hong  Lim  is

alleging  that  Gerald  de Cruz  is  an  expatriate

administrative officer. If he is, then, of  course,

the  Member for Hong Lim is in order. But if he  is

not,  then,  of  course, he is  completely  out  of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> So the possibility of George

Thomson  being  Malayanised by Government  is  very

great -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member for Hong

Lim then satisfied that all reference to Gerald  de

Cruz is outside the ambit of the motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I agree, Mr Speaker. But would

the  Prime Minister tell us when George Thomson  is

to  be  Malayanised and where is he  going?  Is  be

going  to  be  really Malayanised?  Did  the  Prime

Minister  create the conditions for the appointment

of  Mr George Thomson to be the first Professor of

Political Science at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



University  of  Malaya? So George Thomson  will  be

able  to brainwash University students a few  hours

each  day and draw up political blueprints for  the

Prime Minister during his spare hours -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid interruptions are

becoming  rather tedious. But if the allegation  is

that  George  Thomson is to  find  a  post  in  the

University  of Malaya, I cannot see any Ministerial

responsibility, and, therefore, the Member for Hong

Lim.   I   think,  cannot  satisfy  me  that   that

allegation is within the terms of the motion, which

is a motion to urge the Government to do something

in relation to expatriate officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Malayanisation  Commission sat on  the  proceedings

and in these proceedings it deliberated not only on

the  Malayanisation of Government services but also

on  expatriate  officials in Governmental  agencies

and corporations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I shall dwell on another

important  expatriate administrator. The second  of

the  Big Three is Mr P. H. Meadows. During the Lim

Yew  Hock Government, .Meadows was Deputy Permanent

Secretary  to  the  Ministry of  Local  Government,

Lands and Housing, Chairman of the Rural Board  and

Chairman  of the Planning Committee of  the  S.I.T.

When   I   was  appointed  Minister  for   National

Development,  which combined the former  portfolios

of  the  Minister for Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing,  and  various  other departments,  Meadows

automatically became a member of the staff  in  the

Ministry of National Development. As I became  more

and  more  familiar with the work of the  Ministry.

the  presence  and activities of Meadows  began  to

give  me cause for alarm. From whatever files  that

were   not  missing  from  the  Ministry  of  Local

Government  and from reports, I began to  form  the

opinion -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a very

serious  statement has been made  that  files  were

missing from the Ministry, and this is mentioned in

reference  to this particular officer,  Mr  P.  H.

Meadows.  I  think  it is very  important  that  we

should   be   informed   if  files   are   missing,

particularly as the Minister knew about it,  as  he

then  was the Minister. It is a very serious thing.

Theft  has  taken  place. For all  we  know,  great

misdemeanour  might  have  been  committed  by  the

former  Minister  with  his servant.  I  think  the

Assembly  is  entitled to full  facts  and  a  full

disclosure  so  that  the  appropriate  action  and

punishment can be meted out to all who deserve it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was ready

for a U-2 incident to happen here. To give just one

example: on 5th June, 1959, a firm of lawyers wrote

to  the  Ministry  in reply to  the  suspension  of

duties of an officer of the City Council. The  file

reference number was CC/22. Despite my instructions

in  the  Ministry that all letters  concerning  the

City  Council ought to be given to me for reference

and  decisions.  Mr  Meadows replied  on  his  own

account to the legal firm, but quoted instead a new

file  number, CC/17. Now, Mr Speaker,  file  CC/22

from  then  onwards disappeared. I have  the  index

cards to prove it and, if you want, I shall produce

for  your - as a matter of fact, Mr Speaker, I  have

shown this to the Prime Minister in a meeting  with

him on 12th of August -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Very serious.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - when the Prime Minister called

me up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, with regard to the cards

and  the files, may I ask whether we could  have  a

proper  Inspection  of these documents,  because  I

think  a  very serious allegation has been made  of

theft  and  it should be properly investigated  and

pursued?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think this is the

forum  where an investigation shou1d be made.  What

should happen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



is  that  the  Prime  Minister now  takes  note  of

whatever is said by the Member for Hong Lim who,  I

take  it,  is speaking in this Assembly  with  some

foundation.  I  made a remark a little  while  ago,

that   Members  must  realise  that  they  have   a

responsibility not only to themselves and  to  this

Assembly, but also to members of the public who are

outside  this  Assembly and who  are  not  here  to

defend    themselves.   Therefore,   any    serious

allegation should not be made unless the Member  is

fully  satisfied that the allegation can be  proved

up to the hilt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> That is why, Mr Speaker, I

have reduced to the minimum possible my touching on

personalities, instances and incidents in order  to

prove  my arguments; otherwise I would be making  a

more lengthy speech today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it is a very important

point I am making.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The file which the ex-Minister handled is a Government file. Could I ask

him when he removed it from the Government

Ministry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not

remove the file. I only took photostat copies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the file -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The file cover is a

Government file.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This sort of running

commentary  and cross-questions are completely  out

of  order.  Of course, the Member for Hong  Lim  is

inviting  it by giving way. But I would suggest  to

the  Prime Minister that he bide his time and, when

he  makes  his  speech, if he is  speaking  on  the

motion, he could bring all these points up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I wish to make it

clear why I gave way. It is because all what I have

said is nothing but the truth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Repeat it outside.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I formed the opinion that

Meadows was an important political planner  in  the

Labour   Front   Government  and  not   merely   an

expatriate civil servant. I must say that  not  all

expatriate civil servants are involved in political

planning.  The suspension of the City Council,  the

Commissions  of Inquiry and many incidents  in  the

City  Council  can  be traced to Meadows.  The  ex-Minister knew very little of what went on. Although

Meadows  was  in  theory only the Deputy  Permanent

Secretary, he was in practice actually running  the

Ministry  of Local Government, just as  he  is  now

actually running all the departments in the name of

the  Prime Minister. Meadows, like Thomson,  should

have  been Malayanised in 1955 under the Report  of

the  Malayanisation Commission. The  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. When

the hon.. Member makes statements of fact based  on

the  Malayanisation  Report,  should  be  not,   in

fairness to the officials concerned, quote  chapter

and verse? To my knowledge, what was said about Mr

Meadows' date of Malayanisation is utterly untrue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The matter has been placed to me as

a  point  of order. In fact, it is not a  point  of

order  but a point of clarification. I might repeat

that when hon. Members make certain allegations  in

this  Chamber,  it is their responsibility  to  see

that  they do not, in fact, say something which  is

not correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guam Mr Speaker, this is from page 119 of the Interim Report of the Malayanisation

Commission.  In  1955, during the sittings  of  the

Malayanisation   Commission,   Mr   Meadows    was

occupying the post of Principal Assistant  Director

of  Social  Welfare  and the present  Minister  for

Finance was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



the  Assistant Director - he should know that  better

than I do. Item 2 of the recommendations reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The posts of Principal Assistant Director, Social

Welfare,  and  Assistant Director, Social  Welfare,

[the  Minister  was  studying in  England  and  was

coming  back to fill the post] at present occupied

by expatriate officers can be filled immediately by

promotion of local officers in the Department.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The hon. Member is completely

confused in his mind as to the distinction between

the Malayanisation of posts and -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think that is a point which the Hon.

Minister can make in his speech. It is not really

an explanation or elucidation of what the Member is

saying now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

the distinction very well myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meadows, like Thomson, should have been Malayanised

in 1955 under the Malayanisation Commission Report.

The  Lim  Yew Hock Government extended his contract

and  switched  him  over to some other  post  which

required Malayanisation at a later date. But what I

cannot  understand - I can understand the actions  of

the  previous  Government - is  the  action  of  this

Government, the so-called P.A.P. Government.  When

Meadows  was  working in the Ministry  of  National

Development between June and September, 1959, I had

the  opportunity to watch his activities.  I  shall

narrate  here  some of the more interesting  events

concerning  his official duties. After the  victory

of the P.A.P. and the Government was in the process

of being formed, the Prime Minister-designate asked

me  to  appoint one Mr Meadows, who was the Deputy

Permanent  Secretary  to  the  Ministry  of   Local

Government,  Lands  and  Housing,  as   the   Chief

Administrative  Officer of the City  Council.  This

was the first time I heard about him but I told the

Prime  Minister  that  on  no  account  should   an

expatriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



head  the  City  Council again, as  this  would  be

tantamount  to  going back to the pre-Rendel  days.

Later,  I appointed Mr P. C. Lim, the most senior

local   officer,  to  be  the  Administrator;   but

unfortunately,  when the Prime Minister  took  over

the  City  Council  in October  1959,  his  earlier

intention  of making Meadows the real boss  of  the

City Council materialised. Again, on the day before

the swearing in ceremony of the new Government, the

Prime  Minister told me to sign an order  declaring

the  post  of  C.A.O. redundant. He said  that  the

Permanent  Secretary would wait for me outside  the

Council  Chamber;  but  when  I  left  the  Council

Chamber  I was surprised to see instead Mr Meadows

who adjourned to the Committee Room. I read through

the  order and found it unnecessary. The suspension

of  any civil servant does not require a Government

order. Suffice it to say that the effect of signing

that  order  would  have been  detrimental  to  the

interest of the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will see that I am trying to avoid mentioning as many names as possible. What I

do  not understand was the great haste taken to get

me  to sign this order. After a discussion, Meadows

agreed  with me that the suspension of the post  of

any civil servant did not require an order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Singapore Improvement Trust, which was

synonymous with corruption and inefficiency  during

the Lim Yew Hock Government, was to be reorganised.

I  asked  Meadows, who  was the  Deputy  Permanent

Secretary, one or two days after the Government was

formed,  to  put  up  a paper appointing  the  most

senior local architect there as the Chairman of the

S.I.T. to start a cleaning-up campaign. Meadows was

a  former  member of the S.I.T. and Chairman  of  its

Planning   Committee.  This  proposal   and   later

proposals to reorganise the S.I.T. were turned down

by  the  Prime Minister, and from the tone  of  the

discussions  it was manifestly clear  that  he  had

contacted,  directly  or  indirectly,  Mr  Meadows

before the meetings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> "Directly or indirectly,

contacted Mr Meadows" at the time when Mr Meadows

was  supposed  to be working for the  Minister  for

National  Development, is that the suggestion?  Mr

Meadows,  as a civil servant, bypassed his Minister

and  contacted  the  Prime Minister.  Is  that  the

suggestion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it depends on

whether it was done openly or covertly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the hon. Member saying

that the Prime Minister, in complete disloyalty  to

his  own  colleague, conspired with a civil servant

working under that colleague? I ask the Member  for

Hong  Lim  to repeat that outside and he will  have

ample opportunity to prove these things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> After the threats and arrest of

Tan Gak Eng and company, there are more threats!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Files from the Ministry were missing. Meadows

wanted  a  certain person appointed as Chairman  of

the  Rent  Board,  to  which I objected.  When  the

appointment of another person was sent to the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara  (Sir  William  Goode),  it  was

delayed and the Prime Minister wanted me to reverse

the  position. I stood by my decision.  There  were

many  other matters which would require days of  de

bate.  As  a  result  of all  these  incidents,  my

patience was drawing to an end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> For the sake of the record,

that should not go unchallenged. The Member said he

stuck to his decision about the appointment of  the

Chairman  to  the Rent Conciliation Board.  He  did

not, Sir. After the matter was raised by the Member

for Farrer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



Park - if he will remember - it was contrary to certain

principles,  and the appointment was  altered  with

the concurrence of all parties, due to no fault  of

the appointee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, soon I will

expose  the whole story of the appointment  of  the

Chairman  of the Rent Board, and I shall  prove  to

this House that many of the questions raised by the

Member   for  Farrer  Park  were  always  discussed

earlier in the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I am now wandering in

a  morass.  The  Member for Hong Lim  must  try  to

relate  all his remarks to the motion and not  dart

away from it and then come back to it. It is a  bit

puzzling to know when he is relevant and when he is

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of clarification.

Is the Member for Hong Lim suggesting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister must remember

that he should not start speaking until he is

called by the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Can I be called?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Hong Lim has

suggested  that the Member for Farrer  Park  and  I

were  in  collusion  to  ask questions  which  were

discussed in the P.A.P. Central Committee. I do not

know  whether the Member for Farrer Park  considers

it  a  great honour to have been consulted  by  the

Prime Minister on this matter, but I consider it  a

grave  aspersion  on  any Prime  Minister  to  have

engineered with the Opposition, questions discussed

in  his own Party Committee. I would be grateful if

the Member for Hong Lim would assert that by giving

one or two instances. I can assure him that he will

not  be  arrested under the Criminal Law (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is, of course, completely

irrelevant and if the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



Hong  Lim  attempts  to  answer  it,  he  will  be

irrelevant. Let us get back to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the

Member for Tanjong Pagar prophesied as early as

1955 was true. Please refer to Hansard, Volume 1,

No. 2, dated 26th April, 1955, col. 58. The Prime

Minister in 1955 said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...unless the Government can pursue this policy of

Malayanisation  not only in the  Government  Public

Services, but in all the Public Services and,  last

but  not  least,  in the Singapore  Harbour  Board,

where a very important Public Service is run almost

exclusively by expatriate officers, there is  going

to  be  a  great  deal  of. I  would  not  call  it

sabotage,   but   I   would   just   say,   general

dislocation,   when  a  really   vigorous   Malayan

Nationalist Government takes over in the very  near

future...'



<br><br>Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  the  Prime  Minister   aptly

summarised  the  whole position in  1955.  Meadows,

with his colonial octopus, was building an army  of

resistance around his air-conditioned room where he

could  plan  and  contact all  his  key  people  in

private. With the presence of Meadows, there was no

doubt  in my mind that the reorganisation  work  of

the  Ministry  would be difficult to push  through.

Any  governmental  measures aimed  at  cutting  the

existing   privileges   would   be   difficult   to

implement.  Difficulties were imposed on  my  plan,

for   instance,  to  impose  assessments  on  Shell

properties  in Pulau Bukom (they pay no  assessment

and do not need to follow building and planning by-laws;  Pulau Bukom is run by Shell Company, exactly

like a foreign concession), my plan to impose taxes

on  military vehicles which cause great  damage  to

our  roads (military vehicles pay no tax  at  all),

and  my  plan  to  revise assessments  on  military

properties   (they  pay  little   or   hardly   any

assessments  at  present).  The  Cabinet  discussed

certain questions on assessments on military -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether the hon.

Member can relate all that to the motion. The  fact

that  Mr Meadows gave some advice which was turned

down surely has nothing to do with the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, unless one has

experience  in administration, it is  difficult  to

understand really what the Prime Minister meant and

said so aptly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would not call it sabotage, but I would just

say, general dislocation...'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> At that time, Mr George

Thomson was serving another Government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are talking about Mr Meadows.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am talking about Mr George

Thomson  now, Sir. We want to stick  to  one  at  a

time.  I  would be grateful to the Member for  Hong

Lim  if  he could inform me: who wrote that  speech

for the Member for Tanjong Pagar?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Prime Minister is just

as  puzzled  as the Speaker. We are on Mr  Meadows

and not on Mr George Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1955 the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar was a true nationalist;

today,  he is not any more. During those few months

I  was told that Meadows held an important rank  in

British Military Intelligence. Of course, there  is

no  way  to  check its accuracy. I told  the  Prime

Minister  what  I  heard,  and  related   all   the

incidents  when  he called me up  on  12th  August,

1959, to consider, what he said, sending Meadows to

Siberia.  The Prime Minister considered  my  asking

Meadows  to draw up schemes for the development  of

the  Southern Islands and Changi beach, as  sending

him   to   Siberia.   Later  the   Prime   Minister

transferred Meadows out of the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there are different ways

of  doing  things. Despite its lack of tranquility,

if  the  P.A.P. want to fix a guy, we  are  not  so

crude as to knock down the windows, doors and walls

of a person's room - that is what I meant by allowing

the  icy  winds  of  Siberia to  blow  through  Mr

Meadows;  not to send him there. I hope the  Member

is  not proud if he knocked down the four walls and

removed the windows.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, towards the

expatriates, the Prime Minister is always kind  and

gentle.  Towards his own people, many have to  flee

the  country, like Mr Owen and Mr Lui  Boon  Poh,

and  others  have  to be sent  to  gaol  under  the

Criminal   Law  (Temporary  Provisions)  Ordinance.

Later the Prime Minister transferred Meadows out of

the Ministry of National Development and wanted him

to be the Director of the Special Branch. How can a

person who has no experience as a top officer -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is the first time I am

hearing  so many things about myself. I  am  really

wondering  whether or not there are two persons  in

me. One is me, and the other is the man that exists

in  the  Member  for  Hong Lim's  imagination.  Mr

Meadows and the Director of the Special Branch  are

two  completely unrelated subjects. Can the  Member

please  explain  in what particular nightmare  this

visitation of God struck him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister is exactly such a person, and he was  ably

pictured   in  the  latest  issue  of  the   S.P.A.

magazine. This plan was not pushed through  due  to

stiff  opposition.  So  in  September  1959  P.  H.

Meadows became Secretary to the Prime Minister with

special  duties.  There is  no  such  post  in  the

Budget; it is out of circulation. We have the  only

Prime  Minister  in the world with a  foreigner  as

Secretary. And he is not an ordinary secretary, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



a  special secretary. The ex-Chief Minister Lim Yew

Hock,  did not have an expatriate as his Secretary.

This  Special Secretary took control of  the  Prime

Minister's  Office and his power increased  as  the

departments   of   the  Prime   Minister's   Office

increased   in  numbers  and  size.  To   give   an

indication  of his powers, I say that  Meadows  has

more  power in running the City Council, the  Rural

Board,  the  Singapore Harbour Board, the  Planning

Department, the Land Office, the Survey Department,

and so on, [Interruption] than, say, the Member for

Crawford has in running the Ministry of Labour  and

Law. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour  and

Law   cannot  even  issue  Press  statements.  Just

imagine!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder how that statement

can be related to the motion. As I say, the Member

for  Hong  Lim seems to be darting here, there  and

everywhere, forgetting that he must try to keep  to

the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if there were

no interruptions from the Government Benches, I can

assure  you there would be no replies to all  these

interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest then that the

Member for Hong Lim has a remedy, and that is not

to give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Meadows

was  the  man  who  secretly  went  to  the  United

Kingdom,  before  the  Minister  for  Finance  went

there,  to prepare the way for a U.K. loan  of  $65

million. The budget under the control of Meadows is

more  than  half of the total national budget.  The

staff   and   employees  under  the   control   and

administration of Meadows -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has given way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is just for his

information, Sir. I cannot be responsible for other

people's paranoic tendencies, and I hope the Member

for  Hong Lim does not suffer from these. But I can

assure  him  that  the Budgets  both  of  the  City

Council  and the Government are under the  Minister

for  Finance and will be presented to this Assembly

as one Budget and not as it was done before when he

budgeted it in the Gazette. This will be done  this

year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

irrelevant to the motion, otherwise I would make  a

very substantial reply. The staff and employees -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has given way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member is most

accommodating, Sir,I was really surprised to learn

that I had secret allies during my talks in London.

Can  the Member for Hong Lim please tell me in what

secret way or by what secret method did Mr Meadows

depart for London - was it by submarine U-2 or what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is also

irrelevant, otherwise I would show how it was done.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think on this occasion

there  is  no  irrelevancy  at  all  about  it.   A

statement was made by the Member for Hong  Lim  and

the   Minister  for  Finance  has  asked   for   an

elucidation, albeit in a rather lengthy manner!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Meadows

went a few days before the official delegation from

the  Ministry of Finance went. Mr Meadows went  on

his  own,  getting three weeks' leave from the  City

Council.  He is a City Council employee,  paid,  of

course, as the Deputy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister. He  made

the  necessary arrangements there, I  presume,  and

came back in a plane different from that which  the

official delegation took. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

all  part of the game. The budget under the control

of Meadows -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Under the control of the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - is more than half of the total

national  budget.  I can prove and  show  that  the

Prime  Minister, who runs the City  Council,  knows

nothing about the City Council Budget.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. As I said, my difficulty is

trying to relate all these remarks to the motion. I

should imagine that just a passing comment on these

actions  by  the officer concerned would  suffice.'

But if the honourable Member for Hong Lim goes into

detail,  then,  of course, I think he  is  possibly

going  a bit too far away from the motion.  I  must

now  try  to  confine the debate to  the  narrowest

channel possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I am only dealing

with the broad general principles - only one sentence

on the budget, that is all. The staff and employees

under  the control of Meadows are enough  to  equip

two  divisions  of an army of about 30,000  people.

The Prime Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the honourable Member for

Hong  Lim then suggesting that because Mr  Meadows

has   an   army  for  his  staff,  he   should   be

malayanised?  If  he is, then,  of  course,  he  is

relevant; otherwise he is irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have brought up

two  points  at the beginning of my speech.  First,

the  role  of  the  administrators  whose  say   is

decisive  in  the control of power  of  the  State.

Second,  the present expatriate administrators  are

more  powerful in the Lee Kuan Yew Government  than

under the Lim Yew Hock Government. I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



trying  to drive my point home. The Prime  Minister

busies himself in many other duties and feels  most

happy  to  leave the running of his departments  to

Mr   Meadows.  And  today,  the  Prime  Minister's

knowledge of the departments under his name  is  as

much  as, if not less than, what perhaps Mr  Braga

knew about the Ministry of Health, or Chew Swee Kee

knew about the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know how all these

remarks - these asides, to put it that  way - have  any

relevance whatsoever to this motion. Let us try and

be  relevant  from now on, and I think  if  we  are

relevant, we might finish before midnight!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I felt so

sorry  for the Prime Minister when, in a debate  on

the  policy  speech in August, he narrated  matters

concerning   the  City  Council - about   the   power

station,   accountancy   qualifications,   sewerage

engineers, and about other officers. He had  little

knowledge of what went on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Member tell me how

that   is   related  to  the  motion - the  so-called

failings of the Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, have I not

driven home the fact that when he put an expatriate

administrator   in  that  position,   that   person

controls the fundamentals of our State? That is the

reason  why we should put a local officer  in  that

key  position, particularly when we  have  a  Prime

Minister  who  is  so  busily occupied  with  other

multifarious duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come to the last of the

Big Three among the expatriate administrative civil

servants.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is time for tea. I

suspend  this  sitting, and shall take  this  Chair

again at half-past five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come

to  the  last of the Big Three among the expatriate

administrative   civil   servants,   namely,    the

Commissioner  of  Police. I shall quote  below  the

relevant   parts  of  the  1955   Report   of   the

Malayanisation Commission on the Police Force. Page

55 of the Interim Report says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The posts of Commissioner of Police, Deputy

Commissioner  of Police and the remaining  post  of

Senior  Assistant Commissioner of  Police  can  be

Malayanised in three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Police should be asked to

remain as Adviser to the Police Force for 1 more

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Police Force can be completely

Malayanised in three years without loss of

efficiency.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, that was in 1955. And this is what the

Prime  Minister  had  said in  the  debate  on  5th

December,  1956, on the statement of Malayanisation

policy by the Lim Yew Hock Government. Please refer

to  Hansard,  Vol.  2, No. 15 dated  5th  December,

1956, cols. 1081 to 1082. Mr Speaker, Sir, on  5th

December, 1956, the Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Commissioner of Police himself admitted

before  the  Malayanisation  Commission  that   the

police  force  including  his  own  job  could   be

Malayanised   in   five   years.   The   Commission

recommended  a period of three. The Government  has

chosen six. To a certain extent, the experience  of

Members  on the other side of the recent  disorders

in  the  Colony of Singapore when they  found  that

their own lives and property had to be defended  by

Gurkha troops and police and European officers  may

have  weighed  heavily in their  minds,  The  Asian

officers  in the police force no doubt are somewhat

frustrated  and embittered about the Malayanisation

of the police force.'



<br><br>And then in col. 1082, in paragraph 2, the Prime

Minister continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, I say this to the Asian officers, if they

demand the right to take over the police force, let

us see their mettle. Let us see the grit that is

wanted in men who are to hold the rifle barrel in

this little island. Unless they can prove to us

that they have guts, courage and integrity, then

they deserve what they have got in this White

Paper.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, this was the debate on the Lim

Yew Hock Government's White Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the police force is at present far from being Malayanised. Although the number of

expatriate  police  officers has been  considerably

reduced since the publication of the Malayanisation

Commission  Report  in  1955,  yet  the   effective

control of tie police by the British is by no means

less.    This   is   achieved   by   a   systematic

centralisation  of  power  in  the  hands  of   the

Commissioner. What has the Prime Minister  done  to

give  local  officers a chance to prove themselves?

Suffice  it to say that were it not for the  intra-Party struggle waged between the pro-colonial line

and  the anti-colonial line in the P.A.P. since the

Government  was  formed,  the  important  posts  of

Deputy  Commissioner and the Chief  of  the  C.I.D.

would  still  be  in  the hands of  the  expatriate

police  officers  today. The Prime  Minister  seems

always  to  have  a higher regard for  expatriates.

According to the Malayanisation Commission  Report,

the  Malayanisation  of the  police  force  can  be

completed now. It is a shame to the people of  this

country  to have the police force controlled  by  a

handful of foreigners. Or is the Prime Minister now

in  the same boat as the former Chief Minister was?

This  is what the Prime Minister once said in  1956

in  the debate on the Malayanisation of the police.

As  I  quoted just now from Hansard, Vol.  2, col.

1081:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To a certain extent, the experience of Members on

the  other  side  of the: recent disorders  in  the

Colony of Singapore when they found that their  own

lives  and  property had to be defended  by  Gurkha

troops:  and police and European officers may  have

weighed heavily in their minds.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, perhaps this now weighs  heavily

in  the  mind of the Prime Minister. I can find  no

other  reason  for  the Prime  Minister  not  being

interested  in the complete Malayanisation  of  the

police  force  than  the above reason.  Has  he  no

confidence  in our own people? That our  own  local

administrators   can  run  the  Prime   Minister's

Office.  That  our own intellectuals  can  organise

political  discussions based on  our  own  national

identity  and  thinking. That our own local  Police

officers  can maintain law and order when entrusted

with  the  task.  Or does the Prime Minister  still

prefer an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>





expatriate who cannot multiply figures by six to  a

local  accountant? As an accountant,  I  say  this,

Mr  Speaker,  that this local officer  is  easily

considered  to  be one of the top local  accounting

brains in Singapore, both in Government and private

enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this debate, we have

confined  ourselves to the question  of  expatriate

administrative  officials only. It  does  not  mean

that  the question of expatriate technical officers

is  not important. Although they have control  over

our  power  structure,  their  control  is  not  as

fundamental as the expatriate administrators'.  Mr

Speaker,   the  source  of  Government   power   in

Singapore is not to be found in the P.A.P., nor  in

the  Central Executive Committee in the P.A.P., nor

in  the P.A.P. Assemblymen, nor in the Cabinet. The

Cabinet  only gives the formal approval  of  power.

The  source of power is to be found in a group  of

individuals  most  of  whom  are  not  elected  and

responsible  to the people. The day-to-day  running

of   the   government  of  the  country  is   being

undertaken at present by these five men: first, the

Prime  Minister, second, the Minister for  Finance,

third,  Meadows, fourth. Blades, and fifth,  George

Thomson.  I  do not blame the latter  three.  Their

duty  is  to the British Empire, and for that  they

have  shown  and given loyal service. The  Internal

Security  Council, the Singapore  Constitution  and

the  British  Military Force have their  respective

tasks to fulfill, other than the day-to-day running

of  the Government. The Ministers are more like the

Permanent  Secretaries.  It  is  something  of  the

nature of de Gaulle's Cabinet. Mr K. M. Byrne,  as

the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce

and  Industry  of the Lim Yew Hock Government,  had

more  power and authority than he has as a Minister

under the present Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the hon. Member for Hong

Lim relate that to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it shows that

other  than  the  two important  Ministers  in  the

Cabinet, these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



three  expatriate administrators,  vis-a-vis  their

own  Ministers, are more important and more  vital,

and  they  have  the  decisive say  in  matters  of

policy.   In  the  present  context,  Mr  Meadows,

although in theory only possessing the status of  a

Deputy  Permanent Secretary, speaks with  far  more

authority  and  exerts  far  more  power  than  the

Minister for Labour and Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> How stupid!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he will wake

up one day to see his pants stripped off! The issue

in  today's  debate  is the Malayanisation  of  all

expatriate administrators. We have brought  up  for

special mention three of them because they are  the

most important. And its illustration will give  the

people  a  clearer insight into the  importance  of

expatriate administrators and their control of  our

State.  How  can we allow this state of affairs  to

continue?  Have  faith in our local officers.  Have

faith in our people. Perhaps as the final report of

the   Malayanisation   Commission   said   in   its

conclusion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During the transition period there may be some

diminution of general efficiency not because  local

persons  are incompetent or because they belong  to

an  inferior biological species but simply  because

of the fact of change.'



<br><br>But  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we must have faith  in  the

ability  of our own people to solve our own destiny

and plan for our own future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the most apt words uttered  by  the

Member for Hong Lim were those in his introductory

sentences. You will recollect that he has said that

it  is  utterly absurd for anyone to have  proposed

the  motion,  and  if only he had followed  to  the

conclusion  that this statement leads  one  to,  he

would  have  kept  his mouth  shut  and  sat  down,

thereby   sparing  this  Assembly  a   most   sorry

exhibition,  I  do  not think the  dignity  of  the

Assembly   has  been  heightened  by  the   pitiful

spectacle of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



misrepresentation,  lack of logic  and  incoherence

with  which we have been regaled for the last  hour

and a half. Before I deal with the substance of the

motion,   may   I  first  make  a  few  preliminary

observations  to  clear  up  some  misunderstanding

which might arise from what the Member for Hong Lim

has said?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did rise on a point of clarification to point

out the distinction between the Malayanisation of a

post  and  the  Malayanisation of an  officer.  The

Member  for Hong Lim said that the distinction  was

quite  clear  to  him. But he immediately  made  it

quite  evident  that he is completely  ignorant  of

this  very  elementary  fact.  When  you  say   you

Malayanise a post by such and such a year, it means

that  that  post will not be held by an  expatriate

officer, After that time, the post will be held  by

a local officer. But it does not mean that the then

incumbent of the post would be Malayanised.  So  it

was  in the case of Mr Meadows, when he held the

post  of  Deputy Secretary in 1955/1956,  and  that

post  was  recommended for Malayanisation  and  was

duly  Malayanised. But Mr Meadows was a member  of

the  Malayan  Civil  Service,  and,  as  such,  was

available  for  transfer to other  posts.  And  his

Malayanisation date is not due to take effect until

some  time  in  1962.  The  Member  for  Hong  Lim,

therefore, misled the Assembly. I hope, in charity,

that  he did that unconsciously. But he misled  the

Assembly  in  trying to make out that  the  present

Government has extended the terms of Mr Meadows'

service  beyond his due date. The Member  for  Hong

Lim said that he based his whole case on principle.

But for more than an hour, we have been treated  to

a  personal  attack  on three expatriate  officers,

their  lack of integrity, their perfidy  and  their

unreliability. The Member for Hong Lim, as a Member

of  this Assembly, occupies a position of privilege

when  he  utters any word in this Assembly, if  he

were  to  make  the  same  statement  outside   the

Assembly  in the same reckless manner that  he  has

done, I venture to suggest that he would soon  land

in a libel suit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,

Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister will not give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member will have time

later  in  the debate to make use of the  occasion.

Time flies and we do not want to be held up in this

rather foolish motion for the rest of the night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim, as everyone knows,

is  a  great  lad for gimmicks. We  have  seen  his

predilection for this line when he was  given  free

rein during his first Mayorship in the City Council

and  his  brief but disastrous career as a Minister

in  the  P.A.P. Government. Everytime  he  built  a

stand-pipe,  an opening ceremony was duly  arranged

with pomp and splendour, whereby the generosity  of

the then Mayor could be publicly acclaimed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> It was for the Party!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He wanted to chase all cars

from Raffles Place.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if the Minister can

relate those remarks to the motion. I think I  have

to  keep asking that question. It does not seem  to

be related to the motion at all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I shall soon be arriving at

the point that this motion is just another gimmick,

an  example  and  a theme will develop  as  further

details -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, does not

make  those  remarks relevant to  the  motion,  The

remarks  themselves must be relevant to the motion.

We are not now debating the character of the Member

for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if you so rule. I was

merely  saying that the firm and relevant point  is

that  there  is  no  substance  whatsoever  in  his

motion,  and I was trying to illustrate, by various

incidents  in his career, that it is very  much  in

keeping with his character. I trust that that  will

be -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Unless the actions described

relate  to  expatriate officers, I am  afraid  they

must  be  irrelevant. Because the actions  must  be

related to expatriate officers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this motion is but the

second  of  the  motions to be  introduced  by  the

Member  for  Hong  Lim.  At the  last  sitting,  he

introduced a motion on political detainees,  and  I

have  no  doubt  that in future sittings  we  shall

continue to be regaled at each meeting with further

motions until we reach the magic number of 16.  The

Government  has  vigorously  countered  his   first

motion  and today we shall slap this second  motion

down just as effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first consider what the Member for Hong

Lim proposes to achieve by introducing this motion.

First of all, let us never imagine that the purpose

of the motion is what he purports to do, namely, to

advance the cause of local officers. Civil servants

in  the  City  Council,  the Ministry  of  National

Development, the Housing Board and other Government

departments, over whom the Member once held sway as

overlord,  know  him too well as  a  tyrant  and  a

bully.  His  departure from the  City  Council  was

greeted by a spontaneous outburst of joy and relief

on  the  part of local officers, many of whom  held

celebrations on the day the news was announced.  So

it   was   too   with  the  Ministry  of   National

Development,   the   Housing   Board   and    other

departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is not foolish enough to

imagine  that at this late stage he could  retrieve

his  reputation with the local officers.  What  he

hopes to achieve by this motion is simply this.  He

is  trying  to get across to the public the  motion

that  the present Government is pro-expatriate  and

that this is just one more piece of evidence of the

soft  attitude  of the Government  towards  British

Colonialism. In this way, he hopes to maintain  his

post  as  a  true  defender of the  people  against

British Colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that such a

pretence  will  not deceive even a  child, if  the

Member  for  Hong Lim had taken pains  to  get  his

facts straight, he would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



have  found  that, in the light of what  is  taking

place,  this motion is utterly nonsensical. Let  me

present  to  the  Assembly some figures  about  the

numbers   of   expatriate  officers  now   in   the

administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion does not deal with technical officers

such  as  engineers, doctors,  architects  and  so

forth.  It  is  concerned  with  officers  who  are

engaged   in   the  administrative   functions   of

Government   departments.   We   can   grade   such

expatriate  officers  into two  groups.  The  first

consists  of  members of the former  Malayan  Civil

Service,  the Malayan administrative pool and  such

types.  They  are the elite of the former  Colonial

Administrative Service. Indeed, at one time it  was

common-place to call them the heaven-born,  because

of  the  prestige they enjoyed and the  power  they

wielded.   They   held  the  key   posts   in   the

administration  and it was they who decided  policy

and   executed   it.   Before  the   Malayanisation

Commission made its recommendations in 1956,  there

were 48 such European administrative officers,  and

most  of  them  were members of the  Malayan  Civil

Service.  Under the programme for phased retirement

of these officers, if these officers had elected to

serve  their full term of service, there  would  be

serving  in  Singapore no less  than  33  of  these

expatriate  administrative officers.  What  is  the

position  today? There are no more  than  three  of

them. And may I hasten to add that these three  are

not  the famous trio who have become the bête noire

of  the  Member for Hong Lim. In the face of  this,

only  a  fool would maintain that there  should  be

anxiety   about  the  pace  of  Malayanisation   of

administrative officers of this grade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group of officers who perform

administrative functions though they do

not belong to the Malayan Civil Service. By and

large, they serve in various departmental services

such as Customs, Income Tax, Police, Audit,

Broadcasting, Education, Prisons and so forth. They

administer particular Ordinances for which their

departments are responsible. Before the

Malayanisation Commission made its recommendations,

there were about 250



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



of   these   officers.  Under  the   programme   of

Malayanisation,   there  would  be   remaining   in

Singapore  today  135 if all had  chosen  to  serve

their  full term of service. In actual fact,  there

are now only 24 of them. So we see today, out of  a

total  of some 300 expatriate officers who were  in

various  administrative positions in the Government

service,  only 27 now remain. All the  others  have

exercised the option for retirement before the date

of Malayanisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of these facts, the conclusion must

be  that Malayanisation is no longer an issue  that

need cause any anxiety as to the point of retention

of  unduly large numbers of expatriate officers. As

regards  the  magical powers which the famous  trio

have  been  ascribed to have, may I say that  these

only  exist  in  the  paranoid imagination  of  the

Member for Hong Lim?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large-scale retirement of expatriate officers has

left  great  gaps  in  the administrative  machine.

These  have been gallantly filled by local officers

whose performance is a credit both to them and  the

country. In the brief space of three or four years,

nearly   all  the  responsible  positions  in   the

administration  are  now in local  hands.  In  many

instances, comparatively young officers have had to

take  on responsibilities which they normally would

be  required  to  do  at a much  greater  stage  of

seniority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Malayanisation has been discussed

in  the Assembly during the debate on the speech of

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I will quote  at  some

length  from  this  debate,  but  I  think  it   is

necessary  here to point out that the  approach  of

the  Government and the approach of the Member for

Hong  Lim  towards the issue of Malayanisation  are

radically  different. We want  to  fill  the  posts

vacated  by expatriate officers with the ablest  of

our  local  officers.  The  Member  for  Hong  Lim,

however,  regards  Malayanisation  as  an  exercise

whereby  his  cronies from Batu Pahat could  occupy

high   official  positions  for  which   they   are

completely  unfitted. This point has  been  clearly

brought out by the Prime Minister in his final



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



address in the debate on the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,  and the case  of  another  famous

trio,  the Lu: brothers and young Mr Owen, is  now

public knowledge. Nevertheless, I cannot resist the

temptation  to quote some extracts from  the  Prime

Minister's Address. First, there was Mr  Lui  Boon

Poh  who was appointed by the Member for Hong  Lim,

when  he was the Minister for National Development,

to  take  charge of the three great departments  of

Singapore's   public  utilities - the   Electricity,

Water  and  Gas  Departments.  At  column  578   of

Hansard,  Volume  13,  No. 8 dated  Thursday,  11th

August, 1960, the Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Lui Boon Poh was educated at Batu Pahat...'



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I intend to carry on. He can make all his observations and clarifications when

he winds up the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is a remarkable coincidence that Batu

Pahat is the birthplace of the Member for Hong  Lim

where he -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

clarification.  I  happen to be born  in  the  same

place as the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Member for Hong

Lim  should make extensive notes and then reply  in

detail. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Prime Minister went on to

say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...He [Mr Lui Boon Poh] had previously been a

salesman  with  Fissions Chemicals, selling  patent

medicines  amongst other things. He  was  appointed

first as Superintendent, City Cleansing Department,

and    then   as   Deputy   Administrator   (Public

Utilities). He was not dismissed immediately  after

I  took  over. He was given, three months  to  show

that, despite the fact that his past experience and

qualifications  were somewhat not in  keeping  with

the   job  he  was  holding,  he  is  an  extremely

competent administrator. Unfortunately, after three

months,  our high hopes and expectations  were  not

realised. He is now back in the Federation...'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the famous friend of Mr Lui who

took  over the City Cleansing Department, doubtless

on  the  ground that he had experience  in  selling

patent medicines -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that these officers

named  were appointed as replacements of expatriate

officers;  otherwise I cannot  find  any  relevance

whatsoever.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Indeed, Sir, this was an

example  of  the  process  of  "Batu  Pahatisation"

landing  the whole administration into  a  complete

mess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this gentleman, a former ex-medicine

seller,  took  over  the Cleansing  Department  and

decided  that the incinerator at Kolam Ayer  served

no  useful purpose, and that it was better that the

rubbish  be  dumped there to sink into  the  swamp,

thereby  making the ground firmer so that it  would

not  be  necessary to go to the extent of expensive

piling  when you ultimately build on the site.  The

result  was  that tremendous swarms of  flies  soon

plagued  the area, greatly to the distress  of  the

residents in that area. This is one of the  effects

of    the   Malayanisation   programme   not   only

recommended  but  actually  carried  out   in   the

desperate days when the Member for Hong Lim  was  a

Minister of the Government, The same dismal episode

was  repeated  in  all Boards and Departments  over

which  the Member for Hong Lim had control  in  the

past.  In  the  City Council, his  policy  led  not

merely  to  the resignation of expatriate  officers

but to the resignation of 38 local senior officers,

many  of  whom were persons of long experience  and

special   technical  training.  In  the   Singapore

Improvement  Trust, of which the  Member  appointed

himself  as  Chairman when he was a  Minister,  the

position  was  even worse. May I  quote  the  Prime

Minister's   account  of  what  happened   in   the

Singapore Improvement Trust? I quote from the  same

Hansard (Volume 13, No. 8, dated 11th August, 1960)

at column 583:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...he reduced it to near paralysis, unable to

handle  any  housing or planning  projects  of  any

consequence. The manager, architects,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



planners, financial, estates and other officers all

left.  The  position is something like  this,  Sir.

Eight  expatriate officers resigned and, of  these,

the  Minister wanted to retain two. He told me that

personally, He said he wanted two of them. They did

not  want to stay. Ten were retrenched. Two  senior

local officers resigned, one was retrenched, and 58

local  junior  officers were  retrenched.  Sir,  in

their   places  came  a  whole  host  of   personal

appointees - some qualified, many unqualified. Twenty-two  others  who  took  the  place  of  the  junior

retrenched  officers  were  either  unqualified  or

under-qualified. An example is Mr Lui  Boon  Phor,

the brother of the man who was told to send someone

to the Pasir Panjang Power Station. Sir, he is also

from Batu Pahat. He was appointed Chief Development

Officer. On 20th August, 1959, his salary was  $450

per   month  as  Lettings  Officer.  Then  he   was

promoted.  On 1st of October, 1959, his salary  was

$670. Sir, apart from just being the brother of Mr

Lui  Boon Poh - he had a few other things to  commend

him.  One of these is that he was unqualified. He

was a part-time teacher in adult education. But, he

was,  of course, put in charge of all the lettings

in the S.I.T.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have established my point that the

motion standing in the name of the Member for  Hong

Lim has no merit whatsoever. Accordingly, I propose

the following amendment to the motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all words after "Assembly" and insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"approves the policy of the Government in taking

proper steps to Malayanise all administrative

expatriate officials in a systematic manner and so

as not to repeat the blunders of those who

misinterpreted Malayanisation to mean replacing

competent officials with unqualified friends and

supporters".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The full amendment will

therefore read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the policy of the

Government in taking proper steps to Malayanise all

administrative expatriate officials in a systematic

manner  and  so  as not to repeat the  blunders  of

those  who  misinterpreted Malayanisation  to  mean

replacing   competent  officials  with  unqualified

friends and supporters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original question is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges the Government to take

immediate   steps  to  Malayanise  all   expatriate

administrative officials.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



Since which, an amendment has been moved:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all words after "Assembly" and

insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"approves the policy of the Government in taking

proper   steps  to  Malayanise  all  administrative

expatriate officials in a systematic manner and  so

as   not  to  repeat  the  blunders  of  those  who

misinterpreted  Malayanisation  to  mean  replacing

competent  officials with unqualified  friends  and

supporters".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Question is, "That the words proposed

to be left out, be left out." As hon. Members know,

the debate may range over the words proposed to  be

inserted.  In other words, the whole of the  motion

by  the  Member for Hong Lim and the whole  of  the

amendment  by the Minister for Finance  are  before

the Assembly for debate. If there are copies of the

amendment, I will ask the Clerk to hand them  round

to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the amendment handed in to the Clerk

and distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low Por Tuck, in Mandarin?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> In Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the hon. Member supplied a copy

of his speech to the interpreters?  Is it a lengthy

speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> No, it is not. (In Mandarin)

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support  the  amendment

moved   by   the   Minister   for   Finance.    The

Malayanisation issue raised today is  one  that  is

expected.  When the Member for Hong Lim  moved  his

motion, he was repeating what he had said before at

the  sitting in August, when he touched on  it.  At

this sitting, we clearly declared our stand on this

Malayanisation issue. Mr Speaker, allow me to read

out   what   the   Prime   Minister   said   about

Malayanisation and our attitude towards it. Let  me

quote it from the Nanyang Siang Pau of 12th August

[Hansard, 11th August, 1960, col. 585].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, let me add that only a political innocent

would  still  be shouting the same old  slogan  of

"Down with white officers - Malayanisation!" They are

already  politically down, and we can get them  out

any  time  We want to. Our problem is not a  simple

one  of  dislodging expatriate officers... The problem

now  is how to find sufficient numbers of local men

with  the  ability  and  the  skill,  capable   and

efficient, to learn quickly enough to carry out the

functions  of the State and maintain the efficiency

of the administration.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me repeat this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The problem now is how to find sufficient numbers

of  local  men  with  the ability  and  the  skill,

capable  and efficient, to learn quickly enough  to

carry  out the functions of the State and  maintain

the efficiency of the Administration.'



<br><br>This    clearly   shows   our   attitude    towards

Malayanisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what is the Malayanisation policy of

our first Mayor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting on 30th June, 1958, he said (this

was a verbatim report) that among the 71 expatriate

officials,  only 8 must be immediately malayanised.

The  Malayanisation policy regarding the  other  63

officials was this: 5 would be guaranteed retention

in  service until retirement; 16 would serve  until

1st January, 1959, or retirement at 55, or optional

retirement at 50; 11 would be employed  up  to  1st

January,  1964, or when they wished  to  retire  on

reaching  50  or  55  years of  age;  11  would  be

retained  until 1st January, 1962. These  officials

would include Mr Scale and Mr Embley.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Finance Minister has just now told us that

among  the  administrative officers  there  are  at

present only three expatriate officers. The  Member

for  Hong  Lim  cannot even now mention  a  fourth.

According to this Malayanisation policy, at present

there  should be 33 remaining. As to the  technical

side,   there  are  only  34  expatriate   officers

remaining. According to the Malayanisation  policy,

there  should be 135 expatriate officers  remaining

today.  From  a  comparison of  our  Malayanisation

scheme  with  that of the former  Mayor's,  we  can

clearly see that from what the Member for Hong  Lim

has said just now, he has not only been harping  on

the  same tune, but his speech does not hold water.

He  is  distorting facts and trying to confuse  the

people. If he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



really interested and is in earnest, he must  raise

the  issue  with a comparison. This should  be  the

correct attitude. Our Malayanisation policy is  not

like  his.  I remember that I touched on  the  same

question  in this Assembly on 5th August, 1960.  It

appeared  in  the Sin Chew Jit Poh  of  6th  August

[Hansard, 5th August, 1960, Col. 250]. I will quote

from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We can see that the thinking of the Member for

Hong   Lim  is  very  simple.  According   to   his

understanding,  the so-called Malayanisation  means

not  the  substitution of capable local  people  in

place  of expatriate officers, but the substitution

of  Ong  Eng Guan's people for expatriate officers.

According  to  his way of thinking,  the  so-called

Malayanisation is only "Ong Eng Guanisation".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have said is not to

distort  the  facts but to give the truth.  I  will

make  mention  of the so-called Mr Owen  whom  the

Member  for  Hong  Lim praised as very  worthy  and

capable.  We do not know whether he is capable  and

worthy.   He  is  an  officer  responsible   to   a

Government   Department  controlling  millions   of

dollars,   and  he  has  obtained  his  accountancy

certificate  only two years ago. From this  we  can

know what the position as regards financial control

in  this  department  is. It must  be  in  a  great

muddle.  The  Prime Minister in his speech  on  3rd

August, also touched on this. It appeared  in  the

Nanyang   Siang  Pau.  According  to   the   former

Treasurer of the Department, he had planned  for  a

budget  deficit  of  $5  million.  All  these  were

related to the former Minister for National

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on this Malayanisation policy

issue,  we  do not want to utilise this  chance  to

build  up a personal empire and to consolidate  our

own   position.  If  it  is  so,  then  the  person

concerned will have a pitiful future. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I believe the Member for Hong Lim will want to

raise  another  issue at the next sitting  of  this

House  harping on the same tune again. Let us  hear

what he has to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which needs clarification is this.

Just  now the Member for Hong Lim touched on George

Thomson   concerning  the  episode  in  the   Staff

Training Centre. He said some Members were trained

there. At that time, some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



Members  were  wondering why this Mr  Thomson  was

there  to  brainwash  them,  and  so  many  Members

withdrew from training. This is not a fact, and  is

only an attempt to distort facts.



<br><br>6.27 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for  Hong  Lim went to a  great  extent  to

repeat  what he had said over and over again  about

George  Thomson,  Meadows  and  Blades.  I  am  not

concerned here with the allegations he made against

these  officers. What I am really concerned is  the

mental  health  of an honour-able  Member  of  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He alleged that my Minister, the Minister for

Culture,  and I were seen at a party in  connection

with the tourist trade, and our picture appeared in

a  newspaper. Sir, this is the paper which  he  has

referred  to,  the  Nanyang  Siang  Pau   of   17th

February, 1960, page 1, "Local News". I was  there;

so  was the Minister. Five persons appeared in  the

picture,  and  the man who sat in  the  middle  was

referred  to  as Mr George Thomson.  I  could  not

remember  Mr George Thomson having any  connection

with  the tourist trade. For your information, Sir,

the  person  referred to as Mr George Thomson  was

actually Mr J. G. C. Thomson, a partner of  Cooper

Brothers  &  Company. He was the  Chairman  of  the

Preparatory Committee of the Tourist Association. I

am   really   concerned,  Mr  Speaker,   that   an

honourable  Member of this House  should  have  the

audacity to produce -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have overruled the word

"audacity"  and that word must still be  overruled.

Will   the   Member  please  withdraw   that   word

"audacity"?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I withdraw the word, Sir. I

think an honourable Member of this House should not

be so dishonourable.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Even "dishonourable" is

unparliamentary.   Perhaps  "irresponsible"   might

help.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> I will substitute the word

"irresponsible". I would have stood up on  a  point

of information to deny the whole thing but I was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



not  sure and, being a man of integrity, I took the

opportunity at tea time to recheck the facts before

I came to speak. I do not want to waste the time of

this  House.  This little fact alone is  enough  to

prove  that our hon. Member for Hong Lim should  be

more careful when he makes further allegations.



<br><br>6.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take

up  from where the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Culture left off, which is  the  key-note  of  the speeches, that is, we do not want  to

waste  the time of this House. Obviously,  whatever

the   shortcomings  of  the  former  Minister  for

National Development, he must have had a purpose in

moving the motion and making the speech he did. For

the politically simple and straightforward, let  me

explain how tortuous one's thinking can become,  so

that  one  becomes completely oblivious  of  truth,

principles,  or decency in the quest for  publicity

to boost up oneself and to damage one's enemies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is not concerned with the

debate  in  this House, nor with your rulings,  nor

with the vote. He knows he has to face on this side

of  the House 40 sane, reasonably sober people  who

have  known him for a considerable length of  time,

and who had correctly anticipated what he was going

to say and what he was going to do. He is concerned

with  the  hand-outs that he is going to  give  the

Press,  and  which the Press will  publish  because

they  are privileged. This is important and it  may

not be known to the public - that whatever is said in

this  House is privileged in the sense that no lie,

no  libel, nothing derogatory can be the subject of

an action because the Constitution ordains that the

representatives  of the people  freely  elected  by

secret  ballot should have only you,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the Standing Orders and the sense of  decency

and honour to guide them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of clarification



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There will be plenty of time

for  clarification after my speech. The newspapers,

knowing  that  what is spoken here  is  privileged,

because it is in an Assembly sitting, are therefore

completely immune when they publish any lie or  any

libel  against  any person. But, Sir,  if  anything

said in this Chamber which is untrue, derogatory or

defamatory is repeated outside, then the public may

be interested to know that an action for defamation

and damages arising therefrom can be brought in any

court  of law, if anything said in this Chamber  is

repeated  outside  and  an action  ensues  and  the

statement is proved to be true, then he who  brings

the  action fails and he will have to pay costs  to

the person he has brought into court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will forgive me if I have to explain this

elementary  point  of law, because,  unfortunately,

not  all  people  in Singapore are acquainted  with

these technicalities. The mass effect is this. Here

is the newspaper, here is the headline, and this is

what is said. Nothing happens. It is repeated again

and  again, and after some time it may be accepted.

It may be passed off as true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been nothing of substance, no argument,

no facts on this motion. The facts were given by my

colleague, the Minister for Finance. There are only

three   administrative  officers   left   who   are

expatriates.  There  should  have   been   30   odd

officers,  but they have left, and we are  carrying

on.  But that is not the point. The point is in the

asides - to  do  as  much damage as possible  to  the

character  and reputation of those whom the  Member

wants to destroy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to waste the time of this House

because nothing of substance has been brought forth

by  the  Member other than some, what I have called

"cowardly"    but   which   you   have   overruled,

allegations made against his former colleagues.  As

for  the allegations against me, Sir - that  I  am  a

stooge,  the mouthpiece of an expatriate  political

theoretician,  that I am incapable of  setting  the

Party line, of writing my own speeches, that  I  am

just  like Mr Braga, inept, incompetent, a buffoon

and a playboy, who does not know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



what  is  going on in his Ministry; who allows  Mr

Meadows,  this  wicked, evil, British  intelligence

genius,  to  manipulate me, and Mr Blades  and  so

on - everyone  of those statements of  fact  and  the

inferences that he sought to draw from them was  an

untruth.  Sir,  it  is  a very  funny  thing  about

Parliamentary language, if I may allow  myself  one

aside, if   you   use   the  simple   Anglo-Saxon

monosyllabic  word,  "liar",  to  nail  a  man,  it

becomes a little bit obscene. But if you substitute

it  with  the  word  "untruth", it  passes  off  as

parliamentary. However that may be, Sir,  a  person

who utters an untruth is nevertheless by definition

a liar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what I have said is a lie, then I can be sued.

Outside this Chamber at the end of this debate.  It

is  very  simple. The gentlemen of  the  Press  are

here.  I  ask the Member for Hong Lim to hand  them

his  typewritten  notes, with all  the  allegations

about  me  and George Thomson sitting  by  my  side

prompting  me:  and Meadows; that  I  am  like  Mr

Braga: and tell them outside the precincts of  this

Assembly,  "Here  is  what  I  say  of  the   Prime

Minister,"  and I say we will have a battle  royal.

Either the Member for Hong Lim is right and I am  a

stooge,  a  fool, an idiot, a half-wit,  a  toy, a

puppet  of three expatriates; or he has uttered  an

untruth. Sir, I say he has uttered an untruth,  and

at  the  end  of this debate I shall  use  a  four-alphabet  word  without the cover of  privilege  of

this House to tell the Press what I think of him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I go back to the somewhat mildly worded

amendment   of  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Finance.  We  all  have  our recollection  of  what

happened  over  the last few years since  not  just

1955 - Malayanisation was an issue which started  in

the  years  after the war when, with the output  of

more and more graduates from Raffles College (as it

then  was)  and from universities abroad,  pressure

mounted, to take over all these points of power  in

the  cockpit of the State. As far as the main issue

was   concerned,  it  came  to  a  head  with   the

Malayanisation   Commission,  its   recommendations

therefrom,  the White Paper which was  tabled,  and

the stand which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



the People's Action Party took at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem, quite simply now, is how to get the

machinery  of  the State to function  in  the  most

efficient   way.  Let  me  tell  the  great   anti-colonialist,  the self proclaimed anti-colonialist,

the  Member  for  Hong Lim, what the  real  burning

issues   are  now.  Not  to  quibble  about   three

expatriates  who  can  be  denounced,  defamed  and

dismissed  at  will, since they have already  taken

their  compensation terms and are quite safely  out

of  harm's way, and who will go if at any  time  we

want  them  to  go.  The burning  issue  is,  quite

simply,  this. How do you keep this island  of  224

square  miles  alive and viable, when its  economic

existence is controlled indirectly by companies  in

London  and  companies  in  Kuala  Lumpur?   In   a

situation   where  numerical  and  other   logistic

superiority  is overwhelmingly on the side  of  the

Federation,  and  indirectly on  the  side  of  the

British, how do you establish Singapore as part  of

an independent State? For the Member's information,

we  are bringing out, in another anniversary number

of  Petir, our ideological arguments and our stand-point brought up to date. And we do not require Mr

George  Thomson, good though he may be as a student

of political science, to tell us how to analyse our

own future. What I think we must do is to make sure

that  not  only  you,  Mr Speaker,  but  also  the

Members of this Assembly understand this, that  the

written  word as published tomorrow in the  Nanyang

Siang Pau, the Sin Chew fit Poh, the Utusan Melayu,

the Berita Harian, the Tamil Murasu and the Straits

Times,  will  leave no doubts in the minds  of  the

people as to what the real issues are. They are not

concerned  with Mr Owen and Mr Lui Boon  Poh  and

the aberrations of the Member for Hong Lim when  he

was   invested  with  tremendous  power.  But  they

concern the destinies and the way out for a million

and  a half people living on an extremely sensitive

entrepôt  economy - a  people  who  are  tremendously

active,  physically  and mentally;  a  people  who,

politically,  are  extremely  mature,   ready   and

willing to run the apparatus of an independent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



State  but who are denied the where-withal. How  do

we  create  a vital economy, a situation  in  which

independence  can become a reality, an independence

which can become the basis for a social revolution,

to  create an economic system that will live up  to

the platform of a socialist party - the creation of a

more just and equal society? We do not pretend that

we are doing that, because you cannot create a more

just  and equal society when you cannot change  the

basis  `of the economic system. But what we do  say

is  that  we  are  providing the  people  with  the

maximum social benefits, given the limitations that

are imposed on this State, not constitutionally but

by  the economic facts of life. If he can think out

some of the answers to these problems, then he  can

stand up and say, "Yes, I will drive the Naval Base

into the sea, or I shall take it over and change it

into  a  commercial  dockyard. I  shall  take  over

Changi  Airfield and turn it into a new Farnborough

showground for South-East Asia. I shall  take  over

the  Army  installations at  the  B.O.D. in  Pasir

Panjang  and  turn  them  into  brigades  for   the

reconstruction    and   revitalisation    of    the

independent people of Malaya." Tell us how  and  we

shall  listen with avid ears. But if he  does  not,

then  I  say, keep up his subscriptions, if not  to

the  Party, because he is no longer a member,  then

at  least  to Petir, to which he can subscribe,  in

order  that  he  can  keep up  with  the  political

education  which the Party has given  him  for  all

these years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the danger of those who must have

mentors. Never quarrel with your mentors, otherwise

you  go adrift. My colleagues and I are in the more

fortunate position of being our own mentors. If the

Member  for Hong Lim says that that is a lie,  that

it  is not true and that it is George Thomson  and

Blades  and Meadows who run the government outside

this Chamber, then we will give him the time of his

life.  And I hope, Sir, he has sufficient funds  to

defray  the  whole cost of what  I  think  will  be

enjoyable proceedings. We saved him, Sir - my friend,

the Minister for Labour and Law, myself and a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



others - from   the   excruciating   and   terrifying

experience of being put in the witness box.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just wind it up, Mr Speaker, Sir. It is

one  thing to shout into this inert microphone,  to

the discomfiture of the ears of the Speaker - one ear

of the Speaker - and to the discomfiture of the other

50  hon. Members of this House. It is another thing

to  repeat those lies in the witness box in a calm,

dispassionate  manner where every fact  has  to  be

established or every lie has to be eaten - and  heavy

damages  paid  at  the end of it.  Either  I  am  a

stooge, a fool, a half-wit, in which case I deserve

to  be  called  so outside publicly;  or  he  is  a

fabricator  of  untruths. Sir, I am  going  to  say

outside what I think of him, and I hope he will  do

likewise  on the facts that he has stated  in  this

Assembly.  If  he  does not,  then  the  people  of

Singapore will know the worth of his motions  which

will come month by month. There is nothing new.  It

is  all  in the 16 resolutions. Because it is  very

difficult to think up something new when you  have

not got a mind that is prepared to be objective,  a

mind  that  is  prepared to analyse, to  argue  and

reason.  But  when  all you can  do  is  to  repeat

malicious  falsehoods, then I say, he is  down  the

slippery slope at the end of which is perdition.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members do appreciate that if

they  wish to speak on the main motion, now is  the

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original motion was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges the Government to take

immediate   steps  to  Malayanise  all   expatriate

administrative officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all words after "Assembly" and insert

"approves  the policy of the Government  in  taking

proper  steps  to  Malayanise  all  administrative

expatriate officials in a systematic manner and  so

as   not  to  repeat  the  blunders  of  those  who

misinterpreted  Malayanisation  to  mean  replacing

competent  officials with unqualified  friends  and

supporters".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out,

be left out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be

inserted, be there inserted," put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question now is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly approves the policy of the

Government in taking proper steps to Malayanise all

administrative expatriate officials in a systematic

manner  and  so  as not to repeat the  blunders  of

those  who  misinterpreted Malayanisation  to  mean

replacing   competent  officials  with  unqualified

friends and supporters."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have not spoken on the main motion

may now speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan, in reply?

<br><br>6.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this is the

usual way the Prime Minister has been running  this

country  of ours for the past 16 or 17 months.  His

behaviour today is a clear manifestation of how  he

runs the country - (1) Intimidation of the Press; (2)

intimidation  to  take  legal  proceedings  against

people who speak against him, in the courts of law,

but not in the debates of this Assembly. Because he

knows  very  well,  Mr Speaker, that  whether  the

proceedings are judicial or not, he can always tear

people down. This is because he has free access  to

legal  advice, the control of the State  apparatus

and, most important of all, plenty of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister as usual in

his  debate on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech

did  not  answer  the  points I  raised  about  the

control    of   our   State   by   the   expatriate

administrators,  especially  by  the   three   most

important of them. You might be wondering why I was

so  patient with his interruptions just now. It was

because  what I said was the truth except, perhaps,

in a small technical matter which the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Culture raised  just

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He has been exposed!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  has  not  denied  that  Mr  Thomson  has

appeared  at  television sittings and on  occasions

when  the  Prime  Minister gave lectures  to  head-masters of schools. We can also see his presence in

the  newspapers every now and then until  the  June 1959  Party conference.

Mr Speaker, one  way  that

the  Prime  Minister answered the charge  that  the

expatriate administrators have key



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



control  of  the Government was not to  answer  the

charge,  but  to  shift the course of  argument  by

shifting the basis of the argument. He turned  over

from  arguing  what I said about the activities  of

George Thomson, Mr Meadows and others. Instead  of

refuting these charges, he shifted the basis  to  a

discourse   or  a  dissertation  on  the   economic

problems of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On the law of libel outside

this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  has not only got control of  the  State's

free legal advice and plenty of funds, he has also,

as  we  have seen lately, control of laws like  the

Criminal   Law  (Temporary  Provisions)  Ordinance,

which he can exercise at any time on both employers

and  employees, trade unionists, politicians, civil

servants,  and everybody who does not toe  the  Lee

Kuan Yew line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister mentioned

just now about how he saved me from commissions of

inquiry. May I take one or two minutes to clarify

this matter, since he was trying to appear to the

public that he was my saviour, and that I was not

grateful to him -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You bet I do!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is now

time  for me to tell the people that he, the  Prime

Minister, was half responsible for the P. C. Marcus

affair,  and that during the commissions of inquiry

he  had to take up my case. There was no choice for

him especially after the 26th of January, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the trial, every time

when witnesses on the other side cast aspersions on

me, like the Mayor's entertainment allowance or the

use  of  the Mayor's car, the Prime Minister  would

just  keep  quiet. He would only save the situation

when it concerned the name of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Prime Minister, since he cannot do so

otherwise, I do not like to call people  names.  If

we were to go through the speeches in the Hansard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



during  the last few debates, I think. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  Assembly can compile  a  compendium  of

abusive language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also do not want, as Members on the Government

benches  did  just  now, to  cast  a  slur  on  the

professions, the qualifications and the  experience

of  people  like  Mr  Owen and  Mr  Lui.  I  have

mentioned sufficiently about their positions during

the debate on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this debate today, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

never  cast  any  slur  on the qualifications,  the

professions  or  the  ability  of  the   expatriate

officers.  We have fought on a matter of principle,

that  the  control of the apparatus  of  our  State

should  be  in the hands of our local officers.  To

this   argument   and  on  this   vital   political

principle,   the  Government  benches  offered   no

counter  arguments. They just replied  by  shifting

the  basis of argument and casting slurs on people.

For  instance, they tried to cast a slur by  moving

this   amendment   reading,  "to   mean   replacing

competent  officials with unqualified  friends  and

supporters".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is meant by

"qualification"?  Is there a University  where  one

can get a degree in "cleansing"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There are Polytechnics where

you get certificates in cleansing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I am correct in

saying  that  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  did  not

interrupt  the  Prime Minister. Perhaps  the  Prime

Minister could do the same.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the same

manner there is no University or Polytechnic  where

people can get diplomas in S.I.T. flat lettings.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Can you tell us how you

managed it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I would not like to dwell at

length  on  the relatives, the brothers-in-law  and

the unqualified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



friends and supporters whom the Prime Minister and

his  friends have put into the Government  service,

the City Council -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. A

serious  allegation has been made  that,  as  Prime

Minister,  I  have  put  in relatives,  unqualified

friends and others - an allegation against me  in  my

capacity  as  Prime  Minister. I say,  substantiate

that by way of a motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is obviously not a point

of  order.  I think the Prime Minister  should  not

take  advantage by rising on a point of order  when

it  is not a point of order. Those allegations  can

be met in the proper way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I rise on a point of

elucidation on your ruling?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All I am saying is that the

Member  for  Hong Lim has cast an aspersion  on  my

conduct  in  this  House in my  capacity  as  Prime

Minister, that I have done something despicable and

dishonourable  by  getting  jobs  for  friends  and

relatives who are unqualified. And if that is so, I

should be sacked.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps I had better remind the

Prime  Minister of the Standing Order in regard  to

the personal conduct of Members:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose.'



<br><br>That   is  in  regard  to  personal  conduct.   The

allegation  is  against the Prime Minister  in  his

official capacity and, therefore, in so far as  the

Standing Orders are concerned, the Member for  Hong

Lim is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Prime Minister allow the

Chair to continue? If the Hon. the Prime Minister

thinks that there is an aspersion against his

character, there are other ways in which the

Government can delve into this matter. But I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



must  say definitely that what the Member for  Hong

Lim  has  said  is  relevant. He is  in  order  and

therefore he is at liberty to say what he has said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

further elucidate on my point of order, to bring it

home  that  I  cannot in my official capacity  have

properly done the thing that I am accused of doing,

and  that  I must have done it surreptitiously  for

the  benefit of my own personal capacity? The point

I am submitting to you, Mr Speaker, Sir - you are as

much  a  lawyer as anybody else in this  Chamber - is

this:  to say that a person has abused his official

position  to get benefits and jobs for his  friends

is   a  very  serious  aspersion  on  the  person's

personal character.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The allegation is really against the

Prime  Minister's official character  and  that  is

exactly why I have permitted this amendment  which,

in  fact, is an aspersion against the character  of

the  then Minister for National Development in  his

official  capacity. It is now alleged that  he,  in

fact,   interpreted  Malayanisation  by  "replacing

competent  officials with unqualified  friends  and

supporters".  That, of course, is  also  equally  a

very  serious aspersion, but that is an  allegation

against the then Minister in his official capacity.

Therefore, it is permitted. Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> On

a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. I would like to

draw  attention  to  Standing Order  46  (6)  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No Member shall impute improper motives to any

other Member.'



<br><br>What  the Prime Minister brought out just  now  was

that  the Member for Hong Lim had imputed that,  in

his  capacity as Prime Minister, the Prime Minister

had  put  in  his  relatives and  friends  who  are

unqualified into the public services.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Standing Order is quite clear.

It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No Member shall impute improper motives...'



<br><br>I  cannot see any imputation of an improper  motive

if  there  is  an  allegation that  a  Member  does

something in his official capacity, namely  to  let

in his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



friends  and relatives, so long as there is nothing

surreptitious and out of the ordinary, and so  long

as the people do know that appointments are made by

the  Public Service Commission. Therefore, I do not

think  that  the  time of this Assembly  should  be

wasted on a debate on the Chair's ruling. As I say,

I have let in a similar allegation against the then

Minister  for  National Development, for  the  same

reason  that  that  was an allegation  against  his

conduct  in  his  official capacity.  Therefore,  I

think  the Prime Minister ought to be content  with

that. Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I always

listen  with  patience about  the  so-called  "Batu

`Pahatisation"  without  trying  to  retaliate   by

revealing   the  exact  position  of  the   present

governmental  structure, of  appointment  of  civil

servants and of Boards and Commissions. In  today's

sitting,  I only want to clarify the position  with

regard  to  this particular amendment. Despite  the

challenge of the Prime Minister - not that  I  cannot

quote  names and facts, but this is not within  the

context  of my motion - I shall perhaps defer  it  to

some other date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I do understand very well the

distinction  raised  by the  Minister  for  Finance

between  the  Malayanisation  of  a  post  and  the

Malayanisation   of   an  officer.   The   previous

Government  played  on  that  distinction  and  the

present Government is doing likewise. For instance,

according  to  the  Report  of  the  Malayanisation

Commission,  the  post of Public Relations  Officer

(occupied  by  George  Thomson)  should  have  been

Malayanised   by   1955  or  1956.   The   previous

Government changed the post of P.R.O. and called it

Director  of Information Services; and the  present

Government  has changed this post of D.I.S.  (which

should  be  Malayanised) to Director  of  Political

Training;  and very soon it is going to be  changed

to  Professor of Political Science. It was the same

with  Mr Meadows - from Principal Assistant Director

of  Social  Welfare to Director of Social  Welfare,

then  to  Deputy Permanent Secretary, and later  to

Secretary  (Special Duties), and  then  he  changed

back again to Deputy Permanent Secretary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance

alleged that I smeared Meadows. I have only exposed

a  small  fraction of what I know and of  what  has

happened  in  order to avoid giving the  impression

that  I  tried to smear him. I have nothing to  say

about    his    capabilities,    efficiency     and

qualifications   as  an  officer.  The   Government

Benchers  have  tried to shift the basic  issue  by

smearing a few local officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by the Minister for

Finance   was   about  the  number  of   expatriate

administrators  in the Government service  now.  He

said  that we have only 27 of them and that,  as  a

matter  of  fact,  according to the  programme,  we

should  have  more.  But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

control  of the State machinery does not depend  so

much  on  the  number  of  British  officials.  For

instance,  in the old Government, there  were  only

three  British  Ministers compared to  six  elected

Ministers;  but  I  say  that  the  three   British

Ministers in the old Government exercised far  more

power  than the six elected Ministers.  As  I  said

just  now,  although the number of  British  police

officers   has  been  reduced  considerably,   the

control  of  the Police Force by the British  still

remains,  by the system of centralisation of  power

in the person of the Commissioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in today's sitting we have seen

clearly  that the Government side cannot offer  any

constructive  reply  to our  arguments.  They  have

replied by pure intimidation right from the  beginning   of  this  debate.  They  have  replied   by

intimidation of the Press and of the Assembly. They

have   replied  by  shifting  the  basis  of   the

argument.   They  have  not  provided  one   single

constructive reply to all the points  I  raised  in

this debate on this vital issue of Malayanisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the policy of the

Government in taking proper steps to Malayanjse all

administrative expatriate officials in a systematic

manner  and  so  as not to repeat the  blunders  of

those  who  misinterpreted Malayanisation  to  mean

replacing   competent  officials  with  unqualified

friends and supporters.
