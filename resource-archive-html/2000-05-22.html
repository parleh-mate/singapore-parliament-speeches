<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. At the sitting of Parliament on 9th

May  2000, I informed hon. Members that Mr J B Jeyaretnam had

filed  a  Notice of Appeal to the Judge of the High Court  in

Chambers  against the Bankruptcy Order made against  him.   I

also informed hon. Members that it was not appropriate for me

to ask Parliament to make a determination under Article 48 of

the  Constitution as to whether his seat has been vacated  as

the Member had filed an appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal was heard on 11th May 2000 and the Registrar

of  the  Supreme Court has informed the Clerk  of  Parliament

that  the  Judge  had  set aside the  Bankruptcy  Order  made

against  Mr  Jeyaretnam on 5th May 2000.  I have  sought  the

advice  of the Attorney-General on the effect of the decision

of  setting  aside the Bankruptcy Order against Mr Jeyaretnam

in  relation to his seat in Parliament.  The Acting Attorney-General has, on 17th May 2000, advised that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect of the Court setting aside the Bankruptcy

Order  is as if the Order was never made.  Mr Jeyaretnam  was

therefore not an undischarged bankrupt between the  period  5

May  -  11 May 2000.  It follows that Mr Jeyaretnam  did  not

vacate his seat in Parliament on 5 May 2000."

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>HIKES IN RATES AND CHARGES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Gradual and staggered implementation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Prime Minister, in

the  light  of  the  gradual restoration  of  employers'  CPF

contribution following the rebound in the Singapore  economy,

whether  the  Government will similarly adopt a  gradual  and

staggered implementation of hikes in charges for the  use  of

amenities,  facilities  and  services  such  as  bus/MRT/taxi

fares, utilities rates, rental charges, so that the impact of

these   hikes  will  be  more  manageable  for  the  ordinary

Singaporeans  in  general and for those in  the  lower-income

group in particular.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I announced the CPF

restoration  and the extension of some cost cutting  measures

in November last year, I had stated that the Government could

not  hold  back all fee increases. Some adjustments would  be

necessary.  However, I gave the assurance that the Government

would  exercise  moderation in revising public  sector  fees,

which it has done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government cut employer CPF contributions, we

did  not  impose  either  a wage or a  price  freeze  on  the

economy.  The  purpose  of the CPF reduction  was  to  reduce

business  costs  and help companies to regain  profitability,

but  without making the labour market rigid or distorted. Now

that  the  economy is recovering strongly, we need to  manage

the  full  restoration  of CPF contributions,  simultaneously

with  wage  adjustments,  so that total  wage  costs  do  not

increase   too  suddenly.  I  believe  the  NWC  is  actively

discussing  this  issue,  and will make  its  recommendations

soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On prices, the Government does not approve or disapprove

price changes by private sector companies. During the crisis,

many firms held back necessary price adjustments, so that now

some  catching up is necessary. The Government  is,  however,

mindful of the combined

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>

impact  of  individual fee increases on the overall  cost  of

living,  and  watches price levels to ensure  that  inflation

stays  under  control.  In the case of  bus  and  MRT  fares,

operators  have to justify the fee increases  to  the  Public

Transport Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI estimates that the adjustments to gas and

electricity tariffs, bus and MRT fares, and taxi  fares  will

increase the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by only 0.22%.  Their

impact  on  the  cost  of living of lower  income  groups  is

slightly higher - 0.25%. But overall, MTI's forecast is  that

CPI  should  increase by only 1-2% this year. This  is  quite

modest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, 2% points of employer CPF contributions

have  already been restored in April. Given the tight  labour

market, we can expect wage settlements to be generally higher

than last year. Therefore, allowing for inflation, most Singa

poreans will enjoy increases in their real, disposable  wages

this  year. In addition, the Government has given rebates  on

HDB  rentals, town council's service and conservancy  charges

and  PUB  charges to lower income households.  These  rebates

exceed  any  likely impact of inflation on these  households.

Thus,  while consumers will not welcome any new or  increased

charges,  however moderate, taken together these  adjustments

are unlikely to impose hardship on Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, when I last asked the question on the  bus  and

MRT  fare  increases,  the Minister of State  was  unable  to

answer  my  question  whether  he  was  aware  that  the  bus

companies  had been making profits.  I have now learned  that

they  have been making quite substantial profits.   Does  the

Government still think that it was necessary to increase  the

bus and MRT fares?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member was not

here  when  I  addressed  this  issue  at  the  last  sitting

following  his  exchange  with  the  Minister  of  State.   I

explained that all companies have to make profits, because if

they  do  not  make  profits they will  fold  up.   Are  they

reasonable profits or are they excessive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>

profits?   That is a matter for the bus and public  transport

companies  to justify to the Public Transport Council.   They

have  put  up a proposal and members of the Public  Transport

Council  have scrutinised the proposal and they have  decided

that  these increases are fair.  I see no reason to challenge

that conclusion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister saying then that the bus

and  MRT  transport should be run for profit  and  not  as  a

public service to the people who need to use them?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are tens of

thousands, if not, several hundred thousand Singaporeans, who

own  shares in SBS and there is a reason why we arranged  the

scheme  so  that  the  shares are  widely  distributed  among

Singaporeans.  That is precisely because it is necessary  for

all  services to run efficiently and one of the  measures  of

efficiency  is  that  you break even and  earn  a  reasonable

profit.   There  are  subsidies which we  have  provided  bus

companies - roads, bus terminuses, taxes.  But given what  we

have  already  decided they are entitled  to,  they  have  to

operate efficiently and the measure of that is that they have

to earn a profit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Two

supplementary  questions.  I would like  to  ask  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister if there are any coordinated efforts  by  the

Government,  for  example,  by way  of  an  inter-ministerial

committee,  to consider the impact and timing of price  hikes

for  public amenities, facilities and services by the various

ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that for the timing of future

price  hikes  within  the  control of  the  Government,  will

consideration  be given to take into account  the  fact  that

salary  increments and bonuses are usually given once a  year

and  that there are still many months to go before the  year-end increments and bonuses materialise?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> On the first question, we do

coordinate  among the ministries.  We do not  have  a  formal

committee, but we do coordinate among

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>

ourselves,  because it does not make sense  for  us  to  have

several  sudden adjustments taking place one after the  other

and  causing an unnecessary shock to people when very  often,

in fact, there is no reason to be shocked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether we should therefore take

into   account  the  timing  of  the  private  sector  salary

increases which happen once a year.  I would suggest that  if

we make all our price increases once a year, that might cause

bigger  shocks, rather than smaller shocks.  I do  not  think

all  the  private sector salary increases take place  at  the

same  time.  The NWC makes its recommendations in May or June

and  companies take a few months, and some take many  months,

before  they  settle the agreement and then  they  are  paid.

Collective  agreements  come due  at  different  times.  Some

bonuses are paid at the end of the year and some are paid  in

the  middle  of the year.  These adjustments are  spread  out

during  the  year and therefore price adjustments also  quite

reasonably ought to take place during the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question, as I have pointed out, is whether the

cumulative effect of all these price adjustments  is  a  high

inflation  rate or a low inflation rate.  I have pointed  out

that,  in  fact, we have ended up with a very  low  inflation

rate.   In  fact,  it was negative for several  years.   Last

year,  it was less than 1% and this year we think it will  be

less than 2%.  CPF has gone up 2% already - that is not take-home  pay - but I am quite sure take-home pay will go  up  by

more  than  2%  this year, because the labour  market  is  so

tight.    These are adjustments which we have to accept.   If

inflation  goes up 5%, 6% or 10%, then there  is  reason  for

people  to worry because that is very big and you are  unable

to  plan ahead and maybe if oil prices shoot through the roof

that might happen - it has happened before - but that is  not

the situation we are in today.

<br><br><!-- Mr R Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I would like

to  ask  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  whether  there  is   a

possibility of giving off-Budget measures, such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>

as helping the lower-income group.  He has just said that the

inflation rate might go up from 1% to 2% and, as it has  been

in  the past, for  the lower-income workers who I have looked

after  in  the  trade  unions,  their  increments  are   very

marginal.   So  1% increase in inflation rate  could  have  a

serious impact.  I would like to know whether there could  be

a possibility of some off-Budget measures.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we had

better  understand that we are living in an unnaturally  calm

state  of  affairs right now.  Inflation of 1-2% is actually,

by  historical standards, quite low.  In Singapore,  that  is

what  we  have  been  able  to achieve  for  many  years  but

internationally 3%, 4%, sometimes even 5%, inflation  in  the

developed  countries has been quite normal.  Maybe the  world

has   changed.    The  central  banks  have   been   careful,

governments have been running smaller deficits and,  in  some

cases,  surpluses.  Inflation has generally come  down  round

the  world,  also  helped by lower oil  prices  until  fairly

recently.  Because of that backdrop and also because  of  our

prudent policies in Singapore, we have been able to keep  our

inflation  to  1-2%.  Despite this, every  year,  during  the

Budget,  because we have some surpluses, the Finance Minister

has  been  able to scatter confetti all around.  We have  got

utilities rebates, service and conservancy rebates, CPF  top-ups.  As I have said, they all add up to a significant sum of

money  for  the lower income group.  They are  not  meant  to

offset  and make up totally for inflation, dollar for dollar.

That is not possible.  But taken overall, I think there is no

question that they have enabled lower income Singaporeans  to

enjoy significant improvements in their standard of living in

addition  to  what they have been able to get  because  wages

have been generally going up from year to year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

consideration of much stronger than expected economic growth,

I  would  like  to ask the Deputy Prime Minister  whether  it

would  be  reasonable  to  expect another  round  of  partial

restoration of CPF within the year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will await with

bated  breath  the report of the National Wages  Council.   I

have no doubt that this will be a hotly discussed subject  in

the  NWC because we have published our first quarter economic

results  last  Friday and they have been good.   There  is  a

basis  and  I  am sure the unions will argue that  we  should

bring   forward   the  restoration,  maybe   not   the   full

restoration,  but certainly to bring forward the  restoration

to  some degree.  The question is what we see for the rest of

this  year, whether it will continue as strong as it is  now,

or   whether  there  will  be  any  clouds  on  the  horizon.

Traditionally, MTI's view in the first half of the  year  has

always  been  that the second half of the  year  would  be  a

little  bit slower.  That is a cautious approach.  We do  not

wish to raise unjustified euphoria and we always want to be a

little bit on the cautious side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me now whether there is a basis to say

definitely that the economy will slow down, I would  say  no,

we  cannot say.  But are there uncertainties?  Yes, there are

some  uncertainties, because it depends on  the  US  economy,

whether  it  is  showing  signs of overheating,  whether  the

Federal  Reserve  Board will be able to moderate  its  growth

without  precipitating a recession, which is a very  delicate

balancing  act.   It depends on whether the European  economy

will continue to grow strongly.  It is showing signs of doing

so now and we hope it  continues.  We trade considerably with

them.   And  it depends on the Japanese economy,  whether  it

will  continue  to  pick up or whether the  beginnings  of  a

recovery  which  we have seen will peter out  again.   I  see

today  Mr Miyazawa has said that the first quarter was  good,

but  the  second  quarter is a little  uncertain.   Plus,  it

depends on what happens in our region, Malaysia and Indonesia

particularly,  which is a matter of considerable  concern  to

us,  and  what happens in Singapore, whether we are  able  to

sustain  the  productivity growth  and  generate  the  higher

output  without our own economy overheating.   So  there  are

some  uncertainties, but I think that, overall, we feel  much

more  optimistic now than we felt a year ago and,  certainly,

even six months ago.  And

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>

so  I  look  forward  to  the  NWC making  some  constructive

recommendations in this respect.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Can I ask the DPM whether

the  economy is really robust because, from the ground, quite

a  lot of the other sectors are not performing that well.  Is

the  9% growth which was registered as robust as it seems  to

be?   Secondly, I want to ask the DPM whether he foresees all

these concerted price increases will drive up consumer prices

and affect the ordinary wage earners.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The first question is whether the

9%  is real.  Well, it is there, unless you doubt the number.

Does  that mean every company is doing well? Not necessarily.

I know that some of the small retailers in the constituencies

are  not  feeling as much of the lift as they  might  if  the

economy was just generally expanding.  But overall, from  the

macro  point  of view, it is quite a widely based  expansion,

because it is in manufacturing, services, trade, banking  and

finance.    The   only  sector  which  is  not   growing   is

construction.   But that is because we have  an  overhang,  a

downturn,  and that will take some time to turn around.   But

overall, it is fairly broad based.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is whether we think these price

increases will drive up the cost of living.  I have given him

MTI's estimate which is, despite the cost increases, overall,

we  think  the CPI will go up by 1% to 2% this year.   And  I

think that is acceptable.  I do not see a sudden spiral-up in

price  levels  unless we have some significant  difficulties,

say, with energy prices.  Then of course it cannot be helped.

And  electricity prices are linked to energy prices.  If  oil

prices  go  up,  somebody has to bear it and Singapore  Power

cannot  absorb  it indefinitely.  So eventually,  electricity

prices  have to go up.  What to do - we have no  gas  or  oil

gushing out from the ground.

<div align="center"><b>WOMEN IN WORKFORCE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Manpower what

constructive steps are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>

being  taken by his Ministry to attract more women  into  the

workforce.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the return of married women to the  workforce,

more  often than not, is a family decision, involving factors

such  as  alternative  child  care  arrangements,  costs  and

benefits, whether the women should stay at home to look after

the family or go out and work to supplement the family income

and  also  the confidence of the women who have  been  absent

from the workforce for some years in returning to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will try to facilitate the return of the

married  women  back to the workforce and we  will  encourage

employers  to help working women to better manage family  and

work  commitments so that they need not drop out as a  result

of family commitments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past years, through our tripartite network, we

have  been encouraging and emphasizing pro-family or  family-friendly  practices at the workplace.  In 1996,  we  launched

the  "Back  to  Work"  Programme  with  the  support  of  the

Productivity and Standards Board, NTUC and Singapore National

Employers'  Federation.  This programme was aimed at  helping

married  women  re-enter the workforce.   This  will  require

employers to adopt more "family-friendly" practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, our labour laws do not restrict

employers  from arranging any workweek patterns to  meet  the

needs of the companies and their employees.  In addition, the

Employment  (Part-Time Employees) Regulations, introduced  in

1996,  provided greater flexibility for employers to pro-rate

the benefits based on the number of hours an employee puts in

and  ensured  that part-time employees are  given  the  basic

benefits  stipulated in the Employment Act.  The  Regulations

also  allow  the  encashment of statutory benefits,  such  as

annual  leave  and  public holiday pay. The Regulations  will

facilitate  the  introduction  of  part-time  and  flexi-work

arrangements. Employers are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>

encouraged  to  introduce such arrangements so  that  married

women   could   better  balance  their   work   with   family

responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of family-friendly practices is not a one-off affair. It is going to be a long-term effort requiring

the  support  of employers and unions and their members.   We

will  continue  to explore all avenues to facilitate  married

women's entry into the workforce.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the

Minister  whether  he would give further  assistance  through

part-time  employment schemes and whether his Ministry  would

facilitate  further the opportunity for women  to  work  from

home or tele-commute?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, we do

encourage  as many employers as possible to consider  tapping

the  pool of married women, the housewives, to supplement the

existing  workforce, and we encourage them to redesign  their

jobs  so that some of the jobs can be offered to women  on  a

part-time  basis.  Some companies are already taking  it  up,

particularly  those  in  the retail  sector,  the  department

stores.  I understand that some hospitals are offering  part-time employment opportunities to the nurses and I am sure the

Member  would have heard about the offer by the  Ministry  of

Education  of part-time teachers to work in the schools,  ie,

to teach on a part-time basis.  As I said earlier on, it is a

continuing effort.  As the labour market tightens up in  view

of  the  economic turnaround, we are expecting more employers

to have greater difficulties recruiting the workers that they

need.  So those who are more innovative will have to come out

with new recruitment offers to attract the inactive women  to

rejoin the workforce.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether his

Ministry  has new incentives, especially in areas  that  help

women  harmonise work and family, to help them  stay  in  the

workforce?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the biggest

incentive  to  an employer to go out and recruit economically

inactive  housewives  is  in fact  to  fill  up  his  vacancy

positions.   He gets the workers that he needs.  If  he  does

not  make that effort, he is going to be shorthanded.  He  is

not  going  to  be  able  to tap the opportunities  that  are

available.   Sir,  that will be the biggest incentive  to  an

employer.  But  of course, we understand that some  employers

have difficulties in re-engineering their jobs, for instance,

and  making  part-time arrangement for their  employees.   We

offer   through  the  Productivity  and  Standards  Board   a

programme called the Core Skills Training.  If an employer is

prepared to recruit a housewife for a particular job, we  are

prepared  to  help the employer provide the kind of  training

that  is  needed  for a housewife to re-enter the  workforce.

This   training   will  include  confidence  building,   work

effectiveness,  computer  basics, communication  and  quality

work  principles.  We will support the employer with a  grant

of  about  $350 per employee on the scheme which  includes  a

training  allowance  of $100 to be paid  to  the  trainee  to

defray out-of-pocket expenses during the period that the  new

employee  is undergoing training.  This is just  one  of  the

incentives  that we have to help economically inactive  women

re-enter the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also offered a job skill training programme for

employers who recruit housewives.  This will cover up to  80%

of the course fee for the specific job skill training that is

required to help a housewife acquire the skills that will  be

needed by the employer in this case.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> I was

told  that women in the high level jobs did not seem  to  get

promoted  in  their career, and this is one of  the  greatest

barriers  why women do not want to go back to work part-time.

And for those who have stayed part-time they feel demoralised

at work.  Would the Minister comment on this?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I think we are on very tricky ground,

Mr Speaker, Sir.  It is not fair

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>

to  generalise  that  women in the high level  jobs  are  not

promoted  just  on  the basis of gender.  There  are  equally

significant examples where women are in leading positions  in

many  organisations, both in the private and public  sectors.

So  it  is  not  fair  to comment on  that  basis.   But  the

situation  in  our labour market is that many women  tend  to

leave the workforce soon after they get married and started a

family.   So  on average, if you look at the profile  of  the

workforce, you would see that women in Singapore earn a lower

salary  than  men  and some have pointed to  that  as  gender

discrimination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what it really reflects is that women are

withdrawing  from  the workforce.  So the average  experience

level  of  women in the workforce is lower than  men  because

they  do  not work that many years.  If you average  out  the

wages earned by women and men, you will find that men have  a

higher earning because they have more years of experience  on

the  job.  So it is not fair to conclude that women have been

discriminated  against in this sense.  I would  say  that  we

should  not  generalise  on  this  basis.   There  are   many

opportunities for women in Singapore to excel and demonstrate

their capability to contribute to the company, and they  have

risen  in  their  ranks.   We  have  Japanese  multi-national

companies  being led by women, we have local  companies  like

the  promising local enterprises and GLCs being led by  women

and  we  also have Government departments with women in  very

senior positions.  We should look across the board instead of

generalising   and  saying  that  women  are  somehow   being

discriminated on the basis that they are women.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he would

agree  that  childcare leave and third child maternity  leave

are  good  incentives for women to balance between  work  and

family and to remain in the workforce?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> There is a lot of flexibility, in

terms  of  childcare leave.  Employers, particularly  in  the

unionised  sector, do consider granting additional  childcare

leave, especially in the case

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>

when  the  employee's child is sick, or for whatever  reason.

In  terms  of  maternity  leave, the law  provides  for  paid

maternity leave for the first two children.  Or in  the  case

of  the third child, instead of imposing a requirement on the

employer to provide paid maternity leave, the Government  has

provided  a  whole slew of tax benefits for  parents  of  the

third  child.  The tax benefits more than offset the loss  of

the   paid   maternity  leave.   So  this  is  a   preferable

arrangement rather than to mandate that employers  must  also

grant  paid maternity leave to all employees in the  case  of

the  third pregnancy.  Because by doing so, we will  actually

be   shifting  the  cost  of  paid  maternity  leave  to  the

employers.  As it stands today, encouraging families to  have

more   children   is   a  very  urgent  national   objective.

Therefore,  the  Government has taken the  approach  that  we

should do so by giving tax incentives rather than to pass the

burden  to the employers.  So if we want to encourage parents

to  have  more children, we should not, in doing  so,  impose

unnecessary  costs on the employers affecting their  business

competitiveness.   Where  it  is  possible,   for   instance,

promoting  and  encouraging a bigger family,  the  additional

costs can be borne by the Government by way of a special  tax

incentive.  And I understand that the Ministry of Finance and

IRAS have a whole slew of very attractive tax incentives  for

parents who want to have more than two children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister says that

it   is   unfair  to  say  that  married  women   have   been

discriminated.  Has his Ministry got any figures  to  support

his  statement that they have not been discriminated?  I have

called  for  a Board against discrimination more  than  once.

Will  the  Ministry set up a Board against discrimination  in

Singapore to inquire into any complaints?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, it is the usual response from

the Non-Constituency Member to set up a Board for this and to

set  up a Board for that.  Let me suggest to him that  if  he

has instances where he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>

believes that a woman has been discriminated on the basis  of

gender   or  marital  status,  let  us  know.   We   have   a

comprehensive  system  to assist workers  who  have  been  so

discriminated.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like to clarify the

point  that  I was not talking about wage discrimination.   I

think  the marketplace decides the differences and so far,  I

cannot see any evidence of clear discrimination, and that  it

has  been fair.  I am talking about promotion to the next job

rank.   And from some of the doctors that I speak to who  opt

to  do  part-time  services, they feel that  their  full-time

colleagues who started on the same level get promoted faster.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the Member making a speech?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like the Minister

to  suggest ways where the part-time schemes can be  seen  as

attractive and how we can go about doing that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, when an employer promotes an

employee,  it  must be on the basis of the contribution  that

the employee makes to the organisation.  I think it would  be

difficult  for us to dictate that part-time female  employees

should be promoted on the same basis as a full-time employee.

This  has  got  to be left in the hands of the  employer  who

would  judge  who  within the organisation can  best  make  a

difference  to the organisation's success and, in that  case,

promote the appropriate person.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether our

incentives are too restrictive if they are related to  income

tax because 70% of Singaporeans do not pay income tax?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, while it is true that 70% of

employees do not pay income tax, it is also equally important

that  for  those  who  want to have more children,  a  bigger

family, must be in a position to support and look after these

children.   The encouragement to have a bigger family  is  to

have  more  than two, if you can afford to look  after  them.

Therefore, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>

tax   measure   is  closely  related  to  this  approach   of

encouraging those who are in a better position to provide the

family  environment and support for more children to  do  so,

rather  than  to pass this cost of having bigger families  to

the employers and, therefore, loading them with a burden and,

in  a  way, even affecting their competitiveness and business

survival.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he will

agree that in view of the declining total fertility rates  in

Singapore,  we should review our stand and whether  he  could

reconsider changing some of the incentives?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, there is already an existing high-level committee led by the Permanent Secretary, Prime

Minister's Office, who is looking into new ways and means  of

encouraging procreation.  So we shall wait for the  committee

to consider various suggestions.

<div align="center"><b>(Shortage)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  his Ministry will look into the current shortage  of

unskilled  workers  in  the service and  retail  sectors  and

review  or  relax the policies governing the  issue  of  work

permit  for  businesses which depend on  foreign  workers  to

survive.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the service sector

has   been  allowed  to  recruit  foreign  workers  from  the

traditional sources, up to 30% of the total workforce.   Non-Traditional Source (NTS) workers are not allowed  in  general

with a few controlled exceptions.  This is because we have to

balance  employers' need for more workers with the impact  of

foreign  workers  from  low-wage countries  on  our  workers'

wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the manufacturing sector, where companies face

greater  foreign  competition, we allow  up  to  50%  foreign

workers.  For the construction sector, which has the greatest

difficulty to recruit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>

local  workers,  we have taken a more liberal  approach  that

allows up to 5 foreign workers for 1 local worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the allocation limits are sound and

provide  a  fair  balance  between  employers'  demands,  our

ability  to compete and the concerns of Singaporean  workers.

Hence,  we  will  not be generally relaxing our  work  permit

policy  on unskilled foreign workers for the service  sector.

But  we  will  continue  to welcome  and  facilitate  skilled

foreigners  coming  to work in Singapore  under  the  various

employment passes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at present, a person who commits killer

litter offences can be taken to task in the following ways:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Under the Penal Code, the Police can prosecute killer

litter  offenders. The penalty is a maximum 2-year jail  term

or fine or both, depending on the gravity of the offence;.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Under the Housing and Development Act, HDB has the

power to compulsorily acquire a sold flat when a flat lessee,

his  spouse or tenant or his authorised occupier is convicted

of  a killer litter offence.  HDB can also acquire a flat  if

the  flat lessee does not comply with HDB's lease conditions.

One  such  condition stipulates that the  lessee  "shall  not

place or allow to be placed anything or object in the flat or

the common areas or the building or any part thereof so as to

create, in HDB's opinion, an obstruction or a danger or  trap

to  HDB  officers, . lessees, occupiers or visitors . to  the

flats  in the building". Lessees whose flats are compulsorily

acquired

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>

by  HDB  will not be allowed to buy or rent another HDB  flat

for  five  years.   In  the case of  rental  flats,  HDB  can

terminate the tenancy agreement and recover vacant possession

of the flat;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The Housing and Development Act also empowers HDB to

direct  any owner, lessee or tenant of a HDB flat  to  remove

any  article  placed by any window, or on any balcony  of  or

outside  the  flat in a manner which is likely to  cause  any

damage  to property or injury to life.  Any person who  fails

to  comply  with  the Board's direction can be  fined  up  to

$2,000,  and  in  the  case  of  a  continuing  offence,   an

additional $100 per day;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) In addition, Town Councils have by-laws which

prohibit  residents from "throwing or allowing any object  or

article to fall from his flat or the balcony or "placing  any

. object . on any window sill, corridor or common property in

a  manner  likely to cause injury to person or  damage  to  .

property."  The maximum fine prescribed by the different Town

Councils ranges from $1,000 to $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of the opinion that the existing Housing and

Development  Act  is adequate in tackling the  killer  litter

problem.   However, there is scope for some Town Councils  to

amend  their by-laws to make them more effective  in  dealing

with  the  problem.  HDB will work with the Town Councils  in

doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to education and enforcement, I believe this is

a  problem that requires close and joint efforts of  HDB  and

the  Town Councils.  I understand that both HDB and the  Town

Councils  have  conducted inspections,  both  separately  and

jointly, to remove potential killer litter objects.  HDB will

continue  to  work closely with Town Councils and  carry  out

regular  inspections  of HDB flats for  killer  litter.   For

cases  under HDB's purview, HDB will not hesitate to exercise

its  power  under  the  Housing and Development  Act  against

recalcitrant  residents.  Likewise, Town Councils  will  take

enforcement action against households who infringe their  by-laws.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides enforcement, what is equally important is to

impress   upon   HDB  residents  that  they  have   a   civic

responsibility to others, especially when it comes  to  high-rise  living in Singapore.  In this regard, HDB has issued  a

press  statement  and sent out individual  circulars  to  its

800,000  HDB  households  reminding residents  not  to  throw

objects  from  their flats or place potential  killer  litter

objects   outside   their  flats.   The   various   community

organisations, such as HDB, Town Councils and the  grassroots

associations, should all work together and see  how  best  we

can  bring  this  message across to residents.    Ultimately,

everyone  has  a part to play in making HDB estates  a  safer

place to live in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his

answer  and  I  agree  that   it  is  ultimately  the   civic

responsibility  of  the tenants of these flats  who  have  to

understand the importance of this legislation. While I  agree

with  the Minister that most parts of the legislation are  in

place, there are certain anomalies that may not be clear.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can you please ask your question, Mr

Sinnakaruppan?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Yes, Sir. There is a seeming

inconsistency between the Housing and Development Act and the

Town  Councils Act because, as he pointed out, section  63(2)

says  that there is a maximum penalty of $2,000 and  it  also

says in the Town Councils Act ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, can you ask your

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> The Town Councils Act says that the

penalty  could be $5,000. The question is:  Who will  enforce

it?  Will both bodies enforce the same offence and could Town

Councils  enforce  it  up  to $5,000  when  the  Housing  and

Development Act only says that the maximum fine is $2,000?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I think this is not a question of

whether it is either HDB or the Town Council. It is important

for  both  the  HDB  and  the Town Council  to  look  at  the

situation and to see which is the best

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

way to  deal with the problem.  In so far as the specific penalty

involved  is  concerned, whether it is $2,000  or  $5,000  or

whether it is imposed by HDB or the Town Council, I think  it

is not the main point here. The point really is that there is

sufficient power within the Housing and Development  Act  and

the  Town  Councils' by-laws to impose a sufficient deterrent

to  potential  killer  litter offenders.   When  a  potential

killer  litter  offender  is  given  notice  to  remove   the

offending  pot or other object and he does not  comply,  then

both the Town Council and the HDB can take action against him

and  impose a fine. The Town Council can do so within its by-laws.  Some  Town  Councils do not have  sufficient  by-laws.

Different  Town Councils have different by-laws.  So  one  of

the  things I have asked HDB and Town Councils to  do  is  to

work  together to make sure that the by-laws have  sufficient

deterrence.  Where they do, then I think the Town Council can

and  should  take  action.  On top of that,  after  the  Town

Council has taken action, if it is necessary and the offender

continues to be recalcitrant, then HDB can also take action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, has the HDB re-vested any flat whose owner had committed the offence of

killer  litter? Can the Minister also tell this House whether

the  flat belonging to the owner whose flower pot had  fallen

and killed a girl recently has been forfeited?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, to answer the first question, since

the  amendment to the Housing and Development Act was enacted

in  1986, there has only been one instance where the  tenancy

agreement  has  been terminated. This was in the  case  of  a

rental  flat. There has been no instance so far where a  flat

has  been  compulsorily acquired where it has been  a  bought

flat.  In  so  far  as  the case that  he  has  mentioned  is

concerned,  the  matter is still under police investigations,

so I am not at liberty to comment on it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to

clarify with the Minister whether the killer litter provision

in the Housing and Development Act is against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>

littering,  which means throwing something out wilfully,  but

placing  a  flower pot on the ledge of the  common  area  and

thereby falling down may not be covered by the killer  litter

provision.  Is that correct?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think the Member may have

misunderstood  what I said earlier.  As  I  explained  in  my

answer,  apart from compulsory acquisition in the case  of  a

convicted killer litter offender, the Housing and Development

Act also empowers HDB to direct owners or occupiers to remove

any  object  which is placed in a manner which is  likely  to

cause  injury  or  damage to property. So,  the  Housing  and

Development Act does empower the HDB to act in that regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The penalty is different.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, the penalty is different. If the

offender  persists  in  committing  the  offence,  then   the

penalties  would be higher, and HDB will have  the  power  to

impose higher penalties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would like

to  urge  the Minister to seriously consider having clear-cut

laws.   At  the  moment, the way I see it,  there  is  a  gap

between   the   present  Penal  Code  and  the  Housing   and

Development  Act.  If it is like the case that  Dr  Wang  has

just  mentioned, it turned out to be an accident rather  than

an  intentional act to cause harm, then which  law  would  be

applicable?   The  Penal Code may not be applicable  and  the

Housing  and  Development Act may not have  a  strong  enough

deterrent.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the  HDB

could  consider  having clear-cut rules on how  a  tenant  is

allowed  to  hang their flower pots, so as  not  to  cause  a

danger  to  the people around.  At the moment, there  are  no

clear-cut  rules,  except to say that if a  flatdweller  puts

something  in a dangerous manner, then he can be punished  or

asked  to remove the object.  Maybe it is worthwhile for  the

HDB  and  town councils to come out with clear-cut  rules  on

this matter.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member making a speech?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister whether he would consider having clear-cut  laws  on

this  matter  and  also ask the HDB to make  it  a  clear-cut

issue, ie, anybody having flower pots and objects outside the

flat  as well as putting flower pots on ledges are committing

an offence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I would like to refer the Member

again  to that particular part of the Housing and Development

Act  which  I read out just now in response to Dr  Wang.   It

says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Housing and Development Act empowers HDB to direct

any  owner, lessee or tenant of a flat to remove any  article

placed by any window or on any balcony of or outside the flat

in  a  manner which is likely to cause any damage to property

or injury to life.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, it is a very wide definition. What is it

that constitutes a danger to property or injury to life,  and

in  what  manner is it to be put before it so  constitutes  a

danger?  It is worded very widely.  At the end of the day,  I

do  not think it is possible for any legislation to spell out

specifically the ways in which such objects, whether they are

flower pots, bicycles, etc, should be placed.  And if you  do

it  in this manner, you are committing an offence.  If you do

it  in another manner, you are not committing an offence.   I

think there are myriads of objects which residents are likely

to  place  in HDB flats which may cause injury to  residents.

Ultimately, it is all a matter of common sense.  If you  feel

that  putting a flower pot on the ledge is safe, then I think

something must be wrong somewhere.  It does not take a  piece

of  legislation in an Act to tell you that it  is  likely  to

fall,  be  knocked over, be blown over and to  cause  serious

injury to somebody walking downstairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not see the need for us to spell it out from A

to  Z  before residents would take notice.  First of all,  we

have  to educate the residents.  We have to make it clear  to

residents  that  high-rise living requires a certain  amount,

not  only of civic consciousness, but also of responsibility.

When you are living 10-20 storeys up,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>

anything   that   falls  from  your  flat,   consciously   or

unconsciously,  is going to cause a lot of damage.   That  is

the first thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as do's and don't's are concerned, this is

something the HDB and the town councils will be following up.

It  is  through the town councils, notice boards, newsletters

and  so  on,  that we can educate residents on the  do's  and

don't's.    But   this  cannot  be  comprehensive   and   all

encompassing.  There will be somebody somewhere who will come

up  with something else.  Does it mean that because it is not

in  the  Act,  therefore, he is able to  get  away  with  it?

Surely  not.   So, I would recommend an approach  which  says

that, first of all, we make it an offence to either throw  or

to  cause  objects to fall from flats, and to give power  and

authority  to  the  town councils and  the  HDB  officers  to

require  flat  owners  to remove such  potentially  dangerous

objects,  if  they are spotted.  And if they  do  not  remove

them,  to  be  able to fine them.  And if they still  do  not

remove them, to be able to take even sterner action.  I think

those pieces of legislation are already in the books.  Beyond

that,  it is a matter of education.  It is a matter of  civic

consciousness.  I think both legislation and enforcement  are

important, but education is also important.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, what has the HDB

done  or how has it assisted the town councils on the problem

of  potential killer litter before the incident  in  which  a

young  girl was killed by a killer litter?  Second,  what  is

the  role of the HDB, in managing the estates, on this killer

litter problem?  I thought town councils are responsible  for

taking  enforcement action on killer litter offenders.   From

the  Minister's  answer, it seems to me that the  HDB  should

also  be  responsible.  What is the role the HDB  would  play

under the circumstances in such a situation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the town councils' responsibility

is  enforcement of offences in the common areas.   There  are

also  offences  which  take place  within  a  flat,  eg,  the

balcony.   The  balcony is not considered as a  common  area.

But if somebody

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>

places  a  pot on the parapet wall of the balcony, then  what

happens?   Strictly  speaking, the town council  cannot  act.

However, as I have explained to Members of this House,  there

are  provisions  in  the Housing and  Development  Act  which

allow  the HDB, if they spot it, to actually take action  and

to  require them to remove it.  And if they do not remove it,

then HDB can take further action.  I see the HDB and the town

councils playing complementary roles.  It is not a matter  of

the  town  councils alone.  The HDB should not  and  has  not

abdicated  its responsibility and say that this is  the  town

councils'  responsibility because the  offence  has  happened

within  the common property.  Neither should it just  be  the

HDB's  responsibility.  If the town councils  say,  "Oh,  the

offence is committed within the flat and therefore it is  the

HDB's responsibility alone", I also do not think that that is

adequate.   So there is joint responsibility, as far  as  HDB

and  town councils are concerned, not just in so far as where

the  offence  took place, but also in making  sure  that  the

general  well-being,  safety, security  of  HDB  estates  are

preserved.  I do not see a demarcation of responsibility  and

neither do I think it is a fruitful exercise to point fingers

at  one another and say, "This is your responsibility.   This

is  not  mine."  So I would urge both the HDB  and  all  town

councils  to  work  together to make sure  that  our  estates

remain safe for our residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister has not answered my

question on what has HDB done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am sorry. I forgot to answer his

first point.  The Act has been in place since 1986.  And from

time  to  time,  I know that town councils do, through  their

various publicity channels, educate residents on what  to  do

and  what  not  to do, as far as killer litter is  concerned.

There  are  many other aspects of high-rise living which  are

also  important, but the problem of killer litter is probably

one  of the more serious ones.  And I know that town councils

do  make  it  a point, and HDB has also gone around,  through

their  inspections,  to make sure that the  potential  killer

litter  does  not  happen.  But I  do  not  think  both  town

councils and HDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>

have the manpower or the resources to actually go around  and

patrol 24 hours a day every single flat in every single town.

So  they  do  spot checks and when they spot check  and  find

something wrong, they take action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 years, I must say that the number of

killer  litter  offenders has come down quite  significantly.

And  the number of killer litter offenders the HDB has  taken

to  task has also come down significantly.  But I think  that

is  small  comfort  because it does  not  require  many  such

offenders to cause a tragic accident, as we saw in  the  case

of the Kent Road incident.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  killer litter has caused a concern  to  about

three  million  people living in HDB flats.   Most  residents

have  complied with the orders given by the town councils  or

the  HDB.  But there is still a minority of flat dwellers who

place flower pots outside their windows.  Should we have more

specific instructions on whether the HDB or the town councils

should  take  up enforcement orders so that all these  flower

pots  would  be removed immediately to avoid such unfortunate

incidents from happening again?  I think we should not  leave

the matter to be enforced either by the town councils or HDB.

Otherwise, nobody would be doing it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I reiterated just now, this is,

in  my opinion, best dealt with both by the town councils  as

well  as by HDB.  I do not think that it is a matter of  just

one  or the other.  In so far as removing the flower pots  is

concerned,  HDB  and town councils have carried  out  several

inspections, especially over the last couple of weeks.   They

have  discovered that there are quite a few cases where there

is  potential  killer litter and they have  taken  action  to

remove  them.  And I am told that most, if not all, of  those

flower pots and other objects have been removed.  So I  think

the  situation, as it stands at the moment, is that both  HDB

and the town councils are working together on this problem.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to seek a

clarification  from  the  Minister.   Is  it  all  right  for

residents to place objects in common areas such as the common

corridor, as long as they are not likely to cause damage?  Is

it  all  right  to  place various objects  along  the  common

corridor?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is impossible for me to say

yes,  it  is  all  right or it is not all right.   There  are

hundreds of situations where such objects are placed  in  the

common  corridors.  As Members know, if they have gone  round

on  house-to-house  visits, there are people  who  put  their

clothes to dry in the common corridors.  They put their shoes

and  unused  furniture  in the common corridors.   One  could

argue that somebody could then take the unused furniture  and

throw  it  or  heave  it  over  the  side  and  therefore  it

constitutes killer litter.  I think the point is that at  the

end of the day, all the town councillors and HDB officers who

go  around, they look around, they check, they inspect,  they

make  use  of  their judgment and where it does constitute  a

potential  killer litter offence, they will ask the  relevant

household to remove that object.  But if the Member  asks  me

to make a categorical statement to say, "Yes, it is all right

or  no,  it is not all right", I am afraid he would  not  get

that answer from me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, so far, we have

been  talking  about  HDB and town council  regulations.   My

question  is: do we have equivalent killer litter regulations

for private apartments and condominiums?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, if an accident were to happen in a

private apartment, I think the Police would know what to do.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. End of Question time.

<div align="center"><b>ENTREPRENEURIAL EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my Budget

Statement on 25th February this year, I said that a scheme to

enhance  the  tax  treatment of ESOP for high-tech  start-ups

would  be announced by the end of May.  Today, I am happy  to

announce  the  new  "Entrepreneurial  Employee  Stock  Option

Scheme".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee stock options or ESOP play a key role in a

vibrant entrepreneurial environment.  Many fast-growing high-tech  start-up  companies attract talent,  not  through  high

salaries,  but  by offering stock options to  employees.   An

attractive tax treatment of ESOP will therefore give a strong

boost  to  entrepreneurship  and risk-taking.   Moreover,  as

talent is internationally mobile and is increasingly rewarded

by means of stock options, especially in the high-tech start-ups,  we  must  ensure  that our tax  treatment  of  ESOP  is

internationally attractive, to give us a competitive edge.

<br><br><i>Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new scheme aims to foster an entrepreneurial spirit

in the smaller high-risk companies and its employees, many of

whom  have  to  forgo more secure and higher paying  jobs  to

start or join these start-up companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme,

a  50%  income tax exemption will be granted on gains arising

from the exercising of ESOP.  The 50% tax exemption would  be

granted to up to $10 million of gains, over a 10-year period.

To illustrate, if an employee exercises his stock options and

makes a gain of $1 million, 50% or $500,000 of the gains will

be  exempt from tax.  Over the next 9 years, he can enjoy 50%

tax exemption on a further $9 million gains from ESOP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies with gross assets of up to $100 million at the

time the ESOP are granted will be able to benefit from this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>

scheme.   Based on the existing top marginal personal  income

tax  rate of 28%, an employee can enjoy tax savings on  gains

from ESOP of up to $1.4 million.  Coupled with the absence of

capital  gains  tax in our regime and our  low  personal  tax

rates,  our  tax  treatment of stock  options  will  be  very

attractive compared to most other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme has been structured with minimum

restrictions, so as to give companies the maximum flexibility

to  implement  their  ESOP  plans  to  suit  their  different

business needs.  I will now go through some of the details of

the scheme.

<br><br><i>Qualifying Companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of restricting the scheme to companies in

specific  high-tech sectors, which is difficult to define,  I

have  decided that for a start, this scheme will be available

to  companies from all sectors.  Companies, whether listed or

unlisted,  with gross assets of not more than  $100  million,

will  be able to qualify for the scheme.  In addition,  these

companies also have to be incorporated in Singapore and carry

out business activities in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Qualifying Employees</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme is targetted at those employees who devote a

significant  portion of their working time  to  the  company.

Therefore,  to qualify, the employee must work  at  least  30

hours  per week for the company.  An employee who works  less

than 30 hours for a company can also qualify if he spends  at

least  75%  of  his  total working time per  week  with  that

company.   A  non-executive director will  not  qualify.   In

addition, the employee should not control 25% or more of  the

voting rights of the company.

<br><br><i>Effective Date and Timeframe for Review</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced tax treatment will apply to ESOP issued on

or  after  1st June 2000.  The scheme will operate  for  five

years,  after which the Government will review the scheme  to

evaluate whether the objectives of the scheme have been  met.

Mean-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>

while,  during these 5 years, we will continue  to  fine-tune

the scheme as and when modifications are warranted.

<br><br><i>Further Details</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the scheme, including vesting period

requirements  and  treatment of discounted options,  will  be

released by IRAS by 1st June 2000.  They will be available on

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option

scheme,  Singapore is sending a clear signal of  its  support

for  enterprise and wealth creation, and strong encouragement

to  those entrepreneurs and employees who are willing to take

risks.   The use of ESOP is of course also relevant  for  the

larger   and  more  established  companies  and   should   be

encouraged.   But  the degree of incentive will  be  less  as

established companies have less problems with attracting  and

retaining  staff.   My  Ministry will be  reviewing  the  tax

treatment  of  ESOP for these larger companies.   I  will  be

announcing the scheme for the established companies  in  next

year's Budget Statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my GPC for Finance

and  Trade  and  Industry would definitely welcome  this  new

Entrepreneurial   ESOP scheme, because we think  it  is  very

generous and would be very effective in promoting the use  of

ESOP in companies in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister three questions.

First,  on the rule that qualifying companies must be,  first

of  all,  incorporated in Singapore.  Should we not  consider

the  case  of  other companies which are not incorporated  in

Singapore  but have significant businesses in Singapore,  and

their  employees therefore should be allowed  to  enjoy  this

benefit?  My other members of GPC will probably elaborate  on

this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on qualifying employees: Why

should there be a limiting percentage of 75% of the time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>

spent  in the company?  There may well be individuals who  do

not  spend  their  time in one company but in  several  other

companies.   Perhaps  a lower qualifying  percentage  of  51%

might be more reasonable for such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point to ask the Minister is: Why is it not

eligible  for  non-executive directors?  These  non-executive

directors may also contribute to a company and therefore they

should be able to enjoy this scheme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first

question,  at present, the intention is to require  companies

to  be  registered in Singapore to qualify  for  the  scheme,

because  the  objective of the scheme  is  to  encourage  the

setting  up  of such high-tech entrepreneurship companies  in

Singapore.  Whilst I recognise that some companies  may  have

their  registration  elsewhere  and  conduct  part  of  their

operations  here, our preference is for them to be registered

here.  In any case, whether they are registered here or  not,

they  have  to  conduct  a significant  proportion  of  their

operations  here.  For the time being, we want to retain  the

requirement that they should be registered here in the  first

instance.   If  there are specific cases  where  a  high-tech

company  can  demonstrate that their presence here,  although

non-registered, can contribute significantly  to  value-added

in Singapore, we may look at it on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the time spent criterion, this is intended to ensure

that  the  employees  spend  a significant  amount  of  their

private  time  with the company.  The whole  purpose  of  the

exercise  is to allow the company to attract these people  to

help  in the start-up process.  If he dilutes his time  among

several  companies, I do not think that will be very fair  to

the start-up company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of non-executive directors, the reason

for  excluding  them is that being non-executive,  they  will

clearly  be unable to spend sufficient time to qualify  under

the time constraint.  Therefore, they should be excluded.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two

questions for the Minister.  Will the scheme, as announced by

the  Minster,  be  applicable to existing ESOPs?   If  it  is

applicable,  can a company then restructure  their  ESOPs  to

take advantage of the present scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question is: How attractive this scheme will be

is relative.  It is relative to established markets, like the

US,  UK or Hong Kong.  In other words, on this tax treatment,

how do they compare to these established markets?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On the first question of whether

it  is  applicable to existing ESOPs, no, it  does  not.   It

applies to companies which issue employee stock options after

1st  June.   Those who have existing stock options  will  not

qualify for this special incentive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, I think our scheme is very

attractive  compared  to  practically  all  other   incentive

schemes,  partly because our basic taxes are low already  and

we  are giving a 50% reduction of that.  As the top level  of

personal  tax is 28%, qualifying stock option gains  will  be

taxed  at  14%,  which  is even lower  than  Hong  Kong,  and

certainly  a lot more attractive than the United States,  for

example,  where  the  top level tax is approaching  40%;  and

similarly  for most countries in Europe.  So I think  we  are

quite  comfortable  that  the  scheme  itself  will  be  very

attractive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I

would  like to thank the Minister for announcing the  scheme,

and   I   think   that  this  will  really   encourage   many

entrepreneurs  to  have an alternative form of  compensation,

instead of a higher salary, maybe a lower salary and a higher

incentive  in stock option.  This will help companies  to  at

least improve their chances of success by lowering their cash

flow.   I have studied various stock option schemes and share

ownership  schemes in many countries and  I  think  that  the

implementation of this scheme will probably be  the  best  in

the world.  I have a few questions for the Minister.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, will employee share ownership at inception

of  companies,  that means these are not stock  options,  but

equity  in return for expertise that you bring to the  table,

be tax exempt in the first place?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question is: Will this scheme apply to companies

that  have  already gone public but have yet less  than  $100

million   worth  of  assets?   On  the  point  of   Singapore

incorporation, I support Mr Leong's point that more and  more

of  our businesses are becoming very international, and while

we  may  have  the  intention of wanting to  operate  out  of

Singapore,  the  real value sometimes will  be  generated  in

countries  outside  Singapore, for example,  in  the  US  and

Europe.   Therefore, I hope that the Minister can be flexible

on this requirement of local incorporation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is the definition of "working hours".

In  the Internet economy, we talk about 24-by-7, which  means

that 24 hours in a day are considered working hours.  So,  is

there  a  definition that the Minister will  place  on  these

working hours?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, are there any restrictions as to what ownership

the  employee  can have in a company, whether there  are  any

conditions  on employee ownership of companies,  which  means

that an employee can own a substantial portion of the company

in  the  beginning  and yet enjoy 50% exemption  in  the  new

scheme?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Non-registration in Singapore,

as  I have explained earlier, is a requirement to ensure that

the benefits of this ESOP scheme will accrue to Singapore  as

a whole.  Members have said that there are companies who want

to  be  registered  elsewhere  but  continue  to  operate  in

Singapore and I did mention that it will be considered  on  a

case-by-case basis.  If they can demonstrate that the bulk of

their  activities is in Singapore, even though they  are  not

registered here, we might consider looking at it.   But  they

have  to be very sure that they are physically operating from

here, there are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>

people  employed here, adding significant value  before  they

qualify,  otherwise  the whole purpose  of  the  exercise  is

defeated,  if they register outside Singapore and  they  just

come here to take advantage of the ESOP scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On working hours, I know it is difficult to define,

particularly on the Internet or the info-technology  type  of

activity,  but our guidelines are flexible to an extent.   We

will see how this present 30 hours plus 75% work in practice.

If  need  be,  if  companies find that these are  awkward  or

impractical,  we  are quite prepared, as I said  earlier,  to

amend them as we go along during the five-year period of this

exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of whether someone who owns shares

originally  in the company would qualify under  this  scheme,

the  Member  is probably referring to founder shares,  ie,  a

group  of people get together to start up a new company,  and

these people then hold shares in the company in various ways.

Their  contributions could be through money or ideas, and  so

forth.   But  these are founder shares.  If at  a  subsequent

date  they  resell the founder shares at whatever value,  the

gains  would  be capital gains and therefore not  subject  to

tax.   So  gains from sale of founder shares are  not  taxed.

But they do not fall under the ESOP scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the issue of ownership of company. We did say

that  they  should  not own more than 25%.  Effectively,  25%

means  effective control of the company and we  do  not  wish

somebody  who  controls the company to  be  offering  himself

preferentially  large  amounts  of  share  options.   So  the

requirement  is that he should not control more than  25%  of

the shares of the company.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> My next question was: does this

apply  to  a company that has already gone public?  Will  the

stock option then also be tax exempt?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I did say that for those who

have  stock options which have already been issued, they will

not qualify.  It has got to be new shares.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> I was referring to companies with

less  than $100 million worth of assets that have gone public

and  they  still  issue a stock option after they  have  gone

public.  Will those qualify for tax exempt?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Those would qualify.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I welcome the

Minister's  announcement that the scheme will be  applied  to

all sectors without constraints.  But I would like to explore

further with the Minister why the limit to companies  if  its

assets  are less than $100 million.  In the market, there  is

already a migration of talent from the old economy as it were

to  the new economy and typically, new economy companies tend

to  fit this less than $100 million gross asset test and  the

old  economy may be less so.  I am not just talking about the

large companies, but even some of the medium size companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that any differential tax treatment

for   ESOP  of  these  two  categories  will  exacerbate  the

migration  and  make  it  even harder  for  the  old  economy

companies  to retain talent.  So the question I  really  have

for  the Minister is: why can the scheme not be open  to  all

companies  in the first instance or, if not, at least  if  he

could  share with us why or how this $100 million figure  was

arrived at?  What is the thinking behind it and how soon  can

that  be  reviewed?  Does it have to wait for the  full  five

years?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> There is no magic formula to the

$100  million  figure.   No one really knows  the  borderline

accurately  as  to  which company should qualify.   It  is  a

figure we think is sufficiently large to include a lot of the

new  technology companies which we are trying to incentivise.

We  could bring the capital amount down so that some  of  the

start-ups which require less capital would be captured.   But

we  have to draw the line somewhere and $100 million is based

on  our  discussions with MTI who have a feel of the type  of

companies they want to incentivise.  So it is an experimental

level which we will be prepared to reconsider

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>

from working experience over the next five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is whether the scheme should not be

extended to the established companies.  I did mention earlier

that  we  are looking at whether we should have some form  of

ESOP  scheme  for  these  companies too,  but  not  quite  so

attractive as the 50% tax rebate.  Established companies need

quite a lot of talent, but because they are established, they

are  better able to attract qualified staff because they  can

afford  to do so.  It is the new companies which are starting

up  and  without a track record who will have  difficulty  in

getting  high  quality staff to join them, and usually,  they

can only attract them to do so by offering share options.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Can the Minister

explain  the  rationale of imposing this time restriction  on

someone  who  qualifies for the stock option?  The  time  and

contribution are two different things.  A person may work  50

hours  a week but his contribution is not as much as one  who

spends 10 hours.  For the same reason, why is it not extended

to  non-executive  directors because their  contribution  may

sometimes  be more critical than an employee who spends  full

time in the company?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Time qualification is necessary

in  order to ensure that the employee who is incentivised  to

join  spends a significant part of his working life with  the

company.   Whether  the figure we have  used  is  the  proper

criterion,  I am not going to argue, because it is,  to  some

extent, arbitrary.  But I cannot measure whether a person who

is  spending one hour contributes more than somebody  who  is

spending two hours.  This is again a very subjective  matter.

But we have to establish some criteria, in terms of time,  in

order  to ensure that a person, who joins a company to  enjoy

this  incentive, devotes a significant amount of his  working

time  to the company.  If you get a person who may be utterly

brilliant  and spends one hour, but joins 10 or 20 companies,

I  am  not sure that this is the group of people we  want  to

incentivise.  It would be very difficult to quantify anyway.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On non-executive directors, I have explained earlier

that  a  non-executive director is one who from time to  time

contributes but not on a full-time basis, and therefore would

not qualify under the time constraints we have imposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Should the decision then not

be  left to the company to decide whether that person  should

be entitled to have this share option in that case?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We cannot allow that, because it

is  the  Government who is giving the tax incentive, not  the

company.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I would like to

ask  how  do you treat somebody who is an executive initially

at  the  time  the  scheme  is introduced,  but  subsequently

becomes  non-executive.   Does  he  still  qualify  after  he

becomes non-executive?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The title of "non-executive

director", I am not sure really means very much.  Really, the

criteria  should be: what are you doing in the  company,  are

you  one of the pioneers who are the founder shareholders and

therefore  enjoy  certain privileges or are  you  the  people

recruited at the early stages and gain stock options in  lieu

of  salary to start up the company?  A non-executive director

simply does not fit into this mould.

<div align="center"><b>POLITICAL DONATIONS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.53 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Political Donations Bill seeks to prohibit donations

to  political parties, political associations, and candidates

in   parliamentary  election  or  presidential  elections  by

persons  and bodies who are not permissible donors.  It  also

requires  political parties, associations and  candidates  to

report large donations that they have received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is an independent and

sovereign  country.   Foreigners should  not  be  allowed  to

interfere in our domestic politics.  It is no more legitimate

for   foreigners  to  pay  money  to  support   a   political

association  or  candidate than it is for them  to  have  the

right to support the associations' cause, or to vote for  the

candidate.   Any  Singaporean  or  organisation  that  allows

himself  or  itself  to  be  used  by  foreign  elements,  or

collaborates  or  colludes  with them  to  interfere  in  our

internal  affairs, is subverting the independence,  integrity

and  sovereignty of the country.  We must not allow  this  to

happen.   Politics  in Singapore should be  for  Singaporeans

only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Singapore is not immune to foreign interference. We

have  had to deal with interference in our domestic politics.

In 1959, a Government Commission of Inquiry revealed that two

sums  of  money totalling $700,000 were transferred from  New

York to Mr Chew Swee Kee, then

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>

Education Minister from the Singapore People's Alliance,  the

ruling party led by Mr Lim Yew Hock, then Chief Minister.   I

think  many  young Singaporeans do not even know about  this.

The  Inquiry revealed that the money was meant as a political

gift  to  the Labour Front (and I quote the report) "for  the

purposes   of   fighting  subversion  in  the   colony"   and

"strengthening" the Labour Front "as an effective  party  and

bulwark  against  communism."  Then in 1976,  the  Secretary-General  of  the People's Front, Mr Leong Mun  Kwai,  who  is

still  around  today, revealed during Police's investigations

on  the misappropriation of the People's Front's funds,  that

he  was  given  financial assistance and made  use  of  by  a

neighbouring  intelligence service  in  a  "black  operation"

against  the interests of Singapore.  A more recent case  was

in  1988,  when  a  US  diplomat  interfered  in  Singapore's

domestic  politics.   The  diplomat  actively  cultivated  Mr

Francis  Seow.  Mr Francis Seow was advised by  the  diplomat

how  to  establish a more effective opposition in  Parliament

and   to   set   about  seriously  to  recruit   more   young

professionals   into   the   opposition.    This   is   gross

interference in Singapore's domestic politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not condone such activities. Currently, we

have no law prohibiting foreign funding of political parties,

political  associations and candidates  of  parliamentary  or

presidential elections.  This Bill seeks to put  in  place  a

legislative framework to prohibit such foreign funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is not the first country to introduce

such legislation.  Many countries, such as the United States,

Canada,  India,  France, Japan, Germany,  already  have  laws

either prohibiting or regulating foreign political donations.

Hong Kong and Taiwan also have similar laws.  In South Korea,

under  their  Political  Fund  Act,  foreigners  and  foreign

corporations,  except foreign corporations and  organisations

under the control of nationals of the Republic of Korea,  are

not allowed to contribute political funds to any party.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>

The  UK  also  has recently introduced a "Political  Parties,

Elections  and Referendums Bill", which amongst others,  aims

to  regulate political donations.  It is therefore timely for

Singapore to introduce controls against foreign funding.   We

have  studied  the  various examples in other  countries  and

generally adapted the UK Bill to suit our local context.

<br><br><i>Overview</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now give an overview of what our Political

Donations  Bill  would  cover, before highlighting  the  main

clauses of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill aims to prohibit political parties, political

associations  and  candidates from accepting  donations  from

foreign   sources   by  treating  these   as   impermissible.

Political parties, political associations and candidates  are

allowed  to  accept  donations, so long as  these  come  from

permissible sources.  Similar to the approach taken in the UK

Bill, we have chosen to define who is a permissible source or

who the permissible donors are because it is easier to define

who  is  permissible  rather than who is impermissible.   Any

donations  other  than  those from  the  defined  permissible

sources   would   constitute  impermissible  donations.    If

political  parties,  associations or candidates  receive  any

donations  from  impermissible sources, they  would  have  to

return the donation to the donor.  If they are unable  to  do

so,  they  would  have  to  surrender  the  donation  to  the

Government's  Consolidated  Fund.   Political   parties   and

associations and candidates would also be required to  report

large  donations, to ensure that they keep proper records  of

these donations.

<br><br><i>Who does the prohibition cover?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three groups of people who will be covered by

the   prohibition  against  foreign  funding.   Firstly,  all

political  parties, such as the People's  Action  Party,  the

Singapore  People's  Party,  the Workers'  Party,  and  other

political  parties registered with the Registry of  Societies

will  be covered by the definition of "political association"

in clause 2 of the Bill.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>

would not be allowed to accept foreign donations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, candidates of any parliamentary or

presidential elections and their election agents  would  also

be  covered by the prohibition.  The prohibition would  apply

to  both  candidates fielded by political parties as well  as

independent  candidates.   The  prohibition  against  foreign

funding   applies   whether  or  not   the   candidates   are

successfully returned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear why registered political parties and

candidates  should  be  covered by  the  prohibition  -  they

contest  in  elections,  and if elected,  can  influence  the

policies and political process in Parliament.  They can  even

form  the government if they have the majority in Parliament.

The  election  agent  is responsible for all  campaign  funds

(under the Parliamentary and Presidential Elections Acts)  of

the  candidate.   It is therefore logical that  the  election

agent   is  also  covered  by  the  prohibition  on   foreign

donations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group covers any organisation, regardless of

whether  the  organisation  is registered  as  a  society,  a

business  or a company, so long as its objects relate  wholly

or  mainly to politics in Singapore, and it is gazetted as  a

political  association under the Bill.   To  leave  out  such

organisations  from  the Bill would present  a  loophole  for

foreign  interests  to  interfere in our  domestic  politics.

Although the organisation's activities or objects may not  be

directed   at   procuring  a  candidate  for  election   into

Parliament  or as President, it can accept foreign donations,

promote  a  particular political platform and  influence  the

political process, but in the interest of its foreign  donor.

This  should not be allowed.  The Straits Times, in a  recent

article  on  13th  May,  "Regulating the  flow  of  money  in

politics" highlighted an example where a political party in a

foreign country is under investigation for allegedly "setting

up    non-profit   organisations   that   channelled    large

contributions from foreign donors".  Also, in Business Times,

on  10th  May,  and  in fact, in today's  Straits  Times,  in

reports  focusing on the political donations laws in  the  US

and other countries,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>

highlighted  the controversy on the use of "soft  money"  for

purposes  like "party-building" and "discussion  of  national

policy issues", which are not directly for election purposes.

Indeed,  to confine politics to just contesting in  elections

and   electioneering   for   candidates   would   leave   out

organisations  who accept or make use of money  from  foreign

sources  to seek to change our laws or policies, or decisions

of  the  Government.  We have little control over  activities

and spending by organisations unconnected with candidates  or

parties during an election.  Foreign groups can, through such

unconnected organisations, influence local politics.  Surely,

this  cannot be allowed.  Such organisations should therefore

be   subject  to  the  prohibition  from  accepting   foreign

donations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression "relates wholly or mainly to politics in

Singapore" in the Bill is not new.  This is adapted from  our

Films Act.  Further, a similar expression - "wholly or mainly

of  a  political nature", can be found in the UK Broadcasting

Act  1990, and has already been subject to interpretation  by

the  UK  Courts. As regards political activity, we  would  be

taking into account whether:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the activity is intended or would likely to affect

voting  in  any election or national referendum in Singapore;

or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the activity is, for example:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) an election or a national referendum in Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a candidate or group of candidates in election;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) an issue submitted or otherwise before electors in

an election or national referendum in Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the government or a previous government or the

opposition to a Member of Parliament;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the current policy of the Government or an issue of

public controversy in Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) or a political party in Singapore or any body whose

objects relate wholly or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>

mainly  to politics in Singapore, or any such branch of  such

party or body.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To define "politics" and "relate wholly or mainly to

politics"   as  referring  to  "elections  or  electioneering

activities" only as proposed by some civil society groups  is

therefore  too  narrow.  All we need to do  is  to  read  the

Washington Post article as reported in the Straits  Times  of

18th  May  this year and in it, there are details on  certain

groups, although they claim that they are not electioneering,

not campaigning for political party or activity or candidate,

who  are actually influencing the cause of the activities  of

the candidates or parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure transparency, the Bill empowers the Minister

to  gazette  such an organisation as a political  association

for  the  purpose  of  the new law  and  be  subject  to  the

prohibition  against  foreign  funding.   Such  an   approach

ensures that organisations would be fully aware that, if they

are  gazetted as a political association, they are prohibited

from accepting donations from impermissible sources.  If they

are  not  gazetted, then they are not required to follow  the

requirements of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding whether to gazette any organisation as a

political  association, the Minister would have  to  consider

carefully  all  relevant factors, such  as  its  objects  and

activities,  its  links with foreign organisations,  and  the

support it receives from such foreign organisations.

<br><br><i>Permissible donors</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 8 and 14 of the Bill, political

associations  and  candidates  are  only  allowed  to  accept

donations from permissible sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Singapore citizens, who are at least 21 years old,

and   all   Singapore-controlled  companies,  are  considered

permissible donors.  A Singapore-controlled company refers to

a company registered with the Registrar of Companies, and the

majority  of  its  directors and members are  citizens.   All

other sources would be considered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>

foreign in nature and deemed impermissible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Singaporeans, who have attained the age of

maturity  of  21  years old and above, should be  permissible

donors.   Singapore companies are allowed to  make  political

donations,  as  they are our corporate citizens,  and  should

have  an  interest  in Singapore's well  being.   After  all,

political stability is a key fundamental for economic growth,

and provides the environment for businesses to flourish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unincorporated organisations are not permissible donors.

Political associations and candidates therefore cannot accept

donations    from    these   organisations.    Unincorporated

associations  include  trade  unions,  societies,  charities,

mutual benefit organisations, businesses, professional  firms

and  so  on.   Trade  unions,  societies,  charities,  mutual

benefit  organisations are set up for specific purposes.   As

it  is now, most if not all of these associations are already

prohibited  from  making  political  donations  under   their

respective   Acts   or  constitutions.    Sole   proprietors,

partnerships  and professional firms have no  separate  legal

identities  from their owners.  That is to say,  the  profits

and  losses of the business are the profits and losses of the

individual  owners.  Hence, if they wish to  make  donations,

they  should  do  so  as individuals, as  long  as  they  are

Singaporeans and are 21 years old and above.

<br><br><i>Anonymous donations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill allows a political association to accept

anonymous  donations of less than $5,000 in any one financial

year of the association.  Candidates can also accept up to  a

similar amount of anonymous donations during the period of 12

months  prior to his declaration made before nomination  day.

This  is to take into account that some well-wishers may wish

to   remain   anonymous  in  making  donations  to  political

associations  or  candidates.  We have  chosen  a  reasonable

limit  of  $5,000 to strike a balance between allowing  well-wishers to make small anonymous donations and not opening  up

a loophole for significant foreign

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>

donations to slip through as anonymous donations.

<br><br><i>What is a donation?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill deal with the definition

of  donations  and  how  the  donations  are  valued.   These

provisions  are  adapted  from  the  UK  Political   Parties,

Elections  and  Referendums  Bill.   Donations  are   defined

broadly  to include all goods or services, such as any  gifts

of  money  or  property, subscription and  affiliation  fees,

loans,  property, services and other facilities  provided  to

the  candidate  or  political association  that  are  not  on

commercial terms.  For example, if the goods or services  are

rendered  to a political association at less than  commercial

rates,  the  value  of the donation would be  the  difference

between the actual cost to the association and the cost which

the  association would have incurred if it had been  provided

on commercial terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations would not include any notional benefits of

airtime  during  lawful party political  broadcasts,  or  any

postage-free elections communications authorized  by  written

law.   These  benefits  are granted by  or  pursuant  to  our

written laws, and would not be considered as donations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the UK Bill, donations would also not include any

voluntary services by an individual.  It is neither practical

nor  feasible  to  put  a value to voluntary  services.   For

example,  if  an  individual contributes, in  his  own  time,

professional  services within his own  sphere  of  expertise,

such  as  accounting  expertise, to a political  party,  this

service  would not be regarded as a donation.   He  could  be

self-employed,  or he could take leave from his  employer  to

provide  his service to the political party.  As long  as  he

volunteers  his  services in his own time, it  would  not  be

regarded as a donation.  However, if the individual  is  paid

by  his  employer  while providing services  to  a  political

party, the services would count as a donation by the employer

to  the  political party.  The value of the donation  is  the

commercial rate of providing the services.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>What  should  a  political  party  or  a  candidate  do  upon receiving a donation?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 15 of the Bill require every political

association  or candidate or his election agent to  take  all

reasonable  steps  to  identify the donor  and  to  determine

whether the donor is a permissible donor before accepting any

donation received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the donation is from an impermissible source, the

political  association, candidate or his election agent  must

return the donation to the foreign source. If that cannot  be

done,  the  donation  must  be returned  to  the  person  who

transmitted  the donation or to the bank, if  the  money  was

drawn  from  a  bank.   If  that is also  not  possible,  the

donation  must be surrendered to the Registrar  of  Political

Donations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a political association receives an anonymous

donation,  it must ensure that it has not accepted $5,000  or

more  of  such  donations  in  the  year  in  question.   Any

anonymous donations above the allowed limit must be  returned

either  to the person who transmitted it or the bank,  or  in

the  last  resort,  surrender it to the  Registrar.   Similar

provisions  operate  with regard to candidates  and  election

agents receiving anonymous donations.

<br><br><i>Reporting of Donations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill provides for political associations and

candidates  of  parliamentary or  presidential  elections  to

submit  a  donation  report  and a declaration  on  political

donations  to  the  Registrar  of  Political  Donations.   By

requiring  a  declaration  to be submitted  with  a  donation

report,   it  would  obviate  the  need  for  the   political

associations   to  list  all  donations,   which   would   be

administratively tedious.  The declaration would  state  that

the  political  association or candidate did not  accept  any

foreign  donations as well as anonymous donations beyond  the

permissible   limit,   ie,  less  than   $5,000.    Political

associations and candidates need to list only large donations

of $10,000 or above in the donation report.  This reporting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>

requirement   ensures   that   political   associations   and

candidates  keep proper records of the donations  which  they

receive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on the reporting requirements.

<br><br><i>Political Associations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill require political

associations to submit a donation report and a declaration to

the  Registrar within 31 days from the close of its financial

year.   This is similar to current practice whereby political

parties  are  already  required under the  Societies  Act  to

submit their annual returns and statement of accounts to  the

Registrar of Societies within 31 days from the close of their

financial  year or the Annual General Meeting,  if  there  is

one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political association should list in the donation

report  all  donations of $10,000 or more, whether  it  is  a

single  donation,  or  a series of donations  from  the  same

source,  which  adds  up  to  $10,000  or  more  during  that

financial  year.   For example, if the political  association

accepts  three donations from the same individual donor,  and

the  three  donations  add up to more  than  $10,000  in  the

financial year, the political association should also  record

this series of donations in the donation report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political association would also have to submit a

declaration with the donation report that it has not received

any   donations  from  impermissible  sources,  as  well   as

anonymous donations beyond the permissible limit of $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president, the secretary and the treasurer are

responsible  for the preparation and accuracy of the  report.

The  president, the secretary and the treasurer are  the  key

officers of a political association, and should therefore  be

responsible for the political donations.  They have to ensure

that the donation report and the declaration are submitted on

time,  and  declare that the donation report is complete  and

accurate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Candidates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 18 of the Bill requires every person who

intends  to  take  part in any parliamentary or  Presidential

election to submit to the Registrar a similar donation report

and declaration.  The donation report and declaration are  to

be  made after the issue of the writ of election, and sent to

the  Registrar of Political Donations at least two clear days

before Nomination Day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donation report and declaration by a prospective

candidate  are  similar to those by a political  association.

That  is, the prospective candidate must list in the donation

report  all  single donations of $10,000  or  more,  and  any

series  of  donations from the same permissible source  which

adds  up  to  $10,000  or more, for the  year  prior  to  his

declaration.  He would state in the accompanying  declaration

that  the donation report is accurate and complete, and  that

he  has not accepted donations from impermissible sources  as

well  as anonymous donations beyond the permissible limit  of

$5,000.   Thereafter, the Registrar would issue  a  political

donation certificate to the candidate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candidate is then required to submit the political

donation certificate, together with his other papers required

for   nomination  purposes,  to  the  Returning  Officer   on

Nomination  Day.  The nomination of his candidacy would  only

be   accepted  if  he  can  present  the  political  donation

certificate  together with his nomination  papers  and  other

legal requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the election, the candidate and his election agent

would  be required to submit to the Registrar within 31  days

of  the  declaration of election results, a  second  donation

report  and  declaration.  This second report and declaration

are  similar  to  the first declaration and donation  report,

except  that it covers the period from the time of the  first

report  to the time of the second report.  This second report

is  necessary,  as  in practice the candidate  is  likely  to

receive  donations  during this second  period,  when  he  is

campaigning for the elections.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Donors</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 of the Bill requires donors of "multiple small

donations" to political associations, which add up to $10,000

or more in a calendar year, to report to the Registrar.  This

is a counter-evasion measure.  It helps the Registrar to keep

track  of  small  multiple  donations  that  add  up   to   a

significant  amount of $10,000 within a short period  of  one

year.  The reporting requirement will also lessen the tedious

task of verifying such donations.  A donor would not need  to

declare  if  the  total donation is less than  $10,000  in  a

calendar year.  He also would not need to declare if he  made

a  single  donation, or a few donations,  each  of  which  is

$10,000  or  more.   In this case, the political  association

should  have captured these donations in the donation report.

A similar requirement can also be found in the UK Bill.

<br><br><i>Reports Not Open to Public Inspection</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donation reports submitted to the Registrar of

Political  Donations  would  not  be  open  to  the   public.

Allowing  public  inspection of the  donation  reports  could

inhibit   permissible  donors  from  donating  to   political

associations or candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now, political parties, like all other

registered  societies, are required to submit annual  returns

and  statement of accounts to the Registrar of Societies  and

these  annual returns and statement of accounts are also  not

available for public inspection.

<br><br><i>Offences</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the offences under the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this Bill, accepting foreign donations per se

would  not  be  an  offence.  Instead, the foreign  donations

would just be forfeited if they are not or cannot be returned

to  the  donor.   Clauses 11 and 17 of the  Bill  enable  the

Public  Prosecutor to apply to a District Court to order  the

forfeiture of a donation from an impermissible source which a

political  association or a candidate or his  election  agent

has accepted.  Clauses 11 and 17 also provide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>

for  appeals  to the High Court against the decision  of  the

District Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the responsible officers of a political

association or a candidate or his election agent would commit

an  offence  if  any  of  them makes a false  declaration  in

relation to political donations.  For example, if a political

association  accepts a foreign donation but  the  declaration

accompanying the donation report declares otherwise, each  of

the  responsible officers would have committed an offence  of

false  declaration, unless he can show that he did  not  know

and  could not reasonably have known that the declaration was

false.  This is reasonable since the political association is

in  the  best position to know the circumstances under  which

the donations were received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If convicted of false declaration, then each of the

responsible  officers of the political association  would  be

liable  to  a fine of not exceeding $5,000 or an imprisonment

not  exceeding 6 months, or to both.  Repeat offenders  would

face higher penalties  -  a fine not exceeding $20,000 or  an

imprisonment not exceeding 3 years, or to both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, it would be an offence if political

associations and candidates and their election agents do  not

submit  the  donation  reports  and  declaration  within  the

stipulated  time, for example, for the political association,

it   would  be  within  31  days  from  the  close   of   the

association's  financial year.  If  convicted,  each  of  the

responsible  officers of the political association  would  be

liable to a fine of up to $2,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 of the Bill makes it an offence for a person

to   facilitate   the   evasion  of   the   restrictions   on

impermissible donations.  For example, if an individual,  who

is  a  permissible donor, accepts money from an impermissible

donor  and  donates the money to a political  association  to

circumvent  the prohibition, the person would have  committed

an  offence.  He would be liable upon conviction to a fine of

not more than $3,000, or to imprisonment for not more than 12

months, or to both.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30 of the Bill makes it an offence to alter,

suppress or destroy any document he is required to produce to

the  Registrar,  with a view to evade the provisions  of  the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 of the Bill empowers the Registrar to compound

any offence under the Act.  This provides the flexibility for

the  Registrar to offer composition of not more than $500 for

the  less  serious offences.  Offences which carry  a  mental

element, such as false declaration of donations, facilitating

in   the   evasion  of  the  restrictions  on   impermissible

donations,  would not be made compoundable.   As  per  normal

practice,  the  compoundable offences would be prescribed  by

regulations.

<br><br><i>Consequential Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clauses 36 and 37 of the Bill make related

amendments  to  the  Parliamentary  Elections  Act  and   the

Presidential  Elections Act.  A prospective  candidate  would

have  to deliver to the Returning Officer, together with  his

nomination  papers  on nomination day, a  political  donation

certificate  issued by the Registrar of Political  Donations.

If  he fails to do so, his nomination would be rendered  void

and may be rejected.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill aims to keep foreign interference out of

our   domestic  political  process.   It  does  not   prevent

political   associations   and  candidates   from   accepting

donations, so long as the donations are from Singaporeans  or

Singapore-controlled companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting the Bill, we have kept the framework as

simple as possible.  No doubt, the associations would have to

put  in  some effort to account for the donations  that  they

receive.   But  this small effort would  go  a  long  way  in

upholding  the  independence and integrity of  our  political

process.   I  have  made such a long speech to  explain  this

because  I think it is necessary for Members to have a  clear

understanding of the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money and politics seem to be frequently linked

together.  It  has troubled the politics of  many  countries.

Recently,  we read in the newspapers that the Prime  Minister

of  a certain country wept openly because his political party

was  baffled  by money politics.  In the recent  presidential

election  in  Taiwan, we also saw the "black  gold"  politics

prevailing over Taiwan.  According to newspaper reports, some

people  in the United States alleged that China had attempted

to  make  political  donations to the Democratic  Party,  and

created a huge hue and cry out of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us come back to politics in Singapore. I think

we  are fortunate because we do not have such problems.   The

reason is that the PAP Government has consistently maintained

its  stand  on  keeping politics clean and transparent  here.

All  these  years,  the  Government is  against  and  resists

foreign  interference in our domestic affairs, including  the

influence  through financial means.  Now that  we  have  this

Bill  before  us,  we should be able to further  enhance  and

institutionalise   clean   government,   to   safeguard   the

sovereignty and integrity of our country, and to promote  the

development of transparent politics.  Therefore, I think this

Bill is in keeping with our national interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, does this Bill disadvantage the

opposition  parties?  I do not think so.  Everyone  is  equal

before  the law, the opposition parties and the ruling  party

alike.  Every party must come under the law, and so this Bill

will  not  hamper the development of any opposition party  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a clean political system, whether a candidate wins

or  loses an election is dependent on whether or not he  gets

the  support of his electorate.  I think the key does not lie

in  whether  this candidate or his political  party  has  the

money, or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>

whether  the party has political donations.  The key lies  in

whether this candidate or the party has the platform that  is

in  the  interest of the country and the people, and  can  be

identified  by  the  people.   The  financial  power  of  the

candidate and his party is irrelevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether this Bill will affect the

civic organisations or civil society.  I do not think so.  On

the  contrary,  I  feel that this Bill will  encourage  civic

organisations to develop and prosper. This is because we  are

now encouraging active citizenship, encouraging our people to

take part in our public affairs, to show their concern in the

society and  the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you have a civic organisation whose objective and

motivation is very clear,  transparent and proper,  then  why

should they fear?  Why should they worry at all, unless  they

have   ulterior   motive,  and  they   have   to   act   very

surreptitiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether this Bill will deter people from donating

money  to political parties, I do not think so.  Ours  is  an

open  and transparent political system.  Unless a person  has

some  ulterior  motive,  unless  this  person  has  incorrect

objective,   he has  nothing to fear or worry  at  all.   Why

should  he  worry about donating money to support  a  certain

candidate or a certain political party?  He can donate  money

to  a party or a candidate that he believes can represent his

interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill cannot give us 100%

protection or safeguard.  In other words, it cannot fully and

completely  deter certain people, particularly  those  people

with  ulterior motives, to work through loopholes to try  and

influence  the political process in Singapore.  But  I  think

that  overall,  with our strong political structure,  we  can

maintain  clean, open and transparent politics.   Ultimately,

it  will depend on those who take part in politics themselves

-  whether such people have the moral conduct.  Therefore,  I

feel  that  even with this Bill around, it can only  give  us

certain protection and safeguard.  But we must still continue

to insist that all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>

those  who take part in politics must have the integrity  and

good   moral  conduct,  so  as  to  continue  upholding   our

transparent, clean and open political tradition in Singapore.

That Singapore has this clean, transparent and open political

tradition  is, to a large extent, attributed to our political

leaders who themselves maintain very noble moral standards in

politics and they have established the good example  for  all

to  emulate. Therefore, even though we now have this Bill, we

must continue to defend and uphold this tradition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is nothing new, as most countries prohibit

external  political donations.  Although it  is  not  in  our

political  culture to allow external influence  to  undermine

our  political system, it is timely to legislate this in case

some  political  parties are tempted  to  become  puppets  of

outside   agency.   Singapore  is  a  very   small   country,

strategically located both geographically and politically  in

this  region, and therefore we always play a significant role

in  the  global political arena, and may be courted by  other

countries  for their own political agenda.  We must therefore

ensure  that  our independent stand on international  affairs

should  never be compromised and come under any influence  by

other  nations,  big or small.  Because of our  openness,  we

must  ensure  that  Government must not be subjected  to  any

outside  political pressure to influence the  way  we  govern

ourselves.   We must maintain our national integrity  at  all

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donation of any kind from foreign sources invariably

means influence of our politicians involved as those who  pay

out  of funds must have their own ulterior motive and agenda.

Therefore,  it  is necessary that we introduce  the  Bill  to

ensure that our political parties and candidates taking  part

in  any of our parliamentary or presidential elections uphold

their  independence  and  not be  subjected  to  any  outside

interference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Opposition Members, Mr Chiam See Tong

and Mr Low Thia

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>

Khiang, have come out in support of the Bill, as was reported

in the press.  However, when they raised objection to some of

the  provisions to safeguard the administration of the  Bill,

they  betrayed their sincerity in their support for the Bill.

What is the use of having a legislation with no safeguard for

its   implementation,  if  the  legislation  is   so   easily

circumvented, and if one can find so many ways to get  around

the  rules  and  regulations governing the Act?   Surely  the

introduction of the Bill becomes meaningless.   In  fact,  on

Thursday,  18th May, the Straits Times reported that  in  the

US,  a  member  of  the Federal Election Commission  lamented

that,  "The  Federal  Election law is in serious  gravity  of

losing  all  effectiveness."  The aim of the law  enacted  25

years  ago  has  eroded over time because despite  the  tight

rules  and  regulations in place, the US  Election  is  being

influenced by people who found ways to exploit the  loopholes

to  achieve their personal objectives.  Therefore,  far  from

being too stringent in the provision of all safeguards in the

Bill,  such  as those laid out in clauses 8, 12,  13  and  14

which  maintain that the candidates or political  parties  be

transparent   in  receiving  any  donation  from  permissible

sources and state their conditions in which political parties

can accept political donations, in actuality, it would not be

sufficient to cover all the loopholes which can be  exploited

by  those  intending  to  exert influence  on  our  political

parties  or  candidates and for those in the  same  party  or

candidates who want to act as proxy for some outside agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in the Forum page, a group of readers is

concerned that the definition of political association in the

Act  would  affect adversely the group of civil societies  in

Singapore.  I am puzzled because civil societies are supposed

to  be  non-partisan and they are supposed  to  be  concerned

citizens who speak up for Singaporeans on matters relating to

Government  policy governing Singapore.  They should  not  be

supporting  any political party or candidates and  definitely

have no reason to receive donations from foreign sources  for

these purposes.  Therefore, to call for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>

the re-definition of political association to mean two-thirds

of  an  organisation's  annual funding and  activities  being

spent  on supporting the election of political candidates  is

meaningless.  Associations or societies are either  political

or non-political.  It cannot be two-thirds political and one-third  non-political.  It is absurd to see how an association

or  society  which is committed to a cause can be  so  wishy-washy and be so indecisive as to which role they are to play.

Besides,  if the term is being re-defined, what  is  to  stop

political  parties  from  establishing  civil  societies   or

associations  as  a fund to channel foreign funds  for  their

political  use?  It is precisely this and I feel  that  there

are  still  many ways in which one can circumvent  the  Bill.

Offhand, I can think of two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what if a political candidate writes a book,

never  mind  the  substance of the contents, and  an  outside

agency  buys up 1,000 copies at an inflated price to generate

the  necessary funds intended to be given to the party or the

candidate?  Secondly, a political candidate can be invited to

give  a  lecture  in  another country and  be  given  a  huge

honorarium  which is not commensurate with the  substance  of

the  lecture, but purely as a means to justify the  donation.

This  is  definitely not acceptable.  If the candidate  is  a

respectable  statesman or someone who is being held  in  high

esteem  by  the international community, then the  honorarium

can be justified.  But if some unknown political aspirant  is

given  a  huge  sum of honorarium for such  a  lecture,  then

obviously  something  is  very wrong.   These  are  just  two

examples which can be used by unscrupulous foreign sources to

generate  funds  for the political party and  candidate  they

intend to assert influence, and I am sure there are many more

if we do not comprehensively tighten all the loopholes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider ways to tighten

the  Bill  by introducing a clause where the onus is  on  the

political party or candidate to prove that any funds received

by  any means should be bona fide and not as a cover for such

funds to be generated for political use from outside

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>

sources.   It  is  also necessary to monitor  other  channels

where the funds can be made that have not been covered by the

Bill.   The Registrar of Political Donations should be  given

more  power  to  investigate funds which he  is  not  totally

satisfied that they are being donated in accordance with  the

Political Donations Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first thank you

for  allowing me the opportunity to speak at this early stage

of  the  Second Reading. This Bill particularly concerns  the

opposition  parties and it is very vital for  the  opposition

parties.  I thank you for recognising that and you have given

me the opportunity to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us make no mistake about this Bill. This Bill

is  going  to have far-reaching implications on the political

development in this country.  Let no one misunderstand  that.

This  Bill, I say, is sounding the death knell for  political

development  along  the road to a greater democracy  in  this

country.  That is what it is all about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard this afternoon from the Minister but what

he  has said does not, even in one iota, tell us the need for

the  introduction of this Bill in Singapore and  particularly

at this point of time.  It is completely silent on that.  May

I tell the Government that questions have been raised outside

and  I  have spoken to others and they say, "Why do you think

the  Government is introducing this Bill now?"  They need  to

be  answered.  So I ask the Minister, when he replies, to try

and  answer that question.  What is the burning necessity for

this Bill to be introduced in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  at this particular moment? And furthermore,  there

are a number of other things wrong about the way this Bill is

being  presented in Parliament.  It was read  for  the  first

time on the 9th of this month.  Barely 12 days after that, we

are  asked  to  pass  this Bill. What  is  the  great  haste?

Because  this  Bill concerns Singaporeans, it is  a  question

that   concerns   Singaporeans,  the  growth   of   political

development  in  this  country. Every Singaporean  should  be

interested  in  that.  Where are we heading  in  the  way  of

political  development?  Why is the Government  rushing  this

Bill  through?  There  have been no opportunities  given  for

discussion on this Bill outside Parliament.  There  has  been

no  opportunity given by way of a White Paper explaining  the

reasons  for  this Bill.  It will be passed as though  it  is

just  an ordinary Bill, and people should not worry too  much

about it. This is no ordinary Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to oppose this Bill, not only myself but

also  my  Party.   The  previous speaker mentioned  that  the

Member  for Hougang from my Party supported the Bill. I  have

clarified this with the Member.  It would appear that he  was

quoted  out  of  context.  Of course, the Workers'  Party  is

second to none in not wanting foreigners to come and tell  us

how to run our country.  But what does this Bill do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, for all its high-sounding words from the

Minister,  is attempting to dry up for the political  parties

in Singapore getting monies to further the cause of democracy

for  Singapore.  The People's Action Party, I am quite  sure,

is  flushed with funds.  We have not been told how much  they

have  got in the kitty.  Would they like to tell us?  We will

then  tell you how much the Workers' Party has, but I am sure

the  Government knows what the Workers' Party has.  I do  not

speak  for  the other opposition parties but I am  sure  that

they  do not have anything like what the PAP can boast of  in

the  way  of funds.  May I ask:  is that a healthy  state  of

affairs for Singapore that whilst the Government ruling party

is  able  to  tap  money, the other political  parties  which

oppose the Government are starved of any funds?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the PAP Treasurer, in a statement to the

papers some days ago, mentioned that quite a substantial  sum

comes from the members themselves and he picks up the monthly

pledges  or  donations made by the Ministers. Of course,  the

Ministers can afford to give out of their huge salaries  that

they  are being paid from public monies.  May I ask: is  that

one  of the reasons why Ministers are paid such huge sums  so

that  the  Party may get some of the money?  But he  makes  a

valid  point, and that is this. This is the Treasurer of  the

People's  Action  Party, and he says this  Bill  may  prevent

people  who have given donations anonymously in the  past  to

think  whether  they  should continue to give  any  donations

anonymously.  There you have it.  This is to try and cut  off

from  the  other political parties people who would  like  to

give  money to the political parties but who wish  to  remain

anonymous.  They  will not.  Of course, they  will  be  quite

happy to give donations to the People's Action Party and even

have  their names recorded so that the Party knows that  they

are good Singaporeans who support the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister: is there any evidence? Let us be

serious   about  this  Bill.  Is  there  any  evidence   that

opposition   parties   have  received  funds   from   outside

Singapore?   Have  you  got any evidence?   Let  us  have  it

instead  of  making glib statements that  we  must  tell  our

political parties not to be funded from outside. Let us  have

it  here  and now.  Is there any evidence, other than foreign

interests,  that  vested  interests in  Singapore  are  using

opposition political parties for their own ends?  Let me tell

the  House that no company in Singapore will want to make any

donation  to an opposition party.  That is the grim state  of

affairs in Singapore. While they will be ready to open  their

purses  for the PAP, they will not make any donation  to  the

opposition.  What are the opposition parties to do? They will

be crippled. This is an attempt to further cripple them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister refers to other countries but there has

been  public  disquiet about huge funds  going  to  political

parties by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>

people  trying to influence policies and decisions.  We  know

all  that.   Do we have that in Singapore?  There is  a  Bill

before  the  UK Parliament. I have tried to get hold  of  the

Bill  but  I was not able to get the whole Bill, but  I  have

seen  a  little bit of it.  There, it was because of disquiet

among  the public over huge sums of money being paid.   Quite

honestly, let us have it.  What is the motive and purpose for

this Bill at this present moment in Singapore? I shall have a

lot  to  say more, Sir, on the lack of any public discussion,

but  time is running on and I want to try and explain  why  I

think this Bill has been introduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister refers to past instances and I see he has

brought  in  the  Chew Swee Kee episode.  That  was  the  sum

received  by  the Government in power, not by  an  opposition

political  party.  I know all about that because I took  part

in  that  inquiry before Justice Buttrose.  How  is  that  an

instance of the need for this Bill at this particular  stage?

Then  he brings in Mr Francis Seow.  Was there any suggestion

that  he  received any monies?  Did the PAP have any evidence

that  the  US Embassy was giving him large sums of money?   I

ask the Minister to explain in this House whether this is not

another instance of the PAP Government crying wolf to further

strangle  opposition parties?  This is not mere rhetoric,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  This Government has a history of crying  wolf

whenever  it wants to introduce legislation or take decisions

which they think the people may not be ready to accept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to instance four such cases. In 1972, at an

election   rally,  a  PAP  candidate  seeking   election   to

Parliament  uttered a monstrous lie that the  Workers'  Party

had  received $600,000 from Malaysia.  $600,000  -  my  foot!

We  took  him to court for uttering this monstrous  lie,  but

this  was  all  part  of the PAP's plan then.   Because  even

before  the  elections, there was publicity about  opposition

parties,  particularly directed against the  Workers'  Party,

which  I had joined in 1971, of being used by foreign  agents

and   foreign  powers.   He  did  not  seek  to  justify  his

statement.  There was no truth in that statement. But we lost

our case because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>

the Judge, the late Mr Justice F A Chua, dismissed the action

on  a  purely  technical reason that we had not  pleaded  the

Hokkien  text,  or  was it some other dialect  text,  in  our

statement of claim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, showing greater concern, the Constitution was

amended  to ensure that the sovereignty of Singapore was  not

surrendered, except only upon a referendum.  This is to  keep

up  the  pretence,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that opposition  parties

will be ready to surrender Singapore's sovereignty to foreign

powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, next in line, is the amendment to the Newspapers

and  Printing  Presses  Act which  came  in  1974.   I  stand

corrected.   And I spoke on this Bill when I moved  a  motion

for  the  setting up of an independent newspaper in Singapore

sometime last year.  There, the reason for that Bill was that

foreigners were using the newspapers to influence politics in

Singapore.  I mentioned of speeches in this House by  Members

-   there was no Opposition Member in Parliament at that time

-   saying,  "We  can't allow foreign devils, foreigners,  to

take over our newspapers.  We've got to stop all this."  They

said,  "There  was also evidence that foreign embassies  were

using  the newspapers with their advertisements."   All  well

and good, outwardly.  But what was the real purpose?  Speaker

after  speaker spoke of the need for Singaporeans to  control

the  newspapers.  Yes, but what was the result of that  Bill,

as I said last year?  The result was to pass over total iron-fisted  control  over  the  press  to  the  Government.   The

Government  had  to be consulted through its two  classes  of

shareholders  -  the ordinary and preferred shareholders, who

had to be appointed by the Government.  And every appointment

of  any  staff had to be made by these preferred shareholders

appointed  by  the Minister.  So, what was  previously  a  de

facto  control of the press became legal with the passing  of

the  1974  Bill.   The Government could  then  point  to  the

section and say, "There you are, we've got the section  here.

You  can't appoint so-and-so as editor.  You've got  to  have

the  permission of all the preferred shareholders."  So, that

is another instance of crying wolf that there was a great

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>

danger to Singapore that newspapers were being taken over  by

foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then came the arrests in 1987. This was not a Bill.

This was an Executive decision to arrest 22 persons.  Some of

them were accused of being proxies for foreign agents to take

over  the  Workers'  Party.  One can see that  all  this  was

directed  at the Workers' Party.  The Government  was  saying

that these people were going to take over the Workers' Party,

and  so,  as I said then, a fanciful case was built up,  that

Marxists were taking over the Workers' Party.  They had to be

stopped.  The Workers' Party had to be saved.  Well, it was a

lot  of  nonsense.  And why?  The PAP saw that  the  Workers'

Party  was becoming  a real threat.  After the 1981 election,

the PAP vote dropped 121/2%.  This is not fiction.   This  is

a  fact.   Never  before  had the PAP vote  dropped  to  that

extent.  So, the writing was on the wall for the PAP.  And so

the  Workers'  Party had to be branded and some  of  us  were

prosecuted  and  I  had to leave Parliament,  purely  out  of

convictions which the Privy Council said were wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was an amendment to the Constitution to bring

in  an  Executive  President.   Again,  the  reason  and  the

rationale  that was put out for public consumption  was  that

the  opposition parties, if they were allowed to continue and

take over the Government, would squander our reserves.  So we

have  got  to  somehow put a brake on  that.   There  was  no

question  about the PAP safeguarding its reserves.   The  PAP

will  safeguard the reserves.  It was the opposition  parties

that  would  squander  and so we had an Executive  President.

But now, as it turned out, after all that show, the President

was  not given the powers.  Things continued in much the same

way,  but  the PAP was crying wolf to try and bring  in  that

dramatic change in the way this country is run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would ask the Minister, when he replies, to try

and  direct his mind to my question and not tell us about the

1959 donation received by a Government Minister, not tell  us

about Mr Francis Seow, because they are all completely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>

irrelevant.   They are things of the past.  We want  to  know

whether  there  is a need now.  Why are you introducing  this

Bill  now?  What is the danger to Singapore now?  It is  like

whenever  I  ask any question about the defence  expenditure,

they say,  "Oh, we've got to be ready to meet threats."  When

I  ask where is the threat coming from, they say, "Oh, no, we

can't answer that question."  It is all in the mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister please be specific about the need for

this Bill at this point of time?  Or is it merely an attempt,

seeing  that  elections may have to be held within  the  next

year  or so, to further strangle the opposition parties  from

putting up a proper fight at the next elections?  The history

of  this  Government has been one long series of attempts  to

cripple, obstruct, opposition parties making headway.  Are we

not  interested in greater democracy in this  country?   Will

you  tell us now?  Is it the intention of the Government that

Singapore  should  continue  as  it  has  with  the  PAP   in

government,  decreeing  what has  to  be  done  in  Singapore

without the people's participation?  People need to know  all

this.   Are  you  for  or are you against greater  democratic

development  in  Singapore?  Are you for or are  you  against

greater  participation by the people in  political  decision?

The Minister concentrates on foreign donations.  But what  he

does  not  realise, or he perhaps tries to hide, is  that  it

dries up our own people here through the fear that exists  in

their minds.  Are you capitalising on that fear?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you. The Member for Hougang says

yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Your time is up, Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have

permission  to  clarify  a statement made  by  my  Secretary-General?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, it is your turn to make your

speech.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> My Secretary-General mentioned just

now  that the Straits Times misquoted me.  I wish to say that

the  Straits Times has not misquoted me.  I have indeed  told

the  Straits  Times  that  I am of the  view  that  political

parties and politicians aspiring for public office should not

accept donations or funding from foreign sources.  I stand by

what  I  said.   But holding that view does not automatically

put  me in a position that I would accept or support the view

as  presented  in Parliament.  I suppose the  problem  arises

because a Member might have misquoted the Straits Times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, there are three

objectives  of  this  Political  Donations  Bill.    Firstly,

legislating  to  require  supporters  donating  to  political

parties  to  furnish  their names,  residential  address  and

identity  card numbers, so as to clip the financial resources

of the political parties, thereby diminishing the development

capacity of the opposition parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to provide the PAP Government with better

access  to  information  on  the  financial  sources  of  the

opposition parties and background of the supporters so as  to

hit at the opposition parties whenever necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to avoid the event of the pseudo-phenomenon of

the so-called opening up under "Singapore 21" unintentionally

resulting  in   civic organisations turning  to  support  the

opposition parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, when a political party involves itself

in  political  activities, it needs to have a lot  of  funds,

particularly in the situation of Singapore, where it is  said

that  "no  money,  no talk".  For example, if  an  opposition

party  wants to hold a forum or a mass rally, it needs  money

to  pay  for the rent of the stadium and the various  venues,

and  the  printing of publicity materials.  But the PAP  does

not need to incur these expenses because they can make use of

the  CCs,  RCs and other Government machinery to  spread  the

news.  They can even make use of the Feedback Unit to collect

information and convey the PAP's philosophy and policies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On operating expenses of a political party, we can see

that the party headquarter's rental itself will exceed $5,000

a  year.  The PAP has a team of highly paid Ministers who can

donate  to the Party and there are many, many more  MPs  than

the  opposition parties. Getting  huge sums in  donations  to

the  PAP  is  no  problem  at all.  But  for  the  opposition

parties,  they  do  not  have  such  substantial  and  stable

donations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties depend on donations of the

ordinary  citizens and proceeds from sale of party newspapers

and petty donations from the people, ranging from 50 cents to

less   than  a  hundred  dollars.   When  accumulated,  these

donations can add up to more than $5,000 in a year.  The Bill

provides  that in the event of  anonymous donations amounting

to  more than $5,000 in a year, the Government can confiscate

them.   This  amounts  to  saying that  for  even  a  50-cent

donation, we need to record  the identity card number of  the

donor  to  show  that the donation comes from  a  permissible

donor;  otherwise  the donation will be confiscated.  In  the

past, no receipt was issued for this type of donations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another type of donation comes from anonymous supporters

who are willing  to financially support opposition parties or

the  individual  candidates.  But  in  view  of  the  present

political  environment in Singapore, they do not wish  to  be

placed  on  record  that  they  have  been  donating  to  the

opposition  parties.  So even if we issue  official  receipts

to  them,  they would normally request that we put  it  under

"anonymous".   With the passage of this Bill, the  opposition

parties  would  not  be able to accept their  donations,  and

their financial strength will thus be diminished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, with the emergence of the Internet,

the  opposition parties now have more effective means to post

their  bank  account number on the website so that  donations

can  be  deposited into their bank accounts directly, without

worry.   But with the passage of this Bill, if the donors  do

not provide their personal particulars, they become anonymous

donors.  Eventually the donations will be confiscated by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>

the  Government.  Even with the donors' particulars provided,

the responsible officers of the opposition parties are unable

to  ascertain whether the donors are permissible donors.   If

they  choose  to accept these donations, they  face  possible

prosecution  in court.  So this Bill has attained  its  first

objective  of  clipping  the  opposition  parties'  financial

resources, thereby causing the opposition parties to be short

of financial resources needed for their development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, let me talk about the second objective of this

Bill.   The  Bill requires that the political parties  submit

annual  donation reports to the Registrar, giving details  of

the  donors'  names, addresses and IC numbers, and  also  the

Government   can   require  the  parties  to   submit   other

information,  at  any  time.  We do not  know  what  sort  of

information they want in respect of each donor, and how  this

information may be used.  I think only the PAP will know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most absurd provision is that any person who donates

more  than  $10,000  in  a year to a  political  party  or  a

political association is required to submit a donation report

to  the  Registrar; failing which he can be charged in  court

under this law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the PAP Government introduces such a Bill, it

is  invading  the  rights to free donations of  the  ordinary

people  of  Singapore.   In future, they  will  not  dare  to

donate,  because  once they donate money  to  the  opposition

parties,  they  are  inviting trouble for  themselves.   This

Political   Donations  Bill  covers  also   other   political

associations.   The  Minister can, at any time,  gazette  any

organisation as a political association to be covered by this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government has been talking about opening up a

civil  society. There are a lot of intellectuals in Singapore

who  are  actively contemplating  participation in our  local

politics.  The introduction of this Bill is a heavy  blow  to

them. The message the PAP Government  wants to convey is very

clear,  that  is to say, if any so-called civic  organisation

wants to criticise the Government or even to challenge the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>

Government,  then  it  will be simply  categorised  as  being

similar to an opposition party and it will be nipped  in  the

bud  and  given no room to develop, just  like the opposition

parties. They cannot criticise the Government's policies,  as

an  independent organisation, because if an independent civic

organisation  is  to  criticise the Government,  it  is  like

enhancing the strength of the political party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that "money can do wonders". Indeed, money

has great magical power.  If a politician is overly dependent

on  huge donations from a certain source, his political sense

may  well be manoeuvred by this benefactor of his.  I believe

that any politician or political party should not accept  any

donation  from  foreign sources, otherwise it  would  subject

itself to manoeuvering by the foreign power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under these major premises, the Political

Donations  Bill has caused anxiety to ordinary  citizens  who

wish  to donate to opposition parties and indirectly blocking

the donations to the opposition parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must clearly state that I oppose this Bill unless this

Bill  is  further discussed by a Select Committee.   So  from

this Bill, we can see very clearly that the PAP Government is

making  use  of the human weakness to maintain its  one-party

superiority.  At elections, it uses the threat tactics on the

people  and then they make use of this superpower  under  the

ISA to detain people without trial.  Now, with this Political

Donations Bill, it is casting a shadow on those who aspire to

participate in politics and creating a psychological fear  in

them.   So  anyone who wants to support the opposition  party

will  have  to openly reveal his identity, failing  which  he

will automatically lose his political rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all those who want to support the opposition to

stand  up  courageously  and fight for  their  due  citizens'

political rights. Do not cause a psychological barrier to  be

generated  just  because  your identities  will  have  to  be

revealed when making donations to the opposition parties.

<div align="center"><b>POLITICAL DONATIONS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I give my full support to the provisions of the

Bill  that  seek specifically to ban political  parties  from

receiving  contribution  or donation  from  foreign  sources.

Some  in Singapore may feel that the Government may be crying

wolf  because  we  have not experienced recent  incidents  of

foreign  sources  attempting  to  influence  the  outcome  of

political  elections in Singapore.  But  I  personally  think

that  we  should  be extremely careful and  vigilant  because

experiences  in  many countries have shown  that  once  money

politics take root in a political system, it would almost  be

impossible to eradicate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have laws limiting the amount of money candidates

seeking parliamentary or presidential office can spend during

elections.   This  is a good thing.  Our  present  system  of

capping political spending has been effective and has made it

possible   for  independent  candidates  not  affiliated   to

established political parties to seek political office.  This

is  due  mainly  to  the  absence of  financial  barriers  to

participate  in  elections.   This  is  one  aspect  of   our

political system that must be preserved.  Experiences in many

other  countries have shown that informal financial  barriers

of entry have corrupted the electoral process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support laws imposing stricter and more

transparent financial housekeeping rules as they will provide

for   more  accessible  means  to  scrutinise  the  financial

accounts  of  political parties and support a more  objective

assessment of any organisation in any investigation  process.

Therefore,  this  Bill  to check and control  the  source  of

income of political

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>

parties  is  timely  and  appropriate.   Unlike  Mr   J.   B.

Jeyaretnam, I have no problems with any of the provisions  of

the Bill in so far as it applies to political parties, if  it

is  about catching the wolf, although disguised in sheepskin.

However,  Sir,  I  have  reservation and  concern  about  the

implication  this Bill would have on civil society.   I  fear

that  civil society may become the unfortunate victim of this

Bill.   Therefore, I would like to raise some of  the  issues

and  give  feedback  received by me  from  members  of  civil

society to the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to perhaps consider excluding

political  association  from  the  provisions  of  this  Bill

because  it will pose all kinds of problems to civil society,

the  majority of whom have neither the capacity nor objective

to  influence  either  the electoral process  or  outcome  of

elections, but will nevertheless be adversely affected by the

Bill.   Even  if we have good reasons to do so, I would  urge

the   Minister   to  consider  amending  the  definition   of

"political  association" as it is too broad.   Because  I  am

persuaded  to  accept  the  fact  that  civil  societies  and

organisations  can  become  disguised  fronts  of   political

parties.   It would also appear to me that, for example,  the

Democratic   Socialist   Club  and  the   Political   Science

Association  of  the  NUS  whose main  objective  is  not  to

influence  party  politics, but to  provide  a  platform  for

intellectual discussion among university students,  would  be

considered  a  political association.  In this regard,  I  am

curious  to find out the Minister's definition and  how  this

will  apply to the PAP Community Foundation, whose activities

are purely educational, but is part of the PAP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, personally, for me, how would the Minister regard

the  Roundtable  and  whether  it  would  be  gazetted  as  a

political  organisation?   What I  attempt  to  show  to  the

Minister  is that we have three different groups  with  three

different types of activities, but, by sheer definition,  may

all  be  subject to the provisions of this Bill.   Therefore,

what  constitutes wholly or mainly politics in  Singapore  is

problematic to interpret.  The discretionary powers given  to

the Minister, in my view,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>

may  be  too  wide  and  will put the Minister  in  a  no-win

situation,  as it would be convenient for critics  to  accuse

the  Minister  of  wanting  to have this  provision  possibly

because its views are inconsistent with the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to offer some other suggestions which would

perhaps  achieve  the  same  purpose  of  preventing  foreign

influence  and, yet, perhaps remove some of the inconvenience

that may hamper the activities of non-partisan civic groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Organisations registered under the Societies Act and

whose  activities  relate to the politics  in  Singapore  can

have,  in  their  constitution,  provisions  disallowing  its

members to become members of any political party or engage in

any  partisan  politics,  failing  which  then  perhaps  such

organisations  should be deemed to be political organisations

under this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We can have provisions where organisations can be

deemed  to  be  political organisations where,  for  example,

there  is  a large membership size although the objective  of

the  society is to be very broad based.  Or where there is  a

large  amount  of  operating  expenditure,  we  can  draw   a

difference between an organisation with a $2,000 bank account

and  one with $2 million in operating expenditure to fund its

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where such organisations have a significant portion

of   their  income  deriving  from  foreign  sources,   quite

logically, they should be gazetted as political organisations

and  subject  to this provision.  So I hope the Minister  can

accept  these points, and that amendments and refinements  to

this Bill can be made so that we can achieve the major intent

of  this  Bill without jeopardising the activities  of  civil

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other problematic implications which I

wish  to  highlight and seek the clarification and  assurance

from the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For many of us in civil society, the Internet,

globalisation  and the maturing civic movement  in  Singapore

have meant greater collaboration and cooperation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>

with  civil societies in other parts of the world.  In  fact,

my  own  experience has shown how surprising  foreigners  are

about the growth of civil society in Singapore over the  last

few  years.  However, this growth will be affected because  a

large  part  of the activities of civil society  are  through

seminars and conferences overseas.  It is common for  foreign

organisations  to contribute towards travel and accommodation

expenses when inviting Singapore participants.  But this Bill

will  deem these organisations as non-permissible donors  and

therefore disallow such contributions.  Conferences, seminars

and  discussions  are  vital  lifeline  to  civil  societies.

Presently,  many  civil societies have  difficulties  raising

funds locally to carry out such projects.  I have raised this

matter  at the last Budget debate and here I am repeating  my

earlier  call for greater Government's support towards  civil

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, the Roundtable, for example, has carried out

fund raising projects, for example, a childcare centre called

Haripasad  in  Ang Mo Kio.  This is a good  thing  for  civil

society  to be engaged in beyond discussion.  But I fear  the

future  of  such  activities as donors  may  have  their  own

reservations   and   interpretations   about   having   their

identities  recorded.  Many would err on the side of  caution

and would be reluctant to support such organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The definition of "permissible donors". For a

company, the definition of "permissible donor" is such that a

donor  has to be a Singapore-controlled company which carries

out  its  business wholly or mainly in Singapore.  Therefore,

it excludes Singapore-controlled companies but whose business

activities are wholly or mainly outside Singapore as they are

termed "non-permissible donors".  This Bill may appear to  be

out of touch with the regionalisation realities of companies.

My  question  to  the Minister is: why can  we  not  separate

corporate  identity and registration from  the  geography  in

which they do their business in?  The reality is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>

that  there will be some Singapore-controlled companies which

derive  most  of  their income from outside  Singapore.   Why

should  these  companies  be  excluded  or  discouraged  from

contributing  to civil societies in Singapore  when  what  we

really  need  is exactly the reverse, that they  continue  to

contribute to the various social causes in Singapore so  that

they  remain  rooted to this country?  What  about  donations

from  a  private trust and foundations which are also a  main

source  of  income to civil societies?  I wish  the  Minister

could clarify on this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the meaning of "donation". Clause 3(2)(f)

prohibits  the  collection of fees and subscription  paid  by

foreigners to a political association.  My question  is:  why

do  you  have  an organisation, say, a think tank  formed  to

discuss regional security issues and have members and experts

from  around  the region?  This Bill will then  prohibit  the

organisation from collecting fees and subscription from  such

members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the value of donation. This Bill requires the

organisation  to  value  all  donations  and  gifts  only  on

commercial  terms.  Again, this provision may be problematic.

Depending  on  how you value some of these contributions,  it

may  exceed  the  amount  required  to  be  reported  to  the

Registrar  of  Political Donations which is $10,000,  and  an

error  may subject a person to prosecution and a fine  simply

because   of  his  underestimation  of  the  value   of   the

contributions  given to the organisation.   This  will  cause

some  problems  for  civil  societies.   We  have  also  seen

recently  the  emergence  of the individuals  who  stand  for

parliamentary  elections.  They get  help  from  friends  and

families who do so in their personal capacities, or maybe  as

proprietors of their own firms.  The interpretation  of  this

Bill will make it problematic for friends and families to get

help, except on purely commercial terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have given my qualified support for this Bill but

would  appeal  to  the  Minister  to  consider  some  of  the

amendments and suggestions that I have made.  I hope that the

Third Reading of this Bill

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>

can  be  deferred to the next sitting so that some  of  these

inputs  from civil societies can be taken into consideration.

Sir, we have come so far, I think this is a good Bill and has

good  intentions.   But if we can make  some  amendments  and

allow  civil societies' inputs to be considered, many of  the

unnecessary  constraints imposed on civil  societies  can  be

avoided.   I  do  not think that it is such an urgent  matter

that we cannot wait for another month or so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as all good Singaporeans, we want the destiny of this country

to be decided by our own citizens and by Singaporeans, and in

wanting  to exclude or have rules to prevent foreigners  from

trying  to  control and unduly influence the outcome  of  our

society wins my support.  At the same time, while we  try  to

have  controls to prevent foreigners coming in, we must still

encourage  the participation of our citizens in our political

life and civil society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy and democratic institutions can be

strengthened if more of our citizens participate and take  an

interest  in politics and civil society matters.   Therefore,

the  challenge  here  is  to get the  right  balance  between

controls  and free involvement.  We should not have too  much

controls in that the free involvement becomes constrained.  I

think  the  art is getting the right balance.  But before  we

even  talk  about balance, when we talk about  the  need  for

funds, the biggest need for funds is actually to participate.

Therefore,  if  you make it cheap and not too  expensive  for

people  to  participate in politics and stand for  elections,

then  the  need to raise funds and be dependent on  too  many

sources  of funds become unnecessary.  Therefore, having  the

elections where you have limits on expenditure, ie, $2.50 per

voter, does not make it really necessary to raise funds.  And

we  should  still work at great expense to keep  expenses  of

conducting  elections  and  being  involved  in  public  life

affordable,  and  barriers for entry as low as  possible,  so

that any Singaporean who aspires to get into politics through

a party, or as an independent candidate, can freely do so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, we also need a few clarifications.

One  of the clarifications is we need to define a little  bit

more  on  the  political associations  other  than  political

parties.   And  one of the best ways is for the  Minister  to

give examples, and even if he has the examples and he has  to

gazette,  it  is  good to give ample notice  to  a  concerned

organisation.  And I would support that more than a political

party  should  be defined as "political association"  because

many could be third parties who can influence outcomes.   The

US  presidential election is a clear cut example where a  lot

of  third-party  people  under great  or  strange  names  are

influencing the outcome.  I do not think we should have  that

in Singapore but we should at the same time be very clear who

we are referring to and how we want to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provision is in clause 3(2)(e) about

sponsorship.  It is quite widely defined and we do  not  know

what  exactly it means.  If somebody invites you for a dinner

and  is  a political association, and you pay for the dinner,

would  it  be  considered sponsorship?  Or  if  they  have  a

publication   and  people  advertise,  would   it   also   be

sponsorship?   What about cost of seminars  and  conferences?

Would  it  be  all right to sponsor research  programmes,  or

somebody's  political  organisation,  because  the   research

programmes  could  have  impact on  the  positions  to  take?

Therefore, this clause needs a bit more clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few suggestions. First, the limit on anonymous

donations.  I have looked at the British Bill.  In  UK,  they

say up to pound 50, it is anonymous.  You only declare if  it

is more than pound 50.  It seems we have modelled quite a lot

on  the British Bill.  We can take a similar approach and say

that  if  it  is  less  than  S$100,  it  can  be  considered

anonymous.  Because I do not think anybody with $5,000  would

go  and  ask  500  people to donate $100  each.   It  is  too

troublesome and it would not do.  The other point is only the

big  donors  will be the ones who can exert undue  influence.

Therefore, to keep political societies and political  parties

independent, it is better

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>

to  have  small donors but widespread and mass organisations,

because  after  all  winning  election  is  by  getting  mass

support.   And if they do not have ideas that can  induce  or

encourage the ordinary men to contribute, then the idea dies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about corporate donations.

Corporations  cannot vote in an election.  It is individuals.

The country is made of individuals.  And I do not support the

idea  of  companies  making  contributions  or  donations  to

political  parties.   If  you want  to  have  rules,  let  us

completely   prevent  companies  or  corporate  bodies   from

donating.   In the UK law, they ask for a general meeting  of

members  to  decide to give or not to give.  But in  UK,  the

trade  unions  also  have  funds to contribute  to  political

parties.   Societies do.  But in Singapore, our trade  unions

do  not.   Our Trade Unions Act prevents that and  there  are

good reasons for that.  Many of our societies do not do that.

Cooperative  societies  do not do  that,  and  we  have  good

reasons  for  that.  And we should also not allow individuals

to   support  political  parties  or  political  issues  with

corporate big business money.  We should not come to a  state

like  in  the United States where big businesses  have  undue

influence  in our political process.  Therefore,  if  anybody

wants to donate, let them donate as individuals and let  them

be  identified.  Let us be transparent about it  rather  than

through the veil of a corporation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also want to say that as long as we keep the

other pieces of legislation on elections and allow free media

access for people to express their ideas, there will be  less

danger of us having to worry about the need to implement this

Bill.  In that sense, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I thank you for giving

me  the  opportunity to speak on the Bill  which  I  rise  in

support of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that in any country, public

confidence and the integrity of the political system must  be

maintained at all times.  Members of the public must have  no

reason to believe that political parties, policies and indeed

any politician have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>

been  influenced  by  large  donors.   As  a  sovereign   and

independent country, with a Government that is democratically

elected, the legitimacy of the Government would depend on the

trust that people have.  They must not doubt that the leaders

in  power decide policies that work in the long-term interest

of  the country. Where the perception exists that leaders  of

the  Government or politicians take instructions from  people

who  donate  large sums of money, public trust in  Government

would  surely  be  undermined  and  with  it,  its  effective

governance.   I  therefore welcome the  introduction  of  the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, while I support the Bill, as a matter

of  general principle, there are a number of areas which  the

Bill will require clarification and further consideration.  I

shall dwell on some of these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Bill distinguishes between foreign and local

donations.   In  the  case  of  foreign  donation,  the  Bill

provides  generally that every political association,  party,

or candidate must not accept a donation if it is offered by a

person  who is not a permissible donor.  The Bill  defines  a

permissible  donor, inter alia, as either  an  individual,  a

Singaporean  who is at least 21 years of age or a  Singapore-controlled company which carries on business wholly or mainly

in  Singapore.  The  Bill  further  defines,  inter  alia,  a

Singapore-controlled  company to mean a company  incorporated

in  Singapore and the majority of whose directors and members

are citizens of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a direct donation by a foreigner is not possible,

it  would be relatively quite easy for a foreigner who  seeks

to  circumvent the restrictions of the Bill by channelling  a

donation through a permissible donor.  As I said earlier, the

definition   of  a  Singapore-controlled  company   basically

defines the company as one that is incorporated in Singapore,

where  the majority of directors and members are citizens  of

Singapore.  It would be possible in certain situations  where

such  conditions are complied with, where you  have  minority

shareholders  who are foreigners who are able, in  their  own

ways, to exert

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>

influence  on the majority shareholders or even on the  Board

of  such companies.  In such instances, while these companies

still  qualify as Singapore-controlled companies,  I  am  not

sure whether or not the company itself may not be subject  to

the  control of a foreign party.  If the Minister can clarify

this point, it would alleviate our concern on this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I note that under clause 2(5), it provides

that  any  donation received by a candidate  or  a  political

association  by  way  of a donation  via  a  trustee  in  his

capacity  as  such  shall be regarded as a  donation  from  a

person who is not a permissible donor. The question is:   who

is  a trustee? A trustee is not defined in the Bill.  One can

look  to the common law for its meaning. Arguably, it can  be

said that if a person who transfers property to a permissible

donor  with the direction that the latter be asked to make  a

gift  of  that property to a political party or a  candidate,

clause  2(5) would be triggered and in any event,  clause  23

would   equally   apply  in  respect  of  such  arrangements.

However, Sir, it is possible to get around restrictions in  a

number of ways. For instance, a foreign donor can give  these

gifts  to  a  permissible  donor  absolutely  such  that  the

permissible donor is not the trustee of these gifts. Once  it

is  determined that these gifts are not held in trust by  the

permissible  donor, the money can then be channelled  to  the

political party or candidate with whom the permissible  donor

and the foreign party are equally sympathetic to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, one does not have to, as a foreign donor,

transfer property to the permissible donor in order  to  make

such  donations.   Where a foreign donor has strong  business

influence  over a Singapore-controlled company, it  would  be

possible  for  the Singapore company to make donations  under

the influence of the party or the foreign party. Any donation

made  can  be compensated in the future through some generous

contractual  means  between the Singapore-controlled  company

and  the foreign party.  In citing this as an example,  I  am

mindful  that  there are other provisions in  the  Bill  that

prevent or restrict the circumvention of such restrictions by

other means. Clause

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>

23,   for  instance,  makes  it  illegal  for  a  person  who

facilitates  such transactions.  But as we all  know,  it  is

quite possible, if one is aware of the restrictions in clause

23, to even circumvent these restrictions.  In sum, it is not

a  foolproof  and  water-tight  provision  and  it  would  be

possible  under certain circumstances for foreign parties  to

indirectly make a contribution through a permissible donor in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if the purpose of the Bill is to maintain

public confidence in the political system by preventing money

politics, I do not see why distinction has been made  between

a  foreign donor, and for that matter, a local donor who  has

substantial sums of money and can equally be in a position to

influence Government policies through monetary contributions.

Allowing that person to have an influence on policies through

financial  resources would strike at the very  heart  of  our

system of democracy which seeks to represent the interest  of

all  Singaporeans and not just the moneyed few.   It  is  not

inconceivable that with the booming economy, there  would  be

many local companies and individuals with hoards of cash.  It

would generally be conceivable that in an environment that is

more  liberal, some would consider putting money through  the

political  system. At the moment, there is  nothing  to  stop

rich  local  individuals  from donating  money  to  political

associations  and candidates.  Fortunately,  this  party  has

always  maintained the highest level of integrity.   We  have

never  allowed  money  to influence our decisions.   However,

since  institutions exist in perpetuity and man does not,  it

is  vital  that we institutionalise our values by  regulating

all manner of donations and not just confine the present Bill

to foreign donations alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, this Bill, at another level, should not be

seen as one of regulating the influence of foreign parties on

local  policies.  Against this backdrop, there  is  a  larger

issue  of money politics. Up until this point in time,  as  I

have  said  earlier,  there  is  an  absence  of  substantial

spending  on  political campaigns and advertising.  This  has

helped  to  keep  the cost of running for a political  office

low.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>

However,  it would be difficult in trying to win  the  hearts

and  minds  of  the  electorate  not  to  rely  on  the  mass

communication  media  in  the future  to  reach  out  to  the

constituents.    If this happens, the need for funding  would

obviously  increase.  On principle, there  is  nothing  wrong

with getting the public to donate to political parties.  What

is at issue is the extent to which donors have the ability to

influence  policies through donations. One  way  to  overcome

this   concern   is  to  create  a  greater   atmosphere   of

transparency in the whole process. I note that the Bill  only

requires  accounts  to  be  filed  with  the  Registrar   for

donations  above a certain level.  There is  nothing  in  the

Bill  which requires public disclosure of all donations.   It

is  important  that if you want to have a transparent  system

that  such  disclosures be made to the  public.   Making  the

system  and  process transparent would also  have  a  way  of

checking  the conduct of political parties and candidates  in

its  dealings  with  donors.  Additionally,  by  making  such

disclosures,  voters  can also make informed  choices  in  an

election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just some final words about what the opposition has

said. They have lamented and griped about how the Bill is yet

another  example by the Government to stifle the  opposition.

They  have  stated  that the Bill does  not  proscribe  local

donations.  There is nothing to stop local donors from giving

money  to  opposition members. They have harped on  the  fact

that  this  Bill will discourage local donors from  making  a

donation because particulars of their donations would have to

be  disclosed  to  the  Government agency.   Underlying  that

statement  is the assumption that because they  have  made  a

donation, prosecutions, or in their term, persecutions  would

necessarily follow.  If I may just ask the opposition Members

whether  they  are  able  to cite instances  where  such  has

happened.   And indeed, in previous years, we  have  found  a

more  liberal climate and environment where people  are  more

prepared to speak up against Government policies. This  is  a

given.  And  in  this  kind of climate,  it  would  be  quite

difficult to see how this would gel

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>

with  the general climate of fear that the opposition Members

have  painted  that the members of the public  are  suffering

under.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition Members have also made a second

assumption, and that is, the politicians are able to  discern

in  respect of the monies that were given, and still be  able

to stand up for the principle that they should not be subject

to  the  influence  of money in the way in  which  they  make

decisions.   I believe this to be very naive. No  established

society  can run away from the fact that money does influence

and  the greater the sum of money, the greater the extent  of

the  influence.  I  doubt if we can say  sincerely  that  all

politicians, if subject to the influence of money, would  not

be influenced in the way in which they decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is precisely because of Singapore 21 that we

have   confidence  in  our  people,  in  our   system,   that

ultimately,  when it comes to the crunch,  when  there  is  a

viable alternative, if for some reason, the integrity of  the

present  party  and the leadership is compromised,  there  is

nothing to stop the citizens of Singapore from supporting the

opposition. There is nothing to stop them from coming out  in

the  open  with  large monetary contributions to  support  an

alternative view that will surely take us on.  If we  do  not

perform,  if  the people go without homes or health  services

are  not looked after, then I certainly do not think  that  a

restriction  like  this is going to stop people  from  making

contributions to the opposition parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to prevent foreigners from interfering

with  the  ability  of  Singaporeans to determine  their  own

destiny.   Unless of course the hon. opposition  Members  are

saying that they should sell themselves to the foreigners,  I

believe they have no alternative but to support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would say that, at this

point   of  time,  this  Bill  is  quite  unnecessary.    The

Government has always boasted that in Singapore,  we  do  not

indulge in money politics. As far as I know, there have  been

no reported cases in any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>

election  since  Singapore  became  independent  in  1965  of

candidates  wanting to buy votes or to spend  large  sums  of

money  to  influence voters.  So why the necessity  for  this

Bill  at this point of time?  Mr Jeyaretnam has a point  when

he  wants to know the rationale and the reason for this Bill.

I think the Minister should oblige.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only case I know of was in the 1976 elections,

although  Mr Jeyaretnam said it was 1972 when a PAP candidate

who was returned to Parliament accused the Workers' Party  of

accepting $600,000 from a foreign source.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 1972 election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> 1972. I am much obliged. Of

course,  he  was  roundly  sued by  the  Workers'  Party  for

defamation and the PAP candidate was unable to prove that the

Workers'  Party  took any money at all from a foreign  source

but,  nevertheless, he won the case based on  technicalities.

The  fact that remains till today is that neither the  ruling

party nor the opposition parties indulge in any form of money

politics.   I  believe the Government is very proud  of  that

fact  and  has said so many times.  In that case,  I  thought

that the status quo would remain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Political Donations Bill therefore comes as a

surprise  to  me.  Money politics has not been  part  of  the

political  culture  of  Singapore. As  far  as  I  know,  all

opposition candidates who took part in the election run their

election  campaigns on a shoestring budget.  I  believe  that

generally,  the  PAP candidates spend more on  the  elections

than  the  opposition candidates. We can  see  that  the  PAP

election rallies are much more posh than the opposition ones.

We also notice that in some PAP election rallies, at least at

the  ones held in Potong Pasir, the PAP spent money on hiring

huge  buses  to  ferry supporters, especially old  folks,  to

attend  the  election rallies held there. The opposition,  as

far  as  I  know,  has not spent any money to  transport  any

supporters  to their election rallies. The people  just  come

spontaneously  to attend opposition rallies.  Therefore,  the

opposition,  up  to  today,  has not  spent  much  money  and

certainly has not received any money from foreign

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>

sources.   For  that  reason,  I  wonder  why  this  Bill  is

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore there is also a cap on election

spending.   Candidates are limited at one  time  to  only  50

cents per voter. But now, the Parliamentary Elections Act has

been  amended to allow a candidate to spend $2.50 per  voter.

As  far  as I know, opposition candidates have never exceeded

that  limit set down by the law.  I, for myself, have  always

spent  very  little money.  When I first started in  1976,  I

spent  only  $3,500 per election.  And at  the  last  general

elections, I spent not more than $10,000.  But then again, my

constituency  of Potong Pasir is the smallest  in  Singapore.

It  has  only 19,000 voters.  It can therefore be  seen  that

there  is  no need to spend lots of money to win an election,

but only plenty of time and sweat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we ask again: what is the necessity to enact

this  law?   Why does the Government suddenly want  political

parties  and also other organised bodies, whose main activity

is  in politics, to declare donations given to them?  In  any

event,  the law already requires all candidates in  elections

to  declare the amount of money they spend on each  election.

I  am  just  wondering whether the Government has  introduced

this  Bill  as  it envisages that there is a  possibility  of

candidates advertising themselves on TV.  When that comes, of

course, I say lots of money will be needed.  Like in America,

the cost of election campaigning escalates dramatically.   In

the Presidential elections, I believe that each candidate can

spend up to $200 million.  But, in Singapore, as there is  no

election  campaigning through the TV media, I  do  not  think

there is a need for large sums of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, of course, candidates are only allowed

party  political broadcast for a few minutes over  the  local

TV.   The  time  allowed depends on the number of  candidates

and,  of  course,  this  is  very unfair  to  the  opposition

parties, because many of the opposition parties fielded  less

than six candidates and are not allowed even the 21/2 minutes

broadcast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition says that there is no need for such a law

at this point in time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>

The  only  reason  for  wanting  this  law  is  to  curb  the

opposition  further.   People who give money  to  the  ruling

party  do not mind revealing their names.  But in the context

of   Singapore  today,  in  our  culture,  people  are  still

generally  fearful  of  being  seen  to  be  supporting   the

opposition.   For this very reason, I think  this  law  is  a

great disadvantage to the opposition.  Sir, it will leave the

opposition  parties with a lot of problems in raising  funds.

Any  political party which cannot account for large  sums  of

money it receives can easily be discredited.  So there is  no

need actually for this law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, there was a case when a Minister in the

ruling  party  accepted money from the Americans.   This  has

been  mentioned.   His name is Chew Swee Kee.   When  he  was

found  out,  the PAP relished at it.  The PAP, at that  time,

was in the opposition.  It publicised the fact and helped the

PAP  to win the elections in 1959.  The point is that if  any

political party is found to have received money from  abroad,

it  will definitely be discredited.  Any party which wants to

accept  money  from foreign sources will have to think  twice

before  it  does  so.  Because, once it  is  found  out,  the

political  effect  will be disastrous.   People  will  wonder

whether  that party is working for the interest of  Singapore

or  for  some  foreign powers or foreigners.   A  party  that

accepts money from foreign sources will be seen as a tool  of

foreigners  and  cannot  be  trusted.   As  this  is  a  very

important  Bill, I would also support that it be  sent  to  a

Select Committee for further deliberations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have just got two more points to raise in regard

to  the provisions of the Bill.  I think the $5,000 limit for

anonymous donations is definitely too low.  I do not know how

the  Minister has plucked this figure from the air.  I do not

know on what basis this figure of $5,000 has been decided.  I

would  suggest that anonymous donations be allowed up to  the

limit of at least $23,000, which is about half the amount  of

election  expenses allowed under the Parliamentary  Elections

Act for Potong Pasir constituency, which is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>

smallest constituency in Singapore.  I think that is  a  fair

basis to take, half of the election expenses which is allowed

for  Potong Pasir constituency.  I think that cannot probably

even support two candidates.  So what harm can it do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next provision I would like to comment is on clause

12    -  annual donation report.  Sir, this is important.   I

heard from the Minister that it cannot be divulged to members

of  the  public.  If it cannot be divulged to members of  the

public, it must at least  be divulged to the opposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PAP is the Government. It can, at any time,

see  the  political donations report.  Is  the  Registrar  of

Political   Donations  going  to  swear  under  a   statutory

declaration  that he will not show those reports  to  anyone,

even  to members of the Government?    Sir, on this point,  I

think  the Government must be transparent.  If the Government

is  not  transparent, I am certain that people  will  believe

that  the  Government  can have a chance  to  peep  at  those

reports  but no one else can.  In other words, Sir,  this  is

like  playing  cards where I show you all my cards,  but  you

keep  your cards only to your chest.  I think members of  the

public  would like to know who are the people who  donate  to

the  PAP,  even  if  it  is their members  or  the  Ministers

themselves.  I think this must be seen to be transparent.  If

it is not, I am afraid the Political Donations Bill will have

no  credibility at all.  Sir, the opposition would demand for

complete transparency, as far as this point is concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I will try to answer as many as

possible  the points raised by Members.  Generally,  I  think

Members support the need for the Bill.  As to why we want  to

prohibit  foreign  funding  to  the  political  parties   and

political  associations which have an effect on the political

activities  and development of Singapore, we all  agree  that

Singapore's politics is for Singaporeans, and not for  others

to  come  and  interfere via any means, whether by  financial

means  or  other  assistance.   Because,  whatever  form  the

assistance  takes,  there is no question that  the  recipient

will, in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>

some  way or other, be beholden to that foreign organisation.

And  I do not think any Singaporean organisation or political

party  will  want  to put itself in that  position  of  being

beholden to a foreign organisation, and I think this point is

rightly pointed out by Mr Chiam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we actually do not need a lot of money for

elections.   The Parliamentary Elections Act lays down  quite

clearly  how  much each candidate can spend, ie, up to  $2.50

per  voter, and that is the cap.  And it is not an  expensive

affair  to run a campaign in Singapore.  Unlike the  case  of

many other countries where candidates have to spend millions,

if  not  hundreds of millions of dollars, to  secure  even  a

primary  candidacy, or as a candidate for, say, the  American

Presidential elections.  In Singapore, there is no such  need

and therefore it is easy.  The cost of entry into politics by

any Singaporean who has an interest to take part in elections

is easy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for the PAP, we have taken upon ourselves to

observe  very strict rules about donations to the party.   No

money  goes  to  the Ministers or the MPs  direct.   Whatever

donation  does  not go to the individual.   It  goes  to  the

party.   And  we  also make it clear that  whoever  give  the

donation can expect no favour and can expect no preference in

whatever dealings they may have with the Government  or  with

the  party.  They do donate and we tell them that they do  it

because  they  believe  that the PAP  has  been  running  the

country  well  and they want to support an organisation  like

the  PAP  to perpetuate the prosperity of Singapore, not  for

any  other  reason.  It is not to support the PAP  to  favour

them in their business or in their personal affairs.  That is

the basic rule of the PAP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, this Bill does not prohibit anyone who

has  an  interest  to  donate  to  the  political  party   or

association,  so long as he is a permissible donor.   And  we

must have the rules such that we can ensure that the donation

comes  from permissible donors.  On the occasion that  it  is

not,  because a Singaporean donor or a permissible source  is

prepared to allow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>

himself  to  be used as a conduit for a foreign organisation,

then  he  will have to take full responsibility for that  and

answer for the consequences.  So, it is not possible, like Mr

Kenneth Chen suggests, to cover all loopholes, or even Mr Goh

Choon  Kang's suggestion to ensure that we have no loopholes.

There will be some and I think we will have to learn from the

experience as we operate this Bill, which eventually  becomes

the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general point whether this will really affect

the  growth of civil society.  I do not think so.   Even  for

the  civil  society  or any organisation  that  has  a  civic

purpose,  there is no reason why it should depend on  foreign

funding  in  whatever form.  They must depend on  themselves.

They  must depend on Singaporeans who believe in their cause.

We  do not want a situation where a foreign organisation will

say,  "Yes,  this is the cause I believe in and  therefore  I

champion  your  cause for you by providing you  with  money."

And  I have explained in great detail what we consider to  be

politics and what we consider to be political activities.   I

even  outlined  six or seven conditions under which  we  will

consider those to be politics and political activities, and I

think they were clear enough.  Of course, when it comes to an

actual case, I think judgment will need to be applied and  we

will  need to distinguish between activities by groups  which

want  to  promote  a social cause for the  public  good,  not

leading  to a change in the political structure, not  leading

to  a change in the law, not leading to the way we want to do

our own things, and we want to decide that for ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are also groups that will want

to  push  very clearly for a political or partisan agenda  to

alter our political system.  That is a distinction we want to

make.    But   again,  it  will  have  to   depend   on   the

circumstances.  So I cannot answer very specifically in  such

a  situation whether we will allow or not allow.  In the end,

it  will  have to depend on the circumstances and  eventually

when  a decision is made to gazette an organisation which  is

not  a political party as a political association and subject

to  this Bill, I will make the rationale known and why we  do

this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>

and  this can be challenged.  The association can go  to  the

courts  for  a  judicial review of the  Minister's  decision.

That  is a completely transparent system.  But to ask me  now

to  detail  from  A  to Z what is covered  and  what  is  not

covered, it is not possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot speculate on hypothetical situations. But I

can  give  an  example.   For  example,  organisations  which

receive, say, funding from a UN organisation, UNDP or UNICEF,

to  promote  a  social  programme to  address  the  needs  of

children, are obviously the organisations in the first  group

that  I will not consider to be organisations that are within

the  prohibition  of  foreign donations,  because  for  these

associations, they are actually doing a social  programme  to

help  children  or battered wives for that  matter.   On  the

other hand, if local organisations accept foreign funds, say,

from a foreign body like the Soros Foundation network to help

them promote in Singapore a political programme based on what

they  think Singapore's society or political structure should

be, we will deem them to be in the second category, that they

will be a political association covered by the Bill, if these

Singapore  associations  do accept money  from  such  foreign

sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singaporeans truly want to have a political society

of   whatever   form,  whether  it  is  the   NUS   Political

Association, whether it is the Democratic Socialist Club, the

Roundtable, Socratic Circle, or whatever, let it be supported

by  Singaporeans.   It is only fair that whatever  activities

propagated  by  these organisations should  be  supported  by

Singaporeans, and not by foreign sources.  So it is  not  the

intention  of  this Bill to retard the growth  of  any  civil

society  group.   In  fact,  it is the  Government  that  has

generated  this  interest.   The  Government  generated  this

interest by having a Singapore 21 Committee chaired by   RAdm

Teo Chee Hean involving a lot of Singaporeans.  We say, "Come

and  take  part.   Make  sure that you have  an  interest  in

Singapore,  its continued prosperity and success.  Therefore,

do not just leave everything

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>

to the Government and have a say in things that will interest

you  or  affect  you."   So  it is the  Government  that  has

generated this interest and there is no particular reason why

the  Government wants to restrict the growth of  these  civil

societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, should such groups or organisations

come to the Government to ask for money, the question to  ask

is:  should  Government money be used for  their  purpose  or

should  it be for a general purpose of all Singaporeans?   We

cannot,  on  the one hand, say, "Please, give me money."  And

next  say,  "Please, let me be independent and completely  be

left  alone."  When they receive Government money, they  will

be subject to Government influence in some way or other.  But

if they want to be totally independent, then they must depend

on  themselves and on people, Singaporeans, who will  support

their cause.  Then they will be completely independent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas asked me to define "sponsorship" and whether

dinners,  research,  etc.  are considered  as  "sponsorship".

Again,  I really cannot explain in great detail what  is  and

what  is not considered as sponsorship.  We will have to look

at  the whole circumstances and the context before a decision

can be made, which eventually can be challenged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On anonymous donations, he asked why not limit to less

than $100 and therefore has no limit of $5,000 in total.   We

have   applied   different  rules  according   to   our   own

circumstances.   In Britain or America, they cannot  have  an

anonymous  donation of more than pound 50 or more  than  $50.

If they can generate 100,000 donors, so be it.  In Singapore,

we  think that $5,000 a year is pretty reasonable.  If,  over

time,  we  think  that  that sum is not  enough  because  the

political  associations' expenses have grown and  so  on,  we

will look at that.  This is the first time we have a Bill and

this  is  the first time that we have started something  like

that after examining all the examples of other countries, and

we  say,  let  us  give it a try.  It will  not  be  cast  in

concrete and stone.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>

With  the  experience that we have gained,  and  difficulties

that  we may experience, we will amend the Bill as time  goes

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question which two or three of our opposition

Members want to know is: why have this Bill now?  What is the

urgency?  I do not think there is any better time than having

this  Bill  now.  Consciousness has been raised on  political

funding,  soft  money, soft advertisement and  all  kinds  of

things  that have happened in other countries for years.   If

Members  remember the 1996 Presidential Election in  America,

it  has  long  past for years, and now the controversy  still

rages  on.  In our newspapers the last couple of weeks  since

the  Bill  was  made  known,  the newspapers  have  run  many

stories, and Singaporeans ought to know that there is such  a

problem  in  other countries.  In Singapore's case,  the  PAP

Government  always  thrives  on  its  ability  to  anticipate

problems.   We  are  not saying that the  problem  will  come

straightaway  tomorrow, in the next  election,  but  we  will

never know.  So let us have the law ready.  Today is as  good

as any other day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members say, do not bring back the history of 1959 or

do  not  talk about 1976 or 1988, these are real examples  of

how  foreign governments, whether it is a government directed

at  the top or by somebody at the top, or somebody else doing

the  job,  or a foreign intelligence organisation,  like  the

1976  case,  or just one diplomat in an embassy, these  cases

happened and they are real examples.  Do we need to wait  for

more  examples before we say, "Let us do something about it."

What  will Singaporeans say?  They will say, "There you  are,

you  are not doing your job. You should know that these  have

been  happening in other countries and yet you  are  slow  in

responding.   We thought we pay you a lot of money  to  do  a

good job."  So let us not fool ourselves. We do not know that

such  a  problem will come about.  Neither do we want such  a

problem to come about.  But there is no reason why we  should

not have a law like that today.  Because today is better than

never.  It is better than tomorrow.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang is worried about anonymous donations

and  now he cannot raise money because even people are afraid

to  give him 50 cents.  That fear is really not well founded.

If   Singaporeans  want  to  give  him  money,  what  is  the

difficulty  in  saying,  "I  am a  Singaporean.  This  is  my

identity card.  Please record it."  What is their worry?   It

is  a  simple  thing.  That procedure does not apply  to  the

Workers' Party or to the SDP only.  It applies to the PAP  as

well.   It  applies  to all the PAP's 83  branches.   When  I

briefed my GPC, they said this is going to cause problems for

them  to keep detailed records.  I said so be it, because  we

want this system to be established today.  The Party will set

up  the structure, a record keeping method, to make sure that

we  record.   If  the opposition is really  shorthanded,  and

cannot find people to help them understand the system, I have

asked  my  officials to come up with a simple guide  to  help

them to capture such records.  We hope that can be useful  to

them.   But  it  is  up  to them.  They can  keep  their  own

records.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Without any administrative

assistants how do we keep records?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The Member is paid $250 and $500 to

employ  a  secretarial  assistant and  legislative  assistant

respectively.  He can use that money.  If the Government were

to  give more money to the Member to employ an administrative

assistant  to  keep  records, we will only  give  it  to  two

opposition Members, one from the Workers' Party and the other

from  SPP, and the rest will go to the PAP Members.  He  will

then  say  this is unfair because the PAP has more  MPs.   We

will  settle  our own problems.  He settles his and  we  will

settle by our method.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is concerned that the list of donors is only

made  known  to  the PAP.  That would not be  the  case.   No

member of the public will have access to this record.  It  is

only  the officials.  He asked me whether the Ministers  will

see  the list of donors.  There is no need for us to  do  so.

The  purpose of this Bill is not to find out who  donated  to

the Workers' Party, SDP or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>

whoever,  or  even the PAP.  It is up to them to  decide  who

they  want  to receive the money from.  If we know who  their

donors  are,  so what?  How does that affect  them?   Are  we

going  to chase after their donors?  Is the PAP going to  run

after  their donors so that they will say, "Let us have  your

money instead of it going to the  Workers' Party?"  Let us be

realistic.   We  do  not need the people who  give  them  the

money.  We have other people who give us money.  We give  the

money  ourselves.  Most of the money that goes into the Party

for  election purposes comes from the PAP MPs and  Ministers.

We  paid  for our expenses.  Of course, there are also  other

well-wishers who help us.  So be it.   If others want to help

the opposition, fine! Go ahead.  But nobody is interested  in

knowing who their donors are and I do not think that we  need

to  make known the list of donors.  In fact, by making  known

the  list of donors, it will discourage people from donating.

They  may  say  that in that case they would  rather  not  be

known,  whether to be known to be supporting the PAP  or  the

Workers'  Party or the SPP. What for?  Why all  the  hassles?

Let  us  keep our money and enjoy ourselves.  So it is better

that  we  do  not disclose the list but only to keep  it  for

record purposes and use the records when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's long list of other points really just

boils  down  to one thing.  He thinks that this is  going  to

stifle  the  Workers' Party, and the failure of the  Workers'

Party  to get money and people is the fault of the PAP.   How

can  this  be  so?  He has led the party for 28  years  since

1972,  and  maybe even before that.  For 28  years  what  has

changed  in the Workers' Party?  Not very much, but  yet  the

world  has moved on.  It has changed a lot.  What has changed

in  the  Workers' Party?  People will know that  it  has  not

changed very much.  What has changed in the PAP?  A lot.  And

that  is  how  we  have  kept ourselves relevant  and  stayed

relevant.  That is why the people say, "That is the  Party  I

want to run Singapore, and we will continue to vote you,  not

the  party that cannot even get its acts together."  If  they

cannot even get their acts together, how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>

can  they get Singapore together?  Let us face it.  So do not

blame their problems on us.  If they cannot attract people to

join  them,  do not blame us.  If they cannot get  people  to

donate money to them, do not blame us either.  They only have

themselves to blame.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other litany of things is about digging up the

background.   Actually he dug up all the background  himself.

I  have  even  forgotten  about the case  in  1972  when  the

Workers'  Party tried to sue one of the PAP MPs and the  case

went  to  court and failed and that led to all  his  troubles

eventually.  That has got nothing to do with the PAP.  It  is

the  courts.  He believes in the court system.  He  took  the

case  to court and lost.  He challenged it and he still lost.

How  could  that  be our fault?  Whether it was  a  technical

reason or whatever it was, he lost.  If he believes that F.A.

Chua  had been biased, he should have taken up the case.   He

said  that  because  of  this case in 1972,  we  amended  the

Constitution  to  make  sure that  we  cannot  surrender  our

sovereignty to a foreign power or foreign country  without  a

referendum.   He  has forgotten that this change  came  about

because  the  Workers' Party, he himself in  particular,  was

calling  for  the re-merger of Singapore.  All right,  if  he

wants to do that, he must go through a referendum.  Supposing

it  happened that the Workers' Party came into power in  1972

or 1976 ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister giving way?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> No. Please sit down.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is not giving way. Resume your seat, Mr

Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, I will take it up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If his party were to come into power

and say we would re-join Malaysia, I think Singaporeans would

have a right to decide.  Therefore, we said, let us amend the

Constitution  to  provide for a referendum  should  Singapore

decide to surrender its sovereignty.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a Bill against political development? How could

it  be?   We  have  got political development.   But  if  the

opposition  have  not  progressed, that  is  not  our  fault.

Singaporeans have progressed.  Singaporeans are  more  vocal.

Singaporeans  have  supported  many  organisations,  set   up

websites,  etc.   And I think they have  also  grown  in  the

political   process.   But  we  cannot  allow   any   foreign

organisation, any foreign power, any foreign individuals,  to

come  and tell our organisations, Singaporeans, associations,

what  they  should do in order to propagate  their  interest.

That is not right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, may I seek

clarification from the Minister?  I would like to  know  from

the  Minister  what  is  the basis for the  $5,000  anonymous

donations  that are allowed in one financial year.   And  why

does the Minister prefer a capping of anonymous donations  to

$5,000  in  a financial year, unlike in some countries  where

they  cap  a single donation, thereby allowing small  donors?

By  doing  that,  is the Minister aware that he  is  actually

imposing a very tedious process on the opposition, especially

opposition  parties  which basically receive  small  sums  of

donations?   Is  that purposely making it difficult  for  the

opposition to keep accounts and to make it more difficult for

the  opposition to receive small sums, knowing that we depend

a  lot  on  small sum donors whereas I believe PAP would  not

need the money?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask my question as well. Will the

Minister  quote  chapter and verse of the statement  he  says

that  the Workers' Party made calling for a merger again with

Malaysia?   When  was  it  made,  where,  and  where  was  it

reported?  Could he let us have all that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam's memory is very

short.   I  think we should leave it to him  to  do  his  own

research and find the information for himself.  I am not here

to re-educate him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You tell me.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Low asked why we cap at $5,000.

Of course, we can choose the other way, like what the British

and  Americans do, cap at pound 50 or $50, which  means  that

they  can at most receive anonymous donations of $50 or less,

and they can receive a lot of such small donations.  Frankly,

I do not even know that the opposition receive a lot of small

donations  and  neither am I bothered about it.   But,  as  I

said,  for  the $5,000, it is just a macro number,  it  is  a

total sum, it makes it easier for them to receive small  sums

of  anonymous donations up to $5,000 without keeping  record.

If they have to keep record, and we make the limit at $50,  I

think  they will be very much troubled by it.  And if  $5,000

eventually  is  not enough, when we amend the Bill  the  next

time, we will look at it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. Is the

Minister aware that if it is more than $5,000 in a year,  any

single donation, even 50 cents, in order to keep that amount,

you  will  have  to  have records.  It is more  tedious  than

having,  let us say, more than $50, and you have  to  record.

Or we do not need to keep record at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If people give him 50 cents and he

finds it too tedious, ask them to give him $5 or $50, make it

a  big  figure,  so  that he does not have  to  keep  tedious

records.  But actually no record is required of any anonymous

donations up to $5,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> After $5,000?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> After $5,000, he will keep a record.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes, even 50 cents, I have to keep

a record, right?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Ask them to give him more money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly committed to a Committee of the whole

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 37 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, do you wish to speak in

Committee?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on certain specific

clauses in the Bill.  These are clauses 2, 7, 22, 28 and  29.

But  before I speak directly on these clauses, may I say that

I  am  concerned  because this Bill  is  on  a  subject  that

concerns  Singaporeans, not just political parties, not  just

political

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>

associations,  like  NGOs, but Singaporeans  generally.   And

that  is  why  I  wanted the Bill to be  moved  to  a  Select

Committee  so that Singaporeans may be heard as to what  they

think  about  the  Bill, not just the NGOs or  the  political

parties, but Singaporeans, what do they think about the Bill.

But  you have ruled that I cannot speak on the motion,  so  I

have  to  go on and speak about the clauses on which  I  have

objections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My objections stem from the fact that in Singapore,

elections  would  appear to be completely a  matter  for  the

Government,  whereas  in  other countries,  elections  are  a

matter  for the people and there is an independent  elections

body  which controls the conduct of elections and  makes  all

the  rules and regulations.  But that is not so in Singapore.

In Singapore, elections would appear to be the prerogative of

the Prime Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes. But I am coming to my section.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can I point out to you

that  when  we  are in Committee, you are  to  speak  on  the

clauses?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see that you are debating the

principles of the Bill which we have already discussed during

the  Second  Reading stage.  Can I ask you  to  confine  your

speech to the clauses which you have highlighted?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will try and explain why I am speaking

on these clauses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 2, the definition of "political

association",  in  subclause  (b)  of  that,  as  at  present

drafted,  is,  in my opinion, far too vague  and  appears  to

catch everyone.  The term "political association" which is to

be  applied to other than registered political parties should

be  spelt  out with greater certainty.  The Bill, as  it  now

stands, reads:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "political associations" means -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an organisation . whose objects or activities

relate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore and which is

declared by the Minister, by order in the Gazette,  to  be  a

political association for the purposes of this Act;".

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

The  operative words are "whose objects or activities  relate

wholly or mainly to politics".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, politics is something that concerns the general

populace.   That is politics.  So if there is an organisation

that  wishes to speak on something which concerns the general

populace  or  even  a  section of the community,  it  can  be

described as being a political association.  We take the case

of  the women's organisation, AWARE, which is concerned  with

the  rights of women and violence to women. Does it become  a

political  association?   Of course,  their  concern  can  be

called  political because it affects a large section  of  the

community, the women in Singapore.  For that reason, is it to

be  considered a political association?  What about NGOs?  We

do  not have many NGOs in Singapore.  But we have one or  two

now,  concerned  not with promoting any particular  political

issue  or political object, but have, as its aims and object,

the  promotion of greater democracy, greater transparency and

greater  accountability for the society.  Is that  political?

Of  course,  it  is, if you want.  But is it an  organisation

that  is  attempting  to influence any particular  policy  or

object  for Singapore when it is simply concerned with giving

people a greater share in decision making?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the Open Singapore Centre (OSC) of which I am the

Chairman.   We  have said that our aim is simply  to  promote

transparency   and   accountability   through   openness   in

Singapore.  Is that politics?  Of course, one can say yes, it

is political.  But that is something that concerns the entire

populace  in  Singapore.  So why should that  be  declared  a

political association?  It is not concerned with promoting  a

particular  issue  or  calling  for  a  particular  piece  of

legislation  in  this country.  All it  seeks  to  do  is  to

promote  openness,  awareness and  accountability  among  the

public.   The other objection is that the power is  given  to

the Minister to declare which organisation is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>

political association for the purposes of this Act.   I  have

no  doubt  that  the Open Singapore Centre will  be  declared

political, if not the other organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My recommendation to the Government is that that

decision  as  to  whether  an  organisation  is  a  political

association or not should not be left to the Minister.  We do

not  have  any  Elections Commissioner.  We do not  have  any

Election  Commission. It therefore should be left to somebody

completely  outside the Government, someone independent,  and

who  is  appointed for this purpose in consultation with  the

other  political parties in Singapore so that he  may,  after

listening  to  the  organisation itself  or  other  political

parties  as  to  what  they think, then  decide  whether  the

organisation is a political association for the  purposes  of

this  Bill.   That is important if we are going to  encourage

the  setting  up  of NGOs in Singapore for the  good  of  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NGOs exist in almost every other country. But they are

a  rare  commodity in Singapore.  And from what I can see  of

the UK Bill, which is before Parliament, it does not prohibit

NGOs  from  receiving  funds from  overseas.   It  is  common

knowledge  that  a number of the NGOs in the  United  Kingdom

have  links with other NGOs overseas and they get funds.   So

what  is  the objection to allowing organisations which  have

got  nothing  to do with promoting any particular  policy  in

Singapore from functioning in Singapore for the good  of  the

people  and  receiving money, if necessary, from  like-minded

organisations outside Singapore?  For example, if we  have  a

human rights organisation, I would love to see one here, what

is   wrong  with  the  human  rights  organisation  in  other

countries saying, "Well, we got to help you to carry out your

work.   We  will  give you some money."  What is  wrong  with

that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause on the same theme is the appointment of

the  Registrar.   This is provided in clause 7  which  reads,

"The Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint  a

public officer to be the Registrar of Political Donations for

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>

purposes of this Act, and such number of Assistant Registrars

of Political Donations as he considers necessary."  By clause

29  of this Bill, the Registrar is given sweeping powers.  By

clause 29, the Registrar may call upon any person to produce,

for  his  inspection, any books, documents or  other  records

relating  to  the  income and expenditure  of  the  political

association as the Registrar may reasonably require.  He  may

also  call  upon them to furnish him or any person authorised

by  him  with  all information, explanation relating  to  the

income and expenditure of any political association.  And  by

sub-clause (3) of this clause, he is empowered to  enter  any

premises  occupied  by  the  political  association  at   any

reasonable  time, even if he is not required to give  notice,

and to inspect any books, documents or other records relating

to the income and expenditure of the political association.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I make a few points on a

particular clause?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am referring to clause 21 of

the  Bill.  This clause requires multiple small donations  to

political  associations to be reported to the Registrar.   It

seems  to me that even if these people are permissible donors

and  if  they donate more than $10,000 a year, in  aggregate,

the  donor  has to report to the Registrar and give  all  the

necessary details.  May I know what is the rationale of  this

clause  in the Bill?  And does this clause violate the rights

of   Singaporeans  in  making  donations?   Is   it   not   a

discrimination against making donations to political parties?

You  can  donate  whatever amount you want  to  the  National

Kidney Foundation, or anywhere.  But why is it that when  you

are    making   multiple   small   donations   to   political

associations, you are required under the Bill  to  report  to

the  Registrar and the punishment for failing  to  report  is

quite hefty?  Why is it so?  What is the rationale?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam was not listening

when   I   was   explaining   the   meaning   of   "political

associations",  and  what would be  covered  and  under  what

circumstances  would  the  Minister  make  a  declaration  or

gazette  that they would be political associations.   I  have

explained  in great detail the circumstances, and I  gave  an

example.   On his question about AWARE, I gave an example  in

fact and said that if AWARE depends on the money to help  the

battered wives or children in the Family Service Centre,  for

example,  so be it, if it is not campaigning for a particular

cause to change the law or the Government, and therefore they

can   accept   such   foreign  donations.    If   any   other

organisation, say, an NGO, wants to receive money from  like-minded  people or organisation overseas, and that purpose  is

to  influence the political issues in Singapore, then it says

that  these  are impermissible sources if such organisations,

or NGOs, are gazetted as a political association.  Right now,

I  have no intention to gazette any organisation.  But if  he

says   his  OSC  is  going  to  get  money  from  like-minded

organisations overseas to support his political cause, then I

will have to take a look at it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wong, are you giving way?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Go ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why does the Minister consider the

promotion   of   greater   democracy,   accountability    and

transparency  to be something undesirable for Singapore  when

it  has  got  nothing  to  do with promoting  any  particular

legislation or policy for this country?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Nowhere have I said in my speech just

now  that the promotion of democracy or political protest  in

Singapore by Singaporean is undesirable.  Nowhere have I said

that.   But if a particular organisation is going to  stretch

its  hands out and ask for a donation from a so-called "like-minded  organisation" overseas to support his cause, I  would

think we should, and every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>

Singaporean  should,  examine  the  motive  as  to  why  that

organisation wants to give the money.  The political  process

in  Singapore is for Singaporeans to decide.  It is  not  for

foreigners to come here and help us champion our  cause.   If

he has reasons  to receive foreign money, then he should also

have  the motive questioned.  Right now, there is no question

that I am going to gazette any organisation.  But if there is

cause to do so, then we would do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about the powers of the Registrar.

The powers are there just in case the Registrar is obstructed

from doing his work in examining the books, he would have  to

go  into the premises to examine the books.  If such books or

accounts  are not made available, then he must find  ways  to

get access to such records and there is no reason for anybody

to  fear.  If that organisation has not done anything  wrong,

then  that  organisation should have no  fear.   There  is  a

Chinese  saying  that  says, "if he  has  not  done  anything

harmful, then even a knock on the door in the middle  of  the

night should not frighten him".  But in Singapore, it is such

a  small place.  If we do not want people to do it, do not do

it  because  one  day, he will be found out.  There  is  also

another  Chinese saying, "ruo yao ren bu zhi, chu fei  ji  mo

wei" which means if we do not want people to know, do not  do

it.   If he thinks he has done something wrong, then he  will

have to account for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Can I seek a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think he has enough of the time.

Let me finish answering Mr Low Thia Khiang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked why we want to have reports on donors who

make multiple donations that amount to $10,000.  I thought  I

have  explained  that  in  my statement.   If  an  individual

donates less than $10,000, there is no need for the donor  to

write  to  the  Registrar to declare.  If that donor  donates

$10,000, there is also no need for him to declare because the

political association or party would have declared.   But  if

he donates multiple sums

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>

aggregating $10,000, then we want him to declare because that

is a counter evasion measure that the Registrar would want to

know   to   keep   track   of  non-reporting   by   political

associations.  So, it is just a purpose of counter checking.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I have your permission to clarify my

objection to clause 29 in the Bill?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, what do you wish to clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is simply this. Should not that power

also  be  given to an independent person and not to a  public

official?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, on a point of order. I would

like  to  point  out that Mr Jeyaretnam was given  more  than

adequate  time to speak up on the clauses.  He has made  full

use  of  his  time and, in fact, Mr Chairman, you  have  just

ruled  that he had exceeded his time and he was told  to  sit

down, but he is using this device to seek clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have further

clarification from the Minister on clause 21?   The  Minister

says  that  it  might be a disguise because  you  might  make

multiple  donations.  But what is wrong  with  a  permissible

donor  making  donations amounting to more  than  $10,000  to

individual organisations?  Why should you put the onus on the

permissible  donor to report to the Registrar?  What  is  the

rationale for doing that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> There is nothing wrong for that

individual  to make multiple donations amounting to  $10,000.

But  if he gives it to one organisation and that organisation

would  not be able in any way to report it, the donor  should

report it too as a counter evasion measure.  But if he  makes

small  multiple donations that amount to $10,000 to different

organisations, then it does not amount to more  than  $10,000

for  each  of the organisations and, therefore, he  does  not

need to make a declaration to the Registrar.

<div align="center"><b>THE SPEAKERS' CORNER</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I sent in my

notice  claiming  the right I said I wish  to  speak  on  the

pretence that the Speakers' Corner is proof that free

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>

speech,  freedom of expression, exists in Singapore. That  is

my  subject of this afternoon's talk, not just simply on  the

Speakers'  Corner,  but  the pretence  that  because  we  are

setting up a Speakers' Corner, there is freedom of expression

in Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.40 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said more than once, in Singapore, there is a

lot of pretence by the Government about what Singapore is,  a

pretence that things are not what they really are and that is

what  concerns me.  I have been asked by a number  of  people

why  am  I  so dismissive of the proposed plan to  set  up  a

Speakers' Corner.  Well-meaning people have said to  me,  "Mr

Jeyaretnam,  why  are you so dismissive? It  is  at  least  a

beginning.  Why don't you welcome a beginning of the  freedom

of  expression?"  I have no objection to that if it is hailed

as  a  beginning of the freedom of expression  in  Singapore.

But it is not.  What it has been hailed is that it is another

instance  of  giving greater opportunities in a freedom  that

already exists in Singapore when the freedom does not  exist.

Freedom of expression is not simply limited to be able to say

something.  An integral part of it is the right  of  assembly

and  that is not going to be afforded by the Speakers' Corner

being set up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only just recently seen thousands upon thousands of

women  marching  in  Washington to protest  against  the  gun

violence  in  that  country.  Is that possible  in  Singapore

today?  Could people turn out to protest against something in

the  society?  That is real freedom of expression.   We  have

also seen people protesting, coming out to speak against  the

shooting  in the United States by police officers of innocent

people  whom  they suspected of having committed an  offence.

There  were two incidents and it provoked an outcry.  But  in

Singapore, would that be possible?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the recent case of a shooting by two police

officers  of a man who they said was armed with an iron  rod.

The Party

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>

issued  a  press  release, calling upon the  two  men  to  be

charged  with  murder  and  saying  that  if  they  had   any

justification,  they could prove the justification  in  court

and  they  will  be  acquitted.  We  said  that  because  the

Commander  of  the division to which the two police  officers

were  attached  immediately  raised  justification  for   the

shooting  of  the man.  The Straits Times, being  a  faithful

servant  of the Government, did not publish the press release

as  we  put  it.   We called for the man to be  charged  with

murder.  It is covered up in some nebulous words, "calls  for

more action than a Coroner's inquiry".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us not pretend that there is freedom of

expression in Singapore, that people are allowed the  freedom

to speak up wherever and whenever they wish to speak up, that

the  people  have the freedom to assemble peaceably  to  show

their dissatisfaction or discontent over some policy or  over

any  act  of  the  Government.  All we  have,  now  that  the

Government proposes, is setting up of this one space in  Hong

Lim Green and they make so much noise about setting it up and

holding it up as an example of how free Singapore is, how  it

allows  its  citizens  to speak up and  this  is  what  I  am

protesting about because the whole thing is a pretence.  When

one  comes to look at the conditions that are attached,  even

to this little symbolism, one can immediately see that is not

freedom of expression that is being allowed to the speaker at

the  Speakers' Corner.  The Minister, in answering questions,

produced a table of the conditions that applied at Hyde  Park

and in Singapore.  If one looks at that  -  he spelled it out

-  one can clearly see that the proposed plan continues  with

the  curtailment on the freedom of expression  in  Singapore.

It  does not, in any way, expand that freedom, or open up the

society in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, under the proposed plan, the speaker may not

speak  on anything religious in nature.  And that, again,  is

an   all-catching  phrase,  vague  and  nebulous.   What   is

"anything religious in nature"?  What is wrong, may I ask, if

somebody who is a devoted Christian or Muslim stands  up  and

speaks on the virtues of his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>

religion?   Would he not be allowed to speak?  But then,  are

you  not unduly restricting his freedom to speak on something

which   so  vitally  concerns  the  individual,  the  people,

religion?  What are you afraid of?  Of course, it is  another

thing  to  call  upon  people to attack  members  of  another

religion.   What  is wrong with him or her  speaking  on  the

virtues,  the values, of the religion itself, so that  others

may  come to understand the religion better?  But that is not

allowed.   So  you  are cutting down on  a  major  aspect  of

freedom of expression.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it goes on to say that whoever speaks shall not say

anything  that  may have the potential to cause  feelings  of

enmity, etc, between races or religious groups.   This  again

is  as vague as one can get.  What is meant by "anything that

may have the potential to cause feelings of enmity"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take an instance. If a speaker from a minority

community  stands up and says that his language is neglected;

there  should be greater use of his language, because  it  is

one   of  the  official  languages  in  Singapore,  that  the

Government  should encourage greater use of his  language  in

official correspondence or in Government offices, would  that

be  considered as having the potential to cause  feelings  of

enmity  between  races?   Do  you consider  that  may  arouse

feelings of hostility in another community?  Again,  you  are

cutting  down  a  major  portion  of  the  freedom   of   the

individual.   Every community, every group, should  have  the

freedom to speak about matters that concern them.  And if you

are  not going to allow them to speak because you are worried

that  it  may have the potential to cause feelings of enmity,

then  you  are telling him to shut up.  You cannot  speak  on

this subject at all.  So, where is the freedom of expression?

It  is  all this pretence that upsets me and which  I  cannot

accept.   Let  us be honest with ourselves for once  and  say

that,  "No,  we are not saying that this means that  we  have

complete freedom of expression in Singapore.  This is just  a

little beginning that we are really testing to see whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>

we  can have freedom of expression in Singapore or not."   If

the  Government takes that line, then I have no quarrel  with

it,  but it is the pretence.  That is what I wanted to  speak

about this afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is this question about registration. I have

heard  the Minister but I am still not satisfied of the  need

for registration.  All that is needed is for the man or woman

to  produce the identity card to show the officer that he  or

she  is  a  Singapore citizen, and then be allowed to  speak.

There  is  no need for any records to be kept.  There  is  no

need  to ensure that there are no policemen there.  There  is

no  objection  to  have a police officer there  to  see  that

persons  who  speak  are the persons  who  have  shown  their

identity   cards  and  proved  themselves  to  be   Singapore

citizens.  I cannot see the need for their particulars to  be

recorded and kept, not just for a day, as I asked whether  it

would  be destroyed.  It is going to be kept for five  years.

Why?   And  I  have tried to get an answer from the  Minister

whether these records will be released to anyone.  He has not

answered  the  question.   All we get  are  evasive  answers,

attempting  to laugh away the question, that we  have  better

things to do than to keep records and to give to others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has asked whether the speeches would be

recorded.   Again, it is laughed at.  And yet, the  Minister,

when  I asked him questions at the last sitting, says we have

to  keep the records because we need to look at them later if

there is any complaint to determine what the speaker has said

is  against the law or not.  Well, there you have it.   There

is an admission that the speech will be recorded.  Otherwise,

how can you determine what he has said is against the law  or

not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are all these curbs, all these restrictions,

against  persons  speaking out freely without  fear.   He  is

still  subjected  to  this fear.  In Singapore,  he  will  be

subjected  to the fear that his particulars will be  released

to the ISD, which I asked the Minister and he has not replied

on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>

that.   And Singaporeans know that the ISD has the  power  to

detain him or her for 28 days.  Are they going to come up and

speak when they know that their names may be released to  the

ISD and they might be called up and questioned?  So where  is

the freedom of expression in Singapore?  It is a continuation

of  what we have had for the last 40 years since the PAP took

over,  complete curtailment of the freedom of  expression  in

Singapore.   This  Speakers' Corner  does  not  open  up  the

freedom at all.  It is just a pretence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Your time is up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, can I be allowed to say

a little bit more?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> There is no provision for you to

speak.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, the NCMP moved the Adjournment Motion on  three

grounds.  First, he is dismissive about the Speakers' Corner.

Secondly,  he thought that the Speakers' Corner  is  a  great

pretence,  because  of the conditions  tied  down.   Thirdly,

there  is a need for registration, and the question  why  the

speaker's name and speech need to be recorded.  I thought  he

would   come   up   with   something   really   big,   really

philosophical,  but he was merely playing  the  old  records.

Sir, I rise to oppose the motion made in the name of  Mr J  B

Jeyaretnam.  The Constitution of Singapore provides  for  the

right  to freedom of speech and expression.  We have no  need

for  a  Speakers'  Corner  to  prove  that  this  freedom  of

expression exists in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speakers' Corner must be seen in perspective - it

is no more than an additional venue for Singaporeans to speak

up  on  issues of concern to them and it is free of licensing

requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speakers' Corner is set up in response to calls for

an  outdoor venue where people can speak on any subject  they

want to without prior application for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>

a licence.  It is an exemption from the Public Entertainments

Act.  There is a big difference between having to apply for a

licence  and  just putting your name down  and  a  few  other

details   before   proceeding   to   deliver   your   speech.

Registration  does  not  require  approval;  it  is  just   a

notification, and a check for eligibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NCMP talks about the absence of free speech in

Singapore.  We have always had free speech.  Indeed, no other

city  in  Asia has the same ready access to local and foreign

news wires, magazines, television and radio channels and  the

Internet for our citizens to communicate their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the NCMP's information, there are 72 news

organisations  or  agencies  in  Singapore,  and   there  are

currently  37 cable TV channels in Singapore, of  which  more

than  three-quarters are foreign channels like the  CNN,  BBC

and  CNBC,  transmitted through SCV, some of which  had  even

featured the hon. Member in their programmes.  In addition to

these,  there  are  more  than 5,000 publications,  including

Time,  The Economist and AWSJ.  Sir, Singapore has become  an

international media and financial centre precisely because we

allow a free flow of information within our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, including the Opposition MPs, have many

channels  of communications.  Opposition Members can  publish

party  newsletters,  write books and host Internet  websites.

In  effect, you can say and publish anything you want  within

the  boundaries  of law, and this applies to  the   Speakers'

Corner.  There is no pretence about it.  These are facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans have used all these openings to their

fullest.  We understand that a new generation of Singaporeans

have  shown  that they want to be heard and  that  they  have

views  and  suggestions to contribute.  We are  listening  to

them.   So  it  is  evident in the way they articulate  their

views  robustly  in  frequent letters and complaints  to  the

domestic  newspapers.  A study of the forum  pages  of  local

newspapers shows that readers have been much more forthcoming

in expressing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>

their opinions on a range of issues over the past few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member cares to look into the letters that had

appeared  in The Straits Times' Forum page for the  last  one

week  commenting on Kendrick Tan Cheng Kang's case, he  would

understand what I meant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A writer, named Benjie Pedro, whose name sounds a bit

foreign  to  us, had this to write about the Forum  page,  in

November last year.  Let me quote what he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At the risk of sounding too patronising, I cannot help

but admire the way this country allows issues to be discussed

and debated through the ST Forum.  With an increasingly vocal

and  demanding citizenry, it could be anything  from  "social

ills"  to  inefficient service to national issues.  The  best

part  is,  positive response and concrete corrective  actions

are  actually  taken by the relevant parties (or authorities)

most of the time in order to improve the situation.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He concluded:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'People here actually do have a voice, and are being

heard, just by the mere power of the pen.  Singaporeans  have

a  lot to be truly thankful for.  In another place I know too

well,  the  easiest way to get things done is by knowing  the

"right  people"  who could wield influence.   Otherwise,  you

might  need  to amass a million signatures for a petition  or

hold  a massive rally [as proposed by the Member himself]  to

be heard.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

Is   the  Member's  proposal  the  only  civilised,  correct,

democratic way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the print media, there are also

regular feedback programmes on TV and an increasingly popular

medium  today  is  the talk-back sessions on  radio.   During

these sessions, there is a free flow of comments and vigorous

arguments  on  the most current incidents.   And  it  is  not

confined only to local TV stations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, many Singaporeans have been forthcoming in

expressing   their  views  on  Government   policies,   often

critical,  in  live  news and current affairs  programmes  on

foreign   channels.    Academics,  Members   of   Parliament,

community leaders and financial analysts and even the man-on-the-street have been featured prominently.  Finally, we  have

the  Internet.   I do not think there is a  need  for  me  to

elaborate more about this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in no society is there absolute

freedom  of expression or speech.  Singapore is no exception.

The Constitution specifically provides for restrictions to be

imposed  on freedom of speech in areas such as incitement  of

any  offence, contempt of court, defamation and public order.

This  is the point which the Member fails to understand.   He

asks,  "What  is  wrong in allowing a person  to  go  to  the

Speakers'  Corner and express the virtue of their religion  - if  these people were ready?"  I believe that similar avenues

are available.  If the Member is keen to know about Islam  he

can  go  to the mosque and listen to the speech about  Islam.

If  somebody is keen to know about Buddhism, he can go to the

temple and listen to it.  The point is, there is a grey  line

between  preaching the virtue of one religion and criticising

and comparing it with the others.  We must not forget that  a

religious  speech  made in an open area  had,  in  the  past,

triggered  a riot that had cost Singapore a lot in  terms  of

its  religious  harmony.  I think we have talked  about  this

when  we debated on the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill

and  I  believe that the Member is very familiar  about  this

argument.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been sound reasons why we do not allow public

meetings outdoors without a permit.  It was not very long ago

that we had this problem.  Mr Wong Kan Seng, in his speech in

Parliament  on  25th April this year, has  already  explained

that despite its own reservations on its potential for public

disorder,  Government decided that the idea  of  a  Speakers'

Corner  is  worth trying out in view of the  support  it  has

attracted  from  the  civil  society  groups.   To  reinforce

Government's  sincerity in trying this idea out, considerable

latitude would be exercised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calls for a Speakers' Corner have arisen because the

world  is  changing and the limits are wider.  So  Government

has responded and shown that ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The time allowed for the

debate has expired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Thirty-nine minutes

past Five o'clock pm and the Debate having continued for half

an  hour,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker adjourned  the  House  without

Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

<div align="center"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>TAXIS IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Information  Technology   whether   his

Ministry has any plan to address the shortage of taxis in the

Central Business District during peak hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for taxi service varies according to location

and  time  of day. There is no shortage of taxis in  the  CBD

during the morning peak period, as many taxis carry commuters

into  the  CBD.  The waiting time for taxis in  the  CBD  is,

however,  longer  during the evening  peak  period  as  fewer

commuters enter the CBD.  Taxi drivers are also less  willing

to  drive  an  empty cab into the CBD incurring ERP  charges.

According  to LTA's data, the average waiting time for  taxis

at  taxi  stands  within the CBD is 0.5  minutes  during  the

morning  peak and 16 minutes during the evening peak.  During

off-peak  periods,  the  supply of  taxis  usually  outstrips

demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this situation, the question is how does one meet

the demand for taxi service at different times of the day and

at  different  locations in the most  optimal  and  efficient

manner.   From a business angle, it is not optimal  for  taxi

companies to size their fleet based on peak-period demand, as

they would be having excess capacity during off-peak periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution lies in differential pricing to balance

supply  and  demand.   The  Government  has  deregulated  the

setting  of  taxi fares in September 1998 for  this  purpose.

With  deregulated taxi fares, taxi companies  are  given  the

full  flexibility to adjust their fares in response to demand

patterns and changes in ERP pricing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of taxi shortage in the CBD is best

addressed by the taxi companies, through fare adjustments  so

that taxi drivers will have the necessary incentives to enter

the  CBD  during the evening peak period.  Market pricing  of

taxi services is the most effective way to balance supply and

demand throughout the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If commuters in the CBD find the wait for a taxi during

peak periods to be too long, they can choose from a range  of

taxi  booking services.  These charge a premium according  to

the  service level offered, including response time  and  the

certainty in obtaining a taxi.
