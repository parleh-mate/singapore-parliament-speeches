<div align="center"><b>MASS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM FOR SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Feasibility study)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Communications what progress has been made in  the

consideration given to the need for a  mass  rapid

transit system for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in February last year, at

the  request  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the

International   Bank   for   Reconstruction    and

Development,  otherwise known as the  World  Bank,

sent an evaluation





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



mission  to  review the studies conducted  by  the

State  and City Planning Office for an urban  mass

rapid  transit system in Singapore.  It  concluded

that   more   detailed   studies   were   required

especially  to consider, firstly, the consequences

of  having  or  not  having a mass  rapid  transit

system;  and secondly, the selection of a favoured

system  after considering the various alternatives

available.   The   World  Bank   Mission   further

recommended that we seek technical assistance from

the   United  Nations  Development  Programme   to

finance the cost of the proposed study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the concurrence of the Ministries of

Communications, Finance and National  Development,

the terms of references for the study were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



finalised   and  an  application  for   assistance

submitted   to  the  United  Nations   Development

Programme in January this year. The matter is  now

under   consideration  by  them  and  should   the

assistance requested for be granted, the study  is

expected to commence as from January next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong may recall that the

Minister for Finance, in his budget statement made

in  this  House  on  8th March,  in  referring  to

Development   proposals  under  the  Ministry   of

Communications, stated as follows  --see  Hansard,

cols. 582-3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Mass Transit Planning Unit to be set up

for further investigation into the feasibility  of

a   mass   rapid  transit  system  for  Singapore,

requires  a  sum of $500,000. The  study  will  be

carried   out   with  U.N.D.P.   (United   Nations

Development Programme) assistance.'



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Should the study

commence  in  January next year, can the  Minister

inform the House how long it will take before  the

study is completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it was indicated by the

World Bank Mission that it may take anything  from

15 to 18 months.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD REPAIRING AND STREET LIGHTING</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

Teong Eng Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To ask the Minister for Law and National

Development (a) if immediate steps will  be  taken

to  repair  Jalan  Ulu Sembawang  which  is  badly

damaged;  and (b) when work will commence  (i)  to

repair  Lorong Kasemek; and (ii) to install street

lights  at  Chong  Sin Road near  the  Huang  Long

Community Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ng Yeow Chong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I have been asked by Mr

Teong Eng Siong to raise Question No. 2.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, immediate

steps  will  not  be  taken to  repair  Jalan  Ulu

Sembawang. The maintenance or making up of private

roads is the responsibility of owners of the  land

fronting  the  roads.  But  the  Urban  and  Rural

Services Committee can help f the land-owner gives

permission  for  the  work and the  constituency's

Citizens'  Consultative Committee recommends  that

the  work  be  done and the cost paid  from  funds

allocated to the constituency. Jalan Ulu Sembawang

is  a  private road stretching from Sembawang Road

to  Mandai Road. A request has been received  from

the Sembawang Citizens' Consultative Committee  to

make  up  a portion of the road by gotong  royong.

Materials  alone  will  cost  about  $64,000.  The

proposal will be tabled for consideration  of  the

U.R.S.C, at its next meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorong Kasemek is also a private road and a

similar  request  has been made by  the  Sembawang

C.C.C, to make up this road. The U.R.S.C, cannot

even  consider  the request until permission  from

the landowners has been obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The installation of street lights at Chong Sin

Road from Huang Long Community Centre to Jalan Ulu

Sembawang  will  commence in about  a  fortnight's

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

Ch'ng Jit Koon -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To ask the Minister for Law and National

Development  when  work  will  commence   on   the

construction of the proposed new bus bay at  Tiong

Bahru   Road  between  Seng  Poh  Road  and  Jalan

Membina.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho Kah Leong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, I have been asked by Mr

Ch'ng Jit Koon to raise question No. 3.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, construction work

on  the  proposed  bus  bay at  Tiong  Bahru  Road

between  Seng  Fob  Road and  Jalan  Membina  will

commence in May 1971. Funds for this purpose  have

been provided in the budget for the next financial

year.

<div align="center"><b>(Alternative site)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Develop-merit if  Shin  Min  Public

School will be affected by developments in the Sin

Ming   Road   area,  and  whether  and   when   an

alternative site will be provided for the School.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Shin Min Public

School  will  not  be  affected  by  the  proposed

development in the Sin Ming Road area where  about

42  acres  of  land  are being  developed  by  the

Housing  and Development Board into an  industrial

estate for the resettlement of motor workshops and

garages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Sir, can the Minister

give details of the development of the area?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, about 269 motor workshops and

garages  which are affected by the public projects

in  various parts of the city will be resettled in

this  estate.  In addition, about  500  three-room

improved flats, 32 shops with living quarters, and

about   five  eating  houses  will  be  built.   I

understand that the Registrar of Vehicles is  also

constructing a vehicle testing centre  within  the

estate.

<div align="center"><b>(Publication of Research Division's findings)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Finance if he is now in a position to publish  the

findings  of the Research Division of his Ministry

into  the  activities of chit fund companies,  and

whether  he  now  feels that  the  subject  merits

legislation and, if not, why not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is not intended to publish the results  of

the   study   made  by  my  Ministry.  Chit   fund

legislation in countries such as Ceylon, India and

Taiwan  is  being examined with a view to  similar

legislation  being introduced here to control  the

activities  and operations of chit fund companies.

No new chit fund companies are being allowed to be

incorporated for the time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I would

like to know why it is not intended to publish the

findings  of  the Ministry into the activities  of

chit fund companies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I

said  that  it  was not intended  to  publish  the

results of the study made by my Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member wants to know the

reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, this is a confidential

study and it should not be made public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Can the Minister of

State  for Finance indicate how much public  funds

were spent on the confidential study?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the study

was  conducted  by  the  Research  Section  of  my

Ministry  and, apart from the normal  salaries  of

the  officers,  no  additional public  funds  were

involved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In that case, can the Minister

of State make available the confidential report to

those Members who wish to have a look at it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> It all depends on what the

Member for Punggol meant by "those members". If he

meant members of the public, the answer is no. But



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think he meant Members of

Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, Sir, Members of

Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will be

glad  to  show the results of the study to Members

of  Parliament who would like to have  a  look  at

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Finance, in replying to me in January

1970  [Vol.  29  No. 7 dated 27-1-70,  col.  372],

stated  that he would make the findings  available

to  the  public.  I  am just  wondering  what  has

changed the mind of the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Member

for  Jalan Kayu has misunderstood the Minister for

Finance.  I have the text of the Minister's  reply

to  the House. If the Member would like to have  a

look at the study, he is welcome to it.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD ACCIDENTS INVOLVING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DRUNKEN DRIVERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs  what  was  the  frequency  of  road

accidents  involving  drunken  drivers,  and   the

number  of  those  injured  and  killed  in   such

accidents, for the year ending 31st January, 1971.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, traffic

accidents involving drunken drivers have been  few

and far between.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ending 31st January, 1971, there

were only 21 of such cases. The frequency of these

accidents  thus varies from one to  two  accidents

per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these 21 accidents, three drivers were

seriously  injured in three cases. In  nine  other

cases, the passengers of the cars driven by  these

drivers  under the influence of alcohol  sustained

slight  injuries. As for the remaining nine cases,

no one was injured at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven drivers were prosecuted in court,

resulting in six of them being convicted and  five

acquitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining cases were not brought to court

owing to insufficient evidence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, can the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Home Affairs  tell

the   House   how   these  drunken   drivers   are

identified?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these drivers have

their blood and urine tested for alcohol, and they

are  further tested to find out how competent they

are still to drive at that stage. The analysis  is

undertaken   by   the  Chemistry   Department   in

accordance  with  the  Kozelka  and  Hine   method

through a process of steam distillation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, can the Parliamentary

Secretary inform the House whether, if the testing

methods  are improved, we could catch more drunken

drivers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> I can certainly assure the Member of

that, Sir.

accidents  involving pedestrians within 100  yards

of  a pedestrian crossing or overhead bridge,  and

the number of those seriously injured or killed in

such  accidents for the year ending 31st  January,

1971.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Traffic Police do not

maintain   statistics  specifically  relating   to

traffic  accidents involving pedestrians  and  are

therefore  unable to state the number of accidents

involving  pedestrians  within  100  metres  of  a

pedestrian crossing or overhead bridge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are records to show that for the

year  ending 31st January, 1971, a total of 38,139

accidents   have  been  reported  in   which   152

pedestrians   were  killed  and  1,053   seriously

injured.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>

crossing or overhead bridge. The motorist  in  one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the last budget session, I raised a query regarding this same subhead. I suggested that drivers of Government vehicles should take every care to exercise their responsibility on the road, and that we should make every effort to ensure that Government

vehicles  set  an example of social discipline  on

the  road.  The Minister for Law gave an assurance

that  circulars  would be sent out  to  Government

departments to make sure that drivers  make  every

effort  to  follow road regulations. The  Minister

agreed  that drivers of Government vehicles should

set an example in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find now that there is a supplementary request

being  made for $70,000 to be used as compensation

for  damage  caused by Government  vehicles  which

were   involved   in  accidents.   It   would   be

interesting  for the House to know in what  manner

the   $20,000  originally  earmarked  under   this

subhead and this $73,000 is being spent. Does this

indicate  that, for the past year since  the  last

budget,  there has been an increase in the  number

of  accidents  involving Government vehicles,  the

fault  for  which accidents must be attributed  to

the  drivers  of these vehicles? Or does  it  mean

that  much  more  is  being  spent  this  year  on

compensation  for  accidents than  for  any  other

equal length of time in previous years? If one  or

both of these contentions are correct, one has  to

renew  the appeal to the Minister to take stronger

measures   to  see  that  drivers  of   Government

vehicles  exercise greater care and responsibility

on  the road. Perhaps the sending out of circulars

is not enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity of

commending  the Ministry of Defence on the  action

taken to see that its own drivers exercise greater

responsibility.  But  from my  own  experience,  I

personally  have found no discernible  improvement

in  the  driving standard of drivers of Government

vehicles since the time the Minister for Law  gave

us the assurance that he believed that Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



vehicles  should  set  a  good  example   in

Singapore.  Incidentally, it would be  interesting

to know to what extent compensation has to be paid

for  damage  caused in accidents involving  police

vehicles.  Once I had the experience of  seeing  a

police   vehicle   being   driven   in   a    most

irresponsible   way.  The  driver  concerned   was

attempting to write certain notes in his  notebook

while driving the vehicle at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, if the amount of compensation in

respect  of accident claims is rising, how  is  it

that only $25,000 has been earmarked for this same

subhead in the coming financial year?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I  rise  to  ask  the  Minister  for   some

information  and  clarification  on   the   sudden

increase  in the provision for payment  of  claims

against  the  Government arising out of  accidents

involving Government vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate for 1969 - 70, a period of 15

months, was $20,000; for 1970 - 71, a period of 12

months,  $20,000 was earmarked: and this year,  as

the Member for Katong has pointed out, $25,000 has

been    asked    for.   Therefore,   iii    normal

circumstances,  an estimate of  $20,000  per  year

would have been deemed sufficient to meet accident

claims.  The year 1970 - 71 has actually cost  the

Government,    including    the    request     for

Supplementary  Estimates, about  $90,000  to  meet

accident  claims  involving  Government  vehicles.

This  sum,  in my opinion, is abnormally  high.  I

would therefore like to seek from the Minister the

following details:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The total number of accidents involving

Government vehicles

for the period under review;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The breakdown of the above-mentioned total,

Government department by department;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The number of successful claims against the

Government and the total amount of money paid out

in relation thereto;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The number of unsuccessful claims against the

Government;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) What steps, as the Member for Katong has

asked,  are  being  taken  by  the  Government  to

minimise  the accident rate of Government vehicles

involved in accidents?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with all the

points  raised by my two colleagues,  the  Members

for  Katong  and Telok Blangah, I do not  think  I

have  any ground left to cover. Anyway, would  the

Minister for Law and National Development care  to

give further information to my questions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has just now sought

clarification  on  the number of accident  claims,

successful  or  otherwise, and also the  breakdown

figures  of  the  various  Government  departments

involved.  I  would, however, like to  raise  some

further questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)	 How much was paid to each of the successful

claims?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What was the number of accidents in

which   each   of   the  various   Government

departments was involved?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Are there still any outstanding claims

to be settled?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If there are, how many are there and

what  amount of compensation has  been  asked

for?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I too share the sentiments expressed

by  my  two  colleagues in hoping that  Government

would  take  immediate steps to  ensure  that  all

Government  drivers take extra caution  when  they

are on the road. As the Member for Katong has just

mentioned, they should set an example in  ensuring

public road safety when they are on the road.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me put

the  record  right. The Ministry  of  Law  or  the

Ministry of National Development is not in  charge

of   all  Government  drivers  or  all  Government

vehicles.  It  is  when  a Government  vehicle  is

involved  in an accident and there is a claim  for

damage  that the Attorney-General steps in as  the

lawyer  representing the Government. So  whilst  I

agree with the Members that perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



the standard of driving of Government vehicles can

be  improved, what the Attorney-General can do  to

help  is  to  see that circulars are  sent  round.

These  circulars have been sent round. Drivers  of

Government  vehicles have also  been  educated  on

road  safety and have been instructed to  be  more

careful in their driving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for prosecution, there is provision for the

Permanent Secretary of the respective Ministry  to

consider,  on  the advice of the Attorney-General,

whether  disciplinary action is called for against

the  driver of the Government vehicle involved  in

an  accident. It is, however, the function of  the

Police   to  determine  whether  the  driver   has

committed  a traffic offence. Where the  Attorney-

General is satisfied that the accident is  due  to

the  negligence or recklessness of the driver,  he

will  instruct the Police to prosecute the  driver

concerned. There may, however, be instances  where

prosecution   is   not   justified    but    other

instructions have been contravened, in which  case

disciplinary action is instituted by the Permanent

Secretary concerned on the advice of the Attorney-

General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will agree that the expenditure that

would be involved in any accident under this  vote

is  not easily predictable. The greater the number

of  accidents  involved, the larger  will  be  the

amount  of expenditure. In the 1970 - 71 financial

year,  the  sum  of $20,000 provided  has  clearly

proved  inadequate, and another $70,000 is  needed

to  meet  expenditure  of $88,475.24.  To  compare

other  years,  in 1967, $13,200 was  incurred;  in 1968, $19,360.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969 - 70 549,739.75 - nearly $50,000 - but

still  not  near  $90,000. For the financial  year

1971  - 72, two Members have pointed out that only

$25,000 has been approved. I would like to  inform

them that we have asked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



for  much  more,  but that is all  we  have  been

given,  so that in the coming year they will  have

to hear me again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of vehicles in Singapore is increasing

every  year;  so  also are the  traffic  jams.  In

consequence,   the   number   of   accidents   has

increased;   so  has  the  number   of   accidents

involving  Government  vehicles.  The  Member  for

Katong is not satisfied with the assurance I  gave

him  last year. He seems to be more satisfied with

what has been done in the Ministry of Defence.  Am

I correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with what the

Ministry  has done since the time the Minister  of

Defence   answered  my  question   in   Parliament

regarding  the  care that military drivers  should

exercise. May I make that correction, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am glad to hear from the Member for

Katong that he has been reassured by what has been

happening in the Ministry of Defence. But now that

Singapore  has taken over control of the  military

establishments, vehicles of the Army come into the

fold  of the Attorney-General's Chambers in regard

to expenditure on accidents. I have mentioned just

now  that it is the Attorney-General who  acts  as

paymaster in respect of these claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of accidents for the financial year

1970-71  was  875  as compared with  618  for  the

previous  financial year. So there has  definitely

been  an  increase. The break-down  of  these  875

accidents is interesting:

<pre>

  Ministry of Defence                  605



  Public Health Division               111



  Ministry of Health                    30



  Public Works Department               19



  Prisons Department                    16



  Police (in which the Member

    of Katong is interested)            16



  Postmaster-General                    11



  Social Welfare Department              4



  Primary Production

    Department                           5



  Prime Minister's Office                4

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



I  can  go on, but the rest do not exceed  half  a

dozen  accidents  -  Car Parks,  Chief  Surveyor's

Department, or even the Fire Brigade which had two

accidents. All in all, there were 875 accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that the Ministry of Defence

drivers  are careless, but the figures are  there.

As  the British pull out, we have to have more and

more   vehicles,  more  and  more   drivers;   and

therefore more and more accidents occur. Hence, we

are asking for this supplementary vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the number of persons involved in these 875

accidents,  10  were killed and  119  injured.  Of

these  875  claims, 224 were successfully  settled

out  of court. A total of 615 cases, including  15

police cases, were unsuccessful, involving a total

sum   of   $88,475.24.  The  police   cases   cost

$7,584.54.  A total of 36 cases, involving  claims

amounting to about $35,000, are still pending.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no further information for Members, but I

understand that the Member for Katong is a  member

of the National Safety First Council!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> The Member for Katong is not a

member of the National Safety First Council. He is

only an adviser!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, arising out of the answers

given,  I just want further clarification  if  the

Minister would care to answer me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If I have the information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would

appear  that  the  Ministry  of  Defence  and  the

Ministry  of  Health,  in  particular,  have   the

highest number of accidents. In view of this,  are

these  two Ministries taking steps to ensure  that

their drivers undergo a road safety course?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wonder whether the Minister for Law

and  National  Development will consider  insuring

all  Government  vehicles against  accidents,  and

whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



any  feasibility  study  has  been  made  in  this

respect.  I believe that this will take some  load

off the Attorney-General's Chambers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> $1

million insurance!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I cannot speak for either the

Minister  for Health or the Minister  of  Defence,

but  I  am  sure they will take into consideration

the  Member's suggestion. Speaking for myself,  my

Ministry    will   take   his   suggestion    into

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> What about insurance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> We will consider it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $70,000 for Head 0107 ordered to stand

part  of  the  Third  Supplementary  Estimates  of

Expenditure  for  the financial  year  1st  April,

1970, to 31st March, 1971.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0701 -



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to learn that the Ministry of

Education  has been able to fill a greater  number

of  its  vacant posts than was anticipated by  the

Ministry. This amendment is moved in order to seek

further  clarification  on  the  posts  that   the

Ministry has been able to fill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the Ministry should fill not

only  the  vacancies in the promotion  grades  but

also the many vacancies in the lower grades of the

teaching  service.  Last  year  the  estimate  for

Substitute Relief Teachers alone was $1.3  million

in  the General Education Department. In answering

a supplementary question on relief teachers last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



week,  the  Minister of State for  Education  said

that   the  phenomenon  of  relief  teachers  will

continue to exist so long as teachers continue  to

take maternity leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a teacher for many years, and

maternity leave is not a new concept. It has  been

there all along. The reason for the employment  of

relief  teachers  now is due to  the  shortage  of

teachers  and  not  that teachers  take  maternity

leave. The position obtaining then was that  every

school had a quota of teachers over and above  the

number   that   would  be  needed  for   all   the

classrooms. If any teacher went on long  leave  or

maternity   leave,  there  would   be   sufficient

qualified  teachers to stand in. Because  of  this

quota  of  teachers in each school,  I  deem  this

number to be vacancies in the school as well.  The

question is: will the Ministry attempt to fill not

only the vacant posts in the promotion grades, but

also the shortage of teachers in schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I too seek

information  similar  to that  asked  for  by  the

Member for Telok Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is being asked to approve a sum of

slightly  over  half  a million  dollars  for  the

payment  of personal emoluments. I find  that  the

explanatory  note in the Command  Paper  on  these

supplementary estimates is not clear. Therefore, I

will  be  grateful if the Minister  for  Education

will  indicate the number of vacant posts  in  the

last financial year, i.e., ending this month;  how

many have been filled, and what are the categories

of  vacancies that have been filled. Further,  are

there  still vacancies to be filled? If  so,  what

are they, and in what categories?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah is of the

opinion  that  not only the vacant  posts  in  the

higher categories should be filled, but also those

in  the lower categories should be filled as well.

I take it that he means the administrative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



service as well as the teaching service.  On

that  note, Sir, I reserve some further questions,

pending   the   answers  from  the  Minister   for

Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I heartily

agree  with  the  Member for  Telok  Blangah  that

maternity  leave  is not a new phenomenon.  But  I

would like to remind him that in the clarification

given  by  the Minister of State for Education  to

the  supplementary question as to when the  system

of  relief  teachers was instituted, I  think  the

Minister  of State replied, "Ever since  maternity

leave  was  granted." There is nothing wrong  with

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not able to give in detail the

categories  of vacancies which have  been  filled.

But,  generally speaking, we have vacancies  right

through the service - from principals to teachers,

to   specialists,  to  specialist   teachers,   to

administrative officers, to inspectors of schools,

to  inspectors, and even higher clerical officers.

We  have  been trying our best to fill  them  with

persons with the requisite qualifications.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the reply by the Minister of

State  at  the sitting on the 8th of March,  there

were,   in  the  teaching  service  alone,   1,116

vacancies,  because  we  then  had  1,116   relief

teachers. The shortage is of such a magnitude  not

because  no  attempt has been made by  either  the

Public  Service  Commission  or  the  Ministry  of

Education to fill these vacancies wherever it can,

but  simply because we do not have the people with

the  requisite qualifications. I will be very glad

indeed if either Member can indicate where we will

be  able to get the type of people we want to fill

these vacancies, not only in the higher grades but

also in the lower grades in the teaching service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clarification requested by the Member for

Punggol  on the request for an additional $524,000

for  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  respect  of

personal  emoluments can be given very  simply  by

repeating what is stated here. I do not  think  it

can be explained in a simpler



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



form.  The  explanation is that we  were  able  to

recruit   more   teachers,   more   administrative

officers, more specialist inspectors than we first

expected when the budget was formulated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have clarified some of the doubts that

have existed in the minds of Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister  and I agree that there is a considerable

number  of vacancies in the teaching service.  But

the question I am posing now is that, as far as  I

know, this shortage has been in existence for  the

last three years. Year after year the Ministry  of

Education  has been coming here and asking  for  a

vote  for relief teachers. Sir, my quarrel is  not

with  the relief teachers but with the unqualified

relief   teachers  -  people  who  go   into   the

classrooms  and later come out. I  would  like  to

know  from the Minister what attempts the Ministry

has  made  to  recruit teachers for  the  teaching

service  in the last three years - the  number  of

times  recruitment took place and  the  number  of

teachers in the last three years who went  through

a  regular  teacher training course  to  fill  the

vacancies  that  we  have had in  the  last  three

years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Member and I have the

same point of view. But he is probably holding one

end  of the stick and I am holding the other  end.

What I am trying to say here is that we know there

are  large numbers of vacancies and attempts  have

been  made  and  are  being  made  to  fill  these

vacancies   with   people   with   the   requisite

qualifications.  We  have been  advertising  these

vacancies at the beginning of every year. However,

only two-thirds of those who were offered jobs  in

the  Ministry  of  Education  accepted  them.  The

number  of people who apply for vacancies  in  the

Ministry  of Education is not equal to the  number

of vacant posts. So there you are. People with the

requisite  qualifications are not  there.  Members

should  concede that the Ministry of Education  is

not  so stupid as not to fill up the establishment

completely. We have the desire to fill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



these  vacancies; we are given the money voted  by

Members to fill these posts. But because there are

not  enough persons to fill them, that is  why  we

are left with a shortage of teachers. As a result,

we  have  to  resort to the method  of  recruiting

relief teachers who have probably not had the same

kind of training that we would wish them to have.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

I  must say well done to the Ministry of Education

for  being able to fill most of its vacant  posts.

However,  the Minister did ask Members to  suggest

ways  and means of assisting the Ministry  in  the

recruitment of the various categories of officers,

whether   they   be  relief  teachers,   teachers,

specialist inspectors and others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would imagine that when these vacancies

arise the Ministry would make representation  -  I

stand  to  be  corrected - to the  Public  Service

Commission  which, I believe,  is  the  body  that

appoints such officers into the Government service

after  a  due  process  of  interviews.  In   that

respect, surely the Ministry of Education will  be

able to get more of such officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to relief teachers, I understand that

at one time the Teachers' Training College used to

conduct part-time courses for trainee teachers but

that some years later this scheme was shelved with

the  introduction of a full-time teacher  training

scheme. I have lately heard that the T.T.C, might

probably  revive  the part-time  teacher  training

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the recruitment of relief

teachers, will the Ministry of Education not  look

into   the   possibility  of  organising  teaching

courses  for the relief teachers or teachers-to-be

at  the  T.T.C, so that in the next few years  the

Ministry   of   Education  will  have   a   larger

complement of staff?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

can I just make an observation on the reply by the

Minister  for  Education to the Member  for  Telok

Blangah on the plight of the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



of  Education in attracting a sufficient number of

applicants  for  recruitment  into  the  education

service?  I  wonder  whether  the  Minister,   his

Minister  of  State and others are now  more  than

convinced that the salary scales for teachers  are

not so attractive as to attract enough applicants.

Would  they not think that in order to solve  this

problem  the Government should seriously  consider

revising    the   salary   scales   for   teachers

immediately?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would hate

to   think  that  teachers  in  the  service   are

attracted only by the salary scales and that there

are  no  other incentives. I would like to believe

that  a large proportion of the teachers are there

because  they feel that they have the  skill,  the

ability and the interest in imparting knowledge to

young people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question raised by the Member for

Moulmein,  I  think  he is not  unaware  that  the

Teachers  Union has been holding discussions  with

officials  of  the  Ministry of Education  on  the

restructuring - I would like to emphasise the word

"restructuring" -of the salary scales and  not  an

increase  of  salary.  I  think  there  was   some

misunderstanding  when,  on   the   eve   of   his

departure, my predecessor made some mention  about

the  revision of salary scales. What  he  actually

meant  was  that the Ministry was  taking  up  the

suggestion  by  the  Harvey  Commission  when   it

mentioned  that  the  salary  structure   in   the

Ministry of Education is of a very complex  nature

and  that  there  are a lot of  anomalies  in  the

salary    structure   of   teachers.   What    was

particularly  in  my predecessor's  mind  was  the

reference to post allowances for teachers who  are

promoted.  What  he  meant  was  that  all   these

anomalies should be ironed out. We can easily iron

out  these  anomalies  and  incorporate  the  post

allowance  or  part of the post allowance  into  a

higher  scale  for principals and  those  who  are

promoted  to a higher grade. On going through  the

representations from the Teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



Union, the Ministry is in agreement with them.  It

has  come  to the conclusion that the 16 different

salary  scales  for the teachers and,  I  believe,

about  nine  different scales for  the  principals

should   be  thoroughly  considered  and  a   less

complicated    salary    structure    substituted.

Moreover, in considering the restructuring of  the

salary scales proposed by the Teachers Union,  the

Ministry  must  also take into consideration  that

any   adjustment  upward  is  going  to  cost  the

taxpayers a lot of money. A rough calculation  was

made  that if each teacher were to be given a  $10

increment, it would cost the taxpayers  more  than

$2  million. Before we make any recommendation for

the  spending  of such a large sum of  money,  the

problem  must be thoroughly studied  to  see  that

what  we are doing is correct. I hope that answers

the question raised by the Member for Moulmein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Punggol again, the

number  of  vacancies is known to the Ministry  of

Education   and  the  Public  Service  Commission.

Advertisements are put out at the appropriate time

and applications are received and processed.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the number of applications for

posts in the Ministry of Education is not equal to

the number of vacancies. Even if you take everyone

who  applies, you will still be short of teachers.

That is why we must have relief teachers. I think,

as  an  ex-teacher, the Member for  Punggol  would

prefer  to have fully qualified teachers in  three

years  from  now  rather than  teachers  who  have

received only part-time teacher training.  But  we

are reconsidering the question whether, in view of

the  prevailing  circumstances, it  would  not  be

better for us to take half a loaf than to expect a

full  loaf when it is not forthcoming, because  we

do  not  have enough people interested in teaching

to  join the service. This is not because  of  the

pay.  As  I say, a good teacher does not  have  to

depend on his pay for his incentive. He has  other

things which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



induce  him to join the teaching service. We  will

consider  again carefully whether it is worth  our

while,  in view of the grave shortage of teachers,

to  reintroduce  part-time teacher training.  This

shortage  is not only in the teaching service  and

in   every  Government  department,  but  also  in

industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave

your  indulgence  to interrupt again  because  the

Minister  for  Education,  in  his  reply  to   my

observation,  has  mentioned the Teachers  Unions'

pay  negotiations.  I thought I  might  take  this

opportunity  to  mention also one or  two  matters

which  I wanted to say in the Committee of  Supply

when  I  move the amendment to reduce the Minister

for  Education's pay by $10. Since he has  already

dealt  with  many  aspects of the  matter  that  I

originally intended to raise later, perhaps I will

take this opportunity to add one or two points  on

the   question   of  the  Teachers   Unions'   pay

negotiations. I am glad to hear from the  Minister

that  his Ministry intends to go one step  further

than  its  original intention to remove  the  post

allowance of the promotion posts and substitute it

with promotion scales, and that it intends also to

look  into the question of grievances, the 16  pay

scales  of  teachers and so forth. I do appreciate

that it requires time to do an exercise like this.

But  I think sufficient time has been given to the

Ministry  and  to  the Treasury to  consider  this

matter.  I can only express the hope, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that  the matter be considered  without  any

further  delay as too much time has been taken  on

this  matter, in  fact,  the  then  Minister  for

Education  made an announcement on 1st  September,

1970,  that  he was going to invite  the  Teachers

Unions  to discuss pay negotiations. Some time  in

October  last  year,  the  Ministry  of  Education

invited  the Teachers Unions to put forward  their

proposals. Today is the 16th of March. It is about

six  months since we put forward our proposals and

the  Ministry is still studying them. It  is  fair

enough  that  it  needs some  time  to  study  the

proposals, but there seems to be no end to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



time  required for it. The teachers are  beginning

to lose confidence in the whole exercise. They are

wondering what it is all about. Is this a kind  of

joke?  Their  expectations have been raised  as  a

result    of   the   then   Education   Minister's

announcement about pay negotiations.  Since  then,

nearly seven months have elapsed and there is  not

even  a squeak from the Ministry to indicate  what

their reactions are to our proposals. Some of  our

proposals  were put forward ten years ago.  Surely

the  Ministry  does not require so  much  time  to

study  them.  Perhaps it is not possible  for  the

Ministry  at this juncture to give its answers  or

reactions to all of them. That is fair enough. But

surely the Ministry should be in a position to say

something  on some of the proposals. What  is  the

cause  for  this delay? This situation is  causing

unhappiness   in  the  teaching  profession.   The

Ministry has given them the hope that negotiations

are  forthcoming, but if it has to take more  than

six  months to study the proposals, and there does

not  seem to be an indication when this period  of

study is going to end, I think you can quite fully

appreciate the kind of frustration that is felt by

the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the Minister's reply that time is

required to study the very complex problems and  I

agree  that  there are very complex problems.  But

six months should be more than sufficient for this

and  I  hope  we should be hearing soon  from  the

Ministry regarding what its counter proposals are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for  Education has mentioned just now that he will

not   consider  the  reintroduction  of  part-time

training   courses   at  the  Teachers'   Training

College.   Perhaps  I  would  like  to  draw   his

attention  to  the  fact  that  out  of  so   many

thousands  of  teachers in  the  teaching  service

today,   I  can  safely  say  that  a  very   high

percentage  of them somehow or other  did  undergo

part-time training. For that matter, you have  got

the  normal  trained  and the certificate  trained

teachers,  and  also  graduates  who,   on   their

recruitment into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



the  teaching  service, also  have  to  undergo  a

training course of not less than a year to  get  a

diploma  known as the Diploma in Education.  I  am

still  of  the view that the Ministry of Education

should   seriously  look  into  the  question   of

reintroducing   the  part-time  teacher   training

courses  with  a  view  to obtaining  the  maximum

benefit that we are going to pay for, because  the

Minister  has  just now mentioned  that  in  three

years' time we will probably be able to get a full

complement of trained teachers. I do not  see  eye

to  eye with his projections. I think three  years

is  still  insufficient time. I have  seen  relief

teachers  coming in between to take classes  on  a

daily-paid   basis.  I  have  seen  many   schools

affected  by  it. What do the school children  get

out  of it? This is a problem that has been  posed

and  we  should  not just wave it aside  and  say,

"Look,  for the time being, let us carry  on  with

the relief teachers until such time as we can have

better   qualified  teachers  from  the  Teachers'

Training   College   or   other   teacher-training

institutions.  The  present  status  quo  must  be

maintained."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Punggol has completely  misunderstood

what  I  said just now. I was just thinking  aloud

when  I debated whether we should have a full loaf

or  make full use of half a loaf. He is under  the

impression that the Ministry of Education  is  not

considering  part-time teacher  training.  Towards

the  end of my reply, I said that we are seriously

considering  whether  it is  worth  our  while  to

reintroduce part-time teacher training so that the

half-loaf that we have will be fully utilised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I say that it is worth our while

to reintroduce part-time teacher training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am seriously considering it.

The  Member's impression was that the Ministry  of

Education was not considering it. That is  totally

false.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein, knowing the workings of

government, should consider himself very fortunate

indeed,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



because  I  can  say now that within  a  six-month

period - the six months have not expired - we have

already  made our recommendations to the  Ministry

of Finance for restructuring the salary scales and

not a revision of salaries. Sir, the restructuring

of  salary scales is a complicated piece  of  work

and  we have done it within six months. The Member

for   Moulmein   should  consider  himself   lucky

because,  knowing the workings of  government,  he

should  know  that there are some instances  where

even in six years' time nothing is heard, not even

a squeak!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the recommendations that the Ministry

of  Education has made to the Ministry of Finance,

I am afraid they are confidential.

(*The  same  amendment also stood in the name  of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to compliment the Parks and

Trees  Division  on their contribution  in  making

Singapore a garden city. However, may I hasten  to

add  a  word  of  caution. While the  planting  of

shrubs,  trees and greenery along the major  roads

is  important, the routine work of maintaining and

preserving  existing  greenery  is  also  just  as

important.  I  have noticed some areas  where  the

shrubs  need trimming and the grass needs cutting.

I  am  beginning to wonder if the Department  have

sufficient  manpower  to  maintain  the  increased

number of parks and gardens that they have to look

after  as a result of the recent campaign to  make

Singapore a garden city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now say a few words about the instant

trees  that  the Parks and Trees Division  planted

recently all over the city. Sir, the angsana trees

planted  even  around Parliament  House  are  very

hardy  and  take root fast and we had  good  green

trees  overnight. In their enthusiasm,  the  Parks

and  Trees Division planted trees along roadsides,

monsoon  drains and pedestrian paths and sometimes

too  close  to  one  another for  people  to  walk

through.  Sir, I am told these angsana  trees  are

not only hardy, but they also grow to be very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



large trees and will soon damage the footpaths and

drains, thereby causing additional expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can understand the need for road-widening

and removal of some roundabouts, but what I cannot

understand  is  why the Parks and  Trees  Division

beautify  roundabouts and road-dividers which  are

scheduled  to be removed soon by the Public  Works

Department  of  the Ministry of Law  and  National

Development. I know of two places where  this  has

happened,  e.g.. Braddell Circus and  Shenton  Way

Circus.  Shortly  after they were  converted  into

good gardens, the Roads Division came and dug them

up and made them into traffic-light junctions.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I understand

that this sum is required to enable the Parks  and

Trees   Division  to  undertake   a   more   rapid

development of parks and open spaces. Sir, I would

be  grateful if the Minister could enlighten  this

House on the number of parks and open spaces  that

were created in the last financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like to make this observation. In

the housing estates that I visited, I noticed that

there  were  some trees and shrubs and  children's

playgrounds in some of the open spaces. But  there

is  still room for development in a lot of housing

estates with regard to open spaces and parks.  For

example,  a  huge circus in the Toa Payoh  Housing

Estate  is  just simply bare. A lot of  money  has

been  spent in planting some grass, but I see only

one  or  two  small parks for children in  between

blocks  of flats. If the Parks and Trees  Division

would care to look into the possibility of turning

such open spaces into parks, the residents in  the

Housing  Board Estates would be able to have  some

recreational   facilities  in  the   evenings   or

weekends and not, as someone has pointed out, have

to  contend  with blocks and blocks  of  concrete,

like  a concrete jungle. People do not know  their

neighbours. As a result of having little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



or   no   contact,  their  relationship   is   not

strengthened. This is probably the price  we  have

to  pay for not looking into this aspect of public

housing.  There is no doubt that the provision  of

open  spaces and parks is being looked  into,  but

there  should  be  co-ordination  in  this  matter

between the Urban Renewal Development Division and

the  Housing  and  Development Board.  Whenever  a

housing  estate is put up, they should  look  into

the  question of providing such amenities for  the

residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first give

the  details of the projects for which this  extra

money  was  needed.  An  amount  of  $450,000  was

provided in the previous estimate. In early  1970,

what  is called the "Garden City Action Committee"

was   established  in  the  Ministry  of  Law  and

National  Development to plan  and  co-ordinate  a

programme  of  work  to spruce up  Singapore,  the

immediate  objective being to make Singapore  more

beautiful for the Heads of State Conference  which

was  held here last January. A substantial  number

of projects were planned. This amount of money was

found  to  be  insufficient. Hence a supplementary

provision  of  $914,900.  The  break-down  is   as

follows:



<pre>

  Development of park

    outside the Istana                 $118,000

I am sure the Member for Telok Blangah

has not failed to get his maintenance.



<pre>

  Training of 200 gardeners            $120,000

    fountains for use at the

    Botanic Gardens                    $ 12,000

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Member for Telok Blangah complimented

the Parks and Trees Division, he cautioned that we

should  not forget the maintenance. The answer  is

that we have not. Instructions have been given not

to  plant unless we can maintain. We would  rather

have  no  shrubs  and flowers than have  half-dead

wilting  shrubs. In fact, fleets of  lorries  with

water  go out when there is a dry spell.  They  do

watering in most places, sometimes at least  twice

a  day.  As for planting along road sides, monsoon

drains   and  sometimes  along  foot-paths,   some

mistakes  have  been  made. I  need  not  go  into

details,  but  whenever these are  made  they  are

rectified.  For instance, along Orchard  Road.  As

everyone knows, the angsana trees were planted too

close  to  one  another, but they  were  purposely

planted  that  way to accelerate the programme  of

planting  in making Singapore greener for  January

197l. As a net result, Orchard Road looked much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



greener during that month. But the trees were  not

wasted. As soon as they grow too big, they will be

pulled  out and planted in other places.  Mistakes

have  been  made. Where you have a nice foot-path,

the  next day you find angsana trees in the middle

of  it. I myself have had cause to complain.  Some

of  these trees have been pulled out, others  left

alone  to  take  root in order that  they  may  be

planted  elsewhere. Sometimes ridiculous  mistakes

have been made. For example, trees planted next to

a flat, or next to a retaining wall. They have had

to  be  pulled  out, otherwise the retaining  wall

would come down. But these are mistakes which have

been  made  and instructions have been given  that

there  should be closer supervision  of  the  work

done. Most of the work is done by contractors. One

of  the contracts is to plant a tree on both sides

of  the  road  every  50  yards.  Unless  properly

supervised,  all they do is to measure  50  yards,

dig a hole, fill it with fertilizer and then plant

a tree in it. They do not care whether the spot at

which  they  plant is next to a lamppost,  a  fire

hydrant or under another tree! The net result  was

that we finally had to issue a series of do's  and

don'ts.  "Do  plant trees along  unshaded  areas."

"Don't plant trees under lamp-post or under  other

trees." I think these mistakes will continue to be

made,  and perhaps other mistakes will have to  be

corrected.  They have even planted trees  along  a

rubber  estate where the rubber trees are  already

in  a  row and are properly shaded! When I queried

them, I was told that this was a nursery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the roundabouts, the one at Braddell

Circus  was  planted with small trees  and  shrubs

more  than  three years ago. At that time  it  was

known that the roundabout would have to disappear,

and  traffic  lights to control the  left  traffic

lanes  instituted. But instead  of  waiting  three

years  and leaving the roundabout with just grass,

it  was  decided to plant. Now that the roundabout

has  been converted into a traffic light junction,

the  shrubs  and  trees,  wherever  they  can   be

recovered, have been planted elsewhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the roundabout at Shenton Way, Shenton Way

is  an  important  place.  Important  people  pass

there.  Instead of leaving it bare, we decided  to

plant, even if it was for a short while.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can deal with the Member for Punggol who

has suddenly become interested in Housing and

Development Board flats -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am interested in parks!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I assume there are some in Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Private ones.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Private housing estates.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members' complaints, in general, are that

there  is not enough grass and greenery. Ten years

ago  we  were not looking for parks and trees  and

playgrounds: we were then looking for houses.  Now

that   the  houses  have  come,  the  demand   for

amenities has increased. Members of Parliament now

move  around  in cars, whereas before  they  moved

around on bicycles! But they should not blame  the

Parks and Trees Division for any lack of amenities

in  Housing  Board estates. Blame the Housing  and

Development  Board if they like, but  let  me  say

that  a  special  effort has been mounted  in  Toa

Payoh to plant more and more trees and shrubs.  In

fact, quite a bit of ground has been reserved  for

a  park.  There  are  some  concrete  floors  laid

between various blocks of flats, and these will be

broken  up  and trees planted, as in the  case  of

recreation  parks where cars are parked.  I  think

that in the course of this year Toa Payoh will  be

a better place to live in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, my Ministry is aware of the

problems brought up by both Members. We are  aware

of  our mistakes, and we hope to correct them.  We

will do our best to satisfy the demands of Members

and their constituents.
