<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Amber in Mountbatten Constituency has

been serviced by the Kampong Sanitation Service (as

distinct  from  the  Public Cleansing  Service  for

built-up  areas)  which consists of  house-to-house

refuse collection done daily by labourers from  the

Public  Health  Division. Also, the existing  earth

drains are being maintained by workers of the

Anti-Mosquito  Department, and weekly oiling  of  drains

and  pools in the Kampong are being carried out  to

keep public health nuisances to a minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of litter around houses is a personal

responsibility of individual householders  who  are

expected   to   co-operate  by  maintaining   their

compounds and surroundings in a tidy state.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> First Supplementary Estimates of

Expenditure for 1965 in Paper Cmd. 23 of 1965. The

summary is at page 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure

in respect of which amendments stand on the Order

Paper Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0305 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0305

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no one in Singapore will hazard

the  proposition  that we ought to  open  the  door

wider  to immigration. Anyone who suggests so ought

to  have his head examined. We have a population of

two million, quite vigorously reproductive, and  to

suggest a liberal attitude to immigration would  be

to  court suicide for our growing economy  and  our

ability  to  provide  employment  for  our   fellow

citizens.  But  there is an aspect  of  immigration

which   is   humanitarian  and  which   should   be

considered  in its proper perspective.  It  is  not

uncommon  for  a number of our citizens  to  go  to

India.  They  used to go to China  too,  before  it

became Communist, to visit their parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had it put to me, why should our citizens

who  desire  to  bring their aged parents  to  this

island  be prevented from doing so? It would  be  a

humanitarian  act to allow them to do so.  Besides,

it would not put them in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



possibly  invidious position of appearing  to  have

double loyalty. Sir, there need be no apprehensions

about  immigration on this score. The  parents  who

come  in will not be economically active, nor would

they  be a liability to the State. They would  only

come  here to live out the rest of their days  with

their  sons or daughters who can support  them.  To

enable  them  to do so would be a humanitarian  act

which   we  can  afford.  Nobody's  job   will   be

endangered,  and all that we would be doing  is  to

have   the  parents  living  with  their  children.

Besides,  this  will strengthen the  roots  of  our

citizens of immigrant stock in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Immigration Department has

been  singularly unsympathetic to appeals from  our

citizens  to let their aged parents come  in.  That

they  are  such  good  gate-keepers  is  worthy  of

commendation.  They do a good job for  us.  But  in

respect  of  the aged parents of citizens  of  this

country,  the  Department should  relent  a  little

because  it is humanitarian. And what is  far  more

important in Singapore, where we have taken a  very

grim  and realistic attitude to life, is this, that

their  presence here would not constitute a  threat

to  the opportunities in the economic field to  the

citizens  of  this  country,  nor  would  they   be

claimants of social welfare benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, in many cases, money is sent by our

citizens  here  to their parents in their  homeland

regularly.  This practice would cease,  of  course,

should their parents be permitted to migrate  here.

Consequently, the question of allowing the  parents

of  our  citizens  to  enter this  country  becomes

attractive in this light.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were a harmful immigration - harmful in the

sense that the economic opportunities of our people

would be threatened - then we would be the first to

raise  a hue and cry against the idea. But we  have

given  it sufficient thought and have come  to  the

conclusion that it would be a harmless immigration;

in fact, there would be certain beneficial effects.

These beneficial effects could be that firmer roots

would be driven into this soil of our citizens  who

at present out of love and affection for their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



parents,  return home periodically. And they  would

not need to do so once their parents were here. And

what  is  more,  there  would  be  a  decrease   in

remittances abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has not taken us much imagination to see

that  we  could be kinder to our citizens  in  this

regard  without  losing  anything  at  all  in  the

process.  The gains have been mentioned. This  much

we  could do for our citizens in this country.  Our

history is not made yet; it is still in the process

of  being  made - the change from a colony  to  an

independent State. The immigration laws devised  to

protect  the  economic welfare  of  the  people  in

Singapore have caused some amputations in the lives

of  our people which could be amended with a little

humanity. And this is significant because  it  will

not cost anything at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope a little rethinking will be done about

this  matter  and  the  barriers  lifted  in  these

special  cases. The immigration suggested will  not

amount  to a large influx, and I think in the  last

analysis we can afford a little humanity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I fully sympathise with what has been

said  by  the Member for Bras Basah concerning  the

admission of aged parents of Singapore citizens. We

have   laid   down  certain  rules  on  which   the

Controller of Immigration would be able  to  arrive

at  a  decision as to whether applications will  be

permitted or not. I agree with him that persons of.

60  years  of  age and over will  not  in  any  way

compete  with Singapore citizens for jobs or  other

forms of employment. But, at the same time, it must

also  he remembered that it has been our experience

that persons who have sought the admission of their

aged  parents,  either from India  or  China,  have

eventually found themselves unable to support their

growing  families. The Ministry of  Social  Affairs

thus  finds  its  list  of supplicants  for  public

assistance has been growing longer and longer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe - I am quite sure that all Members

subscribe  to  this belief - that  the  concept  of

filial  piety is very strong among us, particularly

among  the  Chinese. Therefore, cases  have  always

been dealt with sympathetically whenever we receive

applications for the admission of aged parents.  In

fact,  I would inform the House that the number  of

applications  for aged parents to be  permitted  to

enter  Singapore  was most during the  years  1958,

1959  and  1960. But since then there  has  been  a

gradual  decline.  In  a  way,  this  reflects  the

greater  stability of the population of  Singapore,

that  fewer people now look towards the origins  of

their birth-place, and many more have more or  less

regarded  Singapore  as their  homeland  and  their

loyalties  are  to this country. Hence  an

inward-looking attitude has developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1958, there were about 800 odd applications.

In  1959, there were slightly over 950 applications

for  admission  of aged parents. I  must  say  that

these  applications will, of course, be  considered

only  if  they  come from Singapore citizens.

Non-citizens  do  not have the right either  under  our

citizenship  laws  or  under  immigration  laws  to

sponsor the admission of their parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the number of admissions has

considerably reduced. In 1960 it was just  slightly

over  400.  In 1961, it was down to 260.  In  1964,

when  immigration was not under my control but  had

moved over to the Central Government of Malaysia in

Kuala  Lumpur, it was just about 100 odd. All  this

goes  to  prove that all those citizens  who  would

have  their  aged parents come into  Singapore  had

already taken the opportunity in 1958 and 1959, and

that  many  more  Singaporeans today  are  born  in

Singapore.  There  was a time  when  a  substantial

number  of  our citizens were born overseas.  Their

parents were overseas. Consequently, they had their

ties overseas, but many of these ties have now been

broken because, as time goes by, their parents pass

away.  Therefore, it is not quite true that we  now

have  as large a stream of remittances sent  abroad

to sustain aged parents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one other point which we have to

make,  and that is, Singapore citizens who wish  to

seek  the  admission  of their  parents  must  also

satisfy  the  Controller that their parents  depend

upon  them  solely for support and  sustenance.  If

they  have  other relatives, brothers,  sisters  or

other members of the family overseas, who are  also

supporting their parents, then, of course, there is

no  logical reason at all why entry permits  should

be  given to such people. Nevertheless, in spite of

all  these rules which we have drafted to guide the

Controller of Immigration, I must say that we  have

always   considered  these  applications   from   a

sympathetic  light, and while we  admit  that  they

will  not  be a competitive factor in our  task  to

look  for jobs for Singapore citizens, nevertheless

there  are also other problems, like housing, which

have to be considered as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure the Member for Bras

Basah  that we have not been very strict or  severe

in  the  consideration of entry  permits  for  aged

parents, provided certain requirements can  be  met

by  the sponsors - that they are our citizens, that

they  are  in a position to support their  parents,

and  that  the parents solely depend upon them  for

sustenance.  Otherwise,  there  has  been  no  real

difficulty in considering this problem of admitting

aged parents.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, do you wish to proceed with

the motion or would you withdraw it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I beg to withdraw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $611,800 for Head 0305 ordered to

stand part of the First Supplementary Estimates of

Expenditure for 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0309 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0309

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as is generally known even by

our neighbours, 50,000 flats or more have been

built for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



people  by the Government of Singapore, and certain

U.M.N.O. leaders have stated that these  are  only

fit  for pigeons. Unfortunately, buses to serve the

people  in  housing  estates,  such  as  MacPherson

Estate,  have  not been seen up  to  today.  It  is

difficult   to   understand  how  the   appropriate

authorities carry out their duties. The  MacPherson

Estate  has  long been in existence. The  residents

there very much require a bus service, particularly

for  their  school-going children.  These  children

have to walk for half a mile or three-quarters of a

mile  to get to the main road in order to get to  a

bus  stop.  If  the housing authorities  can  build

these  flats so easily, why is it that the Registry

of Vehicles cannot attend to the provision of a bus

service  for these estates? We must not keep  quiet

about  this  matter  and  allow  children  in   the

MacPherson Estate to go on foot in order to get  to

a  bus  stop.  I  hope this matter  will  be  given

weighty consideration by the Registrar of Vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities should realise that the

population is growing, although the number of taxis

is  still  the same as before. The matter  of  taxi

licence plates should also be considered so that it

would  not be monopolised by one or two individuals

only.  If possible, Mr Speaker, Sir, every  person

should  be  allowed a limited issue of one  or  two

taxi licence plates, because the opportunity should

be  given  to the people of the State to have  taxi

licence  plates in order to earn their  livelihood.

There  are many exploiters who wish to get as  many

taxi  licence plates as possible. It is up  to  the

Registrar  to  control the issue  of  taxi  licence

plates so that it would not be given to only a  few

persons.  If a regulation is made whereby only  one

plate   is   issued  to  an  applicant,  then   the

opportunity for the exploiters to carry  out  their

misdeeds  may  be limited. I can say that  this  is

similar  to  the  system of the Ali  Baba  type  of

business.  The  exploiter  would  get  the  licence

plates  under his own name, under his wife's  name,

and under his children's names. So I trust that the

regulations  will  be  put  into  force  so  as  to

regulate the issue of taxi licence plates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should do away with the old colonial system

and have a system that is suitable for the present

population  of the country. There are  people  who

take  the opportunity to exploit the new situation

in  order  to  exploit the people. I  request  the

Registry  of Vehicles to do something  useful  for

the people of this State.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, I fully agree with

the  Member for Kampong Kapor that here we do  not

have bus owners and taxi owners registered in  the

name of Ali Baba. And there is more reason why the

number of vehicle licences and bus licences should

be increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another trade union colleague of mine, the

Member  for  Telok Blangah, has  asked  a  pointed

question  about  the imbalance  between  available

taxis  and taxi drivers. The figures are fantastic

-  so  many  more drivers than available vehicles.

Anyone can see that there is such a ripe field for

exploitation, especially when it is known that the

majority  of  taxi  drivers  are  not  owners   of

vehicles.  What  is  the  net  result  of  such  a

grotesque   disproportion  between  vehicles   and

drivers?  It  is  that  the  owners  of  vehicles,

knowing that there will be a competition from  the

thousands of taxi drivers for their vehicles, will

push  up  their rentals for them and lay down  all

sorts of conditions. The taxi drivers will have no

alternative hut to accept the conditions  and  the

rentals  laid down by the owners, rather than  put

up  with the disgrace of unemployment. But what we

would like to know is how things have been allowed

to  get  out of hand in such a manner, and who  is

responsible  for this mess? Or has  somebody  felt

that  by doing so we will be increasing employment

opportunities? It is as plain as A, B, C  that  if

you  increase  the number of taxi  drivers,  there

must   be  a  corresponding  number  of  vehicles.

Otherwise  taxi owners are the only ones  who  are

going  to profit, after squeezing the taxi drivers

by high demands on them, because of the paucity of

vehicles. Sir, I wonder if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



these  questions did engage those responsible  for

this situation. I suppose there is no need for  me

to  wonder  whether  they did, because  the  sorry

situation tells an eloquent story of neglect.  Now

the cure at the moment is increasing the number of

vehicle  licences  and  a temporary  halt  to  the

issuance  of  licences to taxi  drivers  till  the

situation is reassessed. The long-term cure is the

setting  up  of  an organisation  to  enable  taxi

drivers  to own their own vehicles. The  time  has

come to think in such terms if taxi drivers are to

earn a livelihood without exploitation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the question

of  bus  services  as raised  by  the  Member  for

Kampong  Kapor,  I would like to state  that  this

matter  will  be got over with in  a  short  time.

Buses  are  allowed to run only on  public  roads.

There  are many places where the roads are private

roads.  Even  though there are flats built  there,

the  roads are not yet made public roads, so  that

buses cannot run through these estates. Therefore,

the  matter  pertaining to the  particular  estate

will be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the matter raised by the Member for

Bras  Basah, it is true that there is an  increase

in  the number of taxi drivers. That happened when

the  Registry  of  Vehicles was  still  under  the

Central  Government. Before the  separation  there

were  9,800  taxi  drivers.  After  that,  it  was

13,414.  I  have  stated in  this  House  that  my

Ministry will set up a Committee to review all the

problems facing the Registry of Vehicles. When the

Committee  is  set  up, it will  be  possible  for

Members of this House to present their problems to

this  Committee.  All I can  say  now  is  that  a

Committee  will  be  formed  to  look  into  these

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have come to understand

something  from  the Straits Times of  18th  March,

1965,  and I believe the same item also appears  in

other  papers, such as the Berita Harian, and  also

in the Chinese papers. I will quote in English:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English) `Police are investigating the loss

of  about $100,000 from the Police Thrift and  Loan

Society.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay) In paragraph 2, 1 quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English) `Several police officers have

already  been  questioned in  connection  with  the

investigation.'



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member give the date of the

Straits Times?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Thursday, 18th

March, 1965. In the Straits Times dated 20th March,

1965,  on  Saturday, there was a news item,  and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English) `Police today stated that they were

not  investigating the loss of the sum of  $lOO,000

from the Police Thrift and Loan Society here.'



<br><br>(In Malay) Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has set

aside a sum of money so that the Police Thrift  and

Loan  Society can function well. I regret that  the

Registrar  of  Co-operative  Societies  could   not

investigate this matter so that it would not  occur

again  in  our State. This matter is known  to  all

interested  parties. It is known to the  police  as

well  as  the public. It is known to the  Registrar

and  also  to  the  Accountant of the  Co-operative

Societies.  Mr Speaker, I regret that  the  police

and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau have

not  carried out their duties in investigating  the

actions of the Registrar of Co-operative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



Societies  and  the  Auditor  of  the  Co-operative

Societies who have adopted a tight-lip attitude  as

to  the whereabouts of the sums of money that  were

missed,  one  amounting  to  $60,320,  and  another

amounting to $14,270, making a total of $74,590. It

is  not  known where that amount has gone  to.  The

Registrar   of   Societies   has   acted   in    an

irresponsible  manner and has not carried  out  his

duties  in  accordance with the law. He has  merely

condoned  or  indirectly acted in contravention  of

the rules in order to cover up the missing sums  of

money  by,  what I would call, getting false  loans

extracted from tens of members of the Police Thrift

and Loan Society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to explain this. For instance, a

member of the police, Mr A, takes a loan and signs

for  a sum of $1,000, but the sum of $1,000 is  not

received by Mr A, because it is for the purpose of

covering  up  the  loss. So it goes  on  for  other

members  of the police, Mr B, Mr C, etc. That  is

what I mean by "empty loans".

<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher officers had asked members of the

police force to take up loans in order to cover  up

the loss. They said that the repayment would not be

made from their pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, every member of the Police

Thrift and Loan Society was coerced into taking out

an  "empty" loan from the Society, in some cases up

to  the  maximum amount of $2,400 each. Two  clerks

attached  to  this  Society have  vanished.  It  is

possible  that they have received advice indirectly

or  even  directly  from the Registrar,  acting  in

conjunction  with senior police officers,  to  pave

the  way to terminate their services. At least  two

Assistant Superintendents of Police knew about  the

whole  affair. The Commissioner of Police has  been

fully  informed. He is fully aware of the position.

He   will  request  the  Police  Thrift  and   Loan

Society's  Committee members to make a decision  on

the matter. He has carried out his duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wish to state here is about the duties of

the  Registrar. The money was deposited by the rank

and file of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



police  force  who,  in the main,  are  drawing  an

income of less than $200 per month or a little more

than that. Most of them saved up for the purpose of

their  old  age.  Is it not a pity  that  they  are

bitterly  frustrated and that the thrift  and  loan

society    movement   will   surely    fail?    The

administrators  of  the  Police  Thrift  and   Loan

Society have acted in contravention of regulations.

But  even  more  deplorable is the failure  of  the

Registrar of Co-operative Societies to carry out  a

proper   supervision  of  the  management  of   the

Society,   thereby  jeopardising  the  smooth   and

efficient development of the co-operative  movement

in Singapore as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel it is not right that

some  tens of members of the police force  who  had

nothing  to do with the loss are forced to  take  a

blank loan in order to cover up the money which has

gone astray.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I hope that the

Minister  concerned can find  a  way  out,  in  the

interest of the co-operative movement as a whole in

the  State and with the co-operation of the police,

in  respect of the question of re-payments  of  the

loans  which  had been taken out under pressure  by

members  of  the Police Thrift and Loan Society  in

order to cover up the affair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Kampong Kapor has made somewhat serious allegations

against the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. At

one  moment,  he  referred  to  the  Registrar   of

Societies. I would like to make it clear,  however,

that  the  Registrar of Societies  does  not  conic

under  my  Ministry  but,  I  believe,  under   the

Ministry  of  Culture  and  Social  Affairs.  I  am

responsible   for  the  Registry  of   Co-operative

Societies. The Member quoted a newspaper report  of

early  March stating that investigations were being

made   into  these  allegations,  and  then  quoted

another  report of the 20th of March  which  denied

that  these investigations were in fact being made.

What  the  truth of this matter is, I do not  know,

but if the learned Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



is  prepared to supply me with more particulars and

information in respect of his allegations, I assure

him  that  proper investigations will be  made  and

appropriate  action taken against  anyone  who  has

committed  a breach of trust or run away  with  any

part of the Society's funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I point out, Mr Speaker, Sir, that these co-operative societies must file audited accounts

every  year, and unless these accounts are correct,

someone must explain.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

with regard to what has been stated by the Minister

for Law and National Development, I am prepared  to

give him further particulars regarding the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In view of that, is the Member

prepared to withdraw the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I beg leave to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $174,400 for Head 0401 ordered to

stand part of the First Supplementary Estimates of

Expenditure for 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0701 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0701

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the Registry of

Births,  we  know  that after a  mother  has  given

birth, she will be given a copy of the Registration

of  Birth  which  is printed in red.  Within  seven

years of birth, a copy of the original extract  has

to  be obtained from the Registry. The Registry  of

Births  is  situated  in  Empress  Place.   It   is

inconvenient  for  people living  in  the  outlying

areas,  such  as  in the islands,  Changi,  Seletar

Naval  Base,  to come to Empress Place  to  get  an

extract of the Registration of Birth. They have  to

miss a day's work and incur transport expenses.  In

addition,  they have to pay $2 to the  Registry  of

Births  for  an extract. If the Minister  concerned

would consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



seriously this matter to have many branches of this

Registry,  then the work of the Registry  could  be

decentralised in the outlying areas and it would be

convenient for the people living in these areas  to

get their extracts of Registration of Birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter concerns the Registry of

Persons.  I believe it deals with matters connected

with  the  issue  of identity cards.  Soon  plastic

identity cards will be issued. It is hoped that the

errors  which appear on our present identity  cards

will  not  recur. The names on the  identity  cards

have often been misspelt. It is hoped that when the

new  plastic identity cards are issued,  the  names

appearing therein will be the same as those on  the

extracts of the Registration of Birth. If  this  is

not  done, then the clerks will be writing down the

names  according to their own way of spelling.  For

instance,  my name is Mahmud. The correct  spelling

is  `M-a-h-m-u-d'.  But the clerk  who  is  English

educated, on hearing my name, may spell it as

`M-a-h-m-o-o-d'.  So  may be the case  with  names  like

Yaacob,  Khamis, Mohamed Shah, and others. So  also

may  be  the  case  with Chinese names.  Take,  for

instance, Chan Chee Seng. The way I would spell  it

is `C-h-a-n C-h-i S-i-n-g'. There are other ways of

spelling  it according to the way it is pronounced.

I  hope  the Government will make it necessary  for

the Chinese characters to be written down too.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why I bring this matter up, Mr Speaker, Sir, is

this;  when  the  time comes to make  requests  for

withdrawal of provident fund or other such matters,

the  name on the identity card and the name on  the

extract  of  Registration of Birth are quite  often

different.  For  instance, the  name  Ahmad  Taff.

Sometimes  the  name Ahmad is spelt  as  A-h-m-a-d.

There  are others who spell it as A-h-m-a-t,  which

also is Ahmad. And Taff could be misspelt as

T-o-u-g-h. Perhaps the correct spelling is Taff. Probably

Taff is derived from the word "attap". So there  is

a wide difference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



If  the  name is spelt in various ways,  then  that

leads to difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely wish to

touch  a  little  on the Registry of  Persons.  The

Ministry of Labour will be issuing plastic identity

cards,  and  I  wish to draw the attention  of  the

Minister  concerned to this matter,  so  that  when

plastic identity cards are issued, people who  have

not  changed their addresses will have the  changes

duly made. In my constituency, for instance, before

the  construction of Airport Road, Kampong Ann Teng

was known as Lorong Tai Seng. But after the Airport

Road  was  built, the eastern part of the  road  is

called Jalan Ann Teng, and the rest is still called

Lorong  Tai Seng. So it is hoped that the  Minister

for  Labour  will bear this in mind  so  that  when

plastic identity cards are issued, this point  will

have   been  clarified  and  the  changes  in   the

addresses of the people made, because most  of  the

people  affected are farmers and vegetable growers,

and they do not understand the matter well. I hope,

therefore, that the Minister for Labour will give a

full explanation to settlers in Jalan Ann Teng  who

number  not  less  than 2,000,  so  that  they  can

understand the position when the new identity cards

are issued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

I would like to reply to the criticisms made by the

Member for Kampong Kapor in respect of the Registry

of  Births and Deaths. He says that there  is  some

inconvenience  caused  to  people  living  in   the

outlying  areas  of the island and  also  to  those

staying in the Southern Islands who have to come to

the   Registry  to  change  their  temporary  birth

certificates into permanent ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that there are some difficulties

caused  to  these people when they come from  their

homes  to  town  to  have their birth  certificates

changed.  I  think his suggestion  that  we  should

branch out into these areas to provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



such services to these people is a very good one. I

will look into this matter fully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case there have been instances where

in  these  outlying areas community centre  leaders

have  collected these temporary birth  certificates

and have come to the Registry to apply on behalf of

these  parents.  This  is, I  think,  a  very  good

service  also  and  we will also  encourage  it  in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the criticisms of the Registry of Persons

in  regard to mistakes in the spelling of names  on

identity  cards, I can assure the  Member  that  in

future,  when re-registration is carried  out,  his

name will he spelt to his full satisfaction on  his

plastic identity card. In any case, we are going to

take  great  pains  to make sure  that  all  names,

whether  they are Chinese names or Malay  names  or

Indian  names,  will he given proper  study  before

they  are  written on the new identity cards.  Even

under the present system, if a man is not satisfied

with  the spelling of his name, he can always apply

to have his alias written on his identity card.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the remarks made by the Member for Kampong

Kembangan,  regarding wrong addresses  in  identity

cards  at  present, I agree with him  that  in  the

past,  when these identity cards were issued  in  a

hurry  to  meet  the emergency situation  in  1948,

there  were  not very strict conditions  laid  down

about  the  filling  up  of these  identity  cards,

especially the names and addresses of the  holders.

But  in future, before our re-registration campaign

is  carried  out, we will send teams  to  areas  to

inform  the  residents of the correct address,  the

name  of  the street where they live, so that  when

they come to the registration centre, they can give

the  registration  officer the correct  number  and

address of their house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the National Registration Bill which

is  going to be read a Second time tomorrow,  there

is  a  clause to compel the report of a  change  of

address  within 14 days. So I think this will  meet

the request of the Member for Kampong Kembangan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0906

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some ugly incidents involving

political detainees were recently reported  in  the

Press.  It  appears  that these detainees,  divided

into  two camps on the basis of the schism  in  the

Communist  world, namely, the Russian pragmatic  or

revisionist   communism  versus  Chinese   pristine

Marxism, had a free-for-all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not really mind their having a free-for-all amongst themselves because, if they had

their  heads hit in the right places, perhaps  they

would  be  rid  of all the stuff and nonsense  that

they  are  trying  to  inflict  on  the  people  of

Singapore  and  return  as  sane  citizens.  We  in

Singapore   do  not  care  for  either   brand   of

Communism.  We  are  getting  along  fine   without

Communism of either kind tripping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



us  up.  So, if the free-for-all ended with  those

beneficial effects, we would perhaps welcome these

free-for-alls  and  might  have  even   considered

suggesting that they be televised, so that  people

could  get  a good idea of the state of  confusion

these chaps are in themselves, before they set out

in  their dedicated business of confusing  others.

There would be both ideological entertainment  and

entertainment perhaps for boxing fans. I  am  sure

all  of  us  would  get a belly-laugh  from  their

slapstick comedy. It is rather surprising to  note

that  the  gravity of Communism can  descend  into

such shambles as a free-for-all. It is like a fall

from the sublime to the ridiculous.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare say all of the hon. Members here will

agree  with me, say, if their squabbles and fights

were televised and the whole of Singapore would be

suffocated with mirth. For instance, if the leader

of   one  camp,  the  uncompromising  camp,  said,

"Singapore's independence is phoney; we will  have

to  establish the phoney character of  Singapore's

independence  before anything else,"  And  a  chap

from  the other camp said, "There is nothing wrong

with  Singapore's independence. We start from that

basis,"  and  he received a bash on the  head  for

that,  it would clear up the minds of some of  our

people  here who have not decided one way  or  the

other.  These people would then be able to say  "A

pox on these chaps." And the clowns would then  be

out of business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am afraid it will not be as innocent as all

that, because political capital can be made out of

the bashing they give each other. We will have the

Barisan  Sosialis shrieking that the  bashing  was

done  by  the prison guards, acting on  authority,

and the Government would get a bad name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to protect us from getting a bad name,

we   have   got  to  protect  these   chaps   from

themselves. I would, therefore, like to know  what

special precautions have been taken by the  prison

authorities  to  prevent  a  recurrence  of  these

political  fisticuffs.  Have  extra  guards   been

posted near them during their meet-together



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



hours or has the position  been  reached

where they are "raring to have a go at each other"

and  they have been separated from each other  for

their own good?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if the second thing has taken place, it is

well  and  good  for us, then no fights  can  take

place,  but these chaps, to save their  face,  may

make up to preserve the outward form of unity, but

this  unity which they may pretend would be a sort

of  fragile unity, easily broken once they  engage

in  controversy.  And who is to say  that  another

bashing will not arise?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the ugly

incident as described by the Member for Bras Basah

has  given rise to considerable publicity  in  the

local   Press.   I  should  like  to   take   this

opportunity to state that it was not  due  to  any

shortcomings    or   defects   in    the    prison

administration.  In fact, the incident  underlines

the fact that quite contrary to the allegation  of

ill-treatment  and  torture made  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  our  political detainees  are  so  well

treated that they even have the time to engage  in

a little fracas now and then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political detainees are housed in blocks

segregated  from the ordinary and other prisoners,

and are permitted to live comfortably in dormitory

accommodation  as  compared  with  the  cells   of

convicted  prisoners. Unlike  ordinary  prisoners,

they   are  not  required  to  do  any  work  and,

therefore, have a considerable amount of free time

on   their  hands.  Hence  they  have  plenty   of

opportunity to quarrel and fight with one  another

if  they are so disposed. They are allowed freedom

of   movement  within  the  open  grounds  of  the

precincts  of the place of detention,  and  normal

locking-up time is 9 p.m. in the evening.  In  the

matter   of   food  they  are  given  preferential

treatment  over ordinary prisoners. Their  rations

cost $1.30 cents per day as compared with 75 cents

per  day  for ordinary prisoners. They are allowed

to  select the type of diet on which they wish  to

be  placed,  and  most  of  them  have  taken  the

opportunity to be placed on European diet.  So  in

view of the somewhat pampered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



life which they have been leading, I am, in fact,

surprised that there have not been more fights and

incidents among them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,020,600 for Head 0906 ordered to

stand part of the First Supplementary Estimates of

Expenditure for 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1202 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1202

he reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a time when the

police  in  Singapore were feared. This  was  under

colonial  rule.  Guilty and  innocent  feared  them

equally, for they were then a truculent lot and the

common   ordinary  people  in  Singapore   suffered

terrible indignities at their hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Malaysia, there was a relapse apparently,

when a journalist in broad daylight performing  his

duty  was man-handled in a very rough fashion. This

incident,   to   our   considerable   regret,   was

whitewashed and it is now an ugly memory. That  was

under  Malaysia  and it was the only  jolt  in  the

process which we had started in 1959 of orientating

the  police to the fact that they were dealing with

their  own people and not serving colonial masters.

Those who could not change their old attitudes,  of

course, had to go, and was good riddance. We had no

place  for  such  bullies  in  Singapore  which  is

committed to making life pleasant and agreeable for

its  humblest  Citizens. There  was  no  place  for

police brutality and callousness. They were of  the

old  order  and were identified with  the  colonial

government and were perhaps one of the very  strong

reasons for doing away with colonial rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is supposed to have changed with

self-government and independence. But I am afraid

that some dark



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



corners still exist. It has been represented to  me

that  the  traffic police are displaying a singular

callousness to the problems of taxi-drivers.

Taxi-plying is not a lucrative profession as it used  to

be  in  the  colonial rule where it  had  been  the

policy  of colonial government to limit the  number

of  taxis, and the fortunate small number of

taxi-drivers  earned good money. But now it  has  become

different with the accent we have given to creating

employment opportunities. With the issuance of more

taxi-driving licences, taxi-earnings are  not  what

they  used to be. On the average, they earn between

$7  and  $8 per day. In this connection,  Sir,  the

fines  imposed  by the police take  on  an  inhuman

aspect  for  minor offences which  are  settled  by

compounding. As much as $20 is fined  for  a  first

offence   and  subsequent  fines  are  higher.   As

President  of the N.T.U.C., my ears are  full  with

representations from taxi-drivers asking the police

to  reduce  their  fines to a rate consistent  with

their  earning capacity. In other words,  they  are

asking  the police to have a heart, not to  extract

too   heavily  from  their  meagre  earnings.   The

N.T.U.C. feels, therefore, that a system should  be

introduced whereby a warning is issued to  a  first

offender,  and  small  fines  consistent  with  the

nature of the offence and with the earning capacity ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I wonder whether the Member

is  in order in making representations on behalf of

the  N.T.U.C. to this House. He speaks as a  Member

of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I withdraw from

my  capacity  as President of the N.T.U.C.  I  will

speak in my capacity as the Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I have aired all these

grievances  before, but there has been no  response

from  the  authorities. We would like to know  why,

and we have the right to know why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days have gone when the cries of oppressed

sections   of  the  people  can  be  ignored   with

equanimity.  If  there are any  inhumanities,  then

they must be removed and, in my opinion, the system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



of  fines operated by the police bears too  heavily

on  the  poor taxi-drivers. I therefore think  they

must   be  modified.  I  am  not  for  one   moment

suggesting that the fines must be removed, but they

can be modified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic offences are a part of the occupational

risks  of  taxi-drivers, but  it  is  too  cruel  a

deterrent to apply high fines for minor offences as

crossing over a red light or parking near  a  white

line. I hope appropriate attention will be given by

the  authorities,  because this is  being  said  in

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be another cruel activity of the

police  in that they are hounding taxi-drivers  for

an offence such as excessive smoking. Sir, I do not

know  whether such an offence of excessive  smoking

is  under the charge of the Traffic Police  or  the

R.O.V. Anyway, I hope the Ministers concerned  will

heed  my warning about this and hope that they  pay

special  attention, whoever they may be.  In  truth

and  in  fairness, they should hound the owners  of

the  taxis who are the real culprits and who  never

do  anything  about  appropriate repairs,  although

they  are told so by the drivers to whom they  rent

out their vehicles at exorbitant rates.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the owner and the police, the taxi-driver

is  between the devil and the deep sea. The cruelty

reaches  enormous proportions when the  taxi-driver

is  made to shell out as much as $80 as a fine  for

the  smoking  offence.  Meanwhile,  the  owner  who

extracts  a high rental for the car sits smugly  at

home  raking  in  his money from  several  cars,  I

suppose, while the poor wretch has to shell out the

$80.  What exacerbates the matter is that I am sure

the  police  are  conversant  with  this  state  of

affairs, but they do precious little about  booking

the  real  culprits who perhaps would not feel  the

pinch even if they were fined several times more. I

believe if the police want to do some milking, they

should get the milch cows - the owners of the taxis

-  and  not  the threadbare taxi-drivers,  who  can

hardly  make a day's living. I hope these  problems

of  taxi-drivers  on which I have  enlightened  the

House will receive the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



sympathetic  attention of the  police,  that  there

will  be an end to the inhuman persecution  of  the

taxi-drivers, and that they will be allowed to earn

a  living  in  the same manner as the  majority  of

workers in Singapore - unoppressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up, I hope I have painted a lurid

picture of the exploitation of taxi-drivers and the

harassment they suffer at the hands of the  police,

because  it was my intention to do so. We hope  the

remedies   will  come  because  the  situation   is

deteriorating  and, furthermore, intolerable  to  a

"movement" which prides itself on having solved the

problems of workers to a very successful extent.  I

hope  you,  Mr Speaker, will not pull  me  out  of

order  again  when  I mention the  word  "movement"

because  I  have  to make it clear that  the

Taxi-Drivers' Association  is  an  affiliate of the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of taxi-drivers are not ones that

defy  solution. They can be solved,  provided  they

are  approached in the right spirit and a realistic

attempt  is made to solve them. We hope, therefore,

when  the next year we convene, much of the acid  I

have used here will not be necessary and things  in

general will have improved for the taxi-drivers  to

earn  a  living  unmolested by the authorities  and

free  from the grim exploitation they are subjected

to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  comment on the question  of

taxi-drivers  made  by  the Member for Bras  Basah.  The

fines  on taxi-drivers are too heavy, but they  are

necessary.  Just  yesterday as I was  driving  very

slowly out of this Parliament House the driver of a

taxi,  whose  number I had taken  down,  could  not

contain  his patience but kept on hooting his  horn

and  he overtook from the left-hand side of my car.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is the sort of  taxi-driver

that  should  be punished. I am only  stressing  on

such reckless drivers. But those who are constantly

careful  in their driving and earning their  living

properly should be given consideration, but not all

taxi-drivers.  At  the same time,  if  taxi-drivers

park  their  vehicles anywhere  they  like  and  go

against traffic lights, and so on -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the number of vehicles in Singapore is

about  103,000, if I am correct - if  this  sort  of

uncontrolled  traffic  is  allowed  to  go  on   in

Singapore,  I think the lives of you, Mr  Speaker,

and  Members of Parliament will be in danger.  Lay,

and  order must be preserved. I therefore urge that

all  taxi-drivers be a hit more careful in  future.

If  the police are able to curb pirate taxis  which

are  competing with taxis, then I am sure that this

complex  problem  will  be solved.  Therefore,  the

fines  on  taxi-drivers should be imposed according

to the nature of the offence.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

join  the  Member  for Bras Basah in  raising  this

question  of  taxis.  The  Member  for  Changi  has

mentioned  just  now  his personal  experience.  He

feels  that  the taxi-driver who has  committed  an

offence  knew  what he was doing.  The  taxi-driver

knew that the Member for Changi is a P.A.P. Member,

and  I believe that the taxi-driver is a member  of

the  Barisan Sosialis. Naturally, taxi-drivers  who

are  Barisan Sosialis members and taxi-drivers  who

are  P.A.P, members like to block one  another  or

clash with one another when they meet. This problem

could be left to the police to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has suggested that the

fines  should  be in line with the  nature  of  the

offences  committed by taxi-drivers.  This  is  the

example given by the Member for Bras Basah:  for  a

car  smoking offence, the fine will be $40 or  $50.

Naturally  this  is  not  commensurate   with   the

offence.  That is what is asked for by  the  Member

for Bras Basah regarding fines and taxis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I was a bit taken aback by the  Member  for Bras Basah when

he said  that  the Police  Force  is  harassing taxi-drivers  and  the

public  in general, and that we are exploiting  the

taxi-drivers'  earnings in order to supplement  our

revenue.  I am sure that is never the intention  of

the department, and this has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



never  been the policy of the Minister for  Finance

of our Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the crux of the matter

is  that  it  is  up to the drivers  themselves  to

observe  traffic rules. From what  the  Member  for

Bras  Basah has said, it appears that there  is  no

dispute  that they have committed a breach  of  the

Traffic  Ordinance. Therefore, there is no question

that  the  police  are harassing taxi-drivers.  The

fact  is  that taxi-drivers are committing  traffic

offences. It is the duty of the police to see  that

laws are being observed, particularly when children

and workers are using the road. The police have  to

see that motorists who are using the road are not a

menace  to  pedestrians or cyclists, or,  for  that

matter,  to  the  motorists  themselves.   In   the

circumstances, the police will have to see that the

rules are observed by everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of fines being

imposed  by  the police, I understand  the  Traffic

Police Department has been very considerate towards

taxi-drivers.  Those  who have  committed  a  first

minor  offence  are  usually  given  a  letter   of

warning.  But  for  those  who  repeatedly   commit

offences  under  the  Traffic  Ordinance,  in   the

interest of the public and the safety of the

road-users, a deterrent penalty will have to be imposed.

So I would say that if taxi-drivers do not like the

fines  being imposed on them by the Traffic Police,

it  is  up  to  them, especially the Taxi  Drivers'

Association, to promote a campaign of good driving.

I  think  this  is  the  basic  solution  to  their

complaint.  Probably the N.T.U.C. can organise  the

campaign, and I am sure the Traffic Police will  be

prepared to co-operate with them to launch it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emitting of excessive smoke is an offence

under  the  Ordinance administered by the Registrar

of Vehicles. I am not in a position to clarify this

matter. On the suggestion that the owners of  taxis

should  be  made to take the responsibility  rather

than  the  drivers, I am told that this  point  has

been taken note of by the department concerned, and

it  may well be that amendments will be made to the

present Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make

my  point clear to the Member for Changi as well as

the  Minister of State of Defence. I am not at  the

moment  suggesting that the police should  overlook

the  offences of taxi-drivers. My point is that for

first  minor offences, like going against the

red-light  signal or parking too far out from the  side

of  the road, consideration should be given to them

that they should not be fined as high as $20.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My information from the Taxi Drivers' Association

is  that  not  only a fine of $20 is  imposed,  but

sometimes  in one day a taxi-driver receives  three

or  four  summonses  of this nature.  So  I  wonder

whether  the  Minister  concerned  will  take   the

trouble to check with the Traffic Police to see  if

my information is correct or not.

Mr Ho See Beng, Amendment No. (l) *.



<hr size="2" noshade>



*The amendments reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 05 be reduced

by $10 in respect of new subhead 028.

Chong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 05 be

reduced by $10 in respect of new subhead 029.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand this is an

outstanding  sum  yet  to  be  reimbursed  by   the

Ministry  of Health to cover the costs of  building

515  covered pitches by the Housing and Development

Board  for  hawkers at Tanjong Rhu Estate,  Kallang

Airport Estate. Alexandra Hill Estate, and Bukit Ho

Swee Estate. The sum that is required for this vote

as  reimbursement for the Housing Board amounts  to

$122,526.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I further understand that the

construction of these covered pitches was  approved

by the former Minister for Health in 1963 for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



purpose  of re-siting unauthorised roadside  stalls

built  by  hawkers  which  caused  obstruction   to

traffic and impediment to health and cleansing work

in the various housing estates. The Government must

he  praised  for  having  provided  these  roadside

hawkers  with all the facilities of proper  hawking

pitches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to draw the attention of the

Minister  for Health to this - that  the  control

and  supervision of these covered  pitches  by  the

Markets and Hawkers Department of the Public Health

Division  is  far  from satisfactory.  Very  often,

pitches  are left vacant for months and  are  never

allocated  when they are applied for by  unlicensed

hawkers.  In  Tanjong Rhu Estate, which  is  in  my

constituency,  the  covered  pitches,  as  I   have

observed  from time to time, are not fully utilised

and  many  of  them are more often  than  not  left

unoccupied.  Some  of  them,  I  am  informed,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, have actually been allocated but have

never  been  physically occupied by  licensees  who

regularly  pay  up their licence fees.  So  far  no

action  has  ever  been taken by  the  Markets  and

Hawkers Department to rectify this irregularity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this state of affairs is indeed

very  undesirable  as  there  are  some  bona  tide

hawkers who wish to be allotted pitches to  make  a

decent  living. When they apply to the Markets  and

Hawkers Department, they are often told that  there

are no vacancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I should he grateful,

therefore, if the Minister for Health would  kindly

enlighten  me and this House whether he would  take

appropriate  steps  to implement effective  control

and  supervision of hawker pitches not only in  the

various housing estates in my constituency but also

in other housing estates in other constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I admit with regret that most of  the

criticisms   levelled  by  the  hon.   Member   for

Mountbatten against the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



Hawkers Department of the Public Health Division of

my  Ministry of ineffective control and supervision

of  hawkers are unfortunately true. That is why  it

was  necessary  for me to appoint an  officer  from

another  Ministry,  i.e. the  Director  of  Central

Complaints  Bureau  of  the  Ministry   of   Social

Affairs,  to  he  the  officer-in-charge   of

re-organisation  of  the Hawkers  Department  as  from

November last year, a year ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general survey was made in May this year of

markets  and  pitches which revealed  that  out  of

8,269  stalls in 42 Government markets, only  6,493

stalls or 80 per cent were taken up, leaving  1,776

stalls  or nearly 20 per cent not taken up at  all.

This  is  only  the  overall  picture.  In  certain

markets, they are half-empty, like the Maxwell Road

market  which is supposed to house 233 stalls,  but

only  125  stalls were taken up. And then  we  have

another  outstanding example of  a  market  at  the

junction  of  Clementi Road and Pasir Panjang  Road

built  for  49  stalls which have  been  empty  for

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with many markets having empty stalls, thus

causing  loss of revenue to the State,  yet  almost

all  approaches to markets, whether  Government  or

private,   are   crowded   with   hawkers    mainly

unlicensed.  These at the same time  block  up  the

roads  which  are meant for traffic,  thus  causing

serious  congestion  all round for  pedestrians  as

well   as   for  motor  traffic,  whether  carrying

passengers or goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, the question of hawkers

is   inter-related  with  the  problem  of   public

cleansing.  Hawker  congregations  and   those   in

markets are responsible for considerable amounts of

perishable  refuse. Most hawker  congregations  are

also  made up of unauthorised structures which,  in

turn,  prevent  our  cleansing workers  from  doing

their  jobs properly, thus adding up the  piles  of

refuse.  These  in  turn  increase  public   health

hazards,   for  they  bring  in  more   flies   and

mosquitoes, because drains are blocked with  refuse

which cannot he cleared and flushed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Mountbatten

that initial steps of re-organisation, not only  of

the Hawkers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



Department   but  also  of  the  Public   Cleansing

Department,  have  been taken,  and  that  stronger

remedial  measures will be taken early  next  year,

i.e. after  the  forthcoming festive  seasons  are

over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer the hon. Member to a part

of  His  Excellency's Address which was  delivered

on   the   8th  December,  particularly  col.   25 [Hansard],  the  last  but  one  paragraph,  which

reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The re-organisation and expansion of the

Environmental  Health Services, Public  Cleansing,

Anti-Mosquito Services and Hawkers Department  are

being  taken  in  hand  and initial  measures  for

improvement  of transport, equipment,  enforcement

of  discipline  and training of  supervisors  have

commenced.'



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to indicate briefly what has

been  done  and will be done soon. Firstly,  a  new

Hawkers' Code has been drawn up with the assistance

of  the  Public  Health Advisory  Board  which  was

appointed  by me in June 1964. I propose,  Sir,  to

announce   officially  the  details  of  this   new

Hawkers'  Code in mid-February next year,  that  is

about  one  and a half months from now,  after  the

festive  seasons are over. Secondly, for  the  five

months  July  to  November this year,  about  1,000

hawkers  in 17 congregations throughout the  island

have  been successfully resited in accordance  with

the main principles outlined under the new Hawkers'

Code.  And thirdly, the first step to be taken  for

proper  and  effective control and  supervision  of

hawkers  is  the  licensing  of  all  hawkers.   At

present,  unfortunately, only  10,000  hawkers  are

licensed out of an estimated total of anything from

40,000  to  50,000 hawkers. This is, therefore,  an

impossible situation which has gone on for far  too

long  and  should be stopped accordingly. So  after

the  announcement of the new Hawkers'  Code  around

mid-February 1966, it is proposed that the  Hawkers

Department  will begin to license  all  hawkers  as

from  the  1st of March, 1966. And it  is  expected

that  it  may  take a few months to cope  with  the

work. Hawkers' licences will, of course, be limited

for  issuance  to  Singapore  citizens.  And  after

licensing  all the hawkers, it will then become  an

offence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



for  anyone  to hawk without a licence. Thereafter,

the  other provisions of the new Hawkers' Code will

be implemented step by step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to mention the fact that

when  I  used  the term "hawkers",  it  should,  of

course,  include  the term "market  stall-holders",

because  I  group them all under one terminology - hawkers.  In fact, the department previously  known

as the Markets and Hawkers Department, a term which

was  used by my hon, friend, should really read  as

the  Hawkers and Markets Department, which  name  I

changed at least one year ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I can see

here,  $122,526  was  spent  in  building  hawkers'

pitches  in the following area: Tanjong Rhu Estate,

Alexandra  Hill  Estate,  Kallang  Airport  Estate,

Bukit  Ho Swee Estate. According to the hon. Member

for  Mountbatten, some of the hawkers' pitches have

not  been used. If there is any plan in the Hawkers

Department to provide pitches in the rural area  so

as  to  counter the unauthorised stalls which  have

been  erected  all  over the rural  area,  I  would

suggest, if possible, that these pitches be erected

in a quite compact area so as to assist the hawkers

in  the  rural area too. I shall be obliged if  the

Minister will enlighten me on this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I hope my friend the hon. Member

for  Changi could be patient enough to wait for the

official  announcement regarding the  new  Hawkers'

Code,  rather than for me to say something now  and

then  come out later in drips and drops. I hope  he

could  just  hold his horses for  one  and  a  half

months. In fact, he is already in the know, because

I  have  circularised the draft Hawkers'  Code  for

comments from Government Assemblymen and it is only

after   I  have  received  all  the  comments   and

criticisms -  I have also asked for the views  of

the  Public  Health Advisory Board  -  that  I  can

launch  out  on  this project.  It  is  really  the

concentrated  experience  not  only  of   our   own

Assemblymen  but  also  of  officials  in   various

Ministries covering Health, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



Public Works Department, Roads, and Housing and

Development Board and so on. Because the hawker problem

is not a problem by itself.  It is a social problem.. It

covers various aspects of life.  So we try to get as many

heads together as possible on this problem. At last we

have formulated a code, not of too many rules and

regulations, but a few general principles, such as we

accept that hawking is a way of life in Singapore, but

that in their attempt to find a simple way of earning a

living, because of the very serious unemployment

situation in Singapore, the hawkers should not, on the

other hand, ignore their social responsibilities as to

become a danger both in respect of public health and also

of traffic.  They have got to play according to a few

rules, and they would then be assured of security in the

choice of their livelihood.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, do you wish to proceed with a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Now that I have obtained a satisfactory

answer from the Minister of Health, I beg to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $422,526 for Head D 05 ordered to stand part

of the First Supplementary Development Estimates of

Expenditures for 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 11 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 11 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the police barracks at Kampong

Arang, the Government bought a block of Housing Board

flats there to accommodate members of the police force.

Not long afterwards, the five-foot way and the concrete

slabs of the drain were found to be defective. Mr

Speaker, Sir, whether the Ministry of National

Development deliberately sold sub-standard flats to the

police or whatever it is, accommodation for members of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 416</b></font><br><br>



police force should be of good standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, relating to old police quarters. The police

quarters at Woodlands can be seen by our neighbours from

across the Causeway.  We have been boasting about our

achievements such as multi-storeyed flats at Toa Payoh,

satellite towns, and so on.  But  I fear that U.M.N.O.

members, both in our country and in our neighbouring

country, can see these old buildings at Woodlands, made

of timber and occupied by members of  the Police Force,

are in a dilapidated condition.  We must give serious

consideration to that.  Also, the police quarters at

Geylang which are in the city area and those at Keppel

Harbour.  On the left-hand side of the police quarters at

Keppel Harbour, there are existing police quarters built

by the Port of Singapore Authority. This is a big multi-

storeyed building in contrast to the old existing police

quarters made of timber at Keppel Harbour. Mr Speaker,

Sir, these old dilapidated police quarters have only one

hall and there is not much room, with the result that the

members of the police force with large families find it

difficult to accomodate themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, regarding the quarters at Onraet Road. These

quarters at Onraet Road are for members of the rank and

file of the Police Force.  When they are promoted to the

rank of Inspector, they still continue to occupy these

quarters.  I feel that those who have been promoted

should vacate them, thereby giving an opportunity for the

other members of the rank and file to occupy them

instead.  And for those officers who have been promoted,

there should be built special quarters for them

commensurate with their ranks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the

police quarters at Kampong Arang, these are, in fact, not

police quarters.  It is a block of flats leased by the

police department as a block and given out to the police

for occupation.  So if the occupants of these flats have

any complaints of defects or damages, they should refer

or report it to their officers, or they can even write



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 417</b></font><br><br>



direct to the Housing and Development Board, because the

Board is responsible for the maintenance of these flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the old barracks in Woodlands, Geylang,

Keppel Harbour and other places, they have been built

since prewar and no improvements can be made to them

because the structure is such that it would cost too much

to carry out the improvements.  But on this matter,

probably when new police stations are constructed with

quarters attached to the police stations.  I think these

quarters will be better than the ones I have mentioned

here.  I believe that the Department is aware of the fact

that Inspectors who have risen from the rank and file are

still occupying these quarters and, of course,

appropriate remedial measures will be taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,023,200 for Head D 11 ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 13 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, all I wish is to obtain information from the

Minister as to where these four post offices are to be

sited.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob (In Malay)</b>: Mr Speaker, three new post

offices will be built at Siglap, still Road and Owen

Road.  In the Estimates, there is a provision for four

new post offices.  But actually only three will be built

in the course of the year.  This programme was submitted

to the Permanent Secretary, Economic Development Board,

on 30th

three new post offices will be built.  The provision of

"New Post Offices, four" should now read "New Post

Offices, three".
