<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Mohd Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime Minister

how  many  Temporary  Assistant  Markets  and  Hawkers

Inspectors  were employed by the City  Council  as  at

31st  August,  1960; how many of them were  appointed

from   among  former  serving  officers  of  the  City

Council,  and  how  many passed (a)  English  Standard

Eight,  (b) Chinese Junior Middle, (c) Malay  Standard

Seven, and (d) an equivalent standard in Tamil.

reply to this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 25 Temporary Assistant Markets and Hawkers

Inspectors  employed by the City Council  as  at  31st

August,  1960.  None of these were from  among  former

serving  officers. Seven have passed English  Standard

VIII. Four have passed Chinese Junior Middle, and  one

has  passed  Malay Standard VII. None has  passed  the

equivalent  standard  in Tamil.  In  addition  to  the

above, three possess the Cambridge School Certificate,

and   nine   possess   the   Chinese   Senior   Middle

Certificate - these  being  higher  qualifications  than

those  referred  to  by the Member  for  the  Southern

Islands.

Sir,  according  to the information  supplied  by  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, does it

mean  that  the serving officers in the  City  Council

have  no  qualifications to enable them to  carry  out

these duties?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> I do not understand the question.

repeat the question slowly?

that  the officers serving in these posts in the  City

many of them applied.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Is it because those

serving  officers in the City Council who applied  did

not possess the qualifications?

of that question is required.

<div align="center"><b>(Disciplinary action against drivers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Prime Minister (a)

whether he personally took action to sack a driver  of

the  City Council Transport Department in March  1960,

and on what grounds; and whether the Rules of the City

Council  were  followed in this case; (b)  whether  he

personally directed that disciplinary action be  taken

against   a   driver  of  the  Rural  Board  Cleansing

Department  who  was  driving a  Cleansing  Department

lorry along East Coast Road on Vesak Day, and on  what

grounds; and (c) on how many occasions has he initiated

disciplinary  action  against  labourers   under   his

jurisdiction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have been asked by the Prime Minister

to reply to this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The driver was specially employed by the ex-Minister for National Development for the

Parliamentary  Secretary,  Ministry  of  National

Development. The Parliamentary Secretary found the

driver unsatisfactory and he was given one month's

notice of termination of service in March.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Prime Minister reported the crew of a lorry

of the Rural Board Cleansing Section for disciplinary

action for reckless speeding and allowing refuse from

their lorry to fall and litter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



Bedok  Road.  They  were  disciplined  after  due

enquiry and received no pay that day. The  driver

and  co-driver  concerned  were  transferred   to

another section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Prime Minister's report initiated

disciplinary action in this instance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, is the Parliamentary

Secretary  aware  of  any rules in  the  City  Council

whereby  labourers are engaged for specific  jobs,  or

has  there  been  any  labourer engaged  by  the  City

Council on specific jobs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> The driver was specially employed

by  the  ex-Minister  for National  Development  on  a

temporary basis. Therefore, it has nothing to do  with

the rules of the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary

aware  that  the Prime Minister initiated disciplinary

action  against the second driver in question  because

he did not recognise the Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> It is not a question of whether he

recognised the Prime Minister or not. It concerns  the

attitude  of a civil servant towards a member  of  the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, is the Parliamentary

Secretary  aware, on (c), that the Prime Minister  had

either  taken  disciplinary action against  or  picked

quarrels  with  almost  all the  labourers  in  Changi

bungalow?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> I am not aware of that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost of decorating "Sri Temasek" in May

1960  was $194. These decorations were carried out  in

connection with National   Day. In addition,  a  sum  of

$29,790 was spent on painting and structural works and

repairs, and air-conditioning the lounge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One air-conditioned bedroom was prepared for the use

of State guests. The cost is 2,681.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has no "private office". The cost of making up the two rooms on the second floor of City

Hall in September 1959 for the Prime Minister and  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister  was  $21,468.70.  The   Prime

Minister's room therefore cost half of this, that  is,

$10,734.35.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authority for this expenditure came from the Fourth

Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for 1959,  Head

7, Subhead 15, in Command Paper (N.S.) 18 of 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of decorating the Prime Minister's Reception

cum Conference Room is $8,825.11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authority for this expenditure came from the same

Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for 1959,  Head

7, Sub-head 15, in Command Paper (N.S.) 18 of 1959.

Speaker,  I  have been asked by the Prime Minister  to

reply to this question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The cost of "Changi Cottage" was

$24,943.83 and it was constructed in  1950.  The

estimated  value  of  the land  is  about  $1  a

square foot. The cottage is in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



grounds of Changi bungalow, a Government holiday

bungalow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There is no cost to upkeep this bungalow

because the caretaker, the bungalow servant  and

the gardener of the Changi Holiday Bungalow help

to  look  after "Changi Cottage". The  estimated

cost for repairs and maintenance is $250 a year. Painting is done once in about four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Two bedrooms are air-conditioned. The air-conditioning was carried out in 1953.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The cost of painting and repairs to the

bungalow in May 1960 was $1,648.96.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The Yang di-Pertuan Negara and his guests are

entitled to occupy the Cottage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) and (g) There are no records of such domestic

details, nor is it part of the Minister's duties

to provide such information.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the answer to the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Head 34 - Ministry of Labour and Law - there is an

amendment standing in the name of the Member  for  Joo

Chiat  in  relation  to  the new  subhead  (Industrial

Arbitration Court).



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 34 be reduced

by  $10  in  respect  of the new  subhead  (Industrial

Arbitration Court) therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I speak today in particular

reference to the announcement of the Government a  few

days ago regarding the appointment of the President of

the  Industrial Arbitration Court. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

the  word  "Court",  I take it, has been  deliberately

used  in  the  designation of  this  Court  under  the

Industrial   Relations   Ordinance.   It    was    the

expectation,  I think, in the country that  the  first

President  would be a person of some legal  experience

and   qualification.  I  do  not  make  any   personal

reference to Dr Gamba except that he does not possess

any  legal qualification or legal experience. The work

of  this  Industrial Arbitration Court,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, will draw the attention of a very large number of

people of this country. It has been stressed time  and

time again inside this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



House and by both sides of the House that the economic

situation  of  this country is a vital factor  in  the

existence of the people of this country. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  there  has been much attention focussed  on  the

industrial   relationship   between   employers    and

employees,  and  we have all been expecting  that  the

Industrial Arbitration Court would be the final answer

to  the  numerous  strikes  which  have  plagued  this

country  in the past and, in so plaguing this country,

have  disturbed  the equilibrium of the  people  whose

main   concern  is  the  betterment  of  the  economic

situation of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the work of the Industrial Arbitration Court,

there  will no doubt be a great deal of material which

does  not involve the interpretation of law. Now, such

material,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, would  involve  a  great

knowledge  of the business of this country. Dr  Gamba

was  the  Professor of Economics in the University  of

Malaya   and,  as  such,  we  naturally  respect   his

knowledge  of  economics. But he has no experience  of

the  day-to-day running of big business, and it is  my

humble  submission that a certain amount of  knowledge

and  experience of big business should be an essential

qualification  of the Judge sitting in the  Industrial

Arbitration Court. I fail to see how the new appointee

can qualify in that respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the knowledge of law, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  need  to  stress before you that it  is  no  easy

matter  to  interpret the law, and there  is  a  great

principle  often  quoted in  the  law  courts  in  the

administration of law in any country, and that is that

justice  must  not only be done but must  seem  to  be

done.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the appointment should  have

gone  not  only to a person of great legal experience,

but  should also have gone to a person whose  politics

cannot  be questioned, or, rather, a person who should

have no political leanings whatsoever. In the case  of

this  new appointee, there may be some question as  to

his  political leanings. Therefore, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

it  may  perturb  employers,  particularly  when  they

appear  before  the Court, which should be  absolutely

impartial to both employee and employer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to appear to be

anticipating the work of this Court, but I hope,  when

a   reply  is  given  to  this  amendment,  that  some

satisfactory public statement will be made  to  subdue

whatever   qualms  that  may  have  arisen  with   the

announcement of the appointment.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Joo Chiat had been

present  in this House at the time when the Industrial

Relations Bill was debated, he would have been able to

inform himself of the functions of this Court. On that

occasion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I did take pains to inform

Members  of  the House that the Industrial Arbitration

Court is not a Court of Judicature. It is a Court that

is  concerned with the making of collective agreements

between employers and unions, its functions are mainly

legislative and not judicial. Mr Speaker, Sir, in any

dispute  where the parties fail to agree, the Minister

can, under the provisions of the Ordinance, refer  the

dispute  to the Industrial Arbitration Court. It  will

be  the  function of this Court to make the  agreement

for  the  parties when they cannot so agree.  That  is

essentially  a  legislative process and not,  strictly

speaking,  a judicial process. It is for that  reason,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, that it is considered  unnecessary

that  the  holder  of  this  appointment  should  hold

accepted legal qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is provision for the

appointment of a Registrar under the Ordinance. It  is

our intention to ensure that the person who fills that

appointment  will hold recognised legal qualifications

so  that he could assist the President whenever points

of  legal  difficulty arise. There is  also  provision

under the Ordinance for the State Advocate-General  to

be  consulted  by  the  Court  when  points  of  legal

difficulty  arise; and when he intervenes, members  of

the  Bar  have the right to appear before  the  Court.

There  are two sections of the Ordinance which provide

that  members of the Bar no longer have a right,  once

this  Ordinance has been brought into force,  to  take

part in the process of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



collective bargaining and members of the Bar also have

no  right to appear before this Court. I have  pointed

all that out before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of the political

leanings  of Dr Charles Gamba who has been  named,  I

can  assure the Member for Joo Chiat that he is not  a

member  of the People's Action Party. He is  a  person

who  has  played a great part in labour  economics  in

this  country.  He  has appeared on various  tribunals

dealing  with labour problems. As the Member  for  Joo

Chiat  must  know, this appointment is under  the  law

made  by  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the advice  of

the Prime Minister. And the Prime Minister, before  he

made this appointment, was very concerned that he  did

make   the   right  choice.  Before   he   made   this

appointment,   he  consulted  various  employers   and

sounded out their views, and they indicated that  this

appointment would be acceptable to them. In  the  same

way,  he  consulted the Trades Union Congress and  the

Congress  informed him that this appointment would  be

acceptable to them. So we are sure, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that this Court will be in the hands of a capable  and

experienced person.

of  the  Third Supplementary Estimates of  Expenditure

for 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 40 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an amendment standing in the

name of the Member for Joo Chiat in relation to the

new subhead (National Day).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 40 be reduced

by $10 in respect of the new subhead (National Day).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Speaker, Sir, this sum of $52,000 is being asked

by  the Government to pay for that famous occasion  on

3rd  June,  when  rain washed away all the  marvellous

preparations of the Government. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

all  saw  what the procession was going  to  be  like,

although  nature did not permit it to take  place.  In

fact, it was a procession for the glorification of the

People's Action Party. It was to have been a mile-long

procession, or something like that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Two

miles long.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Two miles long. But whatever length it was

supposed to be, I think about 95 to 98 per cent of the

length  was  to  be  occupied  by  banners  which  say

"People's  Action Party". Now, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

country is being asked to pay $52,000 for this act  of

glorification. It is monstrous, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

this little country of ours should have to pay such  a

big   sum  of  money.  Even  if  it  is  not  for  the

glorification  of  one political  party,  this  luxury

could  be ill-afforded by a little country like  ours.

In  future, I hope the Government is not going to  let

us  in for any more heavy expenditure. We can remember

our  National Day. We can send up our prayers, one way

or  the other. Perhaps a sum of a few thousand dollars

could  justifiably be spent. But $52,000, Mr Speaker,

is - I repeat - a luxury which this country can ill afford

to spend.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to enlighten the Member for Joo Chiat.  The

$52,000  was not spent entirely on the so-called  mass

parade  to glorify the P.A.P. In fact, a good part  of

the  expenditure  went to the purchase  of  decorative

material,  much  of  which,  through  wear  and  tear,

becomes useless after use on an occasion of this  kind

and had to be replaced. Moreover, the stock of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



equipment, especially in electrical fittings, with the

Public  Works  Department,  was  inadequate  for   big

festive  occasions of this nature. It is  intended  to

build  a pool of such equipment over a period of  time

and to make it available to meet all requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$52,000 is an insignificant figure when compared with

expenditure for similar events by other countries.  Of

the  $52,000, $41,320.80 was spent on decorations.  We

could  not  stop the rain. But if there  had  been  no

rain, the Member for Joo Chiat would have witnessed  a

performance by the people of Singapore to glorify  the

self-government that we have attained, not the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the Member for Joo Chiat has under-estimated the intelligence of the people of Singapore,

because  all  representatives of the  people  and  all

sections     of    communities    were    represented.

Unfortunately, the procession did not take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $52,000, only $2,403.91 was spent on the Prime

Minister's  luncheon which had to go  on  despite  the

rain. And the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's function at the

Istana Negara, which was not interrupted by the  rain,

cost us $2,673.61. If the Member for Joo Chiat thought

it  was  a good idea to celebrate our self-government,

then  he  should not have brought up this  unnecessary

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not questioning the

necessity for celebrating National Day, but I wish  to

raise  two  questions of principle. Mr  Speaker,  you

will notice that the National Day celebrations started

on  3rd  June  and ended on 6th June, 1960.  When  the

People's  Action Party came into power, they framed  a

Budget  which  they  presented to this  Assembly;  but

apparently they forgot this particular item  in  their

Budget.  Having  forgotten it, Sir - perhaps  they  were

hard pressed in framing that Budget, and I accept what

the  Minister for Finance has said, that they had only

a few months in between the framing of the  Budget

and the actual expenditure of this money - they now come

to  this  House  to seek its approval to  obtain  this

money which they had spent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point you will observe, Mr Speaker, is that

this  sum  has  been advanced out of the Contingencies

Fund. You may remember, Mr Speaker, that when it  was

queried in the House as to how the Contingencies  Fund

would be used, if I remember rightly, Mr Speaker, the

impression  I got was that it would only  be  used  on

occasions  when the Government had to spend  money  in

respect  of matters which they could not have foreseen

before   the   actual   time  of   expenditure.   This

expenditure  is a matter which I am sure the  People's

Action  Party  foresaw - they not only foresaw  it,  but

they  knew it must happen. Therefore, could I  suggest

to  the  Minister for Finance that in future  an  item

like this be covered in the Budget?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I certainly welcome the suggestion

of   the  Member  for  Farrer  Park,  but  a  word  of

explanation may be necessary as to why we adopted  the

procedure that we did. Members will know that this  is

the  first  occasion that celebrations on  this  scale

were  attempted by the present Government, and it  was

not  possible to budget in sufficient detail the  cost

for   all  the  various  activities  in  advance.  For

instance,  in the course of preparation,  it  was  the

experience  of  the  Government  that  more  and  more

associations,  groups of people, and  cultural  bodies

volunteered  to join in the festivities.  Accordingly,

it  was  felt that the method of budgeting in  advance

would  be  a difficult procedure to comply  with.  But

with  the  experience that we have gained, I think  it

should  be  possible  to budget  within  fairly  close

limits for future occasions of this sort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (4) of subhead 6 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Government took office,

and  particularly in the second half of the Government

last  year,  there have been a good many  changes  and

house  removals  of  Government  offices.  I  question

whether  these  removals were, in fact, necessary.  Of

course,  if  the costs of such removals were  not  the

high  sum  of  $50,000,  one might  be  a  little  bit

patient.  But  when there is such a big  sum  to  play

"general  post" within the Government, one  becomes  a

bit perturbed. The government of this country has been

evolved  through  decades, and there  have  been  many

commissions  of  inquiries into the  working  and  the

allocation  of  work and the placings of  the  various

Government  offices.  In one  foul  stroke,  this  new

Government  of  ours has started changing  things  all

round,  quite apart from the headaches the members  of

the public have when they want to go to any particular

department.  We  find  that there  has  not  been  any

radical  improvement. Where do all these changes  lead

us to? It is so easy for a new broom to say, "Well,  I

want  to  sweep clean, and I want to change everything

about."  Well, do  so  by all  means,  but  not,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  contend, at the costly  expense  of

$50,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to implement the

Government's declared policy of integrating  the  City

Council  and  the  Rural  Board  with  the  Government

Ministries,   and  also  the  need  to  organise   the

Ministries  themselves, and where possible  group  the

various departments under one Ministry together in one

building, it was necessary to carry out a programme of

reallocation  of  office  accommodation  for   various

Government   Ministries  and  departments.   For   the

information  of  the Member for Joo Chiat,  the  major

departmental  re-groupings and reorganisation  are  as

follows:  The  Land Office and the  Rural  Board  were

moved  from the Upper Pickering Street office  to  the

ground-floor of City Hall, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



Land  Office  being  a land-user  department.  The

Registry of Titles and the Registry of Deeds  have

been  moved to the ground-floor of the City  Hall,

whilst  the  Survey  Department  will  move  there

shortly. These are also land-user departments. The

Treasury,  the  Establishment  Office,  the  Audit

Office  and  the Accountant-General's Office  have

been  re-grouped  together with  the  Division  of

Commerce and Industry in Fullerton Building.  This

enables the departments under the Ministry of Home

Affairs,  including the Immigrant department,  the

Registry  of Citizenship, the Registry of  Persons

and  the Registry of Births and Deaths to  be  re-grouped in Empress Place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Engineer's Department and the City

Chief    Architect's   Department   were   earlier

regrouped   together   with   the   Public   Works

Department.   The  City  Hawkers'   and   Markets'

Department are to be re-grouped under arrangements

by the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the principle of integration was announced in the policy speech by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara at the beginning of this

Government's term of office. At that  time,  there

was  no  appreciable  opposition  to  integration,

reallocation  of  offices,  and  removal,  as  the

Member  for Joo Chiat has said, from one place  to

another.    Since   there   was   no   appreciable

opposition,  it is assumed that the  principle  of

integration  has  been  accepted  as  the  logical

process by which we can achieve an efficient and a

streamlined administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for actual cost, this is in fact negligible,

but  includes  such  items as  labour,  transport,

adjustment   of   office   needs   and   providing

facilities for the public and so on. Mr  Speaker,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



Saving  from the public from now onwards, both  in

time  and  in transportation, will be immeasurably

grater.  For  instance, it is more convenient  for

the   public,  if  they  have  to  go  to  several

departments in one Ministry, that they have  only

to  go  to  one  building where  business  can  be

cleared  possibly with one visit.  Similarly,  the

advantages  of  regrouping,  as  for  example,  by

having  land-user departments together, will  also

cut  down administrative procedure and costs, and

show   a   considerable   financial   saving.   An

expenditure of some tens of thousands  of  dollars

weighed  against  public time and convenience  and

the administrative efficiency can, therefore, only

be regarded as an essential investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $50,000 for Head D48 ordered to stand part of the Fourth

Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for 1960.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Heads of expenditure undisposed

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have recently

in  another  connection called  for  somewhat  similar

information as at 1st August, 1960, and the number  of

temporary  officers  in the public service,  excluding

those in the Ministries of Education and Health, as at

1st August, 1960, are as follows:



<pre>

          Division I                13

          Division II               51

          Division III             164

          Division IV              205

</pre>



<br><br>These figures include married women officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the temporary officers in the Ministries of

Education and Health are married women officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards non-citizens in temporary posts, I would

say  that  the number is not large. But  if  the  hon.

Member  wants  the  exact number,  together  with  the

salaries and allowances paid to all temporary officers

for  the period January to August 1960, I shall supply

them   shortly, he  present  regulations  on   entry

qualifications  into  the public  service  allow  non-citizens to be appointed to both

<div align="center"><b>CONSTRUCTION COST OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRES BUILT SINCE 1-7-59</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for public inquiry)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and Law (a) how many community centres have been built

since   1st   July,  1959,  and  what  is  the   total

construction  cost of these centres; (b)  whether  the

construction of all these community centres was  given

to  one  private  contractor without going  to  public

tender,  and why; (c) how does the Government fix  the

value  of  the construction; (d) whether the  previous

architect  for the building of community  centres  was

paid  architect fees by the Government or was given  a

cut  by the contractor; and (e) whether the Government

will  request the Board of Architects to make, or will

initiate  proceedings for, a public inquiry into  this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, as to the first part of the question

the  answer  is  that 11 community centres  have  been

built  since the 1st of July, 1959, and that the total

construction cost for these 11 community  centres  was

$306,403.13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second part of the question as to whether the

construction of all these community centres was  given

to  one  private  contractor without going  to  public

tender, and why, the answer is "yes". In August  1959,

the P.W.D. was very short of architects and engineers.

The ex-Minister for National Development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



knows  the  circumstances under  which  this  shortage

arose.  The  Director  of Public  Works  advised  that

private contractors should be engaged for this work. A

reliable contractor and a private architect were  then

engaged  to do this work. The Shaw Foundation and  the

Lee  Foundation, which provided most of the funds  for

the  building  of  these community  centres,  did  not

require  the  work  to  be put out  to  public  tender

because of their appreciation of the Ministry's desire

not  to  have any delays in the implementation of  the

building programme. The People's Association has since

taken  over the control of community centres from  the

Ministry  and  a  Tenders Committee of  the  Board  of

Management  will  take  over  the  work  of   building

community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of the question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`how does the Government fix the value of the

construction;'.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the  value  of  the

construction  was assessed on a certificate  from  the

architect that the price charged for each item of work

to  be  done was fair and reasonable, and scrutiny  of

the charges was made by officials of the Ministry. The

price  of  the small community centres we  have  built

compares  favourably( with that of the small community

centres  constructed by the former  Rural  Board.  The

medium-size community centres we have built at a price

of  about  $40,000 each have the floor  space  of  the

large  community  centres constructed  by  the  former

government at a cost of about $130,000 each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some details, Mr Speaker, Sir, which would

interest, the House. The medium-size centres  that  we

built at Havelock Road and at Banda Street - the cost of

the   centre  at  Havelock  Road  was  $42,000,  which

included   piling.  The  cost  of  the  Banda   Street

Community  Centre  was $36,900, and this  included  an

Arcron  structure provided by the Department of Social

Welfare.  The  area  of  the Havelock  Road  Community

Centre  is  2,590  square feet, with five  classrooms.

There is a hail, downstairs and in this hail there  is

a movable screen in between. If this movable screen is

removed, the floor space is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



increased  to  about 1,036 square feet,  so  that  the

total  of  the  floor space available at the  Havelock

Road  Community Centre is 3,626 square feet. The  area

of  the  Banda Street Community Centre is 2,944 square

feet,  with  five classrooms. There  is  also  a  hail

downstairs with a movable screen in between.  If  that

movable  screen  is removed, then  the  area  will  be

increased by 1,254 square feet, making the total  area

4,198  square feet. These are what we term medium-size

community  centres. We will compare these  medium-size

community  centres  with the old community  centre  at

Sims  Avenue.  The  total  area  of  the  Sims  Avenue

Community Centre is 2,596 square feet. There are three

classrooms  and one hail. That centre was put  out  to

tender and the price was $135,000. Now we come to  the

Changi Community Centre. There are two classrooms  and

one  hall.  The total area is 2,456 square feet.  This

centre  was put out to tender, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  and

the  cost  was $130,000; so that we have built  larger

community  centres which we term medium-size community

centres  for  about one-third of the  price  that  the

previous government paid for those community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of the smaller community centres - the

Minto  Road  Community Centre cost  us  $8,900.  That

included   an   Arcron  structure  supplied   by   the

Department  of  Social  Welfare  from  the   Singapore

Constitution  Exposition.  The  Beach  Road  Community

Centre  cost us $11,448. That also included an  Arcron

structure.  The  Kampong Glam  Community  Centre  cost

$14,581.  That included an Arcron structure.  The  Yio

Chu  Kang Community Centre cost $14,379. This included

an  Arcron structure. The Maude Road Community  Centre

which  was recently opened cost $15,613. There was  no

Arcron structure supplied. All the materials for  that

community  centre were supplied by the contractor.  If

we  compare these prices, Mr Speaker, Sir,  with  the

prices  for the small community centres built  by  the

Rural  Board, we find that the Changi Point  Community

Centre cost. $16,000 without sanitation. The Ama  Keng

Community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



Centre cost $12,500 without sanitation. The West Coast

Road Community Centre cost $11,000 without sanitation.

The  Jalan Eunos Community Centre, which is  the  most

modern of the old community centres, cost $25,000 with

modern  sanitation as against our prices. If  you  go

round and have a look at these community centres,  you

will  find  that  in the new small community  centres,

they   are   all  provided  with  basketball  pitches.

badminton  courts  and so on, which cost  more  money,

while  the other community centres have not got  those

amenities,  Sir.  That is the comparison  between  the

prices  of  work  that has been  done  by  a  reliable

contractor with the help of an architect and officials

of  the Ministry, and work that was previously put out

to tender by the previous government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to the fourth part of the question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`whether the previous architect for the building of

community  centres  was  paid architect  fees  by  the

Government or was given a cut by the contractor;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Shaw Foundation and the Lee

Foundation  received separate bills from the  previous

architect and the contractor for their work in respect

of  each community centre, and separate payments  were

made.  Where  payments  were  made  from  funds   made

available to the People's Association by the Treasury,

the  same procedure was followed. Out of this $306,000

about  $250,000  of  that money  came  from  the  Shaw

Foundation  and the Lee Foundation. The other  $50,000

came from the Treasury - the money that was voted by the

Assembly  for the People's Association. In every  case

where  payments  were made - whether the  payments  were

made by the Shaw Foundation or the Lee Foundation,  or

whether  the  payments  were made  by  the  Treasurer!

Secretary  and  the Deputy Chairman  of  the  People's

Association - there  were separate  bills  presented  in

every   case  by  the  contractor  and  the   previous

architect, and separate payments were in fact made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fifth part of the question, which is:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`whether the Government wilt request the Board of

Architects to make, or will initiate proceedings  for,

a public inquiry into this matter.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must inform the House that the Treasury tender

procedures are not applicable in the case of buildings

put up by private organisations for the Government, or

in  `the  case  of  buildings put up from  funds  made

available  to independent statutory bodies.  Al-though

not  put  out for public tender, the cost of the  work

has   been   carefully  scrutinized  by   professional

architects  and  Government officials  experienced  in

planning and designing community centres. Furthermore,

the allegation that the previous architect received  a

cut  from  the  contractor is  groundless.  For  these

reasons,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  a  public,  inquiry  by

Government or by the Board of Architects is not in the

least called for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, would the Government

consider abolishing the public tender system since  it

is so cheap to build without going to public tender?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It seems to be a different question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is

fair for me to answer that question, because if it  is

raised  seriously I think it is a matter which  really

concerns the Ministry of Finance. If I were to  relate

my  personal  experience with reference to  Government

tender procedures, the whole House will be shocked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I wonder if the Minister could tell the

House whether all the sums of money made available  by

the  Lee Foundation and the Shaw Foundation were  paid

into the Consolidated Fund?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not. The

agreement  that  we had was this. The works  would  be

undertaken, the bills would be duly presented to these

Foundations, and they would then undertake to  pay  up

to  the amounts that they had agreed to pay. There was

no actual transfer of cash between the Foundations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



and  the  Government. So the position, as has been,  I

think,  correctly  stated, is that  they  were  really

buildings  put up by these organisations on behalf  of

the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am I to understand that

these  funds  which  have been  provided  by  the  Lee

Foundation and the Shaw Foundation would not appear in

the public accounts of the State of Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir. I thought

that  that  was a very strange way of doing  business,

but  I  find that businessmen are more wise  in  these

matters than I myself. They say that if they keep  the

money  until it is wanted, they earn interest on  that

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, how was this special

contractor  selected?  is  it  because  he  had  given

satisfactory  private work to the Prime  Minister  and

other Ministers?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The first part of the question is

all  right,  but  if the hon. Member carries  on  with

inferences, he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I withdraw the second part of my

question, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You may remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

we   had  an  Exposition  just  after  we  became  the

Government. We wanted to show to the public  the  work

of  the  various  Ministries of  the  Government.  The

Finance Minister was very strict about expenditure. He

limited  us  to $2,000 each per stand. He  is  a  very

astute person in these matters. Mr Speaker, Sir.  One

day  he asked me to call at the Victoria Memorial Hall

to  see how the work of the stands was progressing.  I

paid a visit there, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I found that

whereas  all  the other Ministries were using  screens

for  stands, there was a beautiful structure going  up

at  the  Victoria  Memorial Hall for the  Ministry  of

National  Development. I looked around  and  I  found

that  a  contractor was engaged in this work.  I  duly

reported the fact to the Minister for Finance and so I

had  to go and get another contractor to do our  work.

The  contractor  that  I employed  knew  the  previous

architect.  We  have employed two architects  for  the

work on community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



centres.  The  criticism is  that  the  previous

architect is the man who is alleged to have got a  cut

from  the  contractor. This previous architect  was  a

colleague   of  my  ex-colleague,  the  Minister   for

National  Development, in Australia, and  he  disliked

this man intensely.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am endeavouring to cut out

personalities.  Perhaps the Minister will  assist  the

Chair by cutting out personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I have lost track of the question at the

moment, Mr Speaker, Sir. May I be reminded as to what

the question was?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> How was the contractor chosen?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He was not chosen. I myself have known him

to  be  a reliable contractor, and I depended  on  the

advice of my good friends. That is how he was selected

to do the work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when this building

was  going  up,  I  went round one day  with  the  ex-Minister for National Development to Kampong Bugis and

asked  him  to  help the poor people  there.  We  both

visited the community centre at Minto Road. He  looked

at  the work and said that it was very good indeed. He

also  said that we, as the Government, would  be  well

advised  to  carry on as we did and get  this  private

contractor to give us very good service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not know this

architect  and  where  he is  qualified.  But  is  the

Minister aware that the reason why this architect  did

not  continue with the job is that he was dissatisfied

with  the cut given to him by the contractor  who  was

introduced to the Minister by his good friends?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is completely untrue.

If  it were not for the fact that libellous statements

made  in  this House are absolutely privileged,  I  am

sure  the  ex-Minister for National Development  would

not dare to make those statements outside a place like

this forum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, would the Government

consider making an open inquiry into the whole matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We do not usually make inquiries into the

activities of people who have done us a

very good service.

to whether I should withdraw the last sentence of the

has been brought into operation.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* 11. To ask the Minister for labour and law what are

the  reasons  for  the nearly seven months'  delay  in

bringing   into  operation  the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance, 1960, which was assented to on the 25th  of

February, 1960; and when he intends to bring  it  into

operation.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member will get a reply

from the Minister. Perhaps the Member will just ask

the question.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, question No.

11.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to the first part of the

question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What are the reasons for the nearly seven months'

delay in bringing into operation the Industrial

Relations Ordinance, 1960, which was assented to on

the 25th of February, 1960;',



<br><br>this is the reply. It was necessary to house the Court

in  the  Supreme Court Building to add to the prestige

and  dignity  of the Court. We had to wait  until  the

Estate  Duty Office in the Supreme Court Building  was

vacated,  and  as  soon  as the  office  was  vacated,

building  of  the Court was commenced. Building  plans

were  made well in advance so that there was  no  time

lag between the vacation of the Estate Duty Office and

the commencement of building operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corrupt Practices Investigation Office below the

Estate Duty Office is to serve as the Registry of  the

Court, and this office will be vacated shortly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



Funds for the payment of the President, the Registrar

and  the subordinate staff have just been voted by the

Assembly, and we can get on with the job of making the

necessary  recruitments.  It  is  obvious   that   the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance could not  be  brought

into  force  until the Court House itself  was  nearly

ready.  There was nothing which the Ministry could  do

to speed up this work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second part of the question, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Industrial Relations Ordinance was  brought  into

force on 15th September this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Minister then

say  that  the first sitting of this Court is entirely

dependent upon the construction of the Court House, or

does   it  depend  on  legislation  which  is  to   be

introduced in this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The legislation has already been enacted

in  this  Assembly. The Industrial Relations Ordinance

has been enacted and it was brought into force on 15th

September.  I  do  not quite get the  point  that  the

Member for Farrer Park wishes to make.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I will be more explicit. Mr Speaker, Sir.

It  seems  to me that before the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance could be effectively brought into force,  it

needed  the support provided for in the new  Ordinance

known as the Trade Unions Ordinance. Now, would it  be

true  to  say that the Industrial Relations  Ordinance

would not be brought into effective operation until  a

new  Trade Unions Bill has been introduced and  passed

by the Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir, they are entirely

two  different  Ordinances. The  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance  deals  with  the  processes  of  collective

bargaining, trade disputes and the settlement of trade

disputes. It has nothing to do with the Trade  Unions.

Ordinance which is concerned with the registration  of

trade unions, their organisation, and their structure.

There is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



relationship   whatsoever   between   the   Industrial

Relations Ordinance and a Trade Unions Ordinance.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and  Law whether there exists an Agreement between the

Government  and the Civil Service whereby any  dispute

can  be  referred  to arbitration at  the  request  of

either  party;  and  to  state  the  reasons  for  not

referring the question of Pay Cut to arbitration until

the  Industrial  Relations Ordinance, 1960,  has  been

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to the first part of

this question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whether there exists an Agreement between the

Government  and the Civil Service whereby any  dispute

can  be  referred  to arbitration at  the  request  of

either party;',



<br><br>the answer is Yes, there is such an Agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second part of the question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to state the reasons for not referring the question

of   Pay  Cut  to  arbitration  until  the  Industrial

Relations  Ordinance,  1960,  has  been  brought  into

operation.',



<br><br>Mr Speaker. Sir, the Civil Service Staff Side Council

wrote  to me for the first time asking for arbitration

on  5th September, 1960. By that time plans were  well

advanced   for   bringing  the  Industrial   Relations

Ordinance  into  force. In fact, as I  have  mentioned

just now, the Ordinance was brought into force on 15th

September.  1960.  Under  this  Ordinance,  collective

bargaining  and  arbitration in the Civil  Service  is

subject  to  the  same  law as that  regulating  these

activities  in  private  employment,  and  arbitration

under the Agreement referred to would therefore not be

possible as it would be contrary to the provisions  of

section 30 of the Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it not within the

ambit  of  the Minister in charge of Staff matters  to

enable such a dispute to go to any arbitrator?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the procedures

that are available to either side under the Industrial

Relations   Ordinance,  there  is  a   procedure   for

negotiation - one side must serve a notice to  treat  on

the other, and so on, thereby bringing the dispute  to

the collective bargaining stage. If they deadlock then

there   are   procedures  under  the   Ordinance   for

conciliation. When conciliation breaks down, there  is

the  procedure  open  to them  for  reference  of  the

dispute  to  the Industrial Arbitration  Court.  Those

procedures must be followed.

other reasons?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan, there are a  number  of

reasons  for the regrettable decline in the number  of

students attending the national language classes.  The

main  reason  is,  of course, the  lack  of  sustained

interest  of the students. Like every other enterprise

of  a voluntary nature, there are many who join in the

first  flush of enthusiasm, but who abandon the course

when  they  find that the going is not  so  easy.  The

present  numbers probably represent the hard  core  of

persons genuinely interested in gaining proficiency in

the  national language. There is scope for  a  further

increase in enrolment for the national language  night

classes,  but  the  efforts  of  the  Lembaga  Gerakan

Pelajaran   Dewasa  in  this  field  are   necessarily

circumscribed  by  the availability  of  suitable  and

qualified instructors in the national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



language,  of  which  fact I am sure  the  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan is aware. But the  Lembaga  Gerakan

Pelajaran Dewasa is sparing no effort in its endeavour

to spread knowledge of the national language, and once

its  teething troubles are over, a rise in the  number

of  students  may  be expected. The  hon.  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan is probably aware that the  Lembaga

Gerakan   Pelajaran  Dewasa  is  presently  conducting

special courses for teachers to teach the students. It

takes some time to produce a good teacher.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an Address be sent to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in the following terms:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Assembly has learned with deep sorrow of the

death of His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of  the

Federation  of  Malaya, and pray that Your  Excellency

will  be  pleased to convey to the Government  of  the

Federation of Malaya this Assembly's deep sense of the

loss which the whole country has sustained, and their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



profound  sympathy with the Raja Permaisuri Agong  and

the  late Yang di-Pertuan Agong's family and with  the

Government and people of the Federation of Malaya.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the late Yang di-Pertuan Agong held office

for only five months, nonetheless in that brief period

he  has  enhanced the dignity of the position  of  the

Constitutional  Head  of State  and  so  in  this  way

advanced the cause of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the people of the Federation in particular, the

death  of  the late Yang di-Pertuan Agong has  been  a

severe loss. In less than one year the Federation  has

lost  two Rulers who were held in high esteem not only

by  the  people  of Negri Sembilan and Selangor,  from

where  their Highnesses came, but also by  the  people

throughout the Federation itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the people of Singapore, I would like to

extend  the  sympathy  of  this  House  to  the   Raja

Permaisuri Agong and the late Yang di-Pertuan  Agong's

family  and to the people of the Federation of  Malaya

over  the loss of an esteemed and respectable Head  of

State.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as a Member of the Opposition, it is my duty  to

offer my condolences over the recent loss of the  Yang

di-Pertuan Agong of the Federation of Malaya.  We  are

fully  aware  that this is a great loss  to  the  Raja

Permaisuri Agong and her family in particular and  the

people throughout the Federation in general. His  late

Majesty  held  the post of Yang di-Pertuan  Agong  for

only  five  months.  Therefore,  we,  the  people   of

Singapore,  not  only those of the Islamic  faith  but

others too, feel a deep sense of sorrow over the  loss

of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Agong, who was held  in  high

esteem  by the people of the Federation of Malaya.  It

is  hoped that the late Yang di-Pertuan Agong would be

a shining example to the future generation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an Address be sent to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in the following terms:-

<div align="center"><b>CURRENCY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His

Excellency's recommendation to proceed with the  Bill.

I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the changes in the political status and

economic   circumstances  of  the  five  Participating

Governments  represented on the Board of Commissioners

of  Currency,  Malaya and North Borneo,  it  was  felt

necessary to revise the 1950 Currency Agreement, which

was   the   working  basis  of  the  Currency   Board.

Representatives of the five Participating  Governments

accordingly met in Kuala Lumpur in February this year,

and   after   considerable  discussion,  settled   and

initialled a new Currency Agreement as set out in  the

Schedule  to this Bill. Each Government then undertook

to enact the appropriate legislation to ratify the new

Currency  Agreement as early as possible so  that  the

new   Agreement  could  be  brought  into  force.  The

Federation  of Malaya, Sarawak and North  Borneo  have

already enacted appropriate legislation, and a similar

purpose is intended for Singapore by the Currency Bill

now laid before the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need explain the provisions of the

Bill  itself, which are simple or will be  clear  from

the  Explanatory  Statement.  But  in  regard  to  the

Currency  Agreement set out in the Schedule, I  should

point out some of the major provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as is befitting the sovereign nation of the

Federation  of  Malaya, the self-governing  State  of

Singapore,  the  State of Brunei,  Sarawak  and  North

Borneo,  the new Agreement provides that the  Currency

Board   should  be  responsible  to  only   the   five

Participating Governments. Under the old 1950 Currency

Agreement,  a Participating Government could  abrogate

the  Agreement  only with the approval of  the  United

Kingdom  Secretary of State for the Colonies.  Another

clause provided that the Secretary of State should  be

the    arbitrator   in   any   dispute   between   the

Participating Governments, and his approval had to  be

obtained  even  for relatively less important  matters

such  as the design of new notes and coins. Under  the

new Agreement, no reference whatsoever is necessary to

the  authority  of  the Secretary  of  State,  as  all

references  to  him  have  been  deleted  in  the  new

Agreement.  The essence of the Agreement is  that  the

Board  of Commissioners of Currency is now responsible

to  the Participating Governments, whose decisions  on

almost all important points must be unanimous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for reasons which the Singapore Government

is  in  agreement, the Federation of  Malaya  is  now

given  increased representation on the Currency Board.

Of  the  seven  members on the  Board,  two  will  the

appointed by the Federation of Malaya Government,  and

one  each  by  the  Governments of Singapore,  Brunei,

Sarawak   and   North   Borneo,  together   with   one

independent member whose appointment must be with  the

unanimous  consent  of the Participating  Governments.

The Singapore and Federation representatives will have

three  votes each, while the other members  will  only

have  one  vote each. It can, therefore, be seen  that

the  Federation  Government will  have  a  predominant

voting strength of six votes, and it also provides the

Chairman of the Board in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



the  person  of  probably the Honourable  the  Finance

Minister  as well. The Singapore representative  would

be the Deputy Chairman of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, which is probably the most important in our

viewpoint, is that the new Agreement provides for  the

investment of a portion of the assets of the  Currency

Fund   in   the   territories  of  the   Participating

Governments. The 1950 Currency Agreement provides only

restricted  avenues  of investment,  and  we  saw  the

strange phenomenon of the assets of territories  which

needed  development  finance urgently  being  invested

overseas  and  used for financing the  development  of

other  countries,  some of which are financially  more

affluent  than  ourselves. Although it  is  recognised

that  reserves  of the Board should at  all  times  be

adequate to maintain confidence in the Malayan dollar,

it  was  felt  that  at the same time  assets  of  the

Currency  Fund should be mobilised to some  extent  in

initiating  the economic development of the  countries

the  Board serves. Hence clause 10 (4) of the new Bill

provides  for  the investment of not  more  than  $300

million  of  the  assets  of  the  Currency  Fund   in

securities  guaranteed  by any  of  the  Participating

Governments, to be spread over a period of three years

from the date when the Agreement comes into force. The

distribution   of  assets  for  local  investment   is

governed by the Third Schedule to the Agreement, which

provides   that   the   reserves   available   to    a

Participating Government shall be determined  directly

by  its  share in the profits of the Currency  Surplus

Fund  in  the preceding financial year. In  turn,  the

share of profits is governed by the Second Schedule to

the   Agreement,  where,  broadly,  the  formula   for

distribution  is  based  on  the  amount  of  currency

circulating  in  the  three territorial  divisions  of

Borneo, Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. On the

basis  outlined above, Singapore's share of  the  $300

million  of the assets of the Currency Fund  available

for  investment in the securities of the Participating

Governments   is  about  $60  million.  An   important

provision  in the Second Schedule to the Agreement  is

that   under  section  (iii)  the  method  of   profit

apportionment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



may  from time to time be varied by agreement  between

the  Governments  concerned, and  with  the  unanimous

approval of all Participating Governments. The door is

therefore  open  for Singapore and the  Federation  of

Malaya to undertake discussion to review the method of

profit sharing between the two territories. Any change

in the profit sharing formula would in turn affect the

assets available for investment in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, clauses in the new Currency Agreement

provide  for,  and  anticipate  the  future,  when   a

Participating Government may wish to withdraw from the

Currency Agreement, thus leading to the dissolution of

common  currency  arrangements  provided  by  the  new

Agreement. Clause 17 of the Agreement stipulates  that

when  any  Participating Government wishes to withdraw

from  the Agreement, a notice must be lodged with  the

Currency  Board 18 months prior to the date of  actual

withdrawal.  This period is regarded  as  the  minimum

time during which other Participating Governments  can

make alternative arrangements. The clauses that follow

up to clause 20 are clauses providing for the winding-up  of  the  Board should any Government withdraw.  At

this  point,  I  should perhaps  say  that  while  the

Federation  Government has agreed to the new  Currency

Agreement,  it  at  best  contains  provisions  for  a

transitional period from a common currency arrangement

to  one where she will be able to control and regulate

her own currency. It is thought unlikely that she will

continue  a  common  Currency Agreement  indefinitely.

However,  the  new  Agreement is a  working  basis  to

gradually transform the present currency structure  to

a more independent one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the new Currency Agreement will at one and

the  same  time  ensure the stability of  the  Malayan

dollar and enable a part of the Currency Fund's assets

to be used for financing our own economic development.

It also provides for the future through the winding-up

clauses, and yet is solidly linked to the present.  In

conclusion, I need not Stress that it will secure the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



maintenance of a sound, stable and respected  currency

which  is  a  prerequisite for economic stability  and

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>CUSTOMS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  have His Excellency  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's recommendation to proceed  with  the

Bill. I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should perhaps explain why Government

considers  it necessary to take the Bill  through  all

the  three stages today. The House will be aware that,

with  effect  from today, the Government  has  imposed

protective  duties on the import of washing  soap.  At

the  same  time,  the Government has  liberalised  the

imports  of  washing soap. Previously the  imports  of

washing soap were placed under special licensing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 29th October, 1959, the report of the

Committee to consider the imposition of duties on  the

imports  of hard soap and detergents was presented  to

the Assembly. The Committee recommended the imposition

of import duty on washing soap as a measure to protect

the  local industry. It was not possible, for  reasons

which  I shall explain later, to introduce such duties

forthwith.  Accordingly it was decided  to  place  the

import  of washing soap on special licence with  quota

ceilings  based  on  previous  performance.  Now  this

action  could be justified under the General Agreement

on  Tariffs and Trade only as a temporary measure.  It

was necessary to regulate soap imports principally  to

prevent  speculative hoarding of a commodity on  which

an  import  duty  was expected to be imposed.  Certain

amendments  have  to  be made to existing  legislation

before  proper  administration of the  duty  could  be

enforced. At the same time, the Customs Ordinance was

due  for  a general overhaul, and it was thought  that

this new amendment should go into the general revision

of  the  Ordinance. Thus what was intended as a short-term  temporary expedient turned out to have a longer

life than was originally anticipated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the introduction of these duties, Government

was  faced  with  two alternative  courses  of  action

regarding  the mechanics and timing of this Bill.  The

first  alternative was to wait until the new Bill  was

introduced,  and  to impose a duty  under  the  powers

derived there-from. It would still have been necessary

to  take  the  Bill through all three stages  at  once

because   of  the  complaints  that  the  Government's

regulation of the import of washing soap was  contrary

to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to which

we   are   bound.  It  was  felt  that   under   these

circumstances  to  take  the Bill  through  all  three

stages  without  at  the same time  giving  the  House

sufficient  reason  therefore would  be  unreasonable.

However,  because the interval between the passing  of

the  Bill and its coming into force would take several

days, to give reasons justifying such action may  lead

to  the  hoarding and rapid increase in the  price  of

imported



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>





washing   soap.  The  second  alternative  which   the

Government has chosen is to impose a duty under powers

derived from the existing Ordinance and then introduce

a  new  Bill in order that the implementation of these

duties may be made easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now why is this so? Under the existing Ordinance, the

Comptroller has no power as such to decide  whether  a

commodity is dutiable or not until an order  has  been

made  under section 11 of the Ordinance, although such

powers  are  implied, for example, in section  42  and

section  73  (1) . By contrast, clause 23 of  the  Bill

specifically  provides that the  Comptroller  has  the

power  to decide. This is of particular importance  in

the  case  of  soap, because, at present there  is  an

import  duty  only on washing soap and not  on  toilet

soap or synthetic detergents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the existing Ordinance does not provide for

duty  drawback except on tobacco. Thus, if an importer

imports   washing   soap,  pays   duty   thereon   and

subsequently  re-exports such soap, the law  does  not

provide  for  duty drawback. Clause  69  of  the  Bill

provides  for  the possibility of duty drawback  under

conditions in which the goods are identifiable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 of the Bill also amplifies the definition

of  "value" for Customs purposes. At present the  duty

on  soap is a specific duty, and, therefore, the  need

for  this amplification does not arise. But in  future

it  is conceivable that some duties would be fixed  on

an  ad-valorem basis. For this reason, it is necessary

to  have  a clearer definition of "value" for  Customs

purposes.  The  present rather limited  definition  of

"value" is contained in section 3 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for additional powers,

including -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the power for the Minister to appoint

all members of the Liquors Licensing Board which is to

replace  the  present Board of Licensing  Justices  of

which  three  members are at present  elected  by  the

Justices of the Peace from among their number;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



the  power  for the Comptroller to determine  whether

any  goods  come  under  the  dutiable  or  prohibited

categories presented to the Minister's order, so  that

possible  delays  due  to the  necessity  of  frequent

references to the Minister may be avoided;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the power for senior Customs officers to issue search

warrants  and  to conduct searches. This will  replace

the present practice of appointing Customs officers to

be Justices of the Peace as and when they require such

power. This practice is administratively undesirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there is the power for proper officers of

customs to determine the proportion of goods which are

to  be  opened and examined and tested, and to  remove

the confusion regarding the interpretation of a 10 per

centum tax as is required at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other major amendments include the transfer of the

responsibility for the collection of a special tax  on

heavy  oil  engined vehicles from the  Comptroller  of

Customs to the Registrar of Vehicles to facilitate the

payment of tax by the owners of such vehicles, and the

reduction  of  the amounts of drawback  duty  paid  on

tobacco allowed to the manufacturer from the whole  of

the  duty  paid to seven-eights of the  duty  paid  to

allow for the recovery of administrative cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a consolidating

Bill  of  the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 160) and  all

other subsequent Ordinances which have amended Chapter

160  of  our laws. While consolidating the Ordinances,

the  Government has availed itself of the  opportunity

to  introduce new clauses which, in its view, help  to

clarify  the  Customs Ordinance  or  to  give  to  the

Comptroller  of Customs certain definite added  powers

which  would  enable  him  to administer  the  Customs

Ordinance more effectively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on a number of occasions I have

spoken   in   this  Assembly  against  the  increasing

practice  of  the  Government to  introduce  Bills  on

Certificates   of  Urgency.  In  this  instance,   the

Opposition  is  obliged to the Government  for  having

sent this Bill two days earlier. On other occasions we

were faced with Bills being laid on the Table when  we

got  here. I am glad that the Minister for Finance  in

his  Second Reading speech, has explained why  it  has

been  necessary  to take this Bill through  all  three

stages today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my own view is that no

consolidating Bill, with certain amendments  put  into

it because the Government wants to avail itself of the

opportunity to tidy up the Bill, should be put through

in  this  Assembly,  or any other  Assembly  for  that

matter, in one day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that if this Bill had not been taken through all its three readings today, the

Government  might have been faced with the possibility

of  hoarding  in  soaps  which  have  now  come  under

taxation  and, therefore, that would lead to  loss  of

revenue. With great respect to the Minister, I beg  to

differ. I think the Comptroller has sufficient  powers

under  the existing Ordinance to declare soap  of  the

kind  which  has  been  declared  dutiable  today   as

dutiable, and to see that duty thereon is collected as

from  today.  The  proposed Bill  will  not  give  the

Government any further powers in that matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take it that it is under section 11 (2) of the

existing Ordinance that this new declaration that duty

is  payable on soap has been gazetted. The  clause  in

the new Bill is identically the same. It has given the

Government no greater powers. The question of hoarding

only  arises  when people know that the Government  is

going  to  bring in a particular category of goods  on

the taxation list. Then they rush to hoard those goods

before the Government puts them on its taxation  list.

In this case, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has the

power  to  put  any article which it so  wishes  under

section 11 (2) of the existing Ordinance. Therefore, I

submit, with great respect to the Minister, that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



it  was  completely  unnecessary  to  move  this  Bill

through  all its three stages today merely  to  defeat

the hoarders. Sir, I agree that substantially the Bill

is exactly the same as the Customs Ordinance as it now

is. But there are a number of new additions on which I

feel  I  am  not competent to speak because  they  are

matters  which  affect the trading community  and  the

system  of carrying on a business or a trade. I  would

have  felt  happier if this Assembly could  have  been

able  to  pass  it  after all responsible  views  with

regard  to  trading and mercantile  matters  had  been

consulted  and  given  effect to.  I  understand,  Mr

Speaker,  that  there is a Trade Advisory  Council.  I

wonder whether the new amendments have been put to the

Trade Advisory Council and what their views are on the

amendments  put  to them. I believe  such  a  Council

exists. If I remember rightly, the Government has said

that  in  all  matters affecting  trade  and  business

interests, this Council would be consulted before  any

legislation is put through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point on which I wish to touch in

this speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I will elaborate on

that  point in the Committee stage. In respect of this

point  I  have filed an amendment, a copy of  which  I

have  already given to the Minister for Finance. As  I

see  it, Mr Speaker, there are at the moment only two

classes  of  goods which are liable to taxation  under

the existing Ordinance. Section 11 (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be charged, levied and paid such duties

on intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum imported

into   or  manufactured  in  the  Colony  as  may   be

prescribed  from  time to time by the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara by order published in the Gazette.'.



<br><br>So  that we get under subsection (1), Mr Speaker, the

goods,  "intoxicating  liquor, tobacco  and  petroleum

imported  into  or manufactured in the Colony".  These

three   types  of  goods  are  taxable.   Then   under

subsection   (2)  is  another  class  of  goods.   The

subsection reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where, on consideration of the report of a committee

of  not  less  than  three persons appointed  for  the

purpose  by  the  Minister,  by  notification  in  the

Gazette,  in  respect of any goods specified  in  that

notification, it appears to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



having  regard to the need for protecting any industry

which is established or is about to be established for

the manufacture of any goods in the Colony...'.



<br><br>Then  to  protect those interests the  Government  can

list  certain goods in a Gazette notification.  It  is

under that subsection (2) that the Government has this

morning listed soap as dutiable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try to convince the Minister

that,  although  he says that this is a  consolidating

Bill,  it  does not take the powers of the  Government

any  further than it has today. I will try to convince

him  that  under  the  proposed  clause  11  (1) ,  the

Government  has  brought  in  yet  another   category,

perhaps  unintentionally. But I will not elaborate  on

that at the moment, Mr Speaker. I will do so when  we

are in Committee. Other than that, Mr Speaker, I have

nothing  to say about this Bill. This is substantially

a consolidating Bill, as the Minister has said, except

perhaps for this over-sight and for certain matters to

which,  if he has consulted trading interests  and  if

they   have  agreed, we  will  certainly   have   no

objection.



<br><br>5.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

seems  to  me  that this very important Bill  marks  a

major  change in the economic policy of the  State  of

Singapore.  I may be wrong, Sir, but it  looks  as  if

this  Bill  will mean that the Government is beginning

to  shift,  shall we hope gradually, from a policy  of

free trade to that of protective tariffs. Sir, we  are

at  one  with  the Government in wanting to  encourage

industrialisation in Singapore. But if in the  process

of encouraging industrialisation it is in such a hurry

that  it spoils the entrepot trade before we are ready

to have enough industries, then the results may not be

as  advantageous as we have expected and may  even  be

injurious.  We know, Sir, that even among the  traders

the  question of protection and free trade has aroused

a great deal of controversy. From the consumers' point

of  view, of course, nobody wants to pay more  for  an

imported  product on which increased duties have  been

imposed,  or for a local product which may be inferior

in  quality.  I  would suggest,  Sir,  that  with  the

implementation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



of  this new policy great care should be taken that we

do  not  cause more unemployment, because  if  due  to

imposition  of new duties we put out of  employment  a

certain  number  of people and industries  created  or

protected  are  not  able to give employment  to  more

people,  then in the long run we shall have  a  bigger

unemployment problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of .the controversial nature of this new

policy of increased protection, we on this side of the

House  think  that an important Bill like this  should

not be rushed through on a Certificate of Urgency.  In

the  past,  whenever very important Bills  had  to  be

passed,  the public were given a chance to  study  the

clauses  of  the  Bills so that if  they  thought  the

clauses should be amended, they would have the  chance

at least to put forward their views to the Government.

But as it is, of course, we have just got to accept  a

fait  accompli. We hope, Sir, that this  procedure  of

getting Bills through on Certificates of Urgency  will

not become the normal procedure in this House, because

thereby  we  defeat  the very  purpose  of  having  an

Assembly. Sir, although the Government will be able to

push   through  this  Bill,  we  hope  that   in   the

implementation thereof great care should be  taken  so

that where increased duties are suggested which may be

of  a controversial nature, they should go slow on it.

It  is no use giving up a bird in the hand in the hope

of  getting  two  birds  in  the  bush,  if  we  cause

unemployment  among those who depend on  the  entrepot

trade in the hope of giving employment to those to  be

employed in factories.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall first

deal  with  the  comments of the  Member  for  Tanglin

because  I  think  he is labouring  under  a  complete

misconception of what this Bill is about, it will  not

take me long to correct this misconception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member is under the impression that this

Bill  introduces a major change in the economic policy

of  the Government of Singapore. Further, he seems  to

labour  under the impression that the act  itself  of

passing the Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



would introduce new taxes. I do not think he has  been

very  diligent in his homework, because it would  have

been very obvious from the explanatory notes that this

Bill does not in itself introduce any new duties.  For

the  most  part, it consolidates the existing  Customs

Ordinance, but it allows a certain modification of the

administrative procedures so that new  duties  as  and

when  they  are  imposed by the  Government  could  be

effectively administered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the new duties that would be imposed under

clause  11 (2) of the Bill, the one immediately before

the State, of course, is that on soap. I have referred

to  the  Report  of the Tariff Advisory  Committee  on

Soap.  And it is this procedure that will be  followed

by  the  Government  before any  new  import  duty  is

imposed.  That is to say, a Committee will be  set  up

under  clause 11; the public will have an  opportunity

to  make  representations to the Committee  either  in

favour of or against any new import duty. That was the

procedure  we  adopted  before  we  decided  upon  the

imposition of duties on washing soap. So much for  the

hon. Member's misgivings. Indeed they are all based on

a  complete  misunderstanding of the purpose  of  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to reply to the Member for Farrer Park. He was

in some doubt as to whether it was really necessary to

pass  the  Bill  through all stages  today.  He  quite

rightly  pointed out that there could be  very  little

fear from the point of view of loss of revenue. We are

not  so much worried about the loss of revenue because

the  import of washing soap is already regulated,  and

it  is  not possible for any importer today to  import

greater  quantities  than  his  quota.  What  we   are

concerned  with are the repercussions that  this  Bill

could have on the market for soap. There would be some

uncertainty as to the amount of duty and the timing of

the  imposition of the duty. By and large, this  would

have  a  disturbing and upsetting effect on the market

for soap. Therefore, in order to avoid any possibility

of  this,  we  decided  to act quickly  and  carry  it

through - the  two operations of imposing the  duty  and

passing this Bill today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has stated that, in his

opinion, the existing Ordinance is quite adequate.  It

is  adequate for the imposition of duties  on  washing

soap,  but  it  is  not  adequate  for  the  effective

administration,  because when you come  to  particular

commodities,  there  may be  doubt  as  to  whether  a

particular  brand of soap is to be considered  washing

soap,  or  toilet soap, or any other form of soap.  In

this  Bill, clause 32 (2) gives the Comptroller  power

to  make  a  decision  on  the  subject  so  that  the

administration  of  revenue  collection  will  not  be

bogged down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the need to refer to mercantile interests,

I  have already explained, in my remarks on the  views

of  the  Member for Tanglin, that commercial interests

have adequate opportunity to make their views known to

the  Tariff Advisory Committee on Soap. As regards the

general  provisions of this Bill, they concern largely

the  administration  of this Bill.  There  is  nothing

controversial  at  all about these provisions  because

they are, by and large, adopted from the corresponding

Ordinance which has already been in operation  in  the

Federation of Malaya for a long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.05 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 10 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I have drafted an amendment and have

handed it to the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly. I

believe he has made copies of it. May I therefore, Mr

Speaker, Sir, formally move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 8, lines 8 and 9, to leave out "any goods

made dutiable on import or manufacture and", and there

to  insert "imported into or manufactured in Singapore

and on".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Member would like to

consider this a little further. I think what he really

wishes to do is perhaps to reinstate more or less  the

wording  of  the original subsection of the Ordinance,

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) There shall be charged, levied and paid such

duties on intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum

imported into or manufactured...'.



<br><br>So that, if the Member would agree, the words to leave

out would be -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`petroleum, any goods made dutiable on import or

manufacture and'



<br><br>and insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and petroleum imported into or manufactured in

Singapore and on.'



<br><br>That would then bring in all the words of his

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am obliged to you, Sir. The purpose of

this amendment is merely to bring the proposed clause

into line with what I consider are the provisions  of

the existing law. The provisions of the existing law, Mr Speaker, Sir, are in section 11 of the Ordinance -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) There shall be charged, levied and paid such

duties  on  intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum

imported into or manufactured in the Colony as may  be

prescribed  from  time to time by the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara by order published in the Gazette.'



<br><br>That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the first category of goods

in respect of which duty may be charged. And it is the

law  itself  which  says  that, intoxicating  liquor,

tobacco  and petroleum shall be chargeable with  duty.

And  the quantum of duty is also provided for in  that

section.   Subsection  (2)  of  section  11   of   the

Ordinance, Mr Speaker, Sir, provides that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where a committee of not less than three persons

appointed for the purpose by the Minister...'



<br><br>have  made  certain recommendations  which  have  been

forwarded  to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  and  if  on

perusal of that document it appears to him that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`having regard to the need for protecting any

industry  which  is  established or  is  about  to  be

established  for the manufacture of any goods  in  the

Colony  and to the interests of the entrepot trade  of

the  Colony in respect of such goods, it is  expedient

to  impose duties on the import of such goods, he  may

by order published in the Gazette prescribe the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>





duties  to  be levied and paid on such goods  imported

into  the  Colony and such duties shall  thereupon  be

charged, levied and paid:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no duties shall be charged or levied

under  this  subsection on any textiles imported  into

the Colony.'



<br><br>So  that  in addition, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the  first

category  set  out in subsection (1),  subsection  (2)

sets out that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara may go beyond

intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum. Therefore,

the  goods  in  respect of which the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  may  go  over  and above subsection  (1),  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, are goods in respect of which a  report

has  been  submitted to him by a committee  of  three.

Now,  if  the Minister accepts that position,  and  if

that  is  the correct expose of the present  position,

let  us now therefore look at the present proposed new

clause.  The  proposed new clause, as I read  it,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, seems to set out three categories:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) There shall be charged, levied and paid to the

Comptroller   such  customs  duties  on   intoxicating

liquor, tobacco, petroleum,'



<br><br>that is the first category, Mr Speaker. Sir, as set

out in subsection (1) of the existing law. Then -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`any goods made dutiable on import or manufacture'.



<br><br>This, in my view, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the second

category which is not provided for in the  xisting

law. And then, the third category -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and any goods made dutiable by an order under

subsection (2) of this section which are imported into

or manufactured in Singapore, as may be prescribed by

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara by order published in the

Gazette.'



<br><br>This  third category here, Mr Speaker, is the  second

category  provided  for under subsection  (2)  of  the

existing  Ordinance.  So that if  this  clause  as  it

stands becomes law, we will get the position where the

Government  can  impose duty on  intoxicating  liquor,

tobacco and petroleum by virtue of sub-clause (1). And

Government  can  also impose duty on  any  goods  made

dutiable on import or manufacture, and such goods need

not  be goods which come under sub-clause (2).  So  we

get to the position where we have three categories  of

goods - intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum;  any

goods made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



dutiable  on  import or manufacture; and  any  goods

made dutiable under sub-clause (2). But we could quite

easily delete the whole of the clause and say -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be charged, levied and paid to the

Comptroller such customs duties on any goods as may be

prescribed  by  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  by  order

published in the Gazette.';



<br><br>because the greater must include the, less. "Any goods

made  dutiable  on  import  or  manufacture"  is   the

greater.  Therefore,  it must  include  the  less,  in

respect  of which a report has been submitted  to  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is with me up to now, then I think he

will  agree with me, Sir, because he has said  in  his

reply on the Second Reading that the intention of the

Government, is not to impose duty on goods in  respect

of   which  the  public  have  not  been  allowed  the

opportunity to make their representations. Subject  to

what the Minister has to say. Mr Speaker, I think the

intention  was not to extend this new Bill beyond  the

ambit of the existing law. Perhaps this has been wrong

drafting, and I will therefore let the Minister  speak

on that for the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In regard to the imposition of new

duties,  it  is  as I have said in my  Second  Reading

speech. And in view of the comments made by the Member

for Farrer Park, I will accept the amendment if it  is

as amended by you, Sir.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish to speak on the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker. Sir, I was

regarded as having misapprehended the Bill because  of

what  I  said.  But  I  was  apprehensive  about  this

particular clause because in the Explanatory Statement

it  is stated that the power to levy customs duty  has

been  extended to include all goods. I am glad  indeed

that  the  Minister  for  Finance  has  accepted   the

amendment proposed by the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11, as amended, ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I propose to take clauses 12 to 22

inclusive,  unless there is any Member who  wishes  to

speak on any particular clause in between. Before I do

that.  I  wonder if the Minister for Finance  will  be

able  to  indicate any consequential amendments  which

may have to be made in view of the amendment to clause

11.  When I come to clause 23, I will point that  out.

Clause 22, I think, is all right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 to 22 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister would like to look

at  this  clause  to see whether there  should  be  an

amendment. I am just wondering whether in line 33  the

words `under subsection (1) or' ought to be deleted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I say something on that, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I had considered the possibility of the

ramifications  of one amendment, and I did  think,  in

the first instance, that possibly clause 22 and clause

23  should  be  amended. But on further reflection,  I

found  that it was not necessary because it  is  under

sub-clause (1) of clause 11 that intoxicating  liquor,

tobacco  and  petroleum come. You have  two  types  of

goods  on  which duty may be levied, tinder sub-clause

(1)  of  clause  11, it would be liquor,  tobacco  and

petroleum: and under sub-clause (2) of the same clause

it would be in respect of matters on which there is  a

recommendation  by  a three-man committee.  You  still

have  the  two categories - one category leviable  under

sub-clause  (1)  and the other under  sub-clause  (2).

Possibly because of that, Sir, I did not suggest  that

clause 22 and clause 23 should be amended.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am just trying to indicate to the

Minister  that  perhaps in so  far  as  clause  22  is

concerned, it is all right because this cause concerns

custom duty; whereas clause 23 deals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



with the question of goods deemed to be dutiable,  and

that is different. Clause 23 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any question arises as to whether any particular

goods  are  or  are not included in a class  of  goods

appearing  in  an order made under subsection  (I)  or

under  subsection (2) of section ii of the  Ordinance,

such question shall be decided by the Comptroller.'



<br><br>In view of the amendment to clause 11, there does not

seem  to  be any order of that nature which  could  be

made  under subsection (1) . Perhaps I might also  draw

attention to cause 32 along the same line of  thought.

Clause 32, sub-clause (2) now reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any question arises as to whether any particular

goods  are  or  are not included in a class  of  goods

appearing  in  an order made under subsection  (1)  of

this  section, such question shall be decided  by  the

Comptroller.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I speak subject to correction by

such  legal illuminati that may be in the House today.

It  looks  to me that it would be an order made  under

subsection (1), and that would relate not to the class

of  goods  but  to  the rate of  duty  that  would  be

1.eviable  on  liquor, tobacco and  petroleum.  So  an

order  would be necessary to give effect to subsection

(1).  Clause 23 gives the power to decide whether  any

particular  goods  would come  under  the  classes  of

intoxicating liquor, tobacco and petroleum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister is satisfied, I will

put the Question on clause 23 then.

consider sub-clause (2) to see whether he is

satisfied. To fall in line with clause 23, ought not

the words `or under subsection (2)' be added after

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Acquisition Ordinance (Chapter 248) lays

down  the  procedure  to  be  followed  when  land  is

required  for a public purpose. Briefly the  procedure

is  that after the declaration under section 5 of  the

Ordinance that the land is needed for a public purpose

or  for a Company under Part VII of the Ordinance, the

Collector of Land Revenue causes notices to be  posted

at  convenient places on or near the land to be taken,

stating that the Government intends to take possession

of  the  land and that claims to compensation for  all

interests  therein  may be made to  him.  This  notice

under section 8 (1) of the Ordinance fixes a date  for

the   enquiry,   not  earlier  than  21   days   after

publication of the notice. Possession of the land  can

only  be taken after this enquiry is held and an award

made under section 10 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, section 17 (1) of the Ordinance provides

that in cases of urgency when the Minister so directs,

the Collector, though no such award has been made, may

on  the expiration of 15 days from the publication  of

the notice under section 8 (1), take possession of any

waste or arable land needed for public purposes or for

a  Company. Thus this section, which seeks to  provide

for  a more expeditious acquisition procedure in cases

of  urgency, nevertheless has been rendered  virtually

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>6.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a short and simple Bill to dispense with the

statutory   requirement  of  having  to   revise   the

registers of electors in 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Singapore Legislative Assembly

Elections  Ordinance requires the  electoral  register

for  each  electoral division to be  revised  annually

before 15th September in each year, or such later date

in  that  year  as may be appointed by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for the purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last revision of these registers was completed in

December 1959. As the next general election will be in

1964,  it is considered by the Government that with  a

view   to  economy,  the  revision  of  the  electoral

registers  in  1960 be dispensed with.  About  $50,000

will be saved by dispensing with the revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-revision of the registers does not mean that

no  work  will  be  done on the registers.  Work  will

continue to keep



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



the  records  of  the registers up to date  by  making

changes of address, additions of new voters, deletions

of  those  no  longer qualified to  vote,  apart  from

restoring  to  the registers the names  of  those  who

failed  to vote at the last general elections  and  so

forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, while the Opposition

sees  no  objection  to  the course  proposed  by  the

Government, we on the Opposition do not agree with the

reasons given by the Minister for not carrying out the

provisions of section 15 of the Ordinance. The  reason

appears  to  be  that  the  Government  is  so  firmly

convinced that it will remain in office till 1964 that

it  does  not think that the electoral registers  need

revision and, on that basis, they would save $50,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are certain types of

expenditure which the Government must incur. Our  view

is  that  this  is one of those types  which  must  be

incurred  and we do hope that we will not be met  with

another  Bill that electoral registers for  1961  also

should be dispensed with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I wish to support the objection

raised   by  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park,  because,

although we support economy in many fields, we do  not

think  that  economy  when it  comes  to  stopping  or

interfering  with the electoral machinery  is  a  wise

move. It creates a bad precedent for the future. If  a

government could say, on the grounds of economy,  that

the revision of electoral registers could be dispensed

with,  then later on somebody might say that if it  is

economy,  well, elections perhaps could  be  postponed

for one or two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for

Home  Affairs  whether he could  clarify  for  me  two

points. A member of my constituency has asked whether,

in  his  particular case, if there  should  be  a  by-election  anywhere,  a person like  himself  would  be

allowed  to vote. He was out of the State of Singapore

when the last election took place,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



and he has since asked for reinstatement because he

was out of the Colony -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Colony?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - out of the State of Singapore.

Would  he  and  people like him be  allowed  to  vote,

although the registers have not been in a way properly

revised?  Now in the case of those who have since  the

last  elections moved to new districts, would they  be

voting  in their new districts or would they  have  to

vote in the old districts?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Pang Boon, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

information  of  the  Members  for  Farrer  Park   and

Tanglin,  there  will be a revision of  the  electoral

registers in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the two questions raised by the Member for

Tanglin,  the first one about a voter being away  when

the register was compiled, I will say that in his case

he would not be eligible to vote if there should be  a

by-election,  because his name would  not  be  in  the

register. In the second instance, the voter will  have

to vote in his old district.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time." This Bill -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I have the recommendation of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I have the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's recommendation under Standing Order  49  (1) .

Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, which seeks to amend the Singapore

Telephone   Board   Ordinance,  has  three   purposes.

Firstly,  to enable the Director of Audit,  Singapore,

to  be  the Board's auditor. Secondly, to empower  the

Minister to appoint to the Telephone Board persons who

are   in   the   public  service  when  suitable   for

appointment.  And thirdly, to impose  the  payment  of

stamp duties on the Telephone Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Audit, Singapore, at present is not

an  auditor within the definition under section  2  of

the  Singapore  Telephone  Board  Ordinance,  although

under  a different Ordinance, the Audit Ordinance,  he

is  empowered  to  audit the accounts  of  any  public

authorities and bodies administering public funds. The

fee  for  such  audit in each case is charged  to  the

authority   or   body  concerned.  By   amending   the

definition  of  "auditor"  under  section  2  of   the

Singapore  Telephone Board Ordinance, the Director  of

Audit  is  now  authorised to act as auditor  for  the

Telephone Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of section 5 (2) of the

Ordinance,  no  person in the public  service  of  the

State  can  be appointed to the Telephone Board.  This

restriction  on  public servants  is  now  removed  by

clause 3 of the Amendment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory bodies which perform duties in the nature

of  social services are exempted from payment of stamp

duties, while other bodies whose operations are  of  a

commercial  character are liable to payment  of  stamp

duties. Since the Telephone Board is being run more as

a   commercial  body,  the  Board  can  no  longer  be

exempted.  Clause  4 of the Amendment  Bill  seeks  to

repeal  section 25 of the Ordinance, and the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's recommendation under Standing  Order

49 (1) has been obtained in respect of this clause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move, "That, the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best known and effective international agency

providing  long-term development  finance  and  expert

economic   assistance  to  countries  has   been   the

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,

known  more  simply as the World Bank.  Its  loan  and

other operations in the immediate postwar period  have

helped  to set many countries on their way to economic

recovery from the aftermath of war. The major economic

problem  and  challenge  to the  world  today  is  the

development  of the less developed countries  in  Asia

and  Africa. In seeking to provide development finance

to  these less developed countries, the World Bank  is

at, times circumscribed by certain provisions in  its

Articles  of Agreement. For instance, the  Bank  would

only   make   loans  for  specific  revenue  producing

projects,  and it also requires loans to be repaid  in

strong currencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to meet more specifically the needs of

less  developed  countries,  a  new  body  called  the

International Development Association has been formed.

By  15th September, less than a week ago, its Articles

of    Association   would   have   been   signed    by

representatives    of   member    Governments    whose

subscriptions  would have totalled more  than  65  per

cent of its overall initial capital of $3,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



million.  The  purposes  of  the  Association  are  to

promote  economic  development, increase  productivity

and  thus  raise  standards  of  living  in  the  less

developed  areas  of  the world  included  within  the

Association's membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would it carry out its stated aims and in what

ways would it be different from its older partner, the

World  Bank?  Firstly, the Association would  seek  to

provide  long-term development loans at low  rates  of

interest  or  even  free  of interest.  Secondly,  the

Association  would shape its financing to meet  actual

needs  of countries as they arise. For example, though

the   Association  is  required  to  finance  specific

projects, which is a criterion based on the sound  and

tried principles of the World Bank, provisions in  its

Articles allow the Association to finance any projects

which  are  of high developmental priority,  that  is,

projects which will make an important contribution  to

development of areas whether or not such projects  are

revenue  producing or directly productive.  Therefore,

projects  such  as water supply, sanitation  or  pilot

housing  which would not qualify for finance from  the

World  Bank,  would be eligible for financing  by  the

Association.  Thirdly, in the case of loans  from  its

freely  convertible fund of currencies, repayment  can

be  either  wholly or partly made in local currencies.

This is of advantage to borrowing countries which  are

faced  with  the  balance of payments  problem.  Thus,

though  the Association has been formed on  the  sound

principles of its older associate, the World Bank, the

Association  would  be  a more  liberal  and  flexible

international financing agency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership of the Association is open only to World

Bank  members.  However, as Singapore is  a  territory

where  international relations are the  responsibility

of  the  United  Kingdom Government,  she  would  have

access  to  the  resources of  the  Association  under

section  3  of  Article  XI of  its  Agreement,  which

provides that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By its signature of this Agreement, each Government

accepts  it  both on its own behalf and in respect  of

all territories for whose international relations such

Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



responsible except those which are excluded by such

Government by written notice to the Association.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only obligations falling on a territory whose

international  relations are the responsibility  of  a

member Government, namely, the U.K. Government in  our

case,   are  those  of  giving  the  Association   the

immunities and privileges set out in Article  VIII  of

the Agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Development Association Bill has

been  introduced  to  so  grant  the  Association  the

privileges  and immunities as set out in the  Schedule

to  the Bill. The immunities and privileges, which are

proposed  to  be  given  to the Association,  are  the

normal   immunities   and   privileges   granted    to

international agencies, as honourable Members may well

see from the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Banishment

Ordinance to take cognisance of the law and to be more

in  keeping  with the spirit and significance  of  the

creation   and   international  status  of   Singapore

citizenship   as  distinct  from  other   Commonwealth

citizenship, and the emergence of Singapore as a fully

internal self-governing State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present law, only aliens are liable to be

banished  or  expelled  from Singapore.  The  existing

Banishment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance  is  not applicable to British subjects  and

Commonwealth citizens. However, since we have  amended

our  citizenship laws to confine Singapore citizenship

only  to those who really belong to Singapore and have

given it their undivided loyalty and allegiance, it is

considered  that we should also bring  our  banishment

law  into  line  with  this  conception  of  Singapore

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizenship must transcend all other

loyalties  and citizenships in Singapore,  and  it  is

only just and proper that only a Singapore citizen has

the  right  to  be here, and that the Government  must

retain the right to banish or expel from its territory

anyone who is a danger to the State, unless he has the

right  to  be  in  Singapore as a  Singapore  citizen.

Therefore, while the present banishment procedures  as

laid  down  in  the existing Ordinance have  not  been

amended   since   these  procedural   provisions   are

considered appropriate and satisfactory for conditions

in Singapore, the Ordinance is being amended to enable

the  Government to banish or expel any person, whether

British subject or alien, whose subversive or criminal

activities make him an undesirable resident and  whose

continued  stay in the State is not conducive  to  the

public  good, unless he has the right to  be  here  by

virtue of his being a Singapore citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has to be ever vigilant and resolute

against any disruptive force undermining the authority

and  the  well-being of the State, and  banishment  or

expulsion is one of the weapons we must have  in  this

fight,  where criminals and other undesirable elements

opposing  the  State and its laws  are  not  Singapore

citizens.  This amendment Bill brings  about  the  new

change  in  the banishment law by deleting  the  words

"alien",   "aliens"   and   "British   subject"    and

substituting therefore the words "a person who is  not

a  citizen  of  Singapore", "persons not  citizens  of

Singapore"  and  "citizen of Singapore"  respectively,

wherever they appear in the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments introduced in the Bill are

mainly drafting amendments, with the exception of  the

amendment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



proposed  by  paragraph (c) of clause 4 of  the  Bill.

This is to correct a mistake in the Ordinance. At  the

Committee Stage, I shall move a further amendment,  of

which I have already given notice, to delete the  word

"nationality"  wherever  it  appears  and   substitute

therefore the word "citizenship".

Paper, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges the Prime Minister to fight

in the Internal Security Council for the unconditional

release  of all political detainees who were  detained

by the Lim Yew Hock Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in a debate on a

motion  of  such great importance, the Prime  Minister

should  conveniently absent himself from the State  of

Singapore.  I  also note the strange  absence  of  the

Member for Cairnhill at today's sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present detainees, Sir, were the result of two

purges  during the Lim Yew Hock Government, The  first

was in October 1956 and the second in August



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



1957. After the first purge in October 1956, the Prime

Minister, who was then only an Assemblyman - the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar - moved a motion in this Assembly  on

5th  of November, 1956, Please refer to Hansard,  Vol.

2, No, 7, col. 475. The Prime Minister moved:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House deplores the further action of the

Labour Front Coalition Government under the Banishment

Ordinance,   the   Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance, and the Societies Ordinance against persons

and  organisations without producing any  evidence  to

justify its action.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall quote extracts of the Prime Minister's speech

on  the  great debate of 5th November, 1956.  This  is

what  he  said concerning those detained in the  first

great  purge  in October 1956. Hansard, Vol.  2,  col.

484, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the Government wants to retain the slightest

pretensions to democracy, it must bring the Member for

Bukit  Timah to open trial. If it cannot then it  must

release  him. And that goes for all the other  persons

who have been detained.'.



<br><br>I  am  giving emphasis to the last sentence, "And that

goes   for  all  the  other  persons  who  have   been

detained,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Speaker, in col. 489, the Prime Minister in  the same debate continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I [Prime Minister] may not always have agreed with

some of my friends who are now in prison in Changi but

I  agreed with them on one thing: the determination to

wreck the present colonial system as soon as possible.

For  I  agreed with them that the colonial  system  is

evil.'.



<br><br>In col. 490, the Prime Minister continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That [the purge] was the Labour Front's tactical

miscalculation  of  the position. There  should  never

have  been this miscalculation. But the errors  having

been  made, the least that the Labour Front can do  is

to bring these men to trial, prove the charges against

them  and satisfy the public conscience, they  cannot,

then they have no alternative but to release them.'.



<br><br>In  col.  584  [Hansard  Vol.  2,  No.  8,  dated  6th

November,  1956]  the  Prime  Minister  in  his  reply

continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The first task is not fighting the Communists. The

first task is to wrest the rifle barrel from the hands

of  the  British. When you have done  that,  then  you

decide what kind of Malaya you are going to have. That

has  been  the stand of the People's Action Party  and

will  continue to be the stand of the People's  Action

Party.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



Now,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, let us refer  to  the  second

batch  of  detainees. On the second batch of detainees

who  were  taken in during the second great  purge  in

August 1957, let us hear what the Prime Minister  said

in this Assembly on 12th September, 1957. Please refer

to Hansard, Vol. 2, No. 37, col. 2602. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government [Lim Yew Hock Government] has chosen

to  act  in  the way it did. Now it is up to  them  to

explain  their actions and what is more  important  to

show  that they have not arrested innocent people.  If

the  Government thinks that because some of these  men

arrested have opposed us in the past we are not  going

to  fight  for  their rights under the law,  they  are

mistaken.'.



<br><br>Going on to col. 2606, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those who fought with us on the agreed Party policy

we  stand by. But even those in our Party who tried to

undermine our policy we do not abandon. It  is  up  to

the  Government  to show that they are  Communists  or

Communist agents. Until then, we shall press for their

rights under the law,'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, all these words were said in  September 1957.  As  the  months passed by, and as  victory  was

almost in sight on the horizon, and the post of  Prime

Ministership was within striking distance due  to  the

active   support   of  the  unions  and   other   mass

organisations on the one hand and the concrete work of

the P.A.P. in the City Council on the other, the basic

stand taken by the Prime Minister in November 1956 and

in September 1957 was gradually and skillfully altered

step  by step. I will only quote the major shifts  and

changes  in the basic stand of the Prime Minister.  On

the  4th  of December, 1958, which was not long  after

the  victorious Kallang by-election and the P.A.P. was

then  recognised even by its enemies as the  party  of

the  masses and victory was already assured, the Prime

Minister  said in this Assembly, in Hansard,  Vol.  3,

No.   12,  col.  1188 - Mr  Speaker,  please  note  the

alteration in the Prime Minister's basic stand -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is only one point

worth  answering,  and it is the  question  which  the

Chief  Minister  has posed me about my ex-comrades  in

Changi. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one thing about the

P.A.P. which perhaps those who form, uniform and  re-form political Parties do not understand. When we form

a  Party,  there  are certain abiding principles  that

bind us together. They were my comrades in 1954 when I

formed that Party. They are my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



comrades  now  in 1958. They will be my comrades  next

year.  If  and  when  anyone departs  from  the  Party

programme and Party policy, then he ceases  to  be  my

comrade.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are a lot of adjectives and a lot of qualifications from now onwards. Mr Speaker,

distinction  is now being made between  detainees  who

are  P.A.P. members and detainees who are not  P.A.P.

members. I am only quoting extracts of speeches of the

Prime  Minister,  and it is not  my  purpose  here  to

impute   that  there  are  improper  or  dishonourable

intentions  or motives on his part. Let  me  give  one

example  so  that this change in basic  stand  can  be

better understood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, allow me to take the case of Soon Loh Boon. When the Prime Minister required the active

support of Soon Loh Boon, who was the President of the

Chinese  Middle  School  Students  Union,  before  his

detention  in  October 1956, the Prime  Minister  even

took  the troub1e of escorting Soon Loh Boon  home.  He

parked  his  Studebaker by the  roadside  in  Hillside

Drive  and  slowly escorted him home. I understand  he

now refuses to grant interviews to the parents of Soon

Loh Boon now that he has become the Prime Minister,  I

can quote more of such examples. Believe me, the Prime

Minister  will  still offer such courtesies  any  time

when  he  requires  the  services  of  any  particular

person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what is the effect of this skilful change? As I have said, for illustration I have taken

the  case  of  Soon  Lob Boon. In his  speech  of  5th

November,  1956,  the Prime Minister  fought  for  the

rights  of  Soon Loh Boon. But in his  speech  of  4th

December,  1958 - remember that this was after  all  the

work in the City Council when he was equipping himself

to  become the Prime Minister - Soon Loh Boon  had  been

placed under a different category because he was not a

P.A.P. member.  Now, there had been  brought  in  two

categories of detainees compared to September 1957, or

October 1956. P.A.P. members and non-P.A.P. members - in

other  words,  detainees who are  P.A.P. members  and

detainees who are non-P.A.P. members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, however, as the days passed by very quickly and as V-Day was approaching nearer and

nearer, a further distinction was being made.  It  was

the 22nd of May, 1959, which was a week before polling

day.  It  was at the height of the election  campaign,

when  the P.A.P. was already confident of at least  40

seats.  It  was then stated that the P.A.P. would  not

take  office  unless former members of the  Party  who

were  intimately connected with the Central  Executive

Committee and who were then in gaol were released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, note the change. There are now

three  categories  of  detainees.  Firstly,  in  class

number  one  are  P.A.P. members intimately  connected

with  the  P.A.P.  Central, most  of  them  ex-Central

members; secondly, class number two, detainees who are

P.A.P. members, but not so intimately connected  with

the  P.A.P.  Central; and thirdly, Mr Speaker,  class

number  three,  non-P.A.P. detainees. Mr  Speaker,  I

shall  just quote an example to illustrate  again  the

difference.  For instance, take the case  of  Tan  Bok

Teng,  who  I remember was the Chairman of the  P.A.P.

Paya  Lebar Branch. His rights would have gone through

these  different  stages, three different  periods  of

transmutation,  in  the skilful but systematic  toning

down of the basic stand of the Prime Minister which he

had  taken in the two purges. It is necessary to quote

extensively from Hansard and elsewhere former speeches

of  the Prime Minister to show the rightward trend  of

the  political  stand of our Prime  Minister;  and  in

order  to refute any argument he may make that he  had

fought  for  these detainees in the Internal  Security

Council, Mr Speaker, of which I was a member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, one can notice the pattern of the

trend  in  the political stand of our Prime  Minister.

During  the  first  meeting of the  Internal  Security

Council  on 28th August, 1959, I made my stand  clear.

The  motion  in  my name today was my  stand  at  that

Internal Security Council meeting: the detainees  must

be  released.  Since that meeting, the Prime  Minister

has  made  it clear that he, being the Prime  Minister

and the person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



who  appoints  or  removes  the  other  two  Singapore

members  of the Internal Security Council, only  shall

speak.  Mr Speaker, he is His Almighty the  power  to

be! Let me refer to section 64 (1) which describes the

organisation  and the representation of  the  Internal

Security Council:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There shall be in and for Singapore an Internal

Security  Council (in this Part referred  to  as  "the

Council") which, subject to the provisions of  section

70  of  this  Order, shall consist  of  the  following

members:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the United Kingdom Commissioner, as Chairman;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Prime Minister;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) two members appointed to the Council by the

United Kingdom Commissioner;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) two members, being Ministers, appointed to the

Council by the Prime Minister; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) a member appointed in accordance with the

provisions of subsection (1) of section 70 of this

Order.'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, it is clear that the Prime  Minister  is the  sole  authority  for Singapore  in  the  Internal

Security  Council. As a matter of fact, in  the  later

meetings  of  the  Internal Security  Council,  I  was

"advised" by the Prime Minister not to attend meetings

of the Internal Security Council and that the Minister

for  Finance  would take my place. My presence - despite

the fact that it was a mute presence - had proved to  be

too  embarrassing  for our Prime  Minister.  There  is

absolutely  no doubt in my mind of the  stand  of  the

Prime   Minister.   There   were   never   any   prior

consultations  by  the  Prime Minister  with  his  two

colleagues   before  the  meetings  of  the   Internal

Security   Council.  There  were   never   any   prior

consultations with the Cabinet. There were  never  any

prior   consultations  with  the   Central   Executive

Committee  of the People's Action Party.  I  tried  to

bring  the  Central Executive Committee of the  P.A.P.

into  the  picture by making it a principle  that  all

Government  business must first be  discussed  in  the

Central   Executive  Committee.  The   principle   was

accepted  but,  Mr Speaker, never practised.  I  also

told the Chairman of the People's Action Party that  I

was   unhappy  about  the  position  in  the  Internal

Security   Council  and  that  all  Internal  Security

Council matters must first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



be  discussed  in  the  Cabinet  and  in  the  Central

Executive Committee of the People's Action Party.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  a  hopeless  position.  In  a

political  party only when the rank and file  of  that

political party could exercise its political  thinking

on  the  leader  who is now enjoying all  the  earthly

benefits of a Prime Minister could the political stand

of  the  leader of that political party be subject  to

the  collective will of the rank and file. The members

of  the  P.A.P. tried to do it  at  a  Special  Party

Conference,  but the result is now too well  known  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the question of these political detainees - on this issue - we have gone through four

fights  or  four  rounds.  The  first  round  was  the

Internal  &  Security Council meeting on 28th  August,

1959,  and a week later on 4th September, 1959  (which

was  a Friday), I was subject to the first of a series

of  secret trials for which the Prime Minister is  now

famous.  The  second  round did  not  develop  into  a

crisis.  The  attempt to bring the  Central  Executive

Committee  into  the affairs of the Internal  Security

Council  failed.  The third round was  in  the  P.A.P.

Special  Party  Conference on  19th  June,  1960.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  today  is the fourth  round,  in  this

Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Secret trial!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Fortunately, we have an impartial

Speaker.  I  must congratulate you in this connection,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Chair should be

considered  to  be  completely  impersonal  in   these

matters  in  that he should really be  ignored  as  an

individual but not ignored as an authority on Standing

Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, these detainees

have  fought British colonialism despite the fact that

their  methods have differed from those of  the  Prime

Minister  who fought the British once upon a time.  Of

course,  there is now no more in him the anti-colonial

fight. The British have been forced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



to   grant   certain  constitutional  concessions   as

embodied in the 1958 Singapore Constitution because of

the  mass participation of all sections of the  people

in  the  anti-colonial struggle. Out of one  phase  of

this anti-colonial struggle, a new Government under  a

new  Constitution  was formed in June  1959,  but  the

result  of  the common fight against the British  came

out  in  striking contrast for different  people.  The

answers  to  the  questions asked by  the  Member  for

Aljunied  (Mr S. V. Lingam) are still  fresh  in  our

minds, Mr Speaker. Some are now enjoying life to  the

utmost,  having enormous political "power" and immense

social   "prestige",  driving  about  in   fleets   of

chauffeur-driven  cars  with  ample   bodyguards   and

escorts, with State flags fluttering in the wind, with

special  Traffic Police on duty at strategic junctions

to   enable   "S1"  to  glide  and  pass  by   without

obstruction.  Oxley  Road, where  the  Prime  Minister

stays -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether the hon. Member

for  Hong  Lim  can  assist me by relating  all  these

remarks to the motion before the House. We are talking

about  a  fight  in the Internal Security  Council.  I

cannot  see  how  his remarks have  reference  to  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, in my next paragraph

you   will   see - and  this  is  the  pattern   of   my

argument - that  I am trying to compare the  results  of

the  common  fight  on which the  Prime  Minister  had

spoken  in 1956. Could I refresh the memories  of  the

Members  of  this House as to what the Prime  Minister

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I may not always have agreed with some of my friends

who are now in prison in Changi but I agreed with them

on  one  thing: the determination to wreck the present

colonial system as soon as possible. For I agreed with

them that the colonial system is evil.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The first task is not fighting the Communists. The

first task is to wrest the rifle barrel from the hands

of the British.'



<br><br>And  nobody denies that the British still control  the

rifle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When you have done that, then you decide what kind

of Malaya you are going to have.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am trying to draw a pattern. It was a common fight on which the Prime Minister agreed, but

the  results were different for different people.  The

homes,  the seaside bungalows and the golf-links  once

used  exclusively by colonial Governors  are  now  the

favourite  haunts of the Prime Minister.  We  promised

the  people during the elections that we would convert

the domains of Government House into a public park for

the benefit of our l� million people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon.

Member  but I do not know how the personal conduct  of

the  Prime Minister has anything to do with his having

to  fight in the Internal Security Council. I must try

to bring the debate back to its proper course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, if at the conclusion

of  my  argument  you rule that what I  am  saying  is

irrelevant  to  the motion, you can  then  ask  me  to

withdraw and I shall withdraw without question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All have gone into empty air. Mr Speaker, Sir,

Government  House  is a nice sanctuary  not  far  from

Oxley Road. One of the bedrooms in "Sri Temasek" -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Then I think I must rule that all

those  remarks  are irrelevant to the motion,  because

the hon. Member has not satisfied me that they are, in

fact,  related  to  the  motion.  Those  remarks   are

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the anti-colonial

struggle   has  come  out  differently  for  different

people.  What  is  the other side of the  picture?  In

other words, what do the people on the other side get?

The  people  who  have fought harder  than  the  Prime

Minister are still languishing in gaol. Perhaps  there

are  some striking similarities. The calm sea  surface

is  their  golf-links. They also have special  seaside

accommodation. They also have special bodyguards. They

also  get free meals at public expense. But there  the

similarities  end. Is that not relevant, Mr  Speaker?

That is what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



I  am trying to arrive at in my conclusion. So we have

one  of  the  most  expensive Prime Ministers  in  the

world.  His extravagant expenditure on great  luxuries

and  comfort  comes  from the pay cuts  of  the  civil

servants  and from the taxes on the poor which  should

all  be  devoted  to  building  more  roads, clinics,

schools, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have brought in what the Prime

Minister said on the occasion of the two great purges,

and  I have related how he has shifted his stand  most

skillfully - like  a professional lawyer - so  that  there

are now three categories of detainees. He has tried to

prove  that  he  has no obligation to the  second  and

third classes of detainees, I have also tried to  give

an  account  to this House of the two very  strikingly

different  results for two sets of people  fighting  a

common enemy - the British colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, arising from this debate, it is

only  decent that the Prime Minister who is today  the

guest  of honour of British colonial governors  should

fight  for the immediate and unconditional release  of

these political detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.46 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to enquire, of course, whether or

not  the  hon.  Member is making  a  prepared  speech,

because  I  have  indicated in a  circular  that  hon.

Members  who  are  speaking in a language  other  than

English  should  try as far as possible  to  cooperate

with  the  interpreters by giving them a copy  of  any

prepared speech that would be made. If the Member  for

Punggol  assures  me that he has not  got  a  prepared

speech, then perhaps he can carry on. But if he has  a

prepared speech, I would rather that he first supply a

copy  of  that  prepared speech  before  I  call  him.

Perhaps he could let me know.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is only a short speech which I did not prepare

earlier.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully  support the motion standing in the name of  the

Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the P.A.P. came into power, during the time of

the  Lim Yew Hock Government, the British colonialists

arrested  many  political  detainees  during  the  two

purges.  How  many of these political  detainees  have

been  released since the Lee Kuan Yew Government  came

into  power? These people who were arrested were anti-British  colonialists. Although we do not  agree  with

their  tactics  but because we believe  in  truth  and

justice, we must request the unconditional release  of

these  arrested  political  detainees.  Let  us  speak

frankly.  Without  these  people  who  supported   the

struggle against the British colonialists and  without

the  success of the P.A.P.'s work in the City Council,

the  Prime Minister would not be holding the  position

he  now  holds today. What has he shown to secure  his

present  position? In the past, the colonial Governors

were  the  objects of his attack but now these  people

are  his  hosts. Those detained by him were  political

workers.  The Mayor of the City Council, Mr  Ong  Eng

Guan,  was his good friend, but now the Prime Minister

attacks  him. When he needs a person to help him,  his

purpose  is  to make use of such a person  to  benefit

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has now cut

himself off from the people who were once on his side.

For example, Mr Soon Loh Boon. The Prime Minister was

once   the  adviser  to  the  Chinese  Middle   School

Students' Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Prime Minister wants to face

the  people,  he  must fight in the Internal  Security

Council  for the release of these political detainees.

Today he must make his stand clear in this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  first let me on behalf of the Prime Minister

disabuse the mind of the Member for Hong Lim that  the

Prime Minister is afraid to attend the debate today to

exchange  cudgels  with him. The invitation  from  the

Sultan  of Brunei to the Prime Minister was fixed  for

today. Today's sitting of the Assembly was fixed  last

month.  If  the Member for Hong Lim had given  earlier

notice  that he was going to move this motion,  I  can

assure  him  that the Prime Minister would  have  been

only too glad to alter the date for today's sitting so

as  to  be present and to listen to all that has  been

uttered against the person of the Prime Minister.  And

I  would  like  to  inform the House  that  the  Prime

Minister  had urged me to postpone today's sitting  of

the  Assembly  so  that he could  be  present  at  the

debate,  but as Leader of the House I had to  consider

the fact that last month we had announced that we were

going  to  move  a  number of Bills  today  and  so  I

proceeded  with  today's sitting. I would  assure  the

Member  for  Hong Lim that he should thank  his  lucky

stars  that  the Prime Minister is not present  today,

otherwise he would be at the receiving end of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at the sitting of the Assembly on 14th October last year, I made a statement on the internal

security  position  and  our  relationship  with   the

Federation  on behalf of the Singapore Government.  In

that  statement, I clarified to the House the  rights,

powers and duties of the Internal Security Council and

our part in the Internal Security Council of which the

Federation Government is a member. If you will  permit

me,  Mr  Speaker,  let  me refresh  the  memories  of

Members  of this House, and in particular the memories

of the Member for Hong Lim and the Member for Punggol,

on  the  role  of  the  Singapore  Government  in  the

Internal  Security  Council.  In  Hansard   of   14th

October, 1959, Vol. 11, No. 11, at column 660, I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The competence of the Singapore Government to

formulate and implement the policy affecting  internal

security  is subject to the overriding powers  of  the

Internal Security Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to consultation and decisions on

questions of policy, the Internal Security Council  is

competent   to  make  executive  decisions   for   the

maintenance of internal security in Singapore, and any

such  decision  which  has been  communicated  to  the

Singapore Government must be given immediate effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is competent to take

executive  action on its own authority in  matters  of

internal security. For its part, the Internal Security

Council  is competent to take decisions in these  same

matters, and in so far as it does those decisions,  by

virtue   of   section  66,  paragraph  (2),   endorse,

supplement  or  override  any  decisions   which   the

Singapore Government may itself have taken -'



<br><br>Let  me  repeat  the  words  "endorse,  supplement  or

override  any decisions which the Singapore Government

may itself have taken ..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and constitute binding directives with which toe

subsequent  decisions  and actions  of  the  Singapore

Government must conform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government should not take any action

in any field which would be contrary to policy already

agreed  by, or decisions already taken by, the Council

or  would  be likely to raise policy issues, or  would

have   repercussions   affecting  internal   security,

without prior reference to the Council.'



<br><br>What I have just said was fully endorsed by the Member

for   Hong   Lim,   the   ex-Minister   for   National

Development,   when  he  stood  up  to   support   the

Preservation  of  Public  Security  (Amendment)   Bill

introduced by the Prime Minister. Ninety-five per cent

of his speech on that day as well as today was devoted

to  a lengthy quotation of what the Prime Minister had

said  at that time in the Opposition in this House  in

October  1958, We know that the Prime Minister  has  a

tape-recorder but not until the Member  for  Hong  Lim

and  his  two colleagues moved over to the  Opposition

Benches did we know that the Prime Minister also keeps

a  parrot. Apart from miscasting or paraphrasing  what

other people have said -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was not quite certain whether

the  Hon.  Deputy Prime Minister meant  to  liken  the

Member  for  Hong Lim to a "parrot". If  he  did  mean

that,  I think he ought to withdraw, because the  word

"parrot" in this context is offensive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I was thinking of Aesop's Fables.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Deputy Prime Minister ought

to withdraw that word.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I beg to withdraw. The only

contribution by the Member for Hong Lim to the  debate

on  the  Preservation  of Public Security  (Amendment)

Bill, recorded in the same Vol. 11, No. 11, col.  673,

was this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is being fully recognised, under the new

Constitution  granted  to  Singapore  by  the  British

masters, that the decisive say in internal security in

this Island is the Internal Security Council.'



<br><br>When  he uttered those words, the Member for Hong  Lim

was  one  of three members representing the  Singapore

Government  in the Internal Security Council.  It  was

his  experience in the Internal Security Council which

led  him  to  conclude that the decisive  say  in  the

internal  security of Singapore rests on the  Internal

Security Council and not on any single member  of  the

Council.  Or does he wish to say now that the decision

of  the  Internal Security Council rests on the  Prime

Minister  only,  or on the Minister for  Home  Affairs

only, or on him, Mr Ong Eng Guan, the third member of

the  Internal Security Council? If the Member for Hong

Lim  wishes  to place the responsibility of  decisions

taken  by the Internal Security Council solely on  any

single  person,  then  surely the responsibility  must

also rest on him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member for Hong Lim has not demonstrated

any   great   love   for  collective  leadership   and

collective  action, I am quite sure  he  will  be  the

first  person  to deny that his role in  the  Internal

Security  Council was an individualistic role.  It  is

not  that the Singapore Government has not fought  for

the  release of those detained under the Lim Yew  Hock

Government.  It was I who said those words  quoted  by

the  Member for Hong Lim a moment ago - that the  P.A.P.

would  not  take office unless former members  of  the

Party  who were intimately connected with the  Central

Executive  Committee and who were then  in  gaol  were

released. We can be responsible only to our colleagues

and to those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



who  work  with us. We cannot be responsible  for  the

activities  of those unknown to us, or be  responsible

to  those who carry out activities for which  we  have

not given any request to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have fulfilled our pledge to release those members

of the Central Executive. Committee who were detained.

There  were eight of them, and at our insistence,, on

4th  June they were released before we assumed  office

on  5th June. On 1st June, 1959, immediately after the

elections  and  before  forming  the  Government,  the

Secretary-General  of  the  Party,, now   the   Prime

Minister,   stated  that  the  record  of  the   other

detainees  would be reviewed and justice done  on  the

merits, of each case. There were 60 persons  detained

on  2nd  June, 1959. From the day the People's  Action

Party  assumed office,, 3rd June, 1959, up to date  32

persons  have  been  released.  Of  those  who   were

detained  by  the previous Government, there  are  now

only  28 persons still under detention. It is not that

the  Singapore Government has not reviewed the records

of  these  detainees.  In fact, these  detainees  have

written letters to the Prime Minister. However, it  is

not  for the Prime Minister alone, or for that  matter

the  Singapore Government, to release these detainees.

It   is  the  Internal  Security  Council  whom  these

detainees, must  convince  that  they  are  sincerely

renouncing  and repudiating the methods  and  aims  of

political   forces   which  seek  to   overthrow   the

democratic system not only of Singapore but of Malaya,

by  means  of subversion and violence as a whole,  The

efforts of the Singapore Government to work for  their

release  will  be  in vain if the  attitude  of  these

detainees continues to be equivocal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recognise one simple fact. The Federation

Government has been compelled today to adopt an  anti-Communist   stand   because  of   militant   Communist

insurrection.  After  passing  through  12  years   of

Emergency,  it is hardly likely, therefore,  that  the

Federation  Government, who has the deciding  vote  in

the  Internal  Security Council,  will  agree  to  the

release of those persons who, by their actions, it  is

convinced,  are  advancing the cause  of  the  Malayan

Communist Party. It is our business to look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



after  the welfare and well-being of the people  which

we  know can only be advanced through ultimate  merger

with   the   Federation.  We  have  no  intention   to

jeopardise  the welfare of the people as a  whole  for

the benefit of a small group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was founded on a rising tide of

nationalism  in Singapore. However, it  is  one  thing

shouting  anti-colonial  slogans,  and  another  thing

knowing how to fight in the present context the forces

of  colonialism.  The  P.A.P. has  carried  the  fight

against colonialism to the present stage, and today we

have  internal  self-government.  In  the  next  stage

against colonialism, we will have to consider not only

the  prospects  of  political  independence  but  also

economic independence. If Singapore were the  size  of

an island like Ceylon, or even the State of Johore, or

Pahang, the possibilities for a completely independent

Singapore  exist. But it is not so, and therefore  the

key  to political as well as economic independence for

Singapore  is  a  merger  between  Singapore  and  the

Federation.   That  key  is  not  with   the   British

Government  today,  but  it  is  with  the  Federation

Government, it is the Federation Government  and  the

people  of  the Federation whom we must convince  that

merger   with  Singapore  will  not  lead  to  Chinese

domination,  or  Communist  conquest  of  Malaya   and

overthrow  of  the  Federation  Constitution.   Merger

between  Singapore  and the Federation  is  the  prime

consideration in our political thinking. And we  shall

not  allow  anybody  to disrupt the good  relationship

which   we   have  established  with  the   Federation

Government, or to endanger the prospects of a merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing that Singapore has in common with

the Federation, and that is that both territories have

a  parliamentary democratic system. It is because  the

parliamentary  democratic system exists  in  Singapore

today  that  the Member for Aljunied can stand  up  in

this  House to ask the puerile questions that  he  has

brought  up  this  evening. But I do  not  credit  the

Member   for  Aljunied  with  even  that   degree   of

puerility, and therefore we must believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



that he is only a mouthpiece. The Member for Hong  Lim

talks  of  secret trials within the P.A.P.,  and  that

this  is  the fourth round of secret trials  in  this.

Chamber.  Let the Members for Hong Lim, Aljunied,  and

Punggol ponder well. Let them thank their lucky  stars

that  the  liberty of speech exists in this House.  In

other  countries with different systems of government,

these  three  birds would be made to sing a  different

tune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I will assure the House and the people of Singapore that the Singapore Government will

continue to fight, as it has done in the past, for the

release  of those, persons who can convince  not  only

the   Singapore  Government  but  also  the   Internal

Security  Council that they have abjured not only  the

methods  but  also the aims of political forces  which

seek  to overthrow the democratic system by subversion

and violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move an amendment to the motion by the

Member for Hong Lim as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out the words "the Prime Minister", and

there to insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the Government to continue";



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to leave out the word "unconditional", and at the end

to add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and the House urges the detainees to assist the

Government in its efforts to secure their release by

sincerely repudiating the methods and aims of

political forces dedicated to the overthrow of the

democratic system by subversion and violence."



<br><br>The final amended motion, if you will permit me, reads

as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly urges the Government to continue

to fight in the Internal Security Council for the

release of all political detainees who were detained

by the Lim Yew Hock Government and the House urges

the detainees to assist the Government in its efforts

to secure their release by sincerely repudiating the

methods and aims of political forces dedicated to the

overthrow of the democratic system by subversion and

violence.

by  the  Lim  Yew  Hock Government."  Since  which  an

amendment has been moved by the Deputy Prime Minister.

I have had an opportunity of looking at that amendment

and I rule that when it seeks to ask this Assembly  to

urge the detainees to do something, that amendment, in

so  far  as  it  seeks to do that, is  out  of  order,

because  the Assembly cannot hope to urge anybody  who

is not responsible to this Assembly to do anything. So

I have suggested an alteration to the amendment to the

Deputy  Prime  Minister, and  if  he  will  move the

amendment  as altered, then he will be in  order.  I

have made copies for him.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Very well, Mr Chan.



<br><br>8.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

second  the  amendment  moved  by  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister. We, being an elected Government and an anti-colonial    Party,    must   solemnly    answer    the

question - should  we strive for the  release  of  those

detained  by the Lim Yew Hock Government for political

reasons?  Our  reply is positive and  has  never  been

otherwise. As early as 14th



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>





October, 1959, the Deputy Prime Minister, when  making

a  policy  speech concerning the problem  of  national

safety and challenge from Communism, quoted the  Prime

Minister  and  pointed  out that  the  P.A.P. has  no

intention  to  become the hand-maid of  the  Communist

Party.  But we also do not have the intention to  soil

our  hands  wearing the same gloves used  by  the  old

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our rebuttal of the so-called 16 resolutions by

Ong  Eng Guan on 22nd June, 1960, we again stated  our

stand:  "All  those  detained  by  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government in the two purges should be released."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand on this problem is unchanged today. The

P.A.P. Government will still persistently request  for

their release in the Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are easily excited by this problem should

weigh the Government by looking at concrete facts  and

figures. Of the 60 person detained by the Lim Yew Hock

Government  for  political  reasons,  32   have   been

released  since the P.A.P. came into power.  Of  those

still  under detention, our attitude is still  this - to

deal with each case on its merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those within and without this House know that the

key to the release or the continued detention of these

people is held by the Federation representative to the

Internal  Security  Council.  That  is  to  say,   the

decisive  factor is whether or not the  detainees  can

supply   sufficient  grounds  to  help  the  Singapore

Government  convince  the  Federation  representative,

whose vote is decisive on the matter. Unless we decide

not  to follow the peaceful and constitutional way  to

fight for the ultimate aim of merger and independence,

we  must  accept  the limitation imposed  by  the  new

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Constitution does not give us the sovereignty

and  liberty  necessary  for an  independent  country.

Everybody  knows this. But since we have accepted  the

new  Constitution, no one can deny the fact  that  the

people  of  Singapore have pushed history towards  the

right progressive path - the only correct path.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim has again raised the question

of  political detainees. Will the release of political

detainees negative the constitutional struggle? If so,

and   if   he  wants  to  be  considered  as  a   real

revolutionary,  then he ought to tell  the  people  of

Singapore in this House how bad and hopeless  the  new

Constitution is and show them the way, the outcome and

the  prospect of such step. He should not merely  talk

of  the release of the political detainees. If  he  is

really  earnest  in engaging in social revolution  and

not  pursuing his aim of individualistic heroism, then

he  should  persuade the people to follow him  in  his

cause.  To  win  the  support  of  a  section  of  the

community  who  are  directly  concerned  with   those

political detainees is not enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of releasing the

political detainees, our policy is that the rights and

wrongs  of every case should be dealt with in  a  just

and fair way. But, if among those who are now detained

there   are  some  who  do  not  believe  in  peaceful

constitutional struggle and who harbour the design  of

replacing the democratic parliamentary system  with  a

Communist regime, then the P.A.P. has no obligation to

fight for their release and their freedom. Even if  we

do  so,  we will not succeed in our endeavour. But  no

matter how, we will still endeavour to convince  these

people  to accept the idea of constitutional democracy

to enable them to be released early.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the three-cornered fight waged

between  the Communists, the British colonialists  and

the P.A.P., the Prime Minister has dealt `with it very

clearly at the last Assembly sitting. Of course,  what

the  Prime Minister said on the topic is not  pleasing

to  the  ears  of  the  pro-Communists  and  Left-wing

adventurers.  However,  I  think  they   should   seek

solutions to the problem in concrete reality  and  not

base their method on their subject wishful thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that there was

no such word as "unconditional" in the Member for Hong

Lim's motion proposed at the Party Conference in  June

this year. If at that time the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



people  were not confused by his slogan, the  addition

of  the  word "unconditional" now would be of  no  use

also.  Another motive behind the Member for Hong Lim's

motion  was  to  put  the  entire  responsibility   of

releasing the political detainees on the shoulders  of

the  Prime  Minister, so as to show that his expulsion

from  the Party arose out of his personal quarrel with

the Prime Minister, and that he is the only person who

is  really anti-colonialistic. Anyone who is  able  to

see  the  true  colour of his individualistic  heroism

will understand the real facts of the event.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I deem it necessary to

amend the motion proposed by the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br>9.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking on the

amendment,  I  was very glad to hear the Deputy  Prime

Minister  and Leader of the House speak in the  manner

he did this evening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this country and in our neighbouring country,

Malaya,   we   are  both  committed  to  a  democratic

parliamentary  system,  and  the  objective   of   the

Government here and the Government across the Causeway

is to work this democratic parliamentary system to the

best  of  both  our abilities. Anybody  who  seeks  to

destroy  this  system and to disrupt and  destroy  the

State  is an enemy of the State. Therefore, the  State

must  take  action to see that it is not destroyed  by

its  enemy. It is only with that intent and  for  that

purpose that it then becomes rightful for a democratic

system  such  as  ours to bring in such  an  Ordinance

which  will  put  away  from society  people  who  are

enemies of the State and who wish to destroy it. It is

on  those  grounds, and on those grounds  alone,  Sir,

that  an Ordinance like this is permissible in such  a

system as we are seeking to operate. I think there can

be  no  doubt  in  the  mind of  any  Member  in  this

Assembly,  or  anybody outside, that  there  are  such

persons in the Federation of Malaya and Singapore  who

are  seeking  to  do  that.  In  those  circumstances,

therefore,   their   detentions  are   justified   and

justifiable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original motion, Mr Speaker, Sir, dealt with

only  the question of detainees who were detained  .by

the  Lim  Yew  Hock Government. Since the P.A.P. came

into  power,  a  certain number of  people  have  been

detained  by the present Government - I do not know  the

exact  number,  Mr Speaker, Sir. So  I  was  somewhat

disappointed when I read the motion by the Member  for

Hong Lim, who has specifically asked the Government to

use  its  best  endeavours in  the  Internal  Security

Council  only for those detained by the Lim  Yew  Hock

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, that on the last

occasion when we met, the Member for Hong Lim was loud

in  his  condemnation  of the  Government  for  having

detained  two  members of the Press.  They  were  also

detained  under  the  P.P.S.O.  Sir,  I  was  somewhat

surprised that the persons whom he had made use of for

his  own purposes in the debate against the Government

had conveniently been forgotten by him in this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister, in the course of his

speech, said that when the PAP, came into power  there

were  about  60 persons under detention,  having  been

committed there by the Lim Yew Hock Government. I hope

I  am  quoting the right figure, Sir - I think  he  said

that 32 have been released up to now and that 28 still

remain  where they were. Sir, let us look at  it  this

way.  Assuming that the P.A.P. did not agree with  the

Lim  Yew Hock Government that all 60 should have  been

detained   (on  the  basis  that  the  Lim  Yew   Hock

Government had made a mistake), then I think  we  have

now  certainly  reached  the position  that,  on  21st

September, 1960, the P.A.P. Government does  certainly

agree  that  in  so  far  as  the  28  detainees   are

concerned, the Lim Yew Hock Government had not made  a

mistake; whatever its views may be on the other 32 who

had been detained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the amendment of the Government and I

support it. But I think the amendment does not go  far

enough.  I think the Government is taking the  correct

view  that  if  the Lim Yew Hock Government  detainees

mend their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



ways  and satisfy the Government that their ways  have

been  mended,  then,  of course, the  Government  will

fight  for  their release. Sir, I think  the  position

which applies to the Lim Yew Hock Government detainees

should  also apply, in all fairness, to the  detainees

who have been detained by the present Government. I do

not  think the Government can say, "We will apply  one

set of standards to those detained by the Lim Yew Hock

Government,  and  another set of  standards  to  those

detained by us."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Therefore, I say this to the Government:

the  only basis on which the 28 are being detained  is

because  they are enemies of the State, and  the  only

basis  on  which the present Government  is  detaining

people   off   their  own  bat - if  I   may   use   the

colloquialism - is also because they are enemies of  the

State.  So  if the 28 enemies of the State  previously

detained  by  the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  can  be

mercifully  treated by the Government, the  Government

should   equally   treat  those   detained   by   them

mercifully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I move an amendment

to the amendment -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now, of course, on the

Question, "That the words proposed to be left out,  be

left  out."  If  that  is agreed  to,  then  the  next

Question  will  be,  "That the words  proposed  to  be

inserted,  be  there inserted." When we come  to  that

Question,  the Member for Farrer Park could  rise  and

move  simpliciter.  Of course, he  must  say  what  he

wishes to say on the subject now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said all that I

could  say on this subject, and therefore I will  wait

for the appropriate moment to move my amendment.



<br><br>9.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  support the amendment moved by the Leader  of  the

beliefs,  they  must  surely  possess  at  least  some

semblance  of  honesty  and  responsibility  in  their

political  endeavours. It must not be forgotten,  Sir,

that the democratic system of government, which we  on

this   side  of  the  House  cherish  and  which   the

Opposition claim' to uphold, can only work and operate

if everyone in this House, nay, everyone in this State

of  ours,  is  aware of his civic responsibility;  and

that  fanatics and opportunists should be confined  to

where they really belong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion of the Member for Hong Lim came as no

surprise  to  us, for we had anticipated such  a  move

from  him  ever  since  he has been  disowned  by  and

expelled  from our Party. To him political  manoeuvres

should  be geared to serve the selfish needs of  petty

politicians and not for the benefit of the masses.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That expression with reference to

the  Member for Hong Lim or any other Member  of  this

House  is out of order. Will the Member withdraw  that

expression?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

this  remark was meant to apply to the Member for Hong

Lim. Perhaps if you may be kind enough to allow me  to

repeat what I have said - may I carry on, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please, then I can rule again.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> To him, political manoeuvres

should  be geared to serve the selfish needs of  petty

politicians. Can that be allowed, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether the Parliamentary

Secretary  will  now agree with me  that  that  is  an

unparliamentary  expression to use with  reference  to

any Member of this House. Will he please withdraw?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I withdraw that remark, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  We on our part believe that  political

movements  must be geared to serve the  needs  of  the

masses,  otherwise such political movements  must  and

certainly  will be doomed to failure. It is  for  this

very  reason  that the Member for Hong Lim  has  found

himself  cold and lonely, outside the warm  spirit  of

comradeship  within  the P.A.P.  The  tactics  of  the

Member for Hong Lim, Sir, are too well known to  merit

elaboration. Suffice it to mention that he has  failed

completely and utterly within the ranks of the  Party,

and  he  is  now  trying very desperately  to  attract

attention by irresponsible and sensational slogans and

motions.  Just  as a drowning man would  clutch  at  a

straw,  an  eclipsed  and disgraced  politician  would

snatch  any  trick  so long as it could  give  him  an

unnaturally  prolonged  span  of  life,  though   such

artificially  boosted  longevity  may  prove   to   be

excruciatingly agonising in the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Hong Lim moved his motion, I

expected  some brilliant dissertation on the need  for

the Prime Minister to do as he has suggested. However,

I  was  completely  disappointed  and,  if  I  may  be

permitted to recall his speech made just a few moments

ago, I might say that other than quoting a few remarks

of  the Prime Minister, which he was wont to quote  at

all  times, he was himself unable to make any  genuine

political contribution by way of political statements.

Other  than such repetitions and quotations, there  is

really nothing in the motion or in the speech that  he

has  made in respect of that motion. He does not  seem

to  be aware or to be able to understand that with the

achievement  of  independence  in  the  Federation  of

Malaya,  the  political analysis of this  country  has

changed.  Before the Federation achieved independence,

it  was  our duty and our responsibility to fight  the

colonialists, to fight the British at all costs.  With

the  achievement of independence by the Federation  of

Malaya,  it  is our responsibility now  to  light  for

merger with the Federation if we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



to accept that independence for Singapore alone is not

viable  and  not  feasible, and that independence  for

Singapore  can  come and will only come  after  merger

with  the Federation. The stress and the emphasis  of

the  fight has therefore changed. It is therefore  our

duty to lead the people of Singapore to fight actively

for  a  merger  and  not  for  quixotic  pursuits   as

suggested by the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have exposed the Member for Hong Lim for trying to

embarrass and discredit the Government in any  way  he

can for little transient advantages. After all, weaker

characters  have  sold their souls to  the  devil  for

similar  ephemeral advantages. To the Member for  Hong

Lim,  the P.A.P. has totally failed to serve  his  own

personal nefarious purposes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. the

Parliamentary  Secretary  does  realise  that  he   is

skating  on  very  thin ice. When he  alleges  that  a

Member of this Assembly is doing something to suit his

nefarious purpose, he is completely out of order. That

expression cannot be used.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will withdraw

the word "nefarious" and -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Unconditionally.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> May I make a remark, Sir, that it

is in relation to the motion that he has moved that  I

was tempted to use such a word to describe him?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That does not mean to say that the

Member is in order. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I will withdraw it

unconditionally,  Sir. The Member  for  Hong  Lim  has

failed  utterly and completely to win over the loyalty

of  the  rank and file of the Party. He now  therefore

embarks  upon  the destruction of the Party  that  had

suckled  and  nurtured him, not for  any  scruples  or

principles,   but   because  he  was   excluded   from

participation  within  the  Party.  The  honesty,  the

integrity and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



collective leadership of the P.A.P. is unquestioned by

any sincere person. The cleanliness and the dedication

of the Party is unchallengeable. The P.A.P. represents

a  genuine movement of the people of Singapore  for  a

better way of life and a more egalitarian society.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me that the Hon.

Parliamentary Secretary is gradually going further and

further  away  from the motion. I  do  not  think  the

motion,  or  even the amendment, suggests  that  there

should  be  a debate on the People's Action  Party.  I

think   the   Parliamentary  Secretary   is   possibly

wandering a little too far.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his speech

supporting  his  motion,  the  Member  for  Hong   Lim

analysed  the  stand of the P.A.P. and submitted  that

throughout  the  days  of  the  struggle  against  the

colonialists,  that stand was changed.  I  was  merely

trying  to  show  him  that the basic  stand  has  not

changed, but that the circumstances have changed.  The

political  objectives of the P.A.P. have  never  been

changed and will never be changed. Yet the Member  for

Hong Lim is prepared to destroy this movement and  put

the clock back for many years to suit his own purpose.

What kind of a revolutionist does he claim to be? Does

he  want  chaos? Does he want riots and bloodshed  for

the  people  of Singapore all over again? Fortunately,

Sir,  the  people of Singapore have seen  through  his

scheme.   They  have  turned  a  deaf   ear   to   his

sensationalism and his antics. Even more  fortunately,

Sir, the collective leadership of the Party is able to

expose him everytime he tries a new stunt. Truth has a

very funny way of bobbing up everytime the Member  for

Hong  Lim tries to hoodwink the people and is  himself

exposed. Sir, we all know that the Member for Hong Lim

has one out-standing talent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must put a stop to

this. The Hon. Parliamentary Secretary is embarking on

a  debate  on the Member for Hong Lim. I do not  think

this  Assembly should debate the Member for Hong  Lim,

as the Member for Hong Lim, in this particular motion.

I  have indicated before that if that is to be done in

this Assembly, it must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



done  by  a substantive motion. Let us try and confine

ourselves to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Sir. I shall now read

the  original motion of the Member for Hong Lim  which

states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly urges the Prime Minister to fight

in the Internal Security Council for the unconditional

release  of all political detainees who were  detained

by the Lim Yew Hock Government.'



<br><br>Running  through this motion, we are able to  read  in

and  between  the  lines the false premises  messed-up

with paranoic tendencies of a persecution complex. The

Member  for  Hong Lim is still trying to persuade  the

people  that  his quarrel is not with the  P.A.P. but

with  the Prime Minister, as indicated by the  wording

of   his   motion.  Perhaps  politicians  with  mental

aberrations  are unable to see their  true  selves  as

others  see  them. The Member for Hong Lim has  worded

his  motion with vengeance towards the Prime  Minister

in  a very personal way. He has intended the motion to

be  a  double-edged sword to cut deeply into the Prime

Minister on the one hand, and into the front and  back

benchers  on this side of the House on the  other.  He

has  hoped to give the impression, through the motion,

that  the Prime Minister is the dictator of the Party,

and  all the rest of us here are mere stooges. He  has

also aimed to discredit the Prime Minister in the eyes

of the progressive elements and to embarrass the front

and the back benchers when it comes to voting. We have

seen  thoroughly through his mischief, and it  is  for

these  reasons, Sir, that the Leader of the House  has

amended  the motion to read the "Government" in  place

of the "Prime Minister".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is because when the Member for Hong Lim

was  the Minister for National Development he  was  so

preoccupied  with  his  selfish  schemes   of   empire

building  that  he  was  unable  to  believe  in  the

principles  of  collective leadership.  Where  he  had

himself failed, he could not believe that others could

succeed.  Going through the original motion,  Sir,  we

can   see  glaring  and  deliberate  errors  both   of

commission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



and omission. As an ex-member of the Internal Security

Council, the Member for Hong Lim must surely know  and

must   surely  realise  that  the  British   and   the

Federation Governments have the decisive vote  in  the

Internal  Security Council, and that however hard  the

Singapore Government fights in respect of the  release

of  the  political  detainees, it would  be  in  vain,

unless the British and the Federation Governments  are

fully  satisfied,  `by the detainees themselves,  that

their release would not be detrimental to the interest

of the Federation of Malaya. Hence the amendment



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.this Assembly endorses the Government's view that

the  detainees  should assist the  Government  in  its

efforts   to   secure  their  release   by   sincerely

repudiating  the methods and aims of political  forces

dedicated to the overthrow of the democratic system by

subversion and violence.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of deliberate errors of commission, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, cannot be forgiven. I might  add,  Sir,

that  the original motion was worded to make it appear

that the Singapore Government had never fought for the

release of the detainees. Nothing can be further  from

the  truth.  Even before the P.A.P. formed  Government

the  wheels  were  set in motion for  the  release  of

political  detainees by the collective  leadership  of

the  Party.  It is indeed true to say that the  P.A.P.

kept  its  promises  fully that it  would  not  assume

Government unless and until our friends and colleagues

detained  by the previous Government were given  their

freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last June, eight of our colleagues came out of Changi

gaol. Since then we have unrelentingly fought for  the

release of the remaining political detainees, and will

continue  to fight for their release. And I  say  here

that all of us on this side of the House support full-heartedly the amendment of the Leader of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim may not be aware of the fact

that  since  June 1959, we have fought  for  and  have

secured the release of 32 political detainees cut of a

total of 60. It is up to the detainees themselves  now

to fight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



their  own battles, and to help themselves. I  believe

that they have no need for people like the Member  for

Hong  Lim  to  fight, unsolicited, their  battles  for

them,  and  they  have indicated so  in  no  uncertain

terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conspicuous and deliberate error of omission of

the  Member for Hong Lim lies in his failure to  state

his  stand  on  the most fundamental political  issue.

When  he was with us in the People's Action Party,  he

believed  in the creation of a democratic,  socialist,

non-Communist Malaya. Now that he has been expelled by

the Party, does he still believe in the creation of  a

democratic, socialist, non-Communist Malaya,  and  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I challenge him to make his stand.  That

is  important,  Sir, because that  is  the  basic  and

fundamental political stand of any politician. And  if

he  still  believes in the creation of  a  democratic,

socialist,  non-Communist Malaya, let him  say  so  in

this   House,   Sir,  so  that  he   may   take   into

consideration his own political beliefs whenever he is

struck  by  the  anxiety to rant and to sensationalise

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he agrees that the creation of a democratic,

socialist,  non-Communist  Malaya  is  in   the   best

interest  of this country, then surely he  must  agree

with  us, Mr Speaker, Sir, that any power that  seeks

to  overthrow this democratic system by subversion and

by  violence  must  be squarely met and  boldly  dealt

with. He must, therefore, support the amendment of the

Leader  of  the House, so ably reamended by  you,  Mr

Speaker, Sir. The motion -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope that remark does not

indicate  to  anybody that I have taken  part  in  the

debate.  The amendment is the amendment of the  Leader

of the House, and I only assisted in drafting it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Perhaps I might be permitted to

thank  you  for your assistance in drafting  and  your

guidance. Perhaps it is uncalled for, since the Leader

of  the  House has already expressed his  thanks  just

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion of the Member for Hong

Lim  appears very much to be and indeed is a  bid  for

political support by progressive elements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



He  is  doing it unashamedly despite having been  told

off in the most unmistakable terms. But then he has no

alternative. Having been expelled by the  P.A.P. from

the  left and being unacceptable to our friends on the

opposite  benches who represent ineffective  political

movements  on the right, he has to crawl back  to  the

very  elements  who kicked him out of  the  P.A.P. in

1957. Very few politicians, Sir, except those bankrupt

of  ideas  and ideals, have had the pig-headedness  to

steer through dead-ends in similar circumstances. This

is not the first nor the last time that the Member for

Hong  Lim will try to bamboozle the people with  empty

slogans.  The collective leadership of the Party  will

deal  effectively  with each and  every  one  of  such

motions that he may introduce into this Assembly,  and

will  see  to  it that all his schemes will  boomerang

back to him and expose him for what he really is.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly urges the Prime Minister to fight

in the Internal Security Council for the unconditional

release  of all political detainees who were  detained

by the Lim Yew Hock Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from "urges" in line 1 to the end and

there to insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the Government to continue to fight in the Internal

Security  Council  for the release  of  all  political

detainees  who  were  detained by  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government and this Assembly endorses the Government's

view  that  the detainees should assist the Government

in  its  efforts to secure their release by  sincerely

repudiating  the methods and aims of political  forces

dedicated to the overthrow of the democratic system by

subversion and violence".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out, be

left out," put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question now is, "That the words

proposed to be inserted, be there inserted." Mr Rajah

to move simpliciter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move

simpliciter,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the words "who were detained by the Lim Yew Hock

Government" be left out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion will then read without that particular

phrase.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has been proposed that the following

words be inserted to replace the words which have been

left out. These words are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the Government to continue to fight in the Internal

Security  Council  for the release  of  all  political

detainees  who  were  detained by  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government and this Assembly endorses the Government's

view  that  the detainees should assist the Government

in  its  efforts to secure their release by  sincerely

repudiating  the methods and aims of political  forces

dedicated to the overthrow of the democratic system by

subversion and violence'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now an amendment to the amendment has been proposed,

to  leave out the words, "who were detained by the Lim

Yew Hock Government". The Question is, "That the words

proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that amendment to the amendment has been

disposed  of,  the  debate must be  confined  to  that

amendment only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no Member wishes to speak, I will put the Question

on that amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, on the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, the ex-Minister for

National Development is indeed a very strange -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I have made myself

clear. At the moment we are debating whether the words

proposed by the Member for Farrer Park to be left  out

should be left out, i.e. the words, "who were detained

by  the Lim Yew Hock Government". In other words,  the

issue is whether or not the motion should include  all

political  detainees  instead  of  being  confined  to

detainees   being  detained  by  the  Lim   Yew   Hock

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might also assist hon. Members by indicating that

those  Members who have already spoken can still speak

on this particular issue. If nobody wishes to speak on

that issue, then I shall put the Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are now back to the amendment moved

by the Leader of the House, the position being that in

the original Question the words "the Prime Minister to

fight  in  the  internal  Security  Council  for   the

unconditional  release of all political detainees  who

were detained by the Lim Yew Hock Government" have now

been omitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the following words proposed

to be inserted, be there inserted:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the Government to continue to fight in the Internal

Security  Council  for the release  of  all  political

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might remind hon. Members that the debate now must

be  centred  on  the  words that are  proposed  to  be

inserted. We have done with the words which have  been

omitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low Por Tuck.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I ask the same question: whether

the hon. Member has supplied a copy of his speech to

the Interpreter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> No. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If it is to be a lengthy and involved

speech,  then of course there will be difficulty  with

the  interpretation. If the hon. Member can assure  me

that  his  speech  will not be too long  and  not  too

involved,  then  he can speak. We have had  difficulty

with interpretation in the past.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> It is quite a short one, Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, the suggestion of the

Member  for  Hong Lim on the unconditional release  of

these political detainees -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps I had better make myself clear.

In  so far as the words that were proposed to be  left

out are concerned, the debate is at an end. We are now

debating  the  words  that the  Leader  of  the  House

proposes  to insert. Any reference to the  words  that

have been omitted will be out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

concerning the Member for Hong Lim's motion to release

for Hong Lim for several years. That is not strange at

all.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

missed  his opportunity. He is now going back  to  the

motion moved by the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



We  have,  in  effect, disposed  of  his  motion.  The

Question before the Assembly now is the motion by  the

Leader of the House, that is, "That the words proposed

to  be  inserted, be there inserted," and  the  debate

must be confined to those words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. I fully

support  the  Deputy Prime Minister's amended  motion.

What  I  have said just now is this: this problem  has

arisen  because  the Member for Hong  Lim  raised  the

question  and, in my opinion, it is not surprising  at

all,  because just now I have said that  I  have  been

with  him for many years and I know his character very

well.  Personally  I do not attack  him  or  have  any

criticisms  against  him, but I feel  that  from  this

motion raised, we can see that the Member for Hong Lim

shows that he is both anti-colonialistic -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has lost

his  opportunity.  What  he is  saying  is  completely

irrelevant  to  the Question now before the  Assembly.

What he is saying could have been said perhaps when we

were  dealing  with  the  Question,  "That  the  words

proposed  to  be left out, be left out."  Now  we  are

dealing with the Question, "That the words proposed to

be  inserted, be there inserted." That is all there is

before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

concerning this question, it is necessary  for  me  to

get to the root of the problem. On 14th October, 1959,

our Deputy Prime Minister said in this Assembly - if you

will allow me to read the text in English, it will  be

a correct quotation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Since the Hon. the Parliamentary

Secretary  has  chosen to speak in Mandarin,  he  must

continue in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Then let me read from

a  newspaper what our Deputy Prime Minister has  said.

It  is the Sin Chew Jit Poh, a local paper, dated 15th

October,  1959.  On  page 1, it  says  [Hansard,  14th

October, 1959, col. 661]:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We agreed to the provisions for an Internal

Security  Council in June 1957, giving the  Federation

Government  representative  a  deciding  vote  on  our

Security Council, because we recognised that that  was

better than giving the British Government the decisive

say and that, in fact, if we achieved independence  we

can only do so as a Member State of the Federation, in

which  case  the Federation Government  would  have  a

decisive  voice  in  our  national  policies   anyway.

Therefore,  until  independence  through   merger   is

achieved,  we  accept the position of  the  Federation

Government  having  a deciding vote  in  the  Internal

Security Council.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today we are debating this question. The

important point is this: when we struggled for  a  new

Constitution, the Member for Hong Lim was at that time

in  the P.A.P. He also agreed that we ought to use the

Constitution as a stepping-stone to a new  stage.  But

unfortunately  today our ex-colleague,  that  is,  the

Member  for  Hong  Lim, completely ignored  the  basic

source of this problem. He did not point out the basic

source  of  the  problem. He only led  the  people  to

believe  the  present  circumstances.  Concerning  the

problem  of the political detainees, I believe  it  is

not  necessary  for  me  to reiterate  what  my  Party

colleagues  outside the Assembly House have  expressed

on  our Party's stand. Being courageous and determined

to  fight against colonialism, the Member for Hong Lim

ought to analyse the real cause of the problem and  to

point  it  out.  He must not make this  a  superficial

problem, and he must not confuse the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member please relate those

statements to the Question before the House, which is,

that the words proposed by the Leader of the House  to

be  inserted  should be inserted in the place  of  the

words  which have been left out? That is all there  is

before the House. If the Member can relate his remarks

to  the words which are proposed to be inserted,  then

he is in order. If he cannot, he is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, just now

I  have  said  that  it is relevant  to  the  problem,

because, being responsible socialists, we must be able

to  untie  the knot of this problem, and to  tell  the

people today the real facts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



about the problem of the political detainees who  were

detained  under the Lim Yew Hock Government. It  seems

that  the  Member for Hong Lim is very sympathetic  to

those  detainees. He acts as if he is afraid of losing

their help. He thinks that he could use this motion to

revive his position. If a person -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the Parliamentary

Secretary  is not having regard to the ruling  of  the

Chair.  We are now debating the words which the Leader

of  the House has proposed should be inserted. We have

done  with  the words which the Member  for  Hong  Lim

sought to include in his motion. All the remarks  that

are  now being passed would have been relevant if  the

Hon, the Parliamentary Secretary had chosen to  catch

the  Speaker's eye when the Question, "That the  words

proposed to be left out, be left out," was before  the

House. He is now too late. He must now concentrate  on

the  words which the Leader of the House has  proposed

should be inserted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

concerning our Deputy Prime Minister's amended motion,

just now several of my colleagues have expressed their

points  of view. Here, I do not have anything to  add.

From this amended motion, we can say that our attitude

towards  those political detainees detained under  the

Lim  Yew  Hock  Government is  very  clear.  From  the

beginning,  our attitude towards these  detainees  has

been  clearly expressed by our colleagues. The release

of  these  political  detainees  is  positively  being

considered, but just now I have pointed out  that  the

important  point at present is this. In  our  struggle

for constitutional self-government, we were restricted

in  many  ways. At that time, we did not  receive  any

motion  or  criticism  by the  Member  for  Hong  Lim.

Therefore,  being responsible socialists, we  must  be

able to analyse clearly this problem, and to tell  the

people  the facts accordingly. If a person  now  shows

himself  to  be different from what he was many  years

ago, by his point of view and by his speeches, then he

may confuse the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



people's  vision. Mr Speaker, I support this  amended

motion by the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although a

certain part of this amendment reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...that the detainees should assist the Government in

its  efforts  to  secure their  release  by  sincerely

repudiating  the methods and aims of political  forces

dedicated to the overthrow of the democratic system by

subversion and violence.',



<br><br>I  take  it  that Government does not  mean  that  any

effort  to  overthrow the democratic system  by  means

other   than   subversion  and  violence   should   be

tolerated.  I take it for granted that any  effort  to

overthrow  the democratic system should be  prevented.

Now  if  Government accepts that the democratic system

must  be upheld, then this whole amendment is a farce.

Let  us  look  at  these  two words,  Sir,  "sincerely

repudiating". By using those two words, the Government

is  admitting  that these people who are detained  had

been  justifiably  detained. In other  words,  as  the

Member  for Farrer Park has put it, they were  enemies

of  the  State. Let us look at it this way. They  were

enemies  of  the State, and so they were detained,  no

matter by whatever government. But the mere fact  that

the Lim Yew Hock Government had put them in -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Here again the hon. Member is

wandering away from what is before the House. We  have

already  dealt  with the amendment by the  Member  for

Farrer Park to delete the words, "who were detained by

the  Lim Yew Hock Government". There can be no further

reference  now  to  those words, or any  criticism  of

those words. The hon. Member has lost the opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I was

trying to do was not so much to deal with those  words

as  to  show that if this amendment goes in as it  is,

then  it is not upholding the democratic system.  That

is  why  we  cannot  support it,  because  it  is  not

democratic. It is making a division of the enemies, of

the State. A certain section of them are more favoured

than another section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



merely  for  the first two reasons, and  that  is  not

democratic. That was what I was trying to point out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the debate

proceeds, the issues have become clearer and  clearer.

We thought that the P.A.P. in power wanted justice and

mercy  for  all  detainees. But the rejection  of  the

amendment -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Tanglin

perhaps  knows the Standing Orders better than  I  do.

But  he  must  know  that he had  the  opportunity  of

debating  that  particular point when the  Member  for

Farrer  Park moved an amendment. He did not choose  to

debate that point and he cannot now seek to debate  it

or to revive it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I withdraw that, Sir. But as the

amended motion stands, it shows that the Government is

not  interested in justice and mercy for all, but that

there is a struggle for control between the P.A.P. in

power and the P.A.P. in the opposition. It looks as if

the  Government is only interested in  those  who  are

willing  to  signify that they have undergone  such  a

change of heart that they are prepared to support  the

P.A.P. in  power. But if they refuse to  support  the

P.A.P. in  power,  and  they are  still  inclined  to

support  the  Member for Hong Lim's group,  then  they

cannot  be  forgiven.  And all others  who  refuse  to

support the Government in power or disagree with  them

and  are  detained cannot be treated with justice  and

mercy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be inserted be

there inserted," put and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original motion as amended. The

Question  now  is,  "That  this  Assembly  urges   the

Government  to  continue  to  fight  in  the  Internal

Security  Council  for the release  of  all  political

detainees  who  were  detained by  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government and this Assembly endorses the Government's

view  that  the detainees should assist the Government

in  its  efforts to secure their release by  sincerely

repudiating the methods and aims of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



political  forces  dedicated to the overthrow  of  the

democratic system by subversion and violence."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan, in reply to your amended motion?

<br><br>10.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is nothing

much in the speeches of Government Members and Members

from the Singapore People's Alliance that are concrete

enough  for me to give a substantial reply. As far  as

the Government speeches are concerned, how I wish they

were made before the general elections!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's debate we have seen the two basic stands

taken  by  Assemblymen in this House. One of  them  is

taken  by  the  three of us which  is  stated  in  our

original motion, which is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly urges the Prime Minister to fight

in the Internal Security Council for the unconditional

release  of all political detainees who were  detained

by the Lim Yew Hock Government.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our stand and it will always be our stand.

The other 48 Members have one common basic stand, that

is,  the  detainees  should  be  released  subject  to

certain  conditions and qualifications.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  this  is  a  further development  of  the  Prime

Minister's  original stand in 1956 and 1957  which  I

made  in  the speech at the beginning of this  debate.

This  amendment is another alteration of or  deviation

from their original political stand since October 1956

and  September  1957. However, there  are  some  slight

differences  of opinion between those Members  in  the

Government  and  those  belonging  to  the   Singapore

People's  Alliance.  There is no difference  in  their

basic political stand. The difference is shown in  the

amendment moved by the Member for Farrer Park. They do

not  want  to  be  embarrassed by any mention  of  the

arrest of these detainees by their colleague, the  ex-Chief  Minister,  who  is at present  the  Member  for

Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the hon. Member wishes

to mention it in passing, he is quite in order. But if

he wishes to expand on it, then, of course,







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



he is out of order. He should have expanded on it when

the  amendment was before the House. But he  can  just

mention it in passing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The S.P.A. would vote today with

the  Government if it did not embarrass them too much.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I think I should have explained why

the  motion was to urge the Prime Minister instead  of

the  Singapore  Government. It was because  the  Prime

Minister   made   all  the  decisions  without   prior

consultation with myself and the other member  on  the

Internal  Security Council as far as I know,  nor  the

Singapore  Government as represented in  the  Cabinet,

nor  the People's Action Party as represented  by  the

Central  of the Party. That is why the motion  was  to

urge  the  Prime  Minister instead  of  the  Singapore

Government.  It  was  because,  having  been  on   the

Internal  Security Council for many  months,  I  found

out,  to my great shock, that the Prime Minister  took

decisions,  some of which are of vital and fundamental

importance, without prior consultations. I just had to

keep quiet then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one issue brought up in my motion

today  is  whether  the  Prime Minister  has,  on  the

Internal  Security  Council,  ever  fought   for   the

unconditional release of these detainees.  I  know  he

has  not. Excuses about merger with the Federation and

the  powers  of  the  Internal Security  Council  were

"good" excuses, but I was long enough on the I.S.C. to

watch the antics of the Prime Minister there. There is

no  doubt that many detainees have been released;  but

as  we  all  know, they were released  on  conditions.

There  is no doubt that the Prime Minister fought  for

the release of those eight in category one: he had  no

choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, mention has been made of my

personal conduct and I think I need reply in only  one

sentence.  If I had wanted, I could have accepted  all

the  offers  of  trips overseas,  I  could  have  been

contented; remain Minister, with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



all  the departments under my control; that is,  if  I

had  decided from the beginning to go along with  them

in  their pro-colonial course. The speeches which have

been  made  by the Government Benchers show  that  the

departures  are  very serious departures  indeed  from

their  original stand. The issue today is not an issue

of  whether the democratic system will survive or not.

I  think  the  Government is trying to exaggerate  and

shift  the  issue. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  support  the

democratic  system  and I believe  everybody  in  this

House does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point today is, as I have quoted at the beginning

of  my  speech from Hansard, that these are the people

who  fought with the Prime Minister against  a  common

enemy-the  British.  That was  before  the  Secretary-General  of the P.A.P. became the Prime Minister.  And

we  have two results for two sets of people. The issue

today  is  a  question of honour. It is  a  matter  of

people   fighting  against  a  common  enemy  and   on

principles that had often been enunciated by the Prime

Minister  in this Assembly. The Prime Minister  should

come  to their aid at this moment and fight for  their

unconditional and immediate release, it is not as  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health has

said, that it is now up to the detainees to fight  for

themselves, or as the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Prime  Minister  has said, to persuade,  convince  and

brainwash  these  people. The issue  is  primarily  an

issue of honour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Tanglin that there are

two  P.A.P.'s  in  this House. One is  the  P.A.P. in

power,  which  is in name only and does not  represent

the  P.A.P. which was known to the masses before  the

general elections. The Member for Tanglin, without any

hesitation, would support the P.A.P. in power on  this

vital  issue if the amendment of the Member for Farrer

Park  was  carried.  Mr Speaker,  we  are  the  other

P.A.P., the P.A.P. not in power - the real P.A.P. as the

masses knew it before the general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.
