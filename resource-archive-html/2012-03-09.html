                     <strong class="ph b">The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC) seat
is vacant after the Workers' Party expelled Mr Yaw Shin Leong, following
several weeks of media reports on Mr Yaw's personal indiscretions.
I intend to call a by-election in Hougang to fill this vacancy.
However, I have not yet decided on the timing of the by-election.
In deciding on the timing, I will take into account all relevant
factors, including the well-being of Hougang residents, issues on
the national agenda, as well as the international backdrop which
affects our prosperity and security.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7162312a-c50e-48c4-b016-5e049d3d18dc">

of whether and when I must call a by-election, an application has
been filed in court concerning this. So, the matter is now <em class="ph i">sub
judice</em>, that is, under the consideration of the court. While
Members enjoy parliamentary immunity in this House, as Mr Speaker
has just reminded us, our parliamentary convention is that we do not
talk about matters which are <em class="ph i">sub judice, </em>for good reason.</p>

Members that Parliament debated this issue extensively in August
2008 when two Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) moved a motion, proposing
to require the Prime Minister to call a by-election within three
months of a seat falling vacant, amongst other things. I spoke in
that debate and stated the Government's position fully, after taking
the advice of the Attorney-General. And before answering today's
question, I consulted the present Attorney-General again to confirm his
advice.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cdde89a6-20a1-4207-9814-9937c3e1508e">
                  <a name="id-da7a09fb-c161-4979-956c-a651c0b68488__id-cdde89a6-20a1-4207-9814-9937c3e1508e"><!--a--></a>Let me summarise what
I said in 2008 about the constitutional position. Article 49 of the
Constitution states that when a seat falls vacant, it shall be filled
by election. In an SMC, a seat falls vacant when the Member of Parliament
vacates his office, for example, when he is expelled from his political
party, resigns from his seat or passes away. The timing of the by-election
is at the discretion of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is not
obliged to call a by-election within any fixed time frame. This
absence of any stipulated time frame is the result of a deliberate
decision by Parliament to confer on the Prime Minister the discretion
to decide when to fill a Parliament vacancy.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-32f6b88a-86ee-4f87-95e3-31e7ca17b37f">
                  <a name="id-da7a09fb-c161-4979-956c-a651c0b68488__id-32f6b88a-86ee-4f87-95e3-31e7ca17b37f"><!--a--></a>Then Prime Minister Mr
Lee Kuan Yew explained this when he moved the constitutional amendment
in December 1965, in other words, immediately after Singapore became
independent. I quote from his speech then:</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2427</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f2ed0bab-7f65-410b-bfe8-8149c1feb9a3">
                  <a name="id-da7a09fb-c161-4979-956c-a651c0b68488__id-f2ed0bab-7f65-410b-bfe8-8149c1feb9a3"><!--a--></a>"(This amendment) revokes the clause which
was introduced into the State Constitution of Singapore when it
entered Malaysia. Members in this House will know that there was
no such injunction of holding a by-election within three months
in our previous Constitution. We resisted this particular condition
being imposed upon the State Constitution at the time we entered
Malaysia. But our representations were not accepted because Malaysia
insisted on uniformity of our laws with the other States in the
Federation, and with the Federal Constitution itself. Since we are
no longer part of the Federal whole, for reasons which we find valid
and valuable as a result of our own experience of elections and
of government in Singapore, we have decided that this limitation
should no longer apply."</p>

reflects a political philosophy that emphasises stable government
and the view that in elections, voters are primarily choosing between political
parties to be given the mandate to govern the country, rather than
between individual candidates to become Members of Parliament. We

Supplementary question, Sir. I am pleased to note that the Prime
Minister has said that he has decided to call a by-election. That
settles all the hypothetical speculation outside the House. He said
that he would consider all factors before deciding when a by-election
should be called. I would like to ask whether or not, after considering
all the factors, would he be able to indicate a period in which
a by-election would be called.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, two supplementary questions for the Prime Minister.
Does the Prime Minister not agree that with the Hougang SMC being vacant,
there is actually an under-representation of the Hougang voters
in this House? The second clarification is, he mentioned that there
would be factors that he would consider in deciding when to call
the by-election. In this particular instance, can he specify what
are the matters which would delay calling the Hougang by-election?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
on the first question of whether there is an under-representation
of the interest of the voters of Hougang as a result of this, I
do not know that. If that is an issue, I would have thought it is
something which the Workers' Party would have considered before
deciding to expel Mr Yaw Shin Leong. Because the Constitution is
clear. The rules are clear. How by-elections are called or not called
is also completely clear. We debated this in the House. If we are
in this situation today, it is because
the Workers' Party has caused this situation to happen, knowing
the consequences. As for the second question, I have already answered
Mr Low three times, and I think my answer stands.</p>

$50. This may not be a significant amount to IRAS but will mean
much to a number of less well-off families. In addition, would the
Government consider extending the waiver to all households with
children and grandchildren under the age of 17? </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
the introduction of the maid levy subsidy of $120 for families caring
for the elderly with severe dementia and other disabilities is a
gracious and generous act. Sir, nobody wants to be sick or to be
stricken with a severe disability. For a family who has to care
for an elderly with severe disabilities, the burden of care is heavy.
We must give the best support to low- and middle-income families
to cope with this financial burden. Caregiving at home is no longer
an option for them, but a critical necessity, as hiring a private
nurse or caregiver would be out of their reach. The elderly would have to be cared
for full-time, and probably for a life-time. Thus, the foreign domestic
helper can free up family members to continue with their jobs while
at the same time, ensuring the elderly sick is well looked after.
Even though this grant is on top of the existing maid levy concession
of $170, as the hon Member Mr Gan Thiam Poh just mentioned, there
is still a levy gap of $50. I would urge the Government to consider increasing

Mr Chairman, Sir, allow me to declare that I am currently the Executive
Secretary of the Education Services Union. Chairman, the pre-school
sector has seen burgeoning demand for places in the past two years
that will likely not wane in the next two. Yet challenges on the
ground, relating particularly to the supply of good professionals,
are yet to be adequately addressed. In 2011, MCYS announced the
development of 200 new pre-school centres by 2013. Initiatives announced
in Budget 2012 will further bolster the demand for places: enhanced
pre-school subsidies for children from less well-off families make
it more attractive for them to be enrolled in pre-school centres;
and Budget 2012 has committed to increasing the number of places
in centres for children in need of early intervention. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-df9ec988-5848-4090-9a66-1a6c9781df1f">

urgent situation on the supply side of things appears to have been
overlooked in comparison to the created demand for pre-school places.
Supply not with regards to the projected number of children entering
this education stream in the next two years but the supply of quality
manpower to staff and develop these very centres we are building.</p>

new positions will be created by 2014. Yet, ground feedback from
pre-school operators and hiring managers is consistently dire. There
are simply not enough good pre-school educators to go around. It
seems now that we are caught up in a blind race to create a first-rate
pre-school ecosystem only to miss out on an essential aspect of
educating: that is, the educators themselves. What are MCYS' plans
to attract talented professionals to join this sector? </p>

fundamental question. Is the chronic lack of educators because the
sector itself is unattractive? If so, what makes this sector unattractive?
I posit two reasons: the remuneration package and the lack of professional
standing of the sector. In
the past year, NTUC First Campus and PAP Community Foundation announced
salary revisions for their teachers. This resulted in strong reactions
on the ground as other operators strove to roll out policies to
better retain staffs. Enlightened operators reviewed to enhance
their employee value proposition and revise their salaries whilst others
reviewed and made it even more punitive for their staff. In the
latter point, the clauses of such employees' contracts are often
not illegal but are highly unfair and unreasonable. For such cases,
the assistance rendered by the MOM is limited as to the scope of
the Employment Act. Those holding supervisory positions in pre-schools
are at an even greater disadvantage, with coverage limited to salary
claims.</p>

sector be seen as a professional sector if management practices
are still unprofessional? What is deemed as fair and competitive
for the remuneration package? The pre-school sector is regulated

similar regulations not extended to ensure a good workplace environment

a strong pipeline of well-qualified and talented professionals for
the sector, the sector needs well-run centres that offer a variety
of quality programmes for parents' choice. In this case, I urge
that more support be extended to small and mid-sized operators who
are doing a good job in offering good employment options to staffs
and good quality programmes to parents. There are already such operators
– both private and VWOs – in the market. Due to their size, these
owners experience more keenly the pressures of the pre-school business
– from locating suitable spaces, to coping with rising rental costs
and, of course, attracting and retaining talents. </p>

Thank you, Chairman. With more women being encouraged to join the
workforce, measures must be in place to ensure that we have enough
affordable childcare centres in convenient locations affording good
quality care. Many young couples have expressed reservations about
having more children as they are not confident that they will be
able to provide good care with both parents and increasingly grandparents
active in the workforce. Hence, I would like to request that the Government
consider regulating and possibly standardising the fees at childcare centres.
At the same time, would the Ministry consider providing more generous increases
in childcare subsidies to make the fees more affordable for Singaporeans? Hopefully,
this will encourage Singaporeans to have more babies. In addition,
would the Government explore the possibilities of expanding the
capacity of schools to incorporate the provision of childcare and
before-and-after-school care services by the operators? This will provide a convenient
service to many parents with children in different age groups.</p>

A good early start to education is important to a child's development.
It is especially important for the lower income families to help
the child be ready for primary school. Schemes like the Kindergarten Financial
Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) with start-up grants and monthly fee subsidies
are helpful to the low-income group. However, after eight years
of KiFAS' implementation since January 2004, only one kindergarten
group, namely the PAP Community Foundation, qualifies as the eligible
provider despite there being some 260 non-PCF kindergartens.</p>

centres licensed by MCYS are eligible centres for the Centre-based
Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC). While understanding
the need to ensure quality of education, the bar is set so high
that only one organisation in the industry has qualified so far.</p>

and reputable kindergarten providers in the industry, including
the kindergartens that my siblings, my wife and I attended as children.
Many of these kindergartens operate within the community, providing
affordable and high quality pre-school education, but are not KiFAS-eligible.
KiFAS-eligible criteria, amongst others, include: one, have no religious
affiliation or relation to racial groups; and, two, be financially
sound, with a minimum paid-up capital of $5 million. These two stringent criteria
are not required for CFAC and I am not sure why they are required
here. I hope MCYS will review the eligibility criteria to ensure
greater choice of kindergartens for low-income families to send
children to, including to private kindergartens.</p>

Mr Chairman, single unwed mothers face many challenges and are unable
to claim some benefits that other lawfully wedded mothers do. One
of these benefits is to be covered under the Child Development Co-Savings
Act which entitles the mother to a total of 16 weeks of maternity
leave. Sir, the current policies made may correctly seek to reinforce
the role that the single woman's parents play in supporting the
family unit. However, maternity leave could be seen primarily as
being of benefit to the infant. Women who have adequate maternity
leave are more likely to fully breast feed for the recommended time,
with this having significant long-term benefits to the child in
terms of growth, development and bonding with the parents. These
beneficial effects cannot be addressed in any other way except by
allowing the mother and the infant to spend time together.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-375b82db-1327-47f5-81ec-04cdbff82a19">
                  <a name="budget__id-375b82db-1327-47f5-81ec-04cdbff82a19"><!--a--></a>While there are provisions
for mothers to claim more maternity benefits if they subsequently
marry, this is a narrow view, only addresses the concept of reward,
and does not in any way provide for the needs of the infant in the
first four months' life. We should not deny a Singaporean child
equal access to his mother in the early days of his life. Would
the Ministry review extending full maternity leave benefits to all
Singaporean children, regardless of the status of their mothers?</p>

Chairman, I declare my interest as a lawyer practising family law.
On 4 March 2012, <em class="ph i">The Sunday Times</em> carried interviews of older
people divorcing, after their children have grown up and could better
accept their parents' divorce. These elderly divorcees felt compelled
to keep their families intact when their children were young. For
their children's sake, they suppressed their own miseries and suffered
in silence.</p>

to married couples today. Not only do they want to end their misery
quickly through a divorce, they also triangulate their children
in the battle to defeat their spouses. Most ignore the hurt that
they inflict on their children when they indulge in painting their
spouses as monsters in order to win sole custody, care and control
of their children. Even while they hurry to end their marriage,
they cannot resist burying their spouses first. There are also those
who impatiently force their children to embrace new "mummy" and
"daddy" even before their children could come to terms that their
own mummy and daddy are going separate ways but they do not know
why. </p>

are denying the other spouse contact with their children even though
they are still living under the same roof. The deprived parents
have been going to the childcare centres or schools to plead with

child away. There were ugly scenes when permission was denied, adding
to the embarrassment and humiliation of the child.</p>

out to these children who are caught in the crossfire. Someone must
be there for them, to help them understand that the failed marriage

over. We should not underestimate the impact of a broken marriage

to these children to help them cope with the divorce. Shield them
from the ignorance of their peers who despise or insult them, or
the disdain of teachers who add on to their misery. Let specially-trained
school counsellors have access to them so that they have a compassionate
person to turn to who could hug, soothe and comfort the deeply hurt
child who cannot express his sufferings. Empower the Judge to order
that from the time the Writ for divorce is served until the Final Judgment
is made, all children below 18 must have equal time to be with each
parent. The parent who breaches this order or harbours the child
should be promptly sanctioned with a jail term of at least one day
for each day that he denies the other parent access.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, this
cut is about whether some of our most vulnerable children – those
caught up in acrimonious divorces – are being alienated from their
parents due to inadequate Government resources being channelled
towards administering court orders.
It is also about whether their parents' rights, as enshrined in
court orders, are being honoured or not.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-257929b8-bef0-4574-8e05-1fd7f1e0a6e7"><!--a--></a>In acrimonious divorces,
the Family Court may order that the parent who does not have care
and control of the child gets access under supervision or that the
transfer process for access be supervised. The supervising party
is usually a Family Service Centre (FSC). I have received feedback
from parents that the court orders take months to be implemented
and, even when they are, there are compromises on the access given to
these parents. I understand that after the Court issues the order,
it takes about one month for the FSC to process it. Thereafter,
both parents have to be interviewed by the FSC which could take
another month. It could then take an additional one to two months before
a suitable date for access can be found.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-13c69d3a-e4f3-4159-a883-c2108bb18526">

to four months passes before the parent with access gets to see the
child. After a few sessions, a report is sent to the Court for review
after which a final order is made which may take another month.
I am told that it is not uncommon that parents in such situations
only see their children two to three times in six months. In addition,
I understand that in cases where the Court orders liberal access,
for example, of several times a week, the FSCs were not able to
cope with the workload and had advised parents to accept access
only once a week.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-c7066814-5ee6-426b-bdff-9f97fb8ce134"><!--a--></a>Sir, because of the delays
and infrequent contact, the child may then become alienated from
the access parent which may be very difficult to remedy. While some
part of the delay is probably caused by the parents, how far do
resource limitations at the FSCs aggravate the delays? Should more
resources be given to the FSCs or can suitable other third parties
be found to supervise such cases? The well-being of these vulnerable children
deserves our attention.</p>

Sir, the Assisting Technology Fund (ATF) was set up to provide financial
assistance to persons with disabilities (PWD), to purchase existing

to the applicant's household income. In view of the recent measures,
such as the extension of the Special Employment Credit to employers

ATF is sufficient and decide whether enhancements are needed to
ensure its relevance. Would the Minister share with us his views

Mr Chairman, I am deeply heartened by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman's
announcement that the needs of children with mild speech, language
and learning delays will be addressed through the Development Support
Programme (DSP). This will certainly close the gap and help these
children cope and stay within mainstream education. However, we
are also aware of the global shortage of therapists, and Singapore
is certainly not spared from this. To this end, how can MCYS ramp
up the manpower capacity as soon as possible to extend the outreach beyond
the 2,000 children who will benefit under this new programme?</p>

and provide early interventions for children with learning difficulties?
We all know every child is precious. Early detection and intervention
can certainly improve the child's chance of progress tremendously.
We cannot afford to let any child fall through the cracks. Sir,
I would also like to ask if MCYS would be harmonising its programmes
with MOE to reach pre-schoolers in kindergartens. Will there be
coordinated efforts that will maximise joint resources and expertise
and make best use of the limited manpower capacity in this area? </p>

to know if the MCYS is considering instituting a screening process
in all pre-schools and childcare centres to detect children with
learning difficulties. The recent MCYS' Enabling Masterplan highlighted
that there is currently a screening gap between the ages of 18 months
and three years in a child's life. This period is certainly critical
to detect developmental disorders for this is when the child develops
further in his or her motor, speech and social skills. How can doctors,
parents and caregivers be alerted to take note of this condition?
Let us all ensure that no child gets left behind.</p>

and congratulate the MCYS Acting Minister and the SSC senior management
for coming up with a list of recommendations for public consultation

it easier for all Singaporeans to take up sporting activities.</p>

in Vision 2030 is that sports should become the strategy for different
sectors in society to enable us to achieve aims, such as heightened productivity,
a greater sense of belonging and a stronger commitment and motivation to
contribute to the country. This contrasts with the traditional ethos
which was that we, as a community, should instead devise strategies
to incorporate sports to a greater extent in our lives. Observers
have said that the recommendations could be a little bit too generic,
but this may be what is needed at this stage as the public consultation
phase is launched so as not to limit the inputs from a wider audience,
and also to encourage greater buy-in from the public. As the Sports
Council Chairman Richard Seow put it to me, the hooks are all in
the water and we are waiting to see what people are interested in. </p>

at in the recommendations is the need to inculcate a true passion
for sports in all Singaporeans, and I believe that this will be
the crucial factor going forward if we are to leverage on all the
other improvements that Vision 2030 seeks to make.</p>

a long way in the past two decades. From targeting medals at regional
competitions like the Southeast Asian Games, Asian and Commonwealth
Games, we are now a player on the international stage, garnering results
at World Championships and Olympic Games. We have established stars
like our table-tennis team and Tao Li who can be counted on to deliver
on the biggest stages, and we have upcoming campaigners in badminton
players, such as Fu Mingtian, who wowed us with their courage under
pressure. And the future definitely looks bright when we hear about
the exploits of youngsters like swimmer Joseph Schooling who, at

was the same age.</p>

up to other countries of similar size and population who are outperforming
us in the international sporting arena, we do indeed need to do
more. With few exceptions, countries and societies who are able
to consistently produce sporting world beaters and champions throughout
their history have more than just a solid infrastructure, good facilities
or a roster of accredited coaches. There is a sporting culture that
runs through the entire society that instils a deep-rooted love
and passion for sports in the population from an early age.</p>

enjoy outings to watch matches, competitions and events instead
of spending time in shopping malls or movie theatres. Besides just
learning about the values that sports can impart, such as discipline,
respect, focus and determination, there is a true love for the excitement
and thrills that are inherent in sporting competitions. Athletes
are celebrated as sporting heroes and held up as role models. Youngsters
grow up with posters of top athletes on the walls of their rooms
and their parents do not discourage them from emulating their idols
or pursuing their dreams.
This love and passion translates into a wide pool of talent flowing
through the sports infrastructure and creates the base of athletes
needed to develop and groom champions on a sustainable basis.</p>

the OCBC Cycle Singapore event, for example, and the participation

the Standard Chartered Marathon regularly draws in close to 65,000
runners annually. But while these numbers may look impressive, it
is important to note that many of the participants come from the same
pool of avid sportsmen and women. As such, this does not imply a
broad-based popularity of sports among all Singaporeans. Such events
are also limited by logistics and space constraints that we face
as a small city-state, and there have been complaints among participants
that the usual race locations are becoming boring as they are often repeated

able to create a true sporting culture, there are a few areas that cannot
be ignored and I would like to highlight just two of them. Firstly
is the impact of our National Sports Associations (NSAs). These
are the over-60 democratically elected federations, manned largely
by volunteers, charged with the management and development of the
various sports in Singapore. The Sports Council currently funds
the bulk of the activities of the NSAs, but aside from funding,
there are many areas where the SSC can help NSAs to professionalise,
improve and upgrade their operations. And the other group of stakeholders
that can be included are private-sector sport businesses which can
develop new training and competition services and experience to
help the sporting culture in Singapore.</p>

we spoke of youth, the word "apathy" almost as naturally rolled
off the lips of many. It was George Bernard Shaw who also once said,
"Youth is wasted on the young." Yet, the image of a <em class="ph i">laissez-faire</em> apathetic
youth is a false one, at least
not with the youths I have met, whether it is polytechnic students
lobbying for fare concessions, hot-blooded eco-warriors advocating
for animal rights or protecting our environment, or the teams of
YEC activists quietly serving their communities, reaching out to
the less fortunate. And, more importantly for me, the many young
workers in the NTUC who have given their time and continue to give
their time to serve their fellow workers in the Labour Movement,
using their youthful passions to ensure that workers' rights are
defended.</p>

are just examples of a small sampling of the endless plethora of
causes that young people – young Singaporeans – are engaged with.
With the advent of social media, every youth can now count himself
as an activist, a campaign manager, an advocate for various causes.
We are witnessing, perhaps, a new spring of activism. The groups
and organisations may be different from the past but the passions are
the same. The generations before us may look at us and say "Why
did we turn out the way we did?" And, we, too, will look at the
generation after and say the same. Yet, each generation will find
its own heroes. Each generation will champion its own causes. </p>

landscape and rapidly evolving social media whirlpool, the NYC,
which saw it genesis in 1989, seems almost arcane with the mushrooming
of different animal welfare groups. Even old stalwarts like the
SPCA have to compete for attention in an overcrowded space, likewise,
the situation for the NYC. As such, there is perhaps no more opportune
time than now to ask if the NYC still has a role to play and how
this grand dame of youth organisations see itself <em class="ph i">vis-a-vis</em> other
youth organisations. With the multiplication of youth opinion leaders,
how then does the MCYS – the Ministry for youths – plan to continue
to nurture these budding leaders so that there is a coherent voice?
So, perhaps now, this impetuous youth begs to differ from the Nobel
Laureate that youths of Singapore are certainly not wasting their
time or their youth. My only hope is their hearts will not be filled
gradually by pessimism and cynicism. </p>

Thank you, Sir. Sir, the Minister announced in February that MCYS
is planning to expand the list of third party exclusion orders under
the Casino Control
Act beyond those who are bankrupt and on Public Assistance allowance.
They may soon cover those receiving some form of Government social
assistance, such as those receiving ComCare. This is sensible. Those
who are in financial hardship and require assistance should be protected
from the risk associated with gambling.</p>

be extended to others who are clearly in financial difficulty. This
is to protect them and their families at a time of increased vulnerability.
In the course of MCYS' review, would the Minister consider the following
categories of people for auto-exclusion as well: (1) those who file
their own petitions, or against whom petitions for bankruptcy are
filed; (2) those who apply under the Debt Restructuring Scheme;
(3) people with adverse credit records with the Credit Bureau; (4)
those who borrow beyond a certain threshold from licensed moneylenders;
(5) people who report, or are credibly reported, to have borrowed
from illegal moneylenders; (6) people with significant or persistent
arrears in utilities payments, HDB loan repayments or service and
conservancy charges; and (7) those who are in arrears of monthly
maintenance payments to their former spouses and their children.</p>

let me first thank all hon Members who have spoken passionately

Beyond making speeches in this Chamber, many Members have, in our

need – regardless of race, language or religion; regardless of political
affiliation; and regardless of whether it is a public, private or
people sector effort. I admire those who see someone in need and

HDB flat in Circuit Road with two grandparents, an aunt, my mother
and my sister – six of us. My late grandmother had a thyroid disorder
and could not walk well. My mother held two jobs to support our
family – a machine operator stamping aluminium plates by day and
an office cleaner by night. We were taught since young that while
we may not be rich, we should cherish what we had, work hard to
be useful to society and, where possible, help others who were less
fortunate than us. </p>

we worked hard, there is hope for a better life – not just for ourselves,
but for our families. And whether in success or failure, whether
in wealth or in poverty, we should also have a heart to help others,
just as some have helped us. We owe our success to society – kind
neighbours who watched over us, unknown donors who contributed to
our education, and Government assistance in various ways. With this
support, we build a "home" – not just a HDB flat, but a sense of
being part of this community and a responsibility towards our fellow
citizens. </p>

standardising childcare fees to make childcare more affordable.
Sir, different operators or centres offer different childcare programmes

For this reason, they have
also different cost structures. It would not be practical for MCYS
to impose a standardised fee structure.</p>

through various subsidies to defray the cost of childcare and kindergarten.
We provide a full day universal childcare subsidy for working mothers up
to $300 per month. Parents can also utilise funds from the Child

of childcare fees. Lower income families are also eligible for further
financial assistance through ComCare.</p>

in a good financial position to provide quality pre-school education. </p>

Mr Yee Jenn Jong's concern to better help our people access more
affordable childcare and kindergarten. But let me explain how we
try to do this on two levels. On one level, we try to lower the
fees that are charged across the board by helping the kindergartens
and the childcare centres to make sure that their costs are contained.
On the other hand, KiFAS is really a scheme targeted at the people
at the lower end of the financial spectrum. It is centred on the
family circumstances rather than centred on the operators themselves.
It is a family- and children-specific scheme, and not so much to
help bring down the costs for the high-end operators.</p>

conduct regular reviews of our pre-school schemes to improve accessibility
and affordability. To ensure that the lower income households with
more dependants receive adequate assistance for their children,
we will introduce a parallel per capita income criterion for our
assistance schemes in childcare, kindergarten and student care.
From April, children from large families will qualify for childcare
and kindergarten assistance if their per capita income is less than
$875. The same will apply for student care assistance from July.
About 5,000 children will benefit from these enhancements.</p>

children need hand holding and social support beyond financial assistance.

case management, Intensive Case Management and the Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE)

and fully resourced by MCYS.</p>

about families on the HOPE scheme. This is an incentive scheme for
young, low-income parents to invest their limited resources in upgrading themselves
and their children, while keeping their families small. As at December
last year, there are about 2,400 families on HOPE. We expect 200
new families to join the scheme this year. We will continue to review
its eligibility criteria to ensure that we reach out to our target
group – those most in need of assistance and family planning.</p>

some Singaporeans need long-term support. We provide this through
the Public Assistance (PA) scheme. Public Assistance serves about
3,000 beneficiaries – mostly elderly or disabled persons with little
income or family support, whom Dr Lily Neo and Mr Vikram Nair have
also asked about. Over the years, we have extended the PA scheme
to help this group. For example, we raised the quantum of cash assistance
for PA recipients last year. </p>

the PA scheme to more needy senior citizens. Some have children
who are low-income earners themselves. We will raise the children's
monthly income criterion from $1,000 to $1,500, so that more elderly
needy with adult children who are themselves in need will be eligible
for Public Assistance. </p>

with no family support but who have some regular payout, although
these may not be sufficient for basic living expenses. In 2010,
we extended the PA scheme to those receiving CPF payouts lower than
the PA rate. This benefited 85-year-old Mdm Mawor and her 67-year-old
daughter. They had struggled to survive on her daughter's Minimum
Sum payout of about $300 per month previously. They are now coping
better with PA cash assistance and medical fee coverage. The community
also assists them with meal delivery and food rations. We will help
more families like Mdm Mawor's. </p>

with non-CPF income sources below the PA rate will also be eligible
for Public Assistance. These can include pensioners and those receiving
small payouts under the Lease Buyback Scheme or ElderShield. Under
PA, they can receive an additional cash grant over and above their
pension or payouts. </p>

ComCare will reach out to many more Singaporeans. In FY 2011, MCYS
disbursed about $70 million through ComCare to help about 67,000 families.
With these changes, we expect to disburse another $20 million each
year, for an additional 15,000 beneficiaries.</p>

Committee's vision for Singapore to be a society where persons with
disabilities are empowered and recognised. Where they can participate fully
in activities, and be respected for who they are – equal, integral
and contributing members to our society. To feel at home in Singapore.
We will provide more support and resources towards the furthering
of this goal. As recommended by the Committee, we will look into
empowering persons with disabilities over their entire life cycle.
We have carefully considered all the recommendations. Senior Parliamentary
Secretary Mr Sam Tan will outline our specific plans and responses. </p>

amongst us have traditionally been cared for, and helped by, our
social service sector. The sector, with its strong spirit of initiative, activism
and self-help, exemplifies the "Heart" of an inclusive society.
Demands on the sector will rise in the coming years along with socio-demographic
changes. Many families, not only the poor or vulnerable, will require
social services. More of us will be "sandwiched" between caring
for our elderly parents and supporting our young children. Community-
and home-based social services will be needed in larger numbers and
variety. </p>

Before I share our plans, let me first touch on what we must preserve,
which is no less important.</p>

sector, we will maintain the fundamental approach of the Public-Private-People
(3P) partnership. It is an approach that brings together the unique strengths
of the stakeholders. It is also one that adds to our social capital,
and engenders greater ownership among citizens, attributes which
Mr Laurence Lien and Miss Penny Low have spoken about.</p>

today are born from the passion and conviction of the People sector.
In 1979, the Asian Women's Welfare Association (AWWA) took on the challenge
of providing services to children with multiple disabilities. These
children were staying at home with no school or programmes available
to meet their needs. Together with a team of volunteer nurses, teachers,
a journalist, a social worker and other volunteers, AWWA started
the AWWA's Handicapped Children's Playgroup for seven children.
From its humble beginning, the playgroup grew and developed into
a professional educational service to educate and train children
with multiple disabilities, shaping what is known as Early Intervention
Programme for Infants and Children today. AWWA is now running early
intervention programmes for more than 150 children. It also runs
a special education school for older kids with disability. </p>

and their professionals and volunteers remain central to the social
service sector. They provide the personal touch and customised ground-up
solutions that are hard to replicate. They are also better able
to mobilise networks and resources on the ground. </p>

has a role to play. We have seen more corporate giving over the
years. This is a trend which we should continue to encourage. Beyond
financial resources, there is room for the private sector to be
more involved in the sharing of ideas and management expertise,
and in offering services and solutions. Their involvement will add
vibrancy to the sector, offering users more choices and options.
Bion Advance is a company founded by Mr Ong Sze Yang, a biological
science graduate from NTU. The company specialises in the supply
of senior mobility aids and products. Having a heart for seniors,
Mr Ong sponsored senior mobility aids to seniors at Southwest CDC.
To date, Bion has donated 100 new design walking sticks to the CDC.
In addition, the company serves as the "walking dictionary" for
the CDC officers looking for advice on senior mobility devices.
Its technical team provides regular and helpful support for the CDC's
elderly clients. </p>

is a "high-touch" sector where the human touch and cultural sensitivity
are paramount. It is served by two groups of dedicated individuals.
The first group comprises the volunteers, who give of their own
time to serve a social cause, out of a spirit of compassion and
giving without remuneration. The other group is the social service
professionals who are employed full-time in areas requiring specialist
expertise. They include social workers, counsellors, early intervention
teachers, therapists and programme developers and coordinators.
A social worker, for example, is trained and qualified with at least
a Bachelor's Degree in Social Work. The two groups must work hand-in-hand
for a thriving social service sector. As Members of the House have mentioned,
we need more of both groups in order to meet the growing demands
of the social service sector. </p>

about the progress of our recent campaign to encourage Singaporeans
to join the social work profession. The campaign, developed in consultation
with the social workers, featured the real-life experiences of social
workers and the
people they helped. The campaign has made some progress in generating awareness.
We hope to turn the awareness into recruitment. The National Council
of Social Service and the Singapore Association of Social Workers
have received more career enquiries. We have also seen an increase
in interest in WDA's mid-career Professional Conversion Programme
because we targeted at the new school leavers and also the people
who want to do a mid-career switch. </p>

of the public and the disability community have given us feedback
that one of the four posters – the one showing two persons with
disability – could be interpreted as the community being labelled
as "hopeless". Sir, this is most unfortunate. I would like to reassure
everyone that it is never our intention to belittle persons with
disabilities or, for that matter, any of the persons whom social
workers help. What the ad seeks to portray are the complex emotions
felt when the real person featured in the ad first suffered the
loss of his leg – a sense of hopelessness – and to convey the role
a professional social worker plays in helping him rebuild his confidence and
rise above the situation. To achieve this, the courage and the determination
of the disabled person are crucial.</p>

We will aspire to improve with each and every campaign. </p>

the salaries of the social service professionals. Social workers

pleased to note that NCSS launched a Social Service Talent Development

pathways. Many more development opportunities will be offered through
the Social Service Training Institute, which will be significantly

enhancing the use of InfoComm Technology (ICT) in the social service
sector. I agree with Miss Low that ICT can be a key enabler for
productivity gains
and service improvements. Take the example of Thye Hua Kwan Tele-Home
Care. This is a pilot initiative that links the elderly in the community
and their care managers through the use of ICT. Each elderly participating
in the project receives a video-conferencing device which has been
modified to be elderly-friendly for them to connect to their case
managers via Skype. With this arrangement, case managers can continue to
follow up on their clients who require close monitoring after regular
home visits. It also enables case managers to better communicate
with their clients through audio-video interaction while reducing
travelling time and transportation costs for the case managers to
perform follow-up visits. Overall, there is an improvement in efficiency
as well as effectiveness. </p>

Youth and Sports (Mdm Halimah Yacob)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, first of all, I would like to wish all our women Members a
very Happy International Women's Day!</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a1722876-dffd-4ec1-8bba-1d80c09f350d">

has spoken about the growing complexity of the problems that we
now face due to a rapidly ageing population, the growing income
gap and other factors.
The Ministry recognises such needs, and we not only regularly review
our schemes to ensure that they remain relevant but also continue
to look at ways to reach out to the needy amongst us. I always find
it a tremendous pleasure to work with the people in the social service
sector – an amazing lot with a tremendous amount of compassion among
them, which is highly infectious. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2449</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bb5f1f0b-984f-4ca0-9e23-fa03d07176a2">
                  <a name="budget__id-bb5f1f0b-984f-4ca0-9e23-fa03d07176a2"><!--a--></a>Compassion, Sir, is the
most important ingredient in delivering an effective social service.
But we recognise that we also need effective systems, processes
and people. To reach out to those in need, the Government cannot
do it alone. Hence, we work closely with the CDCs, the FSCs, the
VWOs and grassroots organisations, all of whom play a very crucial
role in helping us to fulfil our mission. Only with such a strong
partnership will we be able to reach out to the frail, single elderly
living alone, the single mother struggling to bring up her children,
and the low-income family that needs help when the father loses
his job. So, a key element in delivering an effective social service
system is community involvement.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6f2296e9-6ddd-489a-b072-cc30e817fb0a">
                  <a name="budget__id-6f2296e9-6ddd-489a-b072-cc30e817fb0a"><!--a--></a>Local outreach and assistance
can complement national schemes in an important way. They are part
of the social safety net, and help to fill in gaps. But, no matter
what we do, there will continue to be those who fall through the
cracks for whatever reason. How can we prevent this?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7cdcff07-df66-4a74-8ae9-357ba75dd3aa">
                  <a name="budget__id-7cdcff07-df66-4a74-8ae9-357ba75dd3aa"><!--a--></a>A second key element,
therefore, Sir, must be effective coordination. I am as concerned
as the several Members who had spoken in this Committee, such as
Ms Foo Mee Har, on the need for even better coordination and integration
in the delivery of social services. Be it financial assistance,
family services, or eldercare, we need to improve so that we can
catch as many people as possible, even if it is not possible for us
to catch everyone. We cannot and actually do not expect those needing
help to be familiar with all the schemes available. So, I want to
assure Ms Foo that they do not have to know the hundred schemes
NCSS has listed. Neither should our needy have to repeat the same
stories to different agencies, nor fill up the same information
in different forms. Help agencies should work with one another so
as to provide holistic and effective assistance. We need to synchronise
and aim towards a no-wrong-door policy.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-31b485ff-a82b-41c2-991f-cae602449c69"><!--a--></a>Sir, a third key element
is to recognise that our needy families have different needs, so
we have to be client-centric. We have to tailor our assistance to
suit their needs and circumstances. I take note of Mr Gan Thiam
Poh's suggestion of having a common definition to determine eligibility
across assistance schemes. This may sound administratively simpler
but it is not necessarily in the best interests of the needy. A differentiated
approach when it comes to subsidies and assistance to address distinct types
of needs is therefore more helpful.</p>

Members how we apply these concepts in different areas to revamp
our service models, improve our processes and raise the standards
of service delivery, so as to better support our elderly, our low-income
families, and our children. </p>

elderly. Sir, I agree with Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Dr Lily Neo and Mr Patrick
Tay that we need to adopt a holistic approach in caring for the
elderly. That is why we take a Whole-of-Government approach on this.
Minister Gan Kim Yong chairs the Ministerial Committee on Ageing,

Development, Health and my Ministry – and other Government agencies.</p>

success of Singapore, and we are grateful. We understand how they
feel and their heartfelt desires as they age and become frail. If
we ask any of our elderly persons today for their preference, most
will say that they want to be with or close to their families. They
want to live in the community. But, they do not want to be a burden
to their children, their relatives or their neighbours and their
friends.</p>

age-in-place, we need a fundamental re-look at how we design and
organise community- and home-based care to better support them in
their homes and community. This will also help reinforce the role
of the family in caring for them. I am pleased to announce that
the Ministry will be revamping two key services so that our elderly
will receive more effective care and support. These are the Integrated
Day Facilities (IDFs) and Home-based Care. </p>

Mr Ho Koon Chuan, who is currently enjoying the benefits of the

years old today and he attends St Luke's ElderCare in Hougang. St
Luke's has already started delivering integrated services. Rather
than having to shuttle around, Mr Ho goes to St Luke's for both
his physiotherapy and day care needs, all under one roof. St Luke's even
provides transport to and from his house. As we roll out the IDFs,
I believe more will benefit, just like Mr Ho. </p>

staff visiting his home, providing services such as housekeeping,

And I agree with Dr Intan Azura and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, both of whom
will be very happy to know that we are revamping the model so as
to provide coordinated and client-centric home-based care. We call
it "Ensuite Social Home-based Care". The central idea, Sir, is to
have a single care worker who is trained and equipped to perform
a range of services for the elderly person in a single visit. The
Centre for Enabled Living has worked with a couple of organisations

Sir, that we will revamp the SACs so that they can be more effective
in reaching out to the vulnerable elderly, which a number of Members,
such as Mr Vikram Nair, Dr Lily Neo, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Sitoh,
had alluded to. For a start, Sir, the centres will widen their scope
to include those not living in rental flats but who need social
support. To extend coverage, we will ramp up the number of SACs
from 41 to 58 by 2016, so as to cater to 39,000 elderly then, up
from 18,000 elderly today.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a484b2f4-ba1f-4716-a73c-e66fda7ffd0e">
                  <a name="budget__id-a484b2f4-ba1f-4716-a73c-e66fda7ffd0e"><!--a--></a>We will also restructure
the way SACs are organised. We will create 16 "Anchor SACs" out
of the 58 SACs. These will function as social work and support nodes
for vulnerable elderly in the community. They will work with various
touchpoints in the community to receive alerts and referrals of
vulnerable elderly not living in rental flats. They will have trained
volunteers to provide closer supervision for the elderly. Dr Lily Neo
will be happy to know that under the MOH mental health blueprint,
the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will partner our SACs to provide
additional services, such as community mental health services to
better support vulnerable elderly. We will resource our SACs with
extra funding and social work capabilities to enable this. The Ministry
is committing an estimated $70 million over the next five years
to ramp up and resource the SACs.</p>

that we are experimenting with is the concept of Seniors Group Homes.
These homes are meant for elderly persons who have problems with
activities of daily living. We will enable elderly persons to live
together and support each other in a cluster of rental flats. Care
staff will provide support to the residents. The Seniors Activity Centres,
with their expanded scope, will also cover these group homes. With
this arrangement, frail elderly need not be institutionalised prematurely.
They will be able to age with dignity in their own homes, even if
it is a rental flat. We have just started a pilot at MacPherson
that I recently visited, and we will develop another one in Bukit
Merah. We expect to cater to a few hundred elderly over the next
five years.</p>

briefly on what we will do to support our elderly who prefer to and
are able to live independently on their own. More elderly are finding
Studio Apartments an attractive form of housing in their golden
years. With the enhanced incentives by MND, more may move from a
larger flat to a Studio Apartment. For this group, Sir, we should
enable them to live independently.</p>

Sir, that we have begun to partner the commercial sector to bring
elderly-friendly services to the doorstep of the elderly living
in the Studio Apartments. This is a service innovation. These Seniors
Service Centres have social space and services, such as alert alarm
systems, provided free of charge to the residents. At the same time,
they provide fee-based services such as therapy and Traditional Chinese
Medicine, which I understand are hugely popular with the residents.
Because of these commercial activities, centres tend to open seven
days a week and into the nights – a plus for the elderly. </p>

I visited the pilot centre – ECON Health and Wellness – in Bishan,
located under the Golden Jasmine block of Studio Apartments. I saw
for myself how residents who gathered at the centre look out for
each other, lend a listening ear to one another. Some even told
me that they would visit those who are under the weather – because
if they did not see the elderly persons coming down to the centre,
they would start wondering and they go and visit them. The centre
has begun to attract elderly persons outside of the Studio Apartments
who enjoy the friendship and support.</p>

towards building a community for the aged, as Mr Sitoh suggested.
They are also good examples of how we can blend the customer service
and operational capability of the commercial sector, with the care
and compassion of the community, for the benefit of our citizens.
We will open at least another three new such centres this year co-located
with the Studio Apartments.</p>

last two weeks, Sir, many Members have spoken about caregivers,
including Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mrs Lina Chiam and
Dr Intan Azura. Caregivers are our unsung heroes who shoulder stress
and responsibility. </p>

is often a long and challenging journey. But, with the right support,
it can also be fulfilling and life-affirming. The Ministry will
journey alongside caregivers. We will provide support for them to
lean on. </p>

Sir, how we will be doing this in three main areas: first and most
important is to provide information and referral. As a first stop,
families can turn to the Centre for Enabled Living (CEL) established
by MCYS. Families can find information on elderly and disability
care services, financial assistance schemes and caregiver training
programmes, through its website. Those who are less comfortable with
the Internet can also call CEL's helpline – 1800 8585 885. In the
coming years, Sir, CEL will improve its case coordination so that
elderly, adults with disabilities and their families can get help
in putting together care plans that meet their needs, and fit their circumstances.</p>

caregiver training. We agree with Mr Sitoh Yih Pin that it is important
to educate and train our caregivers. This will improve the quality
of care for our elderly. Caregivers can also gain more confidence
that they are taking proper care of their elderly family members,
thus reducing their anxiety and stress.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c31cb9f9-9fcf-44c4-b2de-6f1c6bbd3773">

VWOs and other training providers to develop more of such training
courses. They will be in English, Mandarin, Malay or Tamil to cater
to various caregivers. Together, they expect to train up to 10,000
caregivers this year. We will continue to subsidise these courses
with the Caregiver Training Grant. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-a7ddafbb-1cd5-4659-89cb-839c2d0e2438"><!--a--></a>CEL will also administer
the new additional $120 per month Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW)
grant. This will cover families with a per capita income of up to
$2,200, who look after their elderly with high care needs.</p>

with severe dementia who cannot perform three or more Activities
of Daily Living, such as not being able to feed themselves, bathe,
use the toilet, or move around independently. We are budgeting,
Sir, about $25 million over the next five years for this purpose. </p>

for caregivers. We will provide more respite options. Apart from
IDFs and Ensuite Social Home-based Care services which I announced
earlier, CEL will also look at how it can develop more support services,
such as counselling and elder-sitter programmes, to address the
psycho-emotional stresses that caregivers often experience. </p>

this Committee some of the Ministry's initiatives that support ageing-in-place,
vulnerable elderly, independent living and caregivers. All in all,
we are committing $400 million over the next five years in transforming

new initiatives, our elderly will feel more assured. More of them can

to social assistance and support for our low-income families. The
Minister had shared with Members the enhancements we are making
to ComCare schemes. Other than ComCare, many schemes exist today
to help the needy; delivered by different agencies. Each scheme
has a role to play in the bigger picture, a role in helping and
supporting low-income families.</p>

and today, many Members, such as Mr Seah Kian Peng, Ms Denise Phua,
Ms Foo Mee Har, Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Hawazi Daipi, had called for greater
coordination and integration in the delivery of social services.
These are essentially the client-centric and coordinated elements
that I had mentioned at the beginning of my speech. I agree with
them. Therefore, along with the changes to enhance ComCare schemes, we will expend
efforts to improve service delivery, particularly at two key nodes
– the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and the Family Service
Centres (FSCs).</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2455</p>

the following areas, Sir – first, improving access to information

and training of social assistance officers.</p>

do not know where to seek help. Together with our community partners,
we will step up our outreach and guide them along the way. As Mr Hawazi

themselves.</p>

our ComCare publicity materials, and increase the distribution points.
We will also make our publicity materials simpler and easier to understand.
We have heard feedback that our people are often confused by the
many help schemes. We will present the information in a more client-centric
manner based on the type of help required rather than individual
schemes. And at this point, I just want to reiterate that there
is no need for our needy residents to know about any of the schemes. They
just need to go to any of the touchpoints – FSCs, CDCs, even the
Members of Parliament – to ask for help, and the help will be processed.
The schemes are actually for back-end processing and operation;
there is no need for the needy person to know about it.</p>

grassroots leaders' knowledge of help avenues. Grassroots leaders
are an important touchpoint. Very often, they are the ones who first
encounter those who need help. With training and regular updates,
grassroots leaders can better look out for needy residents in their
midst. We will equip them with a Starter's Kit. With this kit, they
can better advise needy residents on the assistance available, and
connect them to help. </p>

upload more relevant and user-friendly information online, and in print.
We are creating a web-based social service portal called "ComCare.sg".
Those who need help will not need to know the schemes available.
Once again I stress that. Instead, their needs will guide their
online experience, and point them to where to go for help. We know
not everyone who needs help is able to access the web. But those
of us in the community, who want to help them, may. These enhancements
will enable us to guide them better.</p>

approach the CDCs when they need assistance. As part of a concerted
effort to raise the quality of service delivery, CDCs and their
partners are experimenting with various ways to improve the experience
and outcomes of clients who seek help. We are testing out ideas
across the entire journey of a client from the point he walks into the CDC; to when the
CDC assesses his needs and provides assistance; and, finally, to
when he graduates from the scheme. Let me share some of these ideas.</p>

at the CDC sets the tone for the rest of the encounter there. We

we will improve the way we assess and address our clients' needs.
CDCs recognise that every individual or family is unique. Hence,
some of them are trying out a differentiated process of assessing
a client's needs, or a needy family's needs. If someone's needs
are straightforward, and can be addressed in a shorter time, the
CDC officers will do so. </p>

in 10 of all ComCare Transitions applications were rejected due to
a lack of supporting documents, withdrawal of application or because
they could not meet some of the eligibility criteria. This was a
point mentioned by Mr Seah Kian Peng yesterday. And I would like
to assure him that CDC officers do not blindly turn away applicants
just because they do not submit sufficient information. CDC officers
often go out of their way to ensure that help is delivered to the
needy. They make phone calls, they conduct home visits and they
rally the help of the grassroots leaders to trace the needy applicants.</p>

we will customise the amount and type of assistance we provide,

CDCs can and do exercise flexibility for cases when necessary, based

issues need more than financial assistance to get them back on their

arrangements between CDCs and FSCs, we have organised FSCs by district,
supervised by a Cluster Manager at the National Council of Social Service.
The Cluster Manager is the key contact point for the respective
CDCs. They will be familiar with the ground issues and concerns.
My Ministry will also study how to better facilitate sharing of
information between the agencies.</p>

announced, social workers will see their average caseload reduced
by 20%. They can devote more time to helping vulnerable families
with more complex needs. As there will always be a mix of simple
and complex cases, we should not be overly fixated by this ratio.
Neither should we merely track the volume of cases. Since 2009,
we have started with outcome indicators.</p>

need for FSC services. Cases are becoming more complex. I am pleased
to announce that we will introduce a new Master Social Worker Scheme. Through
this scheme, NCSS will appoint a group of experienced social workers
to advance social worker practice in the FSCs. These Master Social
Workers can help elevate standards of practice. They can guide their
colleagues, who will, in turn, develop more confidence and skills
to help vulnerable individuals and families get back on their feet.
We intend to start this scheme this year, and about six to seven
Master Social Workers will be recruited this year.</p>

to work more effectively with these families. Let me briefly touch
on this.</p>

FSC training framework. We prioritised child-centric case management
modules. All senior social workers will have to attend these modules.
We held the first run of training in January this year. We will
conduct more runs this year. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cb3297e2-dfa4-4776-b963-6ae07acd99a2">
                  <a name="budget__id-cb3297e2-dfa4-4776-b963-6ae07acd99a2"><!--a--></a>Second, we strengthened
the referral protocols between childcare centres and FSCs for early
referral of young children and families in need of help. Case workers
from FSCs can recommend higher childcare and student care subsidies
for these children, even as they continue to work with their families
to address their needs. </p>

the Health Promotion Board to enhance access to health promotion

With this in place, a typical low-income family can receive comprehensive counselling
support through the FSCs. </p>

come from single-parent households. Dr Janil Puthucheary asked about
the maternity leave benefits for single mothers. The 16 weeks of
Maternity Leave provided under the Child Development Co-savings
Act (CDCA) is given to married working women to encourage parenthood
within the context of marriage. Single parents who are divorced
or widowed are also eligible if the child was born within marriage. </p>

eligible for maternity leave under the CDCA, Sir, an unwed single
mother who works is entitled to 12 weeks of paid Maternity Leave
under the Employment Act, with the first eight weeks of her first
two confinements paid for by the employer. The 12 weeks provides
time for her to breastfeed and spend time and bond with her newborn.</p>

Lee and Ms Sylvia Lim spoke about support for divorced parents and
the impact of divorce on children. I agree, Sir, with them that
children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of a broken
marriage. We must protect the welfare of children during and after
their parents' divorce. </p>

For the majority of cases, Sir, up to 80%, it takes about two weeks
after a Court Order is made for the first supervised access session

And as you know, with family relationship – sometimes when they

one such heartening community initiative, which is an "ABCD" – the
Asset Based Community Development (ABCD) approach − which I know
Mr Laurence Lien is very fond of, and he has cited a number of times
in his speeches, and which is very popular in the US. Actually,
there are many examples of ABCDs in Singapore. If we look at our
social service sector, we have a lot of ABCDs, except I do not think
they put a very sophisticated label, "ABCD", to the initiatives
that they do. "ABCD" is essentially a ground-up ownership of an
initiative to reach out to the needy; the people who need help.</p>

to cite to you is the Community Network (COMNET), which was initiated
by the social service workers from the Ang Mo Kio Family Service
Centre. The social workers observed that despite being served by
multiple service providers, the living conditions of vulnerable
elderly could be better. They got together to develop programmes
to complement existing services, and to surface cases which we had
all missed. Their efforts synergised with ours for a far more integrated
approach in reaching out to the needy.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9ac5998a-8b61-4fc1-9479-131cb4c395a6">
                  <a name="budget__id-9ac5998a-8b61-4fc1-9479-131cb4c395a6"><!--a--></a>For example, COMNET realised
that the Seniors Activity Centres did not cover certain clusters
of rental flats in Ang Mo Kio, and launched their own socio-recreational activities
in "Pasar Malam" style in lieu. When COMNET identified vulnerable
elderly who remained at risk despite basic befriending services,
they developed an in-depth home visit and monitoring system known
as COMNET Befriending Service, for another layer of engagement.</p>

work that they do. The photos on the screen are a testament to the
positive experience they bring to the elderly. </p>

of the many-helping-hands approach which has worked, and coordinated
well. It is also an example of the "ABCD" approach in trying to
reach out to the needy or the elderly. So, we have the CDCs, the
FSCs and the RCs all working together in order to reach out to the
elderly they feel have not been adequately serviced, notwithstanding
the many services that we have in place. </p>

from COMNET for going the extra mile and working hand in hand with
us. I also like the approach taken by the FSCs here because they
were not just sitting in the office, but they were willing to go
into the community, look out for partners – the RCs and grassroots
organisations – and work with them to deliver the services. I hope
that more in the community will come forward to partner us in building an

Office (Mr Heng Chee How)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Chairman, Sir, as we
gear up for the challenges of an ageing population, it is also very
important that we help empower and enable our seniors to lead full
and purposeful lives. </p>

the overwhelming majority of our seniors, in fact, more than 85%
of them, are healthy and well, and eight in 10 of them believe in
being active and to contribute to society. More than 60% who are
aged between 55 and 64 are working. And for one in three households
with young children, the grandparents are the main caregivers to
their grandchildren. Hence, our perception of seniors and our shared
vision with them must be to enable them to live happy, healthy and
active lives, and to age that way, too. In that way, they can indeed
live out that motto mentioned by Mr David Ong yesterday, that is,
not only to add years to life but to add life to years.</p>

a Government can do to facilitate active ageing, in response to
the comments made by Members – Mr Desmond Lee, Mr David Ong, Ms
Denise Phua and Dr Lily Neo. However, let me also say at this juncture
that what the Government can do is one part of it. It is an important
part. It catalyses. But it requires support and active participation
from the ground by our seniors in order that we can create this
momentum, this groundswell, and make this into a movement and, therefore,
affect the entire social landscape and change our society for the
better for our seniors. </p>

is a key initiative introduced in 2008. So far, the Wellness Programme
has benefited about 150,000 seniors aged 50 years and above. We
have also set up the Seniors for Physical Activity (SPA) Committee
in 2008 and that has promoted Brisk Walking, Health <em class="ph i">Qigong</em> and <em class="ph i">Tai

Wellness: empowering older persons to look after their health, to
stay physically active, and to be good neighbours and friends to
one another. We have decided to fold the SPA into the Wellness programme
to reap synergies between the two. We are beginning to see the fruits
of our efforts: (1) 40% of the seniors participating in the programme
made more than 10 new friends and 36% said that they knew more than
10 neighbours after participating in the Wellness programme; (2)
the number of seniors who attended 10 or more community activities
or interest group activities in the past 12 months also increased
from 8% to 34%; and (3) an evaluation of those who take part in
the National Brisk Walking Programme done by the Health Promotion
Board (HPB) found that these more active ones are 8% fitter than
the national average.</p>

Programme potentially powerful is that the way it is done is not
through organising periodic episodic large, staged mass events.
Instead, it is anchored on small, organic interest groups with inherent
strengths, and these meet regularly. First, ground up initiatives
allow for diversity. Second, ties among seniors who meet regularly,
initially over an interest, often blossom into support networks
and friendship, and that makes participation emotionally fulfilling.
This is why interest groups can create that momentum and that groundswell
to turn active ageing into a movement. </p>

walking interest group exemplify what I mean. After a major heart
operation three years ago, he could barely walk. Nevertheless, with
strong determination, he signed up for an exercise programme at
a hospital and his health improved immensely. Yet, he did not stop
there. Not only did he volunteer at the Jurong Central Wellness
Site to influence others to take charge of their health, he became
the group leader of the RC Fun Walker's Club. There, he influenced
many others to become active and sparked a chain reaction that grew
into a dynamic community. </p>

Government and the ground must be interactive, flexible and nimble.
As we see gaps which are best filled by the agencies, we step in
to develop the framework, channels and linkages. One case in point:
we see synergy between the General Practitioner Network launched
by the Health Promotion Board and the Wellness Programme. For example,
a senior who needs to do medical follow-up after health screening
may be referred to participate in physical activities and interest
groups under the Wellness Programme. </p>

menu. For one, we will introduce another form of mass participation.
It is called the Dance-Fit. Seniors who sign up for Dance-Fit can
choose from a comprehensive menu of line, social and folk dances.
They learn a new dance and they can also enhance their dancing skills
and form interest groups that build on the dance steps according
to their interests and abilities. In doing so, we will start a new movement
where more and more seniors can pick up dance to enjoy themselves,
at the same time to bond and keep fit together regularly.</p>

Third Age (C3A) was set up to champion active ageing and promote
positive mindsets about ageing. C3A has touched more than 150,000
seniors and their family members last year. Through its Active Ager
Awards and Active Ageing Festivals, C3A has opened the minds of
older persons, and the young as well, as to what seniors can do,
are doing and are capable of. </p>

and consultations with seniors, C3A wants to support lifelong learning
through interest groups and inter-generational learning. For example, the
Young-at-Heart (YAH!) Community College brings seniors of similar
interests together to engage in peer learning. C3A also piloted
the Inter-generational Learning Programme, which pairs seniors with
students in learning. The programme has helped bridge generational
gaps and shape positive perceptions towards ageing and learning. </p>

a strong sporting culture among seniors. Under the Sports Vision
2030, we are developing a Seniors Fitness Ecosystem. We will identify
sports that are popular among seniors. Seniors can gather with their
family members and friends to learn, train and compete in a range
of sports through "Super Sports Clubs". They will be able to participate
in sports more confidently with the development of sports safety guidelines by the
Health Promotion Board and the Singapore Sports Council. Seniors can
also look forward to better designed facilities in the community,
better suited for seniors. </p>

ageing with purpose where seniors can play meaningful roles in society.
I agree entirely with her. We want to promote volunteerism among seniors,
and are working with the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre
(NVPC). Again, alluding to the "ABCD", an approach that Mr Laurence
Lien spoke so passionately about, it is a good initiative and it
facilitates platforms to be formed so that those with an asset,
a skill, a talent, a network, an expertise, or a resource of some
kind, can offer to leverage on that or make that available to the
community and, together with other like-minded persons, develop
that asset into a cluster of assets and make their community a better
one, a warmer one, and a more caring one, by everybody for everyone. </p>

to share a case study with all of you. Sixty-seven-year-old Mr Quah
Boon Hwee is a resident in my Radin Mas constituency. Confucius once
said that "living to a ripe old age of 70 is rare". Yet, despite
being at a ripe old age, Mr Quah looks younger than me, more energetic
than me. Let me share the secret of his youthfulness.</p>

in traditional Chinese medicine, and strives to emulate the great
herbalist Shen Nong from ancient China, to taste the various herbs.
With his passion for herbal plants, he started a herb garden at
the Bukit Merah Community Club, where he planted all kinds of peculiar-looking
herbs. The management of the community club gracefully allowed him
to set up the herb garden.</p>

it has become like a second home to him. He goes to the herb garden
every day to tend to the plants and keep his small empire spick
and span. Over time, more and more elderly citizens staying nearby
joined his "army". Now, Mr Quah leads his "herbal brigade" of scores
of people who take great pains to look after the herbal plants there.
Members of this brigade are all older than me, but they all live very
enriched lives and, more importantly, they are always happy. Apart
from planting the herbs, they also put up labels to introduce the
names and medicinal effects of the plants, to raise awareness among
people. Besides that, Mr Quah maintains a good relationship with
members of his "herbal brigade", and they take care of each other
and engage in healthy activities together, for example, <em class="ph i">Qigong</em>,
Brisk Walking and even Laughing Yoga. As the saying goes, laughter
makes one younger, so every morning, they will laugh together for
10 minutes. No wonder they seemed to have entered a phase of "rejuvenation".
Apart from planting herbal plants, they also concocted various herbal drinks
and herbal food, for example, healthy herbal mooncakes, delicious
herbal jelly and cakes. The "herbal brigade" also regularly shares
their knowledge about the effects and application of common herbs
with other residents. These herbal drinks and herbal food are quite
delicious. </p>

Sir, I would like to now focus on a topic which is very close to
my heart, that is the support and care for persons with disabilities.
The spirit of this Budget 2012 is to build an inclusive society
– a point that has been emphasised and reiterated by many Members
of this House. This Budget goes to the heart of a society's approach
towards persons with disabilities too. An inclusive society is one
where persons with disabilities are enabled to become equal and
integral members of society and where the vulnerable amongst them
are given support and care. How do we translate this vision into a reality that
truly touches and also impacts the lives of persons with disabilities?</p>

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Sir,
we started on this journey five years ago by bringing together the
people, private and public sectors. So working in concert, we developed
a better understanding of the needs and hopes of persons with disabilities
and joined forces to muster our resources and solutions to improve

we have made encouraging progress. With increased funding from the
Government and also the Community Chest, early intervention services
have become more affordable. Every Singaporean child undergoing
early intervention receives a monthly base subsidy of $300. Low-income
families get additional subsidies of up to $600 per month. Hence,
in total, low-income families can receive up to $900 of subsidies
per month if their children are enrolled in early intervention centres.
We have also expanded the capacity of early intervention centres
from 1,350 places in 2006 to about 2,000 in 2011.</p>

of Education (MOE) significantly increased funding for Special Education
(SPED) schools to put in place a vocational education framework.
The quality as well as outcome of SPED has improved. In the past,
only a handful of SPED graduates could find a job in the open market.
But in 2010, about 20% in each cohort secured jobs in open employment.
And another 30% proceeded to sheltered employment. The remaining
40% were in adult care. </p>

including VWOs and employers, have also worked together to enhance
vocational assessment, training, job placement and support for persons
with disabilities. Two Centres for Training and Integration, in
hospitality and call centres services, were set up. We also introduced
the Open Door Fund to encourage employers to employ persons with
disabilities by funding workplace modification, job re-design and
apprenticeship training. The Open Door Fund provides funds up to
$100,000 per company and up to $5,000 per individual employed. Since
2007, more than 500 persons with disabilities have benefited through
the Open Door Fund. They have either found employment or are undergoing
apprenticeship training. </p>

also made headway in addressing the legal and financial security
concerns of ageing parents on the care of their adult children when they
are no longer around. The protection framework today comprises the
Mental Capacity Act, Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC) and the
Special Needs Savings Scheme (SNSS). Together, these three measures
safeguard the interests of those lacking mental capacity or with
disabilities, while offering parents various options to save up
for the long-term care needs of their children. The SNTC and SNSS
complement each another.</p>

made to make both our built environment and also transportation
system barrier-free accessible. For example, in 2011, the Town Councils completed
upgrading all HDB precincts with accessible facilities and features.
The MOT and LTA are also working towards making all public buses
wheelchair-accessible by 2020 and have retrofitted MRT stations
and taxi stands with tactile guidance and other barrier-free features.
We should be encouraged by the progress that we have made in the
last five years. But, yet, Sir, we know that our journey has only
just started, and persons
with disabilities and their families still face many challenges
today. There is still much more for us to do, and we will really
want to do them in the next five years. </p>

Ms Denise Phua and Mr Ang Wei Neng, were among the members of this

the Committee's recommendations for the new Enabling Masterplan.
Collectively, the Committee's recommendations represent the aspirations of
persons with disabilities and the stakeholders in the sector – which
is an inclusive society where persons with disabilities are enabled
to live with dignity, maximise their potential and also become equal
and integral part of our society. Sir, the Ministry has considered
all the recommendations. I am pleased to inform the House that the Government
agrees with the principles and the spirit underpinning the ideas
in this Report. In fact, we have already begun to implement some

will play a more supportive role. We will also put in more resources
and so I am happy to announce that over the next five years, we
expect to spend about $1 billion on programmes and services to help
persons with disabilities. This is really a very big amount of fund
committed by the Government, that is, $1 billion. This is 20% more
than what we had spent over the last five years. In drawing the Masterplan,
the Committee has taken a life course approach to ensure that persons
with disabilities will receive the care and the attention needed
at each life stage.</p>

MCYS will reach out to this group through the EIPIC Development

for Infants and Children. So, we will through DSP reach out to children
with learning difficulties, speech and language delays, and behavioural
problems. These children will benefit from learning support intervention
by a group of trained Learning Support Educators and, if necessary,
therapy intervention. </p>

Part of our investment will be in the manpower. Schemes are in place

drives conducted by NCSS, a new "Place-and-Train" scheme was also
introduced to allow centres to hire EIPIC teachers and therapists
ahead of anticipated increase in enrolment. So far, 37 have been
trained on this scheme. So, I am happy to inform Ms Low and also
Members of the House that the "Place-and-Training" scheme has also
been extended to the Development Support Programme. We have also
commissioned the Association for Early Childhood Educators (Singapore)

the past week's Budget debate, we heard Ms Denise Phua and Ms Jessica
Tan's suggestion for persons with disabilities who have not attended

Credit. Allow me a brief moment to explain our thinking on this.
The SPED school criterion was meant to target the group of persons
with disabilities who are more likely to encounter difficulties finding
employment and earning a reasonable wage. So we need to help them.
We want to help. Nonetheless, we appreciate that there may be other
individuals who have not attended SPED schools. I would like to
assure Ms Phua and Ms Tan that equally deserving applicants who
face difficulties can come into the scheme, even if they have not
attended SPED schools. So we intend to use the existing SNSS Committee
to evaluate such exception cases so that they would not be falling
through the schemes.</p>

medical technology and better access to healthcare, Singaporeans
are living longer. This includes persons with disabilities too.
We need to respond to this demographic change. Mr Vikram Nair rightly
pointed out the predicament of ageing parents and caregivers. There
will come a time when parents are no longer able to look after their
disabled child, even if they want to. Many of them will not outlive
their children. Hence, their deeply felt concern of "what happens
when I'm no longer around to care for them". </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-edc870b3-54ed-47ef-b802-3ccde880caa2">

we need to reassure parents that their children will be cared for

even more affordable and accessible services for adults with disabilities.
They will receive appropriate care that is delivered efficiently. </p>

with the thrusts of the Enabling Masterplan recommendations on adult
care. More importantly, we agree to adopt an "enabling care" philosophy.
We not only want to care; we also want to enable persons with disabilities
in knowing how we care for them. We will develop more care options
in the community so that persons with disabilities can access the
appropriate form of care for their needs. In particular, we will
be introducing more Group Homes, where those who can, will be supported
as independent as possible. We will build more community-based and
residential facilities as well. </p>

adult care services can be a substantial portion of the family's expenses.
We recognise it. To enhance affordability, we will raise the means-tested subsidies
for all MCYS-funded community-based services as well as residential
services. A lower income family can receive up to 80% of the norm
cost of a service. This could be up to $1,400 per month for a residential
care home or up to $765 per month for community-based day care and,
in addition, the GST for these services would also be absorbed.
These changes will come into effect in the third quarter of this
year.</p>

measures will significantly help to reduce costs of services. To
illustrate, let me just take the case of Ravi. For the past three
years, Ravi has been attending the Day Activity Centre at Moral
Home for Disabled Adults. He enjoys meeting his friends at the centre
and he looks forward to daily morning exercises. His parents were
impressed by the progress Ravi has made since attending the centre.
He was shy initially but now, he has improved in his cognitive and
physical functions and also gained community living skills. Ravi
does not receive Government means-tested subsidies currently as
his family's per capita income exceeds the current limit. He pays about
$810 a month. But with the revised subsidies and the GST absorption
starting from the third quarter of this year, Ravi will only need
to pay $470. This is about a 40% reduction in fees. </p>

home-based care to enable families to care for their loved ones
in the comfort of their own homes. Today, there is an existing Foreign
Domestic Worker Levy Concession of $95 per month for persons with
disabilities. However, we understand the added stress and strain
of looking after those who are more severely disabled. Mr Gan Thiam
Poh and Mr David Ong have asked the Government to further offset the levy concession.
The Ministry of Health had earlier announced the introduction of
the additional $120 Foreign Domestic Worker Grant for seniors with problems
handling three or more activities of daily living (ADLs). These

their age. We will also adopt the same 3-ADL criteria. However,
we also recognise that while some may be physically able to perform
the ADLs, they could lack mental capacity or have very challenging
behaviour. They need to be supervised closely. We will thus extend
the grant to those with more severe intellectual disabilities, autism
and sensory impairments. The Centre for Enabled Living will open
up applications for the additional FDW grant in the third quarter
of 2012 and we will release the details later. Together with the
FDW levy concession and the grant, eligible families need only pay

also other areas that we can help, that we can play a part to allay
caregivers' fears and concerns. This has to do with the long-term
care planning for parents with disabilities. I believe Ms Denise

just cite one example. </p>

has that peace of mind is Jo Ann. Jo Ann has a 9-year-old daughter
with multiple disabilities. It is rather unfortunate. But before
signing on to the Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC), Jo Ann was
searching for a saving scheme that allows her to prepare for her
daughter's financial and caregiving needs in the future. Private
trusts were far way too expensive and too costly for her. SNTC was
thus a practical and affordable solution. Working closely with the
SNTC case manager, Jo Ann developed
a care plan for her daughter and projected the amount needed to
set aside to provide for her daughter in future years. Jo Ann is
now happy in knowing that SNTC will help her administer her savings,
according to her wishes, when she is no longer around.</p>

of going to school or finding employment may seem daunting, if not
for the assistive technology devices. Such devices can be helpful
in enabling persons with disabilities to have greater independence
and also access to education and employment opportunities. However,
the devices can be costly and difficult to maintain. Currently,
the Assistive Technology Fund (ATF) provides up to $10,000 per individual
to purchase assistive technology devices. Our students with disabilities
in mainstream schools and those in open employment have been benefiting from
it. </p>

whether this amount can be further increased. I am happy to share
with him the joy that his wish has been fulfilled. The Ministry

Since then, many have benefited from it, including Jin Zhu. Sir,
I would like to cite Jin Zhu's case as an example to illustrate
how the ATF has made a difference to people who are born with a
special disability. Jin Zhu has been suffering from muscular dystrophy
from young. This causes her muscles to weaken over time and has
greatly affected her mobility. Owing to her condition, Jin Zhu often
finds it hard to manually copy notes and write her school assignments.
Yet, this has not deterred the young and eager student from Sembawang
Secondary School. Through the ATF, Jin Zhu has acquired both a wheelchair
to help her get around and a laptop to take notes in class and do
research for her projects and studies. With the right help, Jin
Zhu is now more independent than before. However, the total cost
of her equipment is a hefty sum, almost exceeding the existing maximum
quantum of $10,000. With the enhancement of the ATF subsidies, this
will help people like her better cope with the difficulties going forward.</p>

on another aspect, that is, transportation. Transportation is another
important enabler for persons with disabilities. It gives them the
opportunity and the confidence to be independent. We have made much
progress over the past few years in terms of barrier-free public
transport. LTA will continue to enhance the accessibility of our
public transport system. We will also improve access to specialised transport
for those who are unable to take public transport.</p>

Cabs will run until March 2013. MCYS, together with MOT and LTA,
is currently developing a longer term solution. We are taking a
two-pronged approach,
involving both the people and private sectors. First, we will work
with suitable VWOs to develop dedicated transport providers for
those who need to access services regularly and on an <em class="ph i">ad hoc</em> basis.
Over time, we will also be providing targeted transport subsidies
to help cushion the costs for those in the lower income group accessing
our VWO services. Second, we will invite taxi operators to propose
and operate a service that can accommodate different types of wheelchairs.
More details will be announced later. We strive to work towards
getting these vehicles on the road before the licences of London
Cabs expire.</p>

on the second part of my answer and I will come to Mr Ang Hin Kee's
question. First, Mr Chairman, when we began the debate on MCYS' budget,
we noted that it is challenging but it is important to build an
inclusive society of Hope, Heart and Home. Within the Government,
this is something that cuts across different areas. Beyond the Government,
we need a whole-of-society response. Overall, we need the positive
involvement of all Singaporeans and active partnerships among the
public, private and people sectors. </p>

pointed out that developing a sporting culture requires much more
than increasing sporting facilities. Seven months ago, I convened
the Vision 2030 Committee to chart our future direction for sports
development in Singapore. The private, people and public sector
members, in turn, consulted some 2,500 people from all walks of
life. Many Singaporeans – including youths, parents, seniors, working
adults and students – spoke passionately and gave their ideas. We
started this process by asking ourselves that beyond seeing sports
as the end, what could sports do for the individual, the community
and our nation. We asked people and we consulted them – not just
people from the traditional sporting fraternity, but we also wanted
to reach out to people who are not, perhaps, as active in the sports
fraternity. </p>

to engage the corporate sector to deepen their involvement in sports
through innovative ways. Sports can be leveraged upon as a company's
branding and marketing efforts. Or it could be part of a company's
corporate social responsibility – giving back to society through
sports. It could also deploy its younger members for leadership
and team development with the National Sports Associations (NSAs).
Corporates can take up representation at national and community platforms.
They can bring their expertise to the table while developing their
employees.</p>

like to respond to Mr Nicholas Fang's suggestion that, indeed, we
fully agree with them that we have to professionalise our NSAs.
In order to involve more people into sports, I think we will have
to look at new ways to bring in new expertise into the National
Sports Associations, beyond the traditional pool of ex-athletes.
We can get the corporate people inside; we can get the community
partners inside. It is only when everybody gets involved in helping
out the National Sports Associations, then we would have strong
National Sports Associations. Only with strong National Sports Associations,
would we have the strong supporting structures and organisations
to give our athletes – be they recreational athletes or competitive
athletes – the best chance to perform on the world's stage or in
the community. </p>

to our athletes. Indeed, over the last seven days, I have met up
with 40 National Sports Associations' Presidents and Chairmen to
share with them some of the good practices that we would like to
encourage all our NSAs to do. At the same time, we also want to encourage our
better, bigger NSAs to play a leading role to guide the smaller
and less developed NSAs. Only together in this process that goes beyond
trying to just win medals, we also help to build an inclusive society
to help each other out and allow more people to join sports for
its sake and to enjoy it in the process. </p>

we can fine-tune them. It is a long-term vision, and we did not

educated and better travelled. With advances in technology, they
can quickly access information online and form networks with people who
share similar views and interests. There are also many competing
demands on their time and attention. To effectively engage our youth,
we will have to evolve our approach to keep pace with these trends.
We will need to adapt to the changing youth environment and embrace
new technologies to our advantage. This is a work in progress for
the NYC. It aims to be an enabler, to build a strong and vibrant
ecosystem of our youth sector organisations. </p>

Youth Council will strengthen its role as a connector and an enabler.
Through partnerships with people, public and private youth sector organisations
(YSOs), the NYC will work together to build a dynamic community
of youth interest groups. In the process, it will also identify
and nurture a committed core of youth leaders. We look to this group
of youth leaders to reach out to their peers to increase the social
capital of Singaporean youth and to foster an active and caring
youth. We would like to encourage many more ground-up initiatives
amongst the youth to come forward. NYC will partner you, hand-hold,

engagement efforts to facilitate greater youth advocacy, to allow
young people's voices to be heard. Schooling youth will have more
opportunities to learn about the policy making process, and to contribute
on issues concerning them. We
will grow a community of youth representatives in their 20s and
30s from the people and private sectors. They will represent youth
on national and community issues, and champion youth causes. We
will enable them to develop a well-rounded understanding of national
imperatives and policies, as well as community issues and needs.

and I have outlined the Ministry's plans to contribute towards building
an inclusive society of Hope, Heart and Home for Singapore. Not
alone. Not just amongst Government agencies. But through active
3P partnerships which were the originators of these plans, and which
will now serve as the basis for their implementation. And with the
involvement of all Singaporeans. </p>

about Government putting in more resources. Neither is it just a
matter of new programmes. As several Members have reminded us, inclusiveness is
more of a mindset and a value system. It is also about the wider
community and its attitude towards the less able and those in need,
or simply those who are different. </p>

this point. The Enabling Masterplan which the Senior Parliamentary
Secretary has just spoken about will not work if employers do not
give persons with disability a chance. The plans which my Minister
of State had shared on community and home-based eldercare will not
get past the starting line if all Singaporeans say "good idea, but
not in my backyard". </p>

with Mr Laurence Lien on the important role played by civil society

and innovative solutions, in taking ownership over issues which
their communities face. </p>

of VWOs and everyday Singaporeans to make Singapore more inclusive.
We are confident that they can – and will – do more, working hand-in-hand
with Government as partners and co-creators. I draw this conclusion
from the many caring social service professionals and volunteers
whom I have had the privilege to meet over the last 10 months when
I joined MCYS. From the organisations – in both the private and
people sectors – that have visited, I have seen tremendous energy
and passion. And from the ordinary Singaporeans who spoke up for
our elderly during the recent public discussions on locating eldercare
centres at HDB void decks. There is hope for us because I feel and
I sense our community is increasingly more sensitive to the needs
of the people around us, and they are willing to stand forward and
put in their efforts to make a difference.</p>

as Mr Lien would be familiar, our volunteerism rates have increased
over the years, surpassing the 20% mark for the first time in 2010.
Tax deductible donations have almost tripled in the past decade
from $325 million in 2000 to almost $900 million in 2011. Having
said that, we are never complacent, and we hope we will do more
and do better for those in need. And to encourage people to come
forward to join in our efforts to build the inclusive society that
we all want. We should build on this, and my Ministry will continue
to develop the giving and volunteerism landscape. The Ministry intends
to engage the people and private sectors for more ideas to grow
a stronger giving culture.</p>

raising the tax benefits for donations from 250% to 300%. What we
provide today is quite generous by international standards. In some areas,
the Government also provides matching of donations on top of the
tax benefits, to encourage giving to targeted causes. MCYS and MOF
will continue to work together to see how else we can encourage
greater charitable giving in Singapore.</p>

alone, I also share Mr Lien's view that every person has something
to contribute to the community. Persons we seek to help also have
strengths we can encourage, nurture and leverage. Asset-based community
development is a good idea. I hope to see it being deployed in more
of our programmes.</p>

of the Lions' Befriender Programme. They wanted to befriend the
many elderly amongst us. They knew that the number of elderly will
grow; the number of young will shrink. They thought for a long time:
how can they overcome this problem? Eventually, they came up with
a very simple solution, on hindsight. It is not just the young that
can befriend the elderly; the elderly, they themselves, can befriend
many elderly, giving these elderly a new sense of purpose, a new
sense of mission. And that is perhaps what is called "ageing with
a purpose". The elderly and the needy need not always be people
whom we just give help to. They, too, can provide us help. They,
too, can show us a few things once in a while. </p>

recapping my Ministry's plans. First, we will support the effort
to strengthen the Hope of Singaporeans and their children. Hope
to share in the fruits of an inclusive society and to do better,
and to be able to get back on their feet with some help during periods
of difficulty, such as an economic downturn. The Ministry will strengthen
our social safety net. This means extending support to more Singaporeans who
need a boost to keep Hope in sight. It also means better outreach
and more effective delivery of help.</p>

our work in a way that preserves the community activism and self-help
that exemplifies the Heart of an Inclusive Society. The VWOs will
remain central to our social service sector. We will work with them
to build capability for the future. In delivering help to the needy
and vulnerable, we will not just address their material needs, but
also nurture their hearts – to strive to do better for themselves
and their families. Our ultimate goal is to see those who have received
help giving back, coming back to contribute, with an appreciative
and compassionate heart, to help others just as they have been helped. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-241cae4f-30ee-423e-8fec-9afff557e16d"><!--a--></a>Finally, Sir, we seek
to strengthen our social compact on the basis of a strong sense of
responsibility to our families, our community and our country. And
continue to work towards
the vision of an inclusive society. Whether we are rich or poor,
young or old, able-bodied or disabled, we will feel a deep sense
of belonging to this place we call Home. Ultimately, Sir, schemes,
policies do not make for an inclusive society. We do.</p>

Mr Ang Hin Kee's question on what if and how do we prevent abuses
to the system that we have since liberalised to allow us to reach
out to touch more people. Indeed, Sir, in all our schemes and all
that we do, there will always be two types of issues that may concern
us, what I sometimes call the false positive and sometimes call
the false negative. False positives are sometimes cases where people may
try to abuse the system, find ways to go round the system. But I
believe this is a small problem that we can manage and the way we
manage this will depend very much on the people working on the ground,
making the ground assessments. I always tell my Meet-the-People
Sessions (MPS) helpers that they are the first line of defence,
that when someone comes to them, they are like the <em class="ph i">sinseh</em> feeling
the pulse of the person. They have to, based on the evidences available,
make the best judgement and make a call to recommend to me whether
that person really is deserving of help. Once in a while, there will
be a false positive where someone for various reasons tries to beat
the system. We will try to manage that. I am concerned about that,
but yet on the other hand, I am concerned more about what I call
the false negative. The false negative represents the people who
really need help, but for some reasons are unable to, or do not
know where to go and get help.</p>

sessions – and I do it twice a week – we will always go round to
look out for these people. Who are these people that are staying
in the 1-room flat, 2-room flats and 3-room flats? Many of them
do not even know how to apply for a bursary for their children in
school. We want to reach out to these people. The elderly staying
in the 1-room flat that does not speak English, does not speak Mandarin
will not have a chance to read the newspaper, listen to the radio
or watch the TV programmes and do not know all the wonderful schemes
that we may have to help them. These are the people that we need
to reach out to. We cannot do this alone just based on policies. We
need to work with our community partners, the grassroots organisations,
the grassroots leaders who go forth, to each and everyone, knock
on the door to see who are the people that really, really need help.
And for us to translate that help to them, be it in dialect, in
whatever language that we need to reach out to them. It is not an
easy effort. It is something that we have to do labouriously.</p>

to meet up with all the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCC)
Chairmen on a regular basis, to share with them how we want to reach
out to the community using their resources, using their network.
They are enthusiastic. We hope to do more, but I know for a fact
that there are many, many more people that may really not know where
the help may be. And we certainly want to partner all the Voluntary Welfare
Organisations (VWOs), the grassroots organisations, to do more.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1f17d42b-7a0a-40d1-a9e7-a1017c2692ea">
                  <a name="budget__id-1f17d42b-7a0a-40d1-a9e7-a1017c2692ea"><!--a--></a>Sir, nothing pains me
more in my last 10 months as the Minister for MCYS than when a newspaper
article comes out and says that so and so, a person, died in the
house because nobody knew that he or she has passed away – and they
only found out when the smell of a rotting body filtered through
the windows and the doors, and the neighbours reported it. I think
we can do more, I think we can do better because this will never
happen in a <em class="ph i">kampong</em>. This will never happen when we know
our neighbours well, check on them to see whether they are in need
of help or not. It is our onus as a society, as one that we say
wants to be inclusive, for us to go forth and reach out to everyone. So,
yes, there will be cases where some people might circumvent the
rules, the "false positive"
– but there will be many more cases that we must have a compassionate
heart for – the "false negative", who really need help but may not
be reached out at this point in time. I would urge all Members to
work with the Ministry, to work with the FSCs, to work with the
VWOs for us together to reach out to these people who are our fellow Singaporeans,
and only in that way will we build an inclusive and compassionate society.
Like I said, schemes and policies do not make for an inclusive society,
our people do.</p>

MCYS has announced several initiatives on community-based healthcare
options for the elderly. How can we be assured that such services
are offered in an affordable manner for the seniors and their families,
including the middle income?</p>

Sir, in the area of sports, financial support and resources are
very tight. What can the Ministry do to promote a strong culture
of sports philanthropy in Singapore? I believe this is essential

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
as we expand the community-based eldercare options and services,
we are mindful that one key issue will be the affordability and
accessibility to the elderly and their families. This is why we
have introduced the subsidies and enhancements which I had mentioned
earlier. With these changes, more Singaporeans will benefit because
the qualifying per capita monthly income will rise from $1,400 to $2,200.
Elderly persons from larger households will also benefit from a
new per capita household income criteria. Those who qualify will
also receive more. Subsidies will be raised by as much as 80%, with
the middle income groups seeing the highest increase. In addition,
the Government will absorb the GST applied on eldercare services
for all subsidised clients. Allow me just to illustrate with an
example. Mr Abdul Kadir attends the NTUC eldercare programme at
Silver Circle (Punggol South). He is currently staying with his
daughter Mdm Safiah in a 3-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. Under the current
subsidy framework, he receives $195 of means tested subsidy a month.
Under the enhanced subsidy framework, he will now receive $450 per
month. We will continue to be mindful of the affordability and look
into issues such as the efficiency and productivity.</p>

about sports philanthropy. Indeed, Sir, I am very mindful that as
we go forth into the next decade, many of our social needs will
be competing for the finite budget that we have in this country.
For us to do more for sports, we will need to go beyond just Government
funding. We will have to look at new and innovative ways to get
more corporates, private organisations and the people sector to
be involved in sports. Other countries have a very mature sports
philanthropy ecosystem, and they have also very innovative ways
to attract corporate sponsorship for sports.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-f06db35e-bcfc-4262-84f6-c7abc76716d4"><!--a--></a>Traditionally, our sports
scene has tended to try to attract people into sports giving by
using part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) budget
but we think that sports can go beyond CSR. Sports need not just
be a charity that we give to with excess money that we have. Sports
can be a way to help brand a company. Some of these more established
companies that have done this very successfully are, for example,
Standard Chartered and OCBC. The StanChart Marathon now into the
10th year is extremely successful. They grew from 6,000 in the first
year to 60,000. Today, on the off-day when you see someone wearing
a blue T-shirt running around, chances are that it reminds you that this person is
a StanChart Marathon participant in one of their categories. Today,
if you are cycling around town, the first thing that comes to mind
is OCBC. This company has very successfully used sports to brand
themselves. </p>

think we can. Other countries have even more innovative ideas whereby
they partner with the corporates to name sports facilities, to do merchandising,
to promote, to use sports personalities as spokespersons for their product.
There are many, many of these ideas that we can look into and that
we can explore. So there are many ideas that we want to do. But
at the end of the day, as I was sharing with the National Sports
Associations over the last week, in order for sports community to
attract corporate funding into the sports scene, we must make sure
that our sports associations are run in tip-top condition. Only
then will you give people confidence that we can make good use of
the funds available and that it would be a long lasting partnership.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ad6f9797-6b06-4b4b-971a-d723f235cab2"><!--a--></a> We want to break out
of this catch-22 situation today whereby the corporates are hesitant
to give long-term funding for the sports group because they do not
have a long-term plan. Yet without long-term funding, they are unable
to develop a sports plan. What SSC is going to do is to handhold
some of the smaller NSAs – the bigger ones are okay – to develop
their long-term plan, to help them organise themselves better, so
that they can inspire confidence amongst corporate Singapore to
come in and partner sporting Singapore for a win-win situation.
So, certainly, we would like to do more and I hope every Member
in the House will also join us in this endeavour for us to do more.</p>

                  </span>: Thank
you, Mr Chairman. I am glad the Acting Minister emphasised inclusiveness
as MCYS' theme. I have two questions relating to his reply on my
cut. He mentioned that there are 240 centres that are KiFAS-approved.
I like to know whether there are any non-PCF centres included in
the list. The second question is that he said that KiFAS is targeted
at lower income families. It is a child and family specific scheme
and not centre-specific. I understand, so is CFAC which is for childcare
and we have KiFAS which is for kindergarten. But I understand CFAC
is inclusive; all operators included, including private centres
are eligible. But KiFAS is exclusive; so far only to one organisation.
I am sorry I do not understand the Acting Minister's explanation
and I do not understand the reasons behind KiFAS' very onerous criteria.</p>

Sir, in response to Mr Yee Jenn Jong's clarification, let me just
say that the current criteria for all the centres – there is a set
of criteria, we do not specify which operator can or cannot come
in. So long as an operator meets the criteria, we will allow them
to go onto the scheme. So I do not preclude anybody else from coming
onto the scheme so long as they meet the criteria, and I trust that
the criteria are put in place to safeguard the balance of considerations
for the use of public funds in all subsidies. At the same time,
to make sure that there is a certain quality of education available
for the children. So I do not, for one, prescribe that there will
only be one. So long as anybody meets the criteria, we welcome them
to join the sector and provide affordable and quality services to
the children that they want to serve.</p>

I thank Dr Intan for the question. Basically, we intend to do a
few things. For the CDC officers, in order to enhance the social

programme for them so that they can enhance their capabilities and
skills in a very structured manner. </p>

do is also to have a scheme where the more senior social assistance
officers also mentor and coach them so that there is a transferral
of skills and capabilities, not just in structured form or programme,
but also on the job. But what we intend to do is that we intend
to expand, strengthen existing platforms of co-operation between
CDCs, FSCs as well as other groups particularly in handling very
complex cases, where there could be case conferences in order that
the case would be better managed, not necessarily individual cases
but in a more case management approach. Those are the measures we
intend to roll out in order to ensure that we enhance the capabilities
of our social assistance officers employed by CDCs and also in order
to ensure a better, more effective case management system.</p>

I applaud the efforts towards simplifying the various publicity materials
and also improving access. As he pointed out earlier, many of the
people that we are trying to reach out to, the people who need help
are people may be dialect speaking or speaking in languages other
than English. Sir, I hope that as he resources this ComCare hotline,

first, let me thank Mr Seah Kian Peng for the clarifications. Yes,
indeed we share with the Member the concern for not just the problem
gamblers but, as the Member has rightly put it, when a person gets
into problem gambling, it is not only his life that may be affected
but at the same time, his family and the many people around him.
Where we can, we will want to take preventive measures to help the
person before he gets into that situation. </p>

we are exploring various models and best practices from other countries,
including the casinos in Holland, Australia – Crown Casino, and
so forth. I must say that in whatever we do, I would need the support
of this House and the public, because there is huge debate as to
whether we should extend third party exclusion based on the degree
of financial vulnerability of the person involved. On one side,
we have people who support us and say that "Yes! These are necessary
and preventive steps to do." On the other side, we have people who
have also given feedback to us and asked if we are overly draconian
in the way we apply this. So we want to make sure that whatever
we do, we have the public's support.</p>

public's support for this – and we will be consulting the public
on various of these measures – is what I mentioned yesterday in
response to Er Lee Bee Wah's questions. We need ownership. We can
do all these third party exclusions and so on, but if the individual
does not have the sense of ownership, then that individual will
find all sorts of ways to bypass the orders. Even if he or she cannot get
into the casino, he or she will find some other ways to gamble.
In this whole process, if they do not go into the casino but if
they end up gambling in some other forms which may be even more
addictive, that will create another set of problems that we have
to manage.</p>

we indeed want to come out with the ideas and the circuit breakers
as soon as possible. Within my means, I think we can start with
some of the schemes under ComCare. If you are already financial
vulnerable, we will strongly advise you to take up the self-exclusion

second point and indeed, that has already been done for the ComCare
helplines, that they must not only have people that can speak in

of these people are elderly people. When they come and seek help,

to the CDC, the MPS or the FSCs to seek help. If you think they
need help, we want them to come and talk to the social assistance
staff, talk to the social workers. And we will make a holistic assessment.
Help need not just be financial. Help may also be counselling. Help
may also be a bit of handholding. Help may also be a bit of role
modelling. And beyond the professional social worker, this is where
I want to make an appeal to people who have succeeded in life to
come forth and lend a helping hand. Because more than the money that
is given to help the individual, I think very often, we need individuals
that can come forth, spend time with the individual or the family,
to handhold that person and guide them through the process.</p>

If the top 1% of all Singaporeans in terms of financial achievement
and what not, come forth and handhold the last 1%, I think we would
have gone a great way for being a more inclusive society. Finally,
yes, we hear the Member about Braddell Heights being a good location
for one of the 40 integrated daycare facilities. I am quite sure
I will have 39 more bids once I go out to take my lunch later and we
will consider your requests seriously. I need 87. We will get there.</p>

Sir, I thank the Minister for the $1 billion budget for the disability
sector over the next five years. I want to ask if the Minister would
consider incorporating key disability group representatives into
the high-level inter agency Standing Committee that is tasked to
follow up, track and report on the implementations that are accepted
in the Disability Master Plan. The Plan lasts for five years. Many
things can happen and it is quite important that the Standing Committee
does not just include top level civil servants or Government related
groups. Second clarification is beyond –</p>

Beyond per capita income criteria, would the Minister consider tiered
funding? I am speaking on behalf of those who are more severely disabled
– tiered funding for day activity centres (DACs) that serve the
more severely disabled. The costs of these can go up to $2,000 per
month. I think the funding criteria have to go beyond just the per
capita income criteria currently implemented.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
the answer to the first question is "Yes, definitely!" because even
the development of the current Enabling Masterplan is not just a
group of able-bodied people, high level servants, but it involves
people from all walks of life. We certainly want to hear the ideas
and involve those in the disabled group, and other people that they
are trying to help, to get them involved in the implementation.</p>

the way we approach this is that we do have certain guidelines,
but these guidelines are guidelines. When there are deserving cases
that do not fit into any of our definitions, and if the person is
deserving of help, let us all together find a means to help these
people. This is not a bureaucratic process. We are not dealing with
bureaucracy. We are dealing with real people with real needs. So
long as the person has a need, we will assess it holistically. My
promise to everyone in the House is that, even if the cases do not
fit the guidelines, we will find some ways and means to help the persons
involved, and that must be the approach that we take for everything
that we do in this sector.</p>

consumer protection laws that provide remedies against goods with
latent defects, also known as "lemons". These lemons usually fail
to meet standards of quality and performance, even after repeated
repairs, and such laws can be found in advanced countries such as
the UK and EU, and typically obligate the retailers to repair, replace,
or refund the price of defective goods. </p>

of clarity on a consumer's period for exercising his rights. Currently,
the consumer can reject defective goods and seek a refund, but he
would lose his right to reject the goods if he does not do so within
"a reasonable time". The law does not state explicitly what is considered
"a reasonable time", and this is subject to determination by the
courts. The law is also not clear on who has the burden of proof. </p>

provide a limited range of recourse. Consumers are only entitled
to reject goods that are not of satisfactory quality and obtain
a refund. Thus, the Taskforce
recommended making express provisions for repair and replacement
to allow consumers, retailers and the courts additional options
to resolve defects that occur. CASE highlighted that such provisions
would address the key problem of some retailers refusing to replace
defective goods after multiple failed attempts to repair. Retailers
also gave feedback that the inclusion of the options of repair and
replacement would allow them more flexibility. Therefore, the proposed
amendments seek to clarify timelines and burden of proof, and to
expand and make more explicit the remedies available to both consumers
and businesses. </p>

the main amendments. The new legislation will provide clearer rules
on the burden of proof. If a consumer reports that the goods he
purchased did not conform to the sale contract within six months
of delivery, it is presumed that the non-conformity existed at the
time of delivery, unless the retailer can prove otherwise. Non-conformity
with contract is already defined under existing laws, such as the
Sale of Goods Act, and includes situations where goods are not of
satisfactory quality, or fit for the purpose it is purchased for. </p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-613f76e9-945b-4d5b-bf63-d0fac18933e6">

not apply if it is incompatible with the nature of the goods. For example,
perishable goods would not be expected to last longer than their
normal shelf life. And if the non-conformity is found after six
months of delivery, it is for the consumer to prove that the non-conformity
existed at the time of delivery. The same provision can also be
found in EU and UK's lemon laws.</p>

the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act provides that for goods
that do not conform to the sale contract at the time of delivery,
the consumer may require the retailer to repair or replace the goods.
If the cost of the remedy demanded by the consumer is disproportionate
in comparison, the retailer may offer one of the alternative remedies
provided for in the legislation. </p>

replacement remedies are not possible, or disproportionately costly
to the retailer, or cannot be completed within a reasonable time
and without significant inconvenience to the consumer, the consumer
may ask for a reduction in price or return the product for a refund.
As per existing laws, the refunded amount may be reduced to take
into account the use that the consumer had of the goods.</p>

the Lemon Law will apply to all goods, which can range from general
consumer products such as electronics and clothing to big-ticket
items such as motorcycles and cars. Consumables and perishables
are also covered. However, the "rebuttable presumption" that defects
discovered within six months of delivery existed at the point of delivery
will only apply up to the normal shelf life of the consumable or perishable. </p>

are included in the proposed legislation as protection is likely
to be most needed for such goods. This is also in line with Lemon Laws
in overseas jurisdictions. However, the definition of "satisfactory
quality" would take into account the goods' age at the time of delivery
and the price paid. In other words, someone buying a 10-year-old
car from a dealer could not reasonably expect it to be like a brand
new car. However, he can expect it to perform in a manner that may be
reasonably expected of a car of that mileage and model. If it does
not do so, the consumer can seek remedies from the dealer.</p>

as the remedies under the Lemon Law regime are tailored for goods,
and are generally inappropriate for services. For example, it is
impossible to return the service which has already been rendered. </p>

have asked if discounted products or sale items, with slight defects
or limitations, can be excluded from the proposed law. Such goods
are not specifically excluded, but any defects or limitations of
these goods should be pointed out to the consumer before the transaction,
and the retailer would not be held liable for these defects or limitations.
When it is pointed out, it has to be very specific and to the point
of the defect.</p>

if goods can be excluded if they are sold "as is" or "as seen". Even
under the existing law, the retailer cannot deny the consumer his
rights to remedies by stipulating that the sale is "as is" or "as
seen", except in the case of auctions or a competitive tender. As
such, retailers cannot exclude the transaction from the Lemon Law,
by simply displaying a notice saying, "we do not give refunds under
any circumstances" or that "an item has been sold as it is". Therefore,
retailers should be transparent at the point of sale, through appropriate
labelling and disclaimers. For clarity, the retailer should document
any defects and limitations on the sales contract, invoice or packaging. </p>

have also asked if properties and building defects are covered under
the proposed law. There is already existing legislation governing
the sale and purchase of new or uncompleted properties. Under the
Housing Developers (Control &amp; Licensing) Act and the Sale of
Commercial Properties Act, the standard Sale and Purchase Agreement
provides for a one-year defects liability period during which the developer
is required to rectify any defects in the property, at the developer's
own cost. Beyond the one-year defects liability period, purchasers
can still take civil action against the developer for latent defects
on grounds of negligence or breach of contract, within six years
from the date that the damage arose, or three years from the date
that the damage was discovered, and whichever is later. This covers
HDB flats as well. In addition, HDB gives flat buyers an extended
warranty for the protection of the flat against building defects.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8b7ef5eb-3ba9-4c1c-a342-f6931312ae7f">

and building defects are covered by other existing legislation,
the Lemon Law does not cover them. In most jurisdictions, the laws governing
properties and goods are also kept separate as they are very different
in nature. For example, the broader range of remedies under our
proposed "Lemon Law", such as replacement, would not be applicable
for property. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2488</p>

that the law be more specific, for example, by defining precisely
what constitutes a defect and specifying the number of repairs before
a consumer is entitled to a replacement. Because we want the law
to be more comprehensive in coverage, and given the diverse range
of goods in the market, it will not be possible to define specific
terms for all goods and all circumstances. The law, as currently
drafted, provides flexibility and not prescriptive for both retailer
and consumer to work out a mutually acceptable arrangement. </p>

certain guidelines on how the courts will apply the law. The Sale
of Goods Act provides guidance on what constitutes non-conformity
with a sale contract. Also, as the intent of the law is to cover
latent defects in goods, the consumer will not be able to seek recourse
for wear and tear due to usage of the goods. </p>

the replacement should conform to the contract, that is, of the
quality, make, model, and condition that are expected. The replacement
offered to the consumer could take into account wear and tear due
to usage by the consumer and need not always be new. The consumer
could weigh the options between accepting, for example, a relatively
new set, versus asking for other remedies such as a reduction in
price, or returning the product for a refund. </p>

in place, consumers will now enjoy more recourse for defective goods.
However, reflecting the balanced position, retailers also enjoy
safeguards against frivolous claims. First, a retailer may offer
an alternative if the remedy requested by the consumer is disproportionately
costly, so long as his proposed remedy does not cause significant
inconvenience to the consumer. A consumer must also give the retailer a
reasonable time to comply with the requested remedy, such as repair
or replacement, before seeking an alternative remedy such as refund
or reduction in price. </p>

not entitled to a remedy if they damaged the item, misused it and
caused the fault, or tried to repair it themselves, or had someone
else try to repair it, resulting in damage to the item. The remedies
are also not available if the consumer knew about the fault before
they bought the goods, or if they simply changed their mind and
no longer wanted the item.</p>

6G of the Hire Purchase Act (HPA) will update the implied terms in
the HPA to be consistent with those in the Sale of Goods Act and
Supply of Goods Act. This will allow consumers who made a hire purchase

existing jurisdiction cap of $20,000 for consumer goods and $55,000,
excluding COE, for motor vehicles shall not apply to these updated
implied terms. This will allow consumers to utilise the new provisions
under the Lemon Law, even
if the values of their hire purchase goods or vehicles exceed this
cap. Therefore, a consumer who bought a $30,000 home theatre system

consultation with the industry, in order to help motor traders defray
costs and encourage them to offer replacements for lemon vehicles,
MOT and LTA have proposed amendments to the Road Traffic Act. The
amendments allow rules to be made for the transfer of Additional
Registration Fee (ARF) and the Certificate of Entitlement (COE)
from a defective vehicle to a replacement vehicle if the defective vehicle
meets two criteria: First, the defect occurs within one year of
the vehicle's registration in Singapore, or within 20,000 kilometres
of the vehicle's mileage, whichever is earlier; and, second, at
least three attempts have been made to repair the defect, or at
least one attempt if the defect is safety-related, within one year
from the date the defect is reported.</p>

be subject to certain conditions, which include the disposal of the
defective vehicle within a month of its replacement. To illustrate,
take for example, a six-month old car that continues to have faulty
brakes after a dealer has attempted to repair. The retailer need
not pay for the additional set of ARF and COE for the replacement
car that he offers to the consumer. </p>

in such situations. Sir, I beg to move.</p>

there are any Members of this House who had previously bought goods
which were defective and could not be repaired after multiple attempts. Unfortunately,
I had. About five years ago, I bought a mobile phone from a reputable telephone
communication company. Barely a week after I bought the phone, it
simply shut down without notice. So for that day, I thought I had
such a peaceful day with no phone calls. But the reality was that
I could not be contacted because the phone was turned off. In computer
language, the phone simply hanged. Not just once but it occurred
a few more times during that week. Most of us would agree that a
phone which keeps switching itself off is not reliable. If you do
not believe me, you can check your phone and see whether it is on or not.
I brought the phone to the service centre for repair. On the first
occasion, the service centre told me that the phone needed a software upgrade.
The service staff also told me that the phone had to be retained
for the software upgrade and asked me to come back three days later
to collect the repaired phone. No replacement phone was given. I
asked the staff, "What do I do, no phone?" The reply, "Well, that's
your own problem."</p>

upgrade was given, the problem was not resolved and the phone continued
with its erratic behaviour of switching off as and when it felt
like it. On the second and third occasions when I brought the phone
back to the service centre, they told me that the phone had a software
bug which had to be cleared. Each time I brought the phone to the
service centre, I wasted time travelling to the service centre, and
then I spent one-and-a-half to two hours waiting for the service
staff to attend to me. This was five years ago.</p>

my telephone line contract was due for renewal, I bought a new smart
phone. Unfortunately, like the previous one, five years ago, this
phone also hanged repeatedly. The first time I went to the service
centre, there were 25 persons waiting in the queue, just to take
a number. Another 15 persons were waiting for their turn for the
service staff to attend to them. I gave up waiting. </p>

the service centre early in the morning and this time, the service
staff told me that it was a software problem. They removed all the
data in the smart phone and told me that they had cleared the bug
in the phone. Since Monday, the phone had shut down by itself five
times. So, currently, I am back to using my old phone.</p>

that happens to you, it is extremely unproductive and very frustrating.
First, it was such a waste of time sending the phone for repair
again and again. Secondly, it was very irritating that a brand new
phone could malfunction in such a manner. I hope that Members of
this House do not see me as simply complaining. I share my experience
so that Members can appreciate the frustration and anger of a consumer
who has bought a defective product or a "lemon".</p>

experience. Many consumers have complained that they had bought
defective electrical or electronic products, or furniture, and they
could not obtain any refund from the retailer. Some had even bought
a motor car which broke down frequently – for example, the car could
not start or stalled in the middle of the road. So can you imagine,
you wake up in the morning, you go to your car, you are not sure whether
your car will start or not. That is the kind of frustration that
a motorist will feel if he bought a "lemon" car. Or the air-conditioner
in the brand new car does not work. </p>

such high price for such a motor car which turned out to be unreliable,
one can imagine how upset the motorist would be. Some consumers
had also bought electrical products which could not be switched
on. For example, you buy a rice cooker and after you turn it on,
the rice does not cook. Or you buy a hair dryer and it cannot operate
at all. Or we have instances of a consumer who bought a new set
of furniture and when the furniture was delivered, the leather was
mouldy, or it was peeling.</p>

more cases where the consumers chose not to complain to CASE or
to pursue the matter further. For this reason, the Consumers Association
of Singapore has been actively advocating for a change in the law
to ensure that consumers in Singapore receive better protection
whenever they buy a "lemon" product or a product which is defective
and does not meet the expected standard of quality or performance.
The consumer has paid good money for the product. They are entitled
to expect that the product which they have paid for works well.
If they have bought a "lemon", they should have the law on their
side and expect that they can get an exchange for the defective
product or a refund of the price. </p>

to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act would give consumers
the right to require a retailer or the seller of the goods to repair or
replace the good within a reasonable time and without causing insignificant inconvenience
to the consumer. In certain situations, the consumer can also ask
the retailer to refund the costs of the defective product or provide
a reasonable rebate off the price of the defective goods.</p>

a presumption that the goods are defective from the time of delivery
if the defects are found within six months of the delivery of the
goods. Without this law, consumers will have to prove that the defective
goods are in breach of expressed terms of contract or they are not
of satisfactory quality. The remedy for such a breach is usually
to reject the goods and seek refund only, and the consumer must
also reject such goods within a reasonable time.</p>

is far better for the consumers. This law will give consumers and tourists
alike the confidence that there are appropriate laws protecting
consumers who have bought defective products. Some retailers or
sellers have expressed that this law may be abused by customers
who seek refunds after they have used the product. For example,
some retailers have said: "Well, after you have bought the product,
you use it. And, after you have used it, you do not want it anymore.
You claim that it is a 'lemon' and you return it."</p>

established retailers who have a "money back guarantee" return policy
has suggested that such abuses are not frequent. In fact, one established retailer
has told me that it is far better to give a refund or exchange than
to be bogged down with an unhappy customer. He did not wish to spend
hours of his time unproductively trying to answer to complaints
by an unhappy customer. Sir, I also want to say that many potential
car buyers and many consumers are also supportive of this law. </p>

like to ask the Minister of State: section 12D(1) provides that
the transferee (being the consumer) can rescind the contract with regard
to the goods or can ask for reduction in the amount to be paid for
the transfer of the goods in question by an appropriate amount.
May I ask the Minister of State, does this mean that the refund
or the rebate as the case may be must be in cash? Can a consumer
or a transferee decline to accept vouchers <em class="ph i">in lieu</em> of the
defective product? If a retailer or seller says, "let me give you
vouchers in exchange", can a consumer decline and say, "I only want
cash."</p>

requires the transferee to give the transferor a reasonable time to
repair or replace the goods. May I ask: what would be considered
a "reasonable" time? Is there a definition of how long is that reasonable
time?</p>

opt out of this legislation by contracting out of it? Thus, can a
retailer place in his conditions for sale that goods sold cannot
be refunded or exchanged? We see this term quite often whenever
the goods are sold pursuant to some "mid-year sale" or "clearance
sale" or "closing down sale". Thus, if a consumer buys a "lemon"
product during a mid-year sale, would he be deprived of the protection
of this law if the retailer contracts out of the law in his sale
terms or by big bright label saying that the item is a "sale item"?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ce5c69b2-0fbe-498a-b76c-56f9ec637414">

transferee or consumer ask for costs or compensation under section
12C(2) for wasting time and transport expenses when he has to send
the product for repair more than once? This will ensure that retailers
of products effect quick exchange for a defective product. Otherwise
they will face a claim for compensation. A retailer can also insist
that the transferee make multiple trips to the service centre just
to have the defective item repaired again and again. Sir, this would
be a waste of time and travelling expenses for the transferee or
the consumer. Thus, in the case of my defective mobile telephone,
the cost of making three trips to the service centre, including
the parking charges and the four to five hours of wasted time waiting
for the phone to be repaired, eventually cost me more than the price
which I paid for the phone. I would be grateful to hear the Minister's
clarifications. I support the Bill and on behalf of the consumers
in Singapore, I urge Members of this House to also support the Bill.</p>

any retailer will be selling you a phone after that speech. On a
more serious note, if I could ask Members if they are going to use
the VGA plug-in for the LCD display for their smartphones, you might
want to take the phone off line before you plug it in so that you
do not have to answer your calls or read your SMS messages throughout.</p>

Member)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, I welcome the amendments to
the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act and the Hire Purchase
Act to include so-called Lemon Law provisions. This is a progressive
step to bring Singapore's consumer protection regime up to speed
with other developed countries like Japan, the US, Canada, Australia,
and the EU. If executed well, the Lemon Law could help weed out
poor practices by a minority of retailers in Singapore, and reward
those with good practices.
This could lead to improved customer service and greater customer
satisfaction.</p>

practices are weeded out, it will inspire more confidence among
both local consumers and the millions of tourists who arrive at
our shores each year to shop. They will be more at ease to buy goods
here, without worrying about the limited recourse should the goods
turn out to be defective. In turn, we could see fewer tourists leaving
Singapore with a bad taste in their mouth because of unpleasant shopping
experiences.</p>

about the proposed amendments as well as some suggestions on how
the execution of the Lemon Law could better achieve its objective of
protecting consumers. Section 12C states the transferee may require
the transferor to repair or replace the goods. Can the consumer
ask for replacement without attempting a repair? This will make
it much more convenient for the consumer and he will not need to
make multiple trips to the service centre.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d5d17bb1-6822-4287-b05c-1046f7d3d0b6">

states that if the customer rescinds the contract, any reimbursement
due to him may be reduced to take into account the use he has had
of the goods since they were delivered to him. I note that based
on existing common law, the court has sometimes decided not to make
any deduction for use because of the inconvenience which the buyer
has already suffered in having to deal with the defective goods. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-92f1d0b0-05f2-4552-afb9-1a57cd2362b4">

I ask the Minister of State: what will be the basis for calculating
this deduction of quantum of reimbursement? Will the deduction be
for only the duration of use until the first repair attempt, or
for the entire duration of the product has been in the customer's
possession even if it included multiple failed repair attempts in
between? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-023cdf1d-c157-4709-ac71-0b2fdc5637fd">

states in the US specify that the reduction of reimbursement is
for the consumers' use of the vehicle only until the first repair
attempt because it recognises that the consumers continued use of
the "lemon" is not a valued benefit to them. </p>

whether a minority of customers might abuse the Lemon Law to make
dishonest claims. This can lead to an increase in the retailers'
costs, which could get passed on to other customers. Does the Ministry
intend to introduce any measures, including punitive measures, to
discourage frivolous customer claims? Could the Minister of State
also explain what the rationale was for specifying the six-month period
after the purchase of the goods, during which the customer can exercise
his rights under this law? Why six months and not more or less? </p>

implementation of the Lemon Law. I believe much would need to be
done to educate customers about their rights under the Lemon Law.
Without adequate public education, consumers may not reap the full
benefits of the amended law. </p>

situations where consumers' lack of understanding of their rights
may disadvantage them when dealing with savvy retailers. The first
is a situation that may arise when retailers get their customers
to sign away their rights through a contract. At the point of the
retail transaction, customers often do not have the time to read through the fine
print before signing and completing the purchase. Section 13 of the
Act states that the provisions of the Act shall prevail notwithstanding
any agreement to the contrary. However, if the customer were to
return to the retailer and request repairs, replacements or a refund,
the retailer may simply pull out the contract and turn down the
request. If the customer is not aware of his rights under section
13, he would naturally assume that since he had signed the contract,
he has no further recourse.</p>

               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e03bebf3-7cbc-4cf0-9406-ec2bfa1b7299">

may have difficulty distinguishing between a manufacturer's warranty
and their right under the Lemon Law. Many goods sold in Singapore,
especially consumer electronic goods, come with a warranty from
the manufacturer. The retailer requires the consumer to approach
the manufacturer directly to rectify any defects within the warranty
period. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-04b9c2dc-0704-4591-b99c-ac3082757efd">

does not fulfil its agreements under the warranty, or the warranty
is shorter than six months, the consumer may not be aware that he
still has the right to go to the retailer to request remedies for
the defective product.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ae9799a9-d2dc-4059-b59d-43368130f083">

to be informed about the avenues available to them if they are unsuccessful
in claiming remedies from retailers of the defective goods. Since many
shoppers in Singapore are tourists, it may be ineffective to run
expensive television advertisement campaigns. Instead, clear signs
could be required to be displayed at all retail outlets highlighting
a telephone hotline and a website that shoppers can call or visit
to learn about their rights as consumers, and the avenues for recourse
under the Lemon Law. The website could include a "Frequently Asked Questions"
section to clarify consumers' and retailers' rights and responsibilities
in plain English and with appropriate translations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c7f2e442-b04f-4068-a94f-0595f3c218ae">

authority could require that the hotline be printed on the receipts
issued by retailers, for shoppers' easy reference. Retailers too
should be educated about their obligations under the amended law.
If not, many of them might continue with their old practices and
cause much confusion and frustration among consumers.</p>

the amendments tilt the balance more in favour of consumers and
this will lead to Singapore becoming a more attractive retail destination.
However, the situation should also be closely monitored to ensure
that this does not inadvertently lead to higher business costs,
which could get passed on to the very consumers that this Bill seeks
to protect. Mr Speaker, with that, I support the Bill.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, I support the Bill. I think it is useful to remember
why we have the Consumer Protection Act in the first place. The Common
Law could not adequately address the imbalance between the might
and financial power of commercial enterprises and the vulnerabilities
of the ordinary consumers, particularly when dealing with increasing
complexities of modern trade and products. The Government therefore
has to intervene to give consumers more rights and provide adequate
and practical remedies when those rights are infringed. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2495</p>

rights and is therefore good to provide remedies to consumers should
their purchases fail to conform to an applicable contract at the
time of delivery including terms implied by statutes such as the
Sale of Goods Act. Consumers are entitled to require retailers to
repair or replace defective goods or require the retailer to reduce
the price of the goods, or the consumer can cancel the purchase
and get their money back.</p>
            </div>

makes this right stronger is the proposed section 12(b)(iii) which
provides that goods, which do not conform to the applicable contract
at any time within six months from the date of delivery, is presumed
not to have so conformed at the date of delivery. In effect, it
gives consumers a six-month trial period. This enhanced protection
comes at a timely juncture. CASE, in their media release supporting
the proposed amendments, noted there had been an increasing trend
of cases relating to defective products from 1,410 cases in 2007
to 1,793 cases in 2011. Hopefully, these amendments will reverse
that trend by encouraging better retail practices. </p>

concerned about some practical issues which may undermine the effectiveness
of the proposed Lemon Law. I would like to make four points. First,
the proposed law only applies when the product fails to conform
to the, I quote, "applicable contract". I would be grateful if the
Minister or Minister of State could clarify what that means. For
example, if the product is sold with a lengthy list of microscopic
terms and conditions, waivers and exclusions, would that be part
of the applicable contract? If so, that could defeat or dilute the
protection the provision seeks to give, particularly when the terms
seek to restrict or qualify the performance of the product.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-eb718390-1246-42d0-bd6d-938f1a3b380c">
                  <a name="id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-eb718390-1246-42d0-bd6d-938f1a3b380c"><!--a--></a>Second, the provisions
do not specify the exact form the refunds must take if the consumer
requests one. Will the retailer be entitled, for example, to provide
a consumer with a voucher or must they pay cash? When it comes to
replacements, must the retailer provide a brand new product or will
they be allowed to provide the customer with a refurbished product
or display item? Leaving this uncertain may result in disputes and disappointments. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c0d290b2-caa4-496e-b05d-58deadcab1d2">
                  <a name="id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-c0d290b2-caa4-496e-b05d-58deadcab1d2"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, while the retailer
is not allowed to contract out of the provisions of the act, this
does not mean that some retailers will not try. As reported in <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits
Times</em> on 16 February 2012, in anticipation of the amendments,
one retailer is instructing its staff to record agreements where
consumers are willing to give up a warranty in exchange for a better
price. Consumers will be none the wiser as to whether such deals
are allowed. That same would apply to goods on sale. Not knowing
your rights is as good as not having those rights at all. More must
be done to educate retailers and consumers about their rights and
obligations arising from these amendments. May I ask the Minister
of State what he plans to do to educate the public on these rights?
He says there is going to be a "Lemon Law education campaign". Could
he give this House some details on that campaign? But, I think,
despite all the campaigns and the education, people will forget.
So can I ask the Minister of State, will there be an obligation
imposed on retailers to inform customers of their rights at the
point of purchase, which is really the most important time? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-74e8c6f0-b1fc-4ed9-9f3b-6599afbb2e5b">
                  <a name="id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-74e8c6f0-b1fc-4ed9-9f3b-6599afbb2e5b"><!--a--></a>Finally, for disputes
which cannot be resolved, the parties may try mediation before CASE,
before heading to the courts, most likely the Small Claims Tribunal.
This could take time and could cost more than the item, which is
the subject of the dispute. Further, the more inconvenient the process,
the more likely consumers will be deterred from prosecuting their
complaints even when there are genuine complaints, or even encourage retailers
to be as difficult as possible so as to discourage the customer.
Could we not simplify the process by giving a body like CASE the
power to make awards for claims not exceeding a certain threshold?
This, I suspect, would resolve the majority of cases and reduce
time and costs substantially. There is a precedent for this in banking disputes
where customer can turn to Financial Industry Disputes Resolution
Centre (FIDReC) to adjudicate claims not exceeding $50,000. And
as the Minister of State would know, following the Lehman crisis,
many customers turned to FIDReC for adjudication instead of to the
courts and many cases were resolved quickly and with minimal costs. There
should be a similar facility for consumer disputes. This body could
also maintain a database of awards made which should bring to light
any errant retailer guilty of multiple violations. In this regard,
would the Minister of State also clarify whether any action will
be taken against the recalcitrant retailers?</p>

move to help consumers. However, I hope consumers and retailers
will turn to these provisions as a last resort. Ideally, consumers and
retailers should come to an amicable settlement when there is fault
in any product. As reported in the <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> on
29 February, and I quote, "In the US and the United Kingdom, many
retailers do more than it is required by Lemon Law. They give exchanges,
no questions asked, sometimes on the spot. This keeps customers
happy and removes the hassle of dealing with frivolous complaints.
Far from encouraging spurious complaints, retailers say freely given
exchanges lead to a fall in the number of unreasonable complaints,
they credit this to shopper trust." That is the ideal we should aspire
to. </p>

retailers should cultivate goodwill and loyalty through good service.
The retailers' real fear should not be Lemon Laws or other forms
of consumer protection, but the knowledge that their customers have
the ultimate remedy of going to their competitors. And on that regard
– a word of advice to Mr Lim Biow Chuan – if the phone does not
work, perhaps it is time to go to a different provider. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, many I spoke with welcome this amendment because of prior bad
experience. Like them and Mr Lim Biow Chuan, I had, at some point in
time, purchased products that failed to work soon after the purchase
was made. Many retailers in Singapore do not have a "no questions
asked" refund policy. This Lemon Law will force retailers to rethink
the business model they use to transact with consumers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-290b07b8-16eb-43c3-b783-9b5e12428580">
                  <a name="id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-290b07b8-16eb-43c3-b783-9b5e12428580"><!--a--></a>The amendments now make
provisions that if a product is found defective within six months
of delivery, the customer has the right to demand the seller make
repair or replacement within a reasonable time and without causing
significant inconvenience to the consumer, or the consumer can keep
the defective product and be given an agreed discount or return
the product for a total refund. Now, there are four areas I wish
to highlight as potential concern areas in the execution of the
Bill for which I will be grateful for the Minister of State's clarification
or assurances. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5571cd90-447c-43fc-baff-18ff2c81314a">
                  <a name="id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-5571cd90-447c-43fc-baff-18ff2c81314a"><!--a--></a>The first is what constitutes
a refund? Like Mr Hri Kumar, I wondered if retailers will attempt
to get around the compensation issue by offering or contracting
in-house vouchers
of the same value as the defective products to the customers as
compensation. How do we prevent retailers from such attempts to
dilute the consumers' rights? </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2497</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2669dbc7-7599-4717-92cc-9b1a1ca37834">
                  <a name="id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-2669dbc7-7599-4717-92cc-9b1a1ca37834"><!--a--></a>The second is a retailer
may sign a contract with the customer to state that the product
is, I quote, "as is" due to special pricing, or promotion, or due
to the nature of that particular product with no refund or exchange
allowed. Section 13 of the existing Act seems clear enough that
it bars sellers and buyers from contracting out of a refund for
other considerations such as a lower price. However, many retailers
and consumers may not know of this provision. Retailers may attempt
creative ways to contract themselves out of the provision in this
Act, especially during the initial implementation stage. A lot of
monitoring and education need to be done. The Minister of State
has spoken about "as is" products. How do retailers now have to
highlight specific defects in specially-priced products as stated
clearly in their contracts and advertising to make sure they stay
within the law? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd7a1b15-82a1-4090-a2da-9b57df575e99">

physical products. I understand a big area of consumer complaints
is regarding services such as packages offering services like spa
services. I am citing this as an example but I do not wish to generalise
that such packages are bad. One may purchase a package only to find
that the centre is perpetually overbooked and you can hardly get
a chance to use your package. Or if you sign up for some miracle treatment
to restore, say, hair, only to find that it does not work after
six months of faithfully trying the service. What recourse avenues
are there for consumers under the current law now? I appreciate
that the Ministry would need time to work out this current amendment
on dealing with physical products. I trust it will cover services
more comprehensively in the future amendment of the Act.</p>

will be difficult to cover online purchases as online shops are likely
to be outside of our jurisdiction, or we may not even be able to
identify and locate these online shops. Nevertheless, online shops
registered in Singapore should have to abide by these rules. I would
like to hear from the Minister of State his views on online purchases. </p>

as it is a move in the right directions towards the type of shopping
experience we get in first world countries. The execution must be
managed carefully to ensure that retailers and consumers are adequately
educated so that both groups are fully aware of their rights and
obligations under this amendment. We should be mindful that Singapore
is a cosmopolitan city with consumers, retail frontline staff and
even retail owners coming from a diversity of international backgrounds.
Non-Singaporeans may be used to the retail practices in their native
countries. A good engagement programme with different stakeholders
in the implementation is critical to its success. Can the Minister
of State elaborate on the steps which the Ministry will take to
educate retailers and consumers in conjunction with the implementation?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-671d15b0-5a40-42c0-a0fb-90d69475c9fa">
                  <a name="id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-671d15b0-5a40-42c0-a0fb-90d69475c9fa"><!--a--></a>We have just finished
the Budget debate which had a lot of focus on SMEs. The bulk of
our retailers are SMEs. The larger retailers will have the better
resources to get themselves acquainted to and cope with the changes.
Smaller retailers may find the changes difficult to understand and
deal with. Retailers should also be mindful that they need to work
out their own arrangements with product manufacturers to ensure
that they are not stuck with an untenable position when servicing
the customers. They will need to factor for refunds and exchanges.
Some retailers may now turn conservation about carrying lower-priced
products that may not be built to last even if their consumers are
willing to buy these because the consumers themselves are highly
price conscious.
This will lead to changes in our retail model over the next few
years. I hope MTI can extend good support to the SME retailers to
ease them in the implementation. Engaging in partnership with organisations
such as the Singapore Retailers Association will be helpful. I hope,
too, that there will be a balanced approach in the implementation so
that we do not unnecessarily put genuinely good but small retailers
out of business. I trust that if we execute this amendment well,
it will be a more pleasant and reassuring shopping experience for
us all.</p>

allowing me to join this debate. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading)
Act, internationally known as the "Lemon Law", has been anticipated
for a long time. Many residents ask me why the Lemon Law cannot
come into force immediately. I explained to them, Amendment Bills
can only come into force after the Third Reading in Parliament.
More importantly, retailers need time to adjust, and the Government
also need to educate the public, to prevent any misunderstanding
and abuse of the law.</p>

in the US, UK and other European countries. In Singapore, it is
still a new concept. People will have many queries. I hope MTI can explain
to us in detail. </p>

do not have as much information on the quality of the product as
the retailer. We are concerned that some retailers will take advantage
of the buyer's ignorance and ask him, at the point of payment, to
voluntarily relinquish the right to have the defective merchandise
replaced or refunded. When the retailer is having a promotion or
sale, buyers are mostly likely to be tricked when they try to save a
few dollars. I hope that MTI will take note of this. </p>

some merchants will only give cash vouchers, not cash, to consumers
who ask for refunds. There are many conditions associated with a
cash voucher, the consumer can only buy the same type of products
in the same shop. The validity period is also limited. Does the
Lemon Law stipulate that consumers have the right to ask for a cash
refund?</p>

did not state clearly the quality of the replacement product. Many people
worry that the replacement will not be much better than the original
defective product. I suggest the Law stipulates that if the consumer
bought a new product, the replacement should also be new. If what
he bought is a second-hand product, then the replacement can be
second-hand. However, the quality must be the same. </p>

product, does it come with a six-month "lemon" protection period?
Or is it a case where once the retailer gives a replacement, he
is no longer bound by any liabilities stipulated under the "lemon"
law? </p>

be to calculate the period from the date the first merchandise was
sold and add six months. If the replacement is also found to be
flawed within the six months, then I think the buyer is entitled

products from different merchants, sometimes the products are still
not up to expectation. If the merchant does not abide by the Lemon
Law, consumers will suffer more. Therefore, I hope the Government

not suffer further. I also hope the Government can establish an
enforcement team, to conduct raids or undisclosed investigations
to see whether merchants abide by the Lemon Law.</p>

are unlawful retailers, there will also be unreasonable consumers.

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill that will help to
protect consumer rights better and ensure better equity in retail transactions,
in the case of a defective product. This Bill will also see retailers
and suppliers of goods taking a more responsible attitude in the
quality of their merchandise. All these will culminate in a better
reputation for Singapore as a retail hub in the region. </p>

on several issues and ambiguities that are not fully covered in
the Bill. To begin with, the definition of what makes a good defective
is very much left open to interpretation. The seller and buyer will
surely take a different view on this and claims for refunds will
surely take time to settle without a clear definition even though the
burden of proof now lies with the seller.</p>

it will be an even more tedious process in establishing right and
wrong. Take for example, the purchase of a second-hand car. A few
months later, after the purchase, problems may start erupting and
the new owner has to spend monies in replacing the air-conditioning
system, the lights, the brake pumps and even the brake pads. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cbbc163e-c337-4a5a-9914-6f6ec2346a1f">

one would never have imagined that one has to fork out so much more
since all these malfunctioning parts to be replaced had never been mentioned
in the first place. The worst thing is that they all happened progressively
in which no physical inspection can help to identify. In the case
of the car air-conditioning, the new owner may just be told that
it was a bit weak and there were no further explanations. In the
new Law, I suppose you would be able to ask for a replacement car, or
similar make, or model, or to receive a further discount?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd6f2a5e-5369-4a56-b0ae-27a544dea6fa">

a weak case. First, the person accepted the fact that the car is having
a weaker air-conditioning system and, second, a second-hand car
would surely have come under prolonged use and its parts are more
liable to break down or be worn out. I am not sure how realistic
it is to ask the second-hand car dealer to guarantee that all the
parts be in tip-top condition. Third, and most importantly, the
car is still in good driving
condition. Would it be regarded as a defective product since the
car can still be driven?</p>

a car, it would be far better to state specifically in legal annexes
what would be the conditions of exchange and how the refund or discount policy
be like. To place all baskets of goods in the same coverage, the
Law seems to take a simplistic approach. It is more likely for the
second-hand car owner to settle repairs first rather than wait for
a car of a similar make, model and mileage to be exchanged. In practicality,
it probably will not happen at all.</p>

laws of exchange without considering the nature of products sold
is another shortcoming. I worry for sellers who may pay a high rate
of return and refunds. This will directly add on to the costs for
the businesses and impact them financially. Taking the example of
an apparel, this is probably one difficult category of product to
establish the nature of defects for it does not just concern the
size and fitting but also comfort and aesthetics. An apparel can
shrink after repeated washing and hence the size does not fit or
it becomes tighter. The colours on our shirts and dresses can also fade
after sometime. Will all these therefore fit into a "defective"
product? </p>

perhaps the wrong washing method is deployed and hence caused the
defect. Consumer can continue to insist that this is not the case.
How would the tribunal or in anyway, some dispute resolution measure
be able to establish the process of law in this case? In a most
ludicrous situation, the consumer may have added on to their waistline
causing their clothes not to fit anymore. Would this require for sellers
to have an exchange of goods when these clothes are brought back
to them within six months' of purchase? Should the seller then not
record every single customer and every single waistline to ensure
the veracity of the purchase?</p>

our consumers are unreasonable. In fact, unreasonable customers
would be a minority. However, from this simple example, we can see
the challenges in which the Law can be exercised and be potentially
abused. Through the earlier two examples other than the ambiguities
of what constitutes a defect, it is clear that another lacuna of
the Bill is the one-size-fits-all approach in covering exchanges, discounts
and refunds for all goods. </p>

it may be useful to consider different time periods for different categories
of goods. For example, defects in a car may take more than six months
to manifest as compared to a defect in an apparel. Conversely, a
six months' period for an apparel may be too long as the fabric
is more prone to wear and tear and damage. </p>

is on what really constitutes the proper exchange and refund of
defective goods. Some retailers may just replace the product with
a refurbished product rather than a new product that works. Such
a refurbished product will usually be sold at a discounted price.
So, the point of equity cannot be taken as the same.</p>

in place in the Law to stipulate how an unscrupulous retailer would

this phone was passed off as a new phone.</p>

Law also seems to suggest that the retailer would have the discretion

the new Law also has to take into account new shopping trends such
as online shopping. A recent article in <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> on
3 March 2012 highlighted how more and more people have taken to
shop online for their furniture. So what happens when their furniture
that they have ordered and paid for by their credit cards is not
the same as the one ordered or even delivered? Will the new Law
be able to extend its reach even beyond our borders? Many of the
online furniture stalls may be based overseas and even the local
ones will have their manufacturers and suppliers abroad. It is difficult
to see how replacement or refund can be sought readily when the seller
cannot be located in Singapore. If there is a differentiated treatment
based on whether the seller is local or foreign, will the Law then
be fair to our local sellers? </p>

I thought there is a critical need to build safeguard mechanisms
online to deter mistaken purchases. This is because the product
delivered or received may not be fully representative of what is
seen online or the presupposed functions are not even there. Sometimes,
it can even be the wrong click of the computer mouse. I have personal
experience of online purchases, once made, are extremely difficult
and near to impossible to reverse and seek a refund. The process
of filling in appeal letters to banks to rescind online payment
is usually tedious and onerous.</p>

may not feature physical goods, sometimes, but services instead.
The new Law would not be able to cover this area since the definition is
strictly on physical goods. There are a broad range of services
that consumers purchase which will not be covered in this new Law.</p>

about the spike in complaints about online group discount purchases.
How can we ensure that retailers deliver their end of the bargain?
I am of the opinion that stronger measures need to be put in place
to protect unknowing customers who may have purchased products at
the spur of moment, attracted by the price discount alone.</p>

of the Lemon Law, to me, is just a start in educating consumers on
their rights and how to exercise them. The scepticism among consumers
is understandable as the new Law will not remove all the lemons.
It will be far better to promote a retail environment where exchanges
are made without questions and on the spot and also, a consumer
culture which thrives on information sharing. This is already happening
in the United States, Japan and Europe. I hope there will be a day
where the Law will not be needed to make the buyer and seller pleased
that the transaction has been made. </p>

I am happy that we have made a significant and steady progress with
consumer protection. Seriously, I hope this Lemon Law will not sour
the buyer and seller relationship. I think, at the end of the day,
our desired outcome is not for the buyers and sellers to throw lemons
at each other but that both parties can enjoy the lemonade that
is squeezed from the lemon. With that, I support the Bill.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join this debate. I welcome
the Lemon Law. To tell you the truth, the first time I heard about
Lemon Laws was when I was watching the movie "Cars 2" where there
was a group of cars, one group, they would call themselves "Lemons"
where they were defective cars and the other cars were the better
cars. That was when I actually checked out what was the meaning
of the lemons and came to know about lemons being defective goods.
I believe I might not be alone in not knowing what is a Lemon Law.
So, I support the call for public education to know what the Lemon
Law is all about.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4806f4c9-24a5-478b-a6f3-c35fffc1c074">

milestone for the protection of consumer rights. However, I noticed
the proposed amendment covers only the purchases of goods including perishable
products. In many countries, the Lemon Laws actually cover the purchases
of pets. They call it the Puppy Lemon Law. So, I would like to propose
for the Bill to also include provision for the purchases of pets.
I also want to declare myself as being the owner of two pets.</p>

the Lemon Laws for pets, I would like to caution against possible
abuses. We have heard cases where the purchasers of pets sometimes,
out of being impulsive, buy the pet at the spur of the moment and
should they change their mind, I think there must be certain safeguards
to prevent people from causing harm to the animals, hoping that
they could claim back the purchases of the pets by causing harm
to the animals. I hope sufficient safeguards will be introduced
should the Ministry consider to include the purchases of pets under
the Lemon Law.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, let me first thank all the Members who have spoken and raised
some lemon questions or questions relating to the Lemon Law. There are
a lot of lemons around. As Members can see, the questions are so
varied and diverse. As such, first of all, the Law is not going
to be very prescriptive. From the legal perspective, we can pass
the Law and then try to explain and interpret the Law and educate
consumers. But on the ground, the law is actually practised in such
a way where it gives a win-win situation or position for both the
consumer and business. </p>

as a consumer who bought lemons and, also, as a customer service
representative early in my career when I worked for multinational companies
with customer service policies that are very simple. For the smaller company,
they were smaller but the customer policies are very detailed in
order to reduce costs. Both these companies practise customer service
and, I would say, that returns policies are based on very different
kind of philosophies and ideals. </p>

the company size is different and some with resources and some without,
but the ones that have good customer service practices and the ones
that retain customer loyalty and where the customers keep coming
back are the ones with the least number of rules or guidelines for
people like us, who are customer service officers who had to deal
with customers. The broad guideline was: whenever a customer approaches
you and you engage them, and you look at the product, if there are
any defects or not, always give the benefit of the doubt and exchange
it if you can, if you have the product or the stock. If you do not
have the same model, offer alternatives. That was how it was practised. We did not go
to the part where there was cash refund because, at that time, we
issued vouchers. At that time, we did not know about the existence
of Sale of Goods Act nor was there any Lemon Law so many years ago.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2503</p>

hand, I also worked part-time in this company's customer service
unit but it had strict rules. We would get supervised for every
single transaction that we approved or disapproved. It was always
down to the dollars and cents. As you can see, the customers that
had a very good customer experience would keep coming back and bought
more products. That is the practice we look for. That is what we
hope the Lemon Law can act as a deterrent law to filter out the
retailers that do not have the best practices. We want to make sure
that retailers maintain some good practice, give a good customer
experience. That will be good for the retail sector, the business
sector, also for the companies that deal with consumers directly
every day. It lifts Singapore up with good reputation and goodwill.
At the end of the day for consumers and businesses, there are just
a few important objectives: quality of the product is very important,
the goodwill built between the two parties is very important and
we want to retain the customer loyalty and make sure customers will
come back and even buy more products. This is extremely important.
Some companies do their sales or market their goods not just based
on quality of products but on a customer service approach. You can
tell that some of them practise the principle of money-back guarantee,
no questions asked. Some of these promotional campaigns are actually
quite common, nowadays, because the companies want to show that
they keep the customers at the very top of their priority.</p>

some of the questions and if I cannot answer all of them, as there
are so many of them and so diverse, I will also come back to you
separately. But let me start with some of the points of clarification.
Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Yee Jenn Jong who have
asked if the retailers' obligation under the Lemon Law can be contracted
out. The retailer cannot contract out his obligations under the Law.
As I have spoken in my earlier speech that, even under existing
laws, the retailer cannot deny the consumer his rights to remedies
by stipulating that it is a sale, display or discounted item that
cannot be refunded or exchanged. Retailers should document any defects
and product limitations on the sales contract, invoice or packaging.
And if these defects and limitations are made clear to the consumer
at the point of sale, retailers will not be held liable for them
but it has to be very specific and pinpoint. I will also address
this issue later in my speech.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e520ece-25e0-4fc4-aba0-e187e8f5ade4">

consumer can ask for compensation for time and expenses if he is
asked to send the defective product for multiple repairs. Under
the proposed Law, the retailer must bear any necessary costs incurred
in providing repair, including the cost of any labour, materials,
postage while delivering the goods for repair. And if the retailer
is unable to provide the repairs within a reasonable time and without
causing significant inconvenience to consumer, consumer may demand
an alternative remedy, meaning a replacement, a reduction in price
or a refund.</p>

about how deduction for usage by the consumer is calculated in the
refund. The court will have the discretion to determine the appropriate deduction,
depending on the facts of each case. As Mr Giam has rightly pointed
out, based on existing common law, the court has sometimes refused
to make any deduction for use because of the inconveniences which
the buyer has already suffered in having to deal with the defective
goods. This has to be kept open because it really has to depend on
the type of goods and the nature of the goods, the type of purchases
and how it was purchased
at the point in time and we have to keep it and leave it more open,
flexible and dynamic rather than prescriptive because it may not
be able to be applied across the board. There is case law where
the court determined on the spot how the transaction was done, whether
the goods that were purchased and used, whether there was wear and
tear, whether there was inconvenience caused, and whether there
was cost incurred in delivering to and fro. All these would have
to be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

considered acceptable refunds, the answer is "no". The partial or
full refund should be in cash. The consumer may decline to accept
vouchers. In my earlier example when I mentioned about my own experience
about exchanging those products, we never had to deal with cash.
Because what we want to do was to encourage the customers to continue
to use the product from the same company, use the same brand and
not go to the competition. That was why we would offer vouchers and
we would propose alternative products for the customer because we
want to make sure that we keep the customer within our product.
If not, they would change the brand or change to another kind of
product, we think, we would lose the customer. Under the Law, it
has to be in cash. In practice it could be very different. But the
Law protects the consumer.</p>

for clarification of whether terms and conditions in fine print
would form part of the contract for determining conformity to contract,
the answer is "yes". However, these terms and conditions cannot
be used to allow retailers to contract out of their obligations
under the Law or to deny consumers their rights to remedies, and
in addition, where the other Acts do apply.</p>

Act does not allow retailers to contract out the implied terms of
the sales contract under the Sale of Goods Act, including the term
to conform to description and to be of satisfactory quality and
fitness for purpose. The court can also grant relief to a consumer
under the Consumer Protection Fair Trading Act for unfair practices
and this will include taking advantage of a consumer by including
in an agreement terms or conditions that are harsh or oppressive
or extensively one-sided so as to be unconscionable and using small
print to conceal a material fact from the consumer or to mislead
the consumer as to the material fact in connection with the business
of supply of goods and services. So, if there is intent to hide,
intent not to show the true facts, then the business or the retailer
will be liable. So, there is the Act and there is the law to protect
the consumer.</p>

about how the six-month rebuttable presumption is derived. Under
existing laws, such as the Sales of Goods Act, the buyer can already reject
the goods and claim a refund if the goods do not conform to the
contract. However, the consumer can only do so within a reasonable
period which is actually not defined. That is exactly why the Lemon
Law regime provides a six-month time frame in which the defect that
occurs is presumed to have existed at the time of delivery unless the
seller can prove otherwise. So, in this case, a consumer can return,
reject but the retailer has to prove. So, the burden of proof is
with the seller. If the seller cannot prove that the defect did
not exist at time of delivery, he is obligated to provide a remedy.</p>

is consistent with that set in the lemon laws of the UK and the EU.
We are learning and following how lemon laws are practised internationally,
and so, we have adopted this six-month period. Whether it is too
long or too short, it is hard to tell. As it evolves, it will depend on
the context, it will depend on the environment in Singapore. But
we think that the six-month period is not too long such that it
makes it difficult for a seller to prove that the defect was not
present at the time of delivery. But, really, I would say that on
the ground, it depends on the product, depends on how it was transacted
as well and the practices between the seller and the buyer. A lot
of these arrangements in the past tend to be resolved by their own
arrangements. Some of these laws that we put in place even if they
say six months, I believe sometimes it is resolved within the six
months.</p>

if the six-month rebuttable presumption period is renewed each time
the consumer obtains a replacement. This six months' reversed burden
of proof on the retailer cannot be renewed with each replacement.
However, the Lemon Law provisions for remedies of repair, replacement,
discount or refund will still apply beyond this six-month period.
But the consumer will have to prove that the replacement provided
did not conform to the contract.</p>

there were also questions on whether the law can be more specific.
And there was a question asked by Mr Patrick Tay. In my earlier
speech I have explained why we should not make the Law more specific
by stipulating terms and conditions for the particular goods. And
given the diversity of goods in the market, doing so is not practical
and I have explained that the practice can sometimes be different
and it will make the Law complicated in application. In fact, it
may or it may not help retailers since this Law does protect consumers.
And it will also remove the flexibility for both retailer and consumer
to work out mutually acceptable arrangements. Our Law must also
be adaptable to the new goods that come on to the market. It will
not be possible to change the Law every time a new product is launched.
However, we understand the need for guidelines to provide greater
clarity to businesses and consumers and we have distributed advisories
to various trade associations highlighting good business practices,
case studies on claims for various types of goods. We are going
to work with CASE to prepare consumer guides to highlight what we
consider appropriate and reasonable claims under the Lemon Law. </p>

will lead to abuse by consumers resulting in increased costs, businesses
and goods retailers already have in place guarantees and warranties and
their own returns policies. In fact, some of the retailers with
good practices and also have great customer retention and loyalty,
have returns policies and customer service polices that are even
more stringent than the Lemon Law. There are also existing remedies
under other legislations such as the Sale of Goods Act or the Common
Law. The proposed amendments help to enhance this market deficiency,
making more explicit the time frame that the burden of proof falls
on the retailer, and by providing more options for recourse. While
the consumer can use the proposed Law to seek recourse from the
retailer, the retailer can offer to repair the product first before providing
a replacement or even a discount or refund. </p>

to a remedy if they caused the fault, for example, by misusing the
goods, wear and tear, or trying to repair themselves, or getting
it repaired by unauthorised retailers. The remedies are also not
available if the consumer knew about the fault before they bought
the goods. Or simply changed their mind and no longer want the item.
With the Lemon Law, within these six months, the retailer must prove
those facts.</p>

established retailers with existing money-back guarantees have indicated
that consumer abuses are not frequent and most reputed retailers
are already giving refunds or exchanges to make their customers happy.
But, of course, there are cases that still happen. This Law, in
some way or another, has to be explained effectively to both sides,
both the retailers and sellers, and see how they implement the practice.
But, at the end of the day, it is important that the retailers must
understand that any mutually acceptable agreement must be beneficial for
themselves and also must get the buy-in from the consumers.</p>

whether replacement needs to be brand new. The replacement should
conform to contract that is to be of the quality, make, model and
condition that is expected. Wear and tear due to usage will be considered.
If the consumer is not satisfied with the replacement, he could
ask for other remedies such as a reduction in price, or return the
product for a refund.</p>

Chuan's question of what constitutes a reasonable time before a
consumer can seek an alternative remedy: it is not practical to
prescribe a time frame definitely, given the diversity of goods.
We cannot simply stipulate one time and then apply it across the
board because the range of defects is also different. The Law states
that this is to be determined by the nature of goods and the purpose
of which the goods were acquired and the court will interpret the
provisions accordingly. The industry association may also adopt
codes or guidance for their members as appropriate dispute resolution
practices. Industry standards and guidelines may also indirectly influence
the court's views too.</p>

question of coverage of the proposed legislation. Both Mr Yee Jenn
Jong and Mr Patrick Tay have asked why services such as spas and
real estates and hair care and time share are not included. In my
earlier speech, I mentioned that not including services and real
property is consistent with lemon laws in other jurisdictions. Services
are not covered as the remedies under the Lemon Law regime are tailored
for goods. They are generally inappropriate for services because,
sometimes, implementation will be difficult under the Law. For example,
I am not sure how to replace the hair that is still not growing.
Maybe they will give you a wig. I am not sure if that is the best
replacement, but sometimes, it is difficult to say how does a company repair
a service or a spa treatment. Moreover, for property including HDB
flats, there is already existing legislation governing the sale
and purchase of new or uncompleted properties, such as the Housing
Developers Control and Licensing Act and the Sale of Commercial
Properties Act which provides for one-year defects liability period
and beyond the one-year defects liability period, purchasers can
still take civil action against the developer for latent defects
on grounds of negligence or breach of contract. </p>

share and spa, consumers are already protected under the Consumer
Protection (Fair Trading) Act which contained specific provisions
against pressure selling, which is a common complaint. We have also
recently strengthened the time shares specific provisions in the
Act, such as extending the mandatory cooling-off period from three
to five days and introducing a 60-day refund period for contracts cancelled
within the cooling-off period. CASE has proposed further amendments
to it and we are going to conduct a public consultation together
with CASE later this year.</p>

under the Lemon Law. As in other jurisdictions such as UK and the
EU, the Lemon Law does not distinguish between local or foreign
online traders. Generally, Singapore law applies if the contract
stipulates it as the "governing law of the contract" or if the contract
is concluded in Singapore. However, it may not be possible to enforce
that judgement against those overseas traders if they have no presence
here. So this is where consumer education comes into play and it
is very critical that you make a choice and when you buy things
online, you must know who you are buying from and whether there
is an appropriate track record, the track record that can be reliable
and you know that the physical presence is there. Different ways
of making that judgement, but consumers would have to make informed decisions.</p>

against overseas parties is a practical jurisdictional issue which
is not unique to lemon laws. For group online purchases which failed
to deliver, after payment was made, the consumer may have recourse
under contract law as well as under the Consumer Protection Fair
Trading Act. If there was fraudulent intent, the police may be able
to take action for offences under the Penal Code. Lemon laws are
not designed to address the issue of mistaken online transactions.
However, the Electronic Transactions Act allows a person to withdraw
input errors when transacting online if he did not have an opportunity
to correct the error. So, that is the Electronic Transactions Act
that provides that opportunity. </p>

on operations and education. On Mr Hri Kumar's question on whether
CASE is given powers to award claims so that consumers need not take
a more expensive route of going to court, currently, the Act does
not allow such powers to CASE. We can discuss with CASE, review
what is possible to make it more effective as we evolve, because
the laws have not been implemented yet. It takes a while. At this
point in time till September when it is implemented, we will focus
on education and trying to educate and get public feedback and consultation

out that the cost of going to the Small Claims Tribunal – the charges
to the consumers range from $10 to $20, depending on the claims
amount. The Small Claims Tribunal provides a speedy, low-cost forum
for the resolution of disputes arising from claims not exceeding
$10,000 or $20,000, if both claimant and respondent agreed. As to
whether action can be taken against recalcitrant retailers, CASE
is empowered under the Act to apply for court injunctions against
errant retailers who carry out unfair practices, such as product
misrepresentation and pressure selling.</p>

of the Members who have spoken, educating consumers on their rights
under the proposed law and the fact that these rights cannot be
contracted out or signed away will form an integral part of the
education campaign on Lemon Law that we will work with CASE on.
I have taken note of the views of several of the Members to educate
through different channels, different ways, even working with trade associations,
helping the smaller retailers, SMEs. I think those entities are
important to educate. We will try to reach out to as wide a group
as possible. Because to implement this effectively and get a better understanding
of it, we need to reach out to both sides, not just to the consumer
but also the businesses.</p>

on whether we will maintain a registry of unreasonable consumers
who make repeated claims, we will not do so as it may not be possible
to determine whether the claim was reasonable or not. It is actually

repeat abuses of the law through their point of sale system and

some manufacturers may decide to cease providing warranties altogether
since the law obliges the retailer, not the manufacturer, to provide the
remedy. While it is a commercial decision whether manufacturers
will provide warranties or not, but I think with this law it provides
certain discipline or an opportunity for the retailers to relook
at their contractual and commercial arrangement with the manufacturers.
With the Lemon Law, maybe it is a back-to-back agreement with the manufacturer
and they can practise good quality exchange or returns policy between
the manufacturer and retailer and consumer. We do not expect that
manufacturers will cease to provide warranties because warranties
are also part of a selling point. It is important for consumers
at the point of decision, they would also look at whether there is
warranty or not. Most manufacturers would have that understanding,
retailers as well. So retailers and manufacturers must have the
contractual arrangement that were beneficial for both.</p>

the other questions. Mr Zainal Sapari asked if the Lemon Law applies
to pets and puppies. This Lemon Law does apply to pets too. I was
wondering how you would apply the repairs to pets. I guess it is
a life, so we cannot just repair it. But I guess in many circumstances,
just for discussion's sake, let us say, you buy a pet, at the point
of delivery the pet is not feeling too well – puppy or otherwise
– the seller would have to treat the disease or the illness or the
sickness before delivery. Maybe that is one way. I have a friend
who runs pet centres all over Singapore and he takes extreme care
to make sure that the pet is in good condition before he sells them
and he follows up after selling them to make sure that the pets
remain in good condition, under good care. Some of these approaches
are really arrangements between the retailers and consumers. So
it is included.</p>

borrow a statement from Mr Patrick Tay's speech, "The introduction
of the Lemon Law is just a start and serves as a deterrent to errant
retailers selling shoddy products and at the end of day what the
law seeks to do is not to remove all lemons – you cannot. It is
difficult and it is practically impossible – but to encourage transparency
and good business practices." And many a time the law is a deterrent.
On the ground, with this law, it would encourage good practices
and make sure that we weed out the bad retailers; and the good retailers
remain in place. That can help tourism, our retail sector and business
sector. It will also bring sellers and consumers to work together
to improve the retail environment in Singapore. Most importantly,
it will ensure good quality products. It is goodwill for the retailers
and goodwill and trust between both the retailer and the buyer and,
most importantly, retain customers for the businesses and this will
be beneficial for retailers and consumers and for Singapore's retail
sector as a whole.</p>

use the same analogy with the goods for the pets: replace, repair,
even refund under the Lemon Law, then I think the pet must be in
a healthy condition before it is sold to you. As I mentioned, healthy
condition means, you bought the pet and within six months it has
to be treated for a sickness or illness that happened at the point
of delivery, it is justifiable to claim the medical expenses. If
the retailer cannot prove otherwise that at the point of delivery,
there was no sickness then the buyer has to be reimbursed all medical
expenses.</p>

the Registry's statutory powers to inspect the business premises
of licensed moneylenders and to require them to furnish information
and documents. Clause 4 amends section 25 to allow the Registry
to engage any person, for example, auxiliary police officers, to
assist the Registrar or an authorised public officer in exercising
the Registry's statutory powers. While they will be able to view
and make copies of documents being inspected, the power to seize
and remove documents or equipment from the premises inspected will
continue to be exercised by public officers only. The amendment
will enhance the Registry's capacity to conduct more frequent and thorough
enforcement checks on moneylenders.</p>

the offence of unlicensed moneylending, and section 14(3)(A) stipulates
a non-exhaustive list of activities which are deemed to be assisting
in unlicensed moneylending. Such activities include allowing premises
to be used for unlicensed moneylending, and collecting or demanding
payment of a loan on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender. While
the generality of section 14(1) makes all activities which assist
in unlicensed moneylending illegal, we propose to make it explicitly
clear that it is a criminal offence to share information on borrowers
with unlicensed moneylenders. In this regard, clause 3 amends section
14(3A) to include the activity of any person sharing information
on a potential borrower with an unlicensed moneylender, or referring
a potential borrower to an unlicensed moneylender, as assisting
in unlicensed moneylending. A person convicted of the offence will
be liable for a fine of up to $300,000 and, depending on whether
it is the first or subsequent offence, a maximum of four or seven
years' imprisonment and a maximum of six or 12 strokes of the cane.</p>

it an offence for moneylenders to commence their business at a place
which the Registry has not approved. Clause 2 amends section 10(13)(a)
to make it explicit that it is an offence for moneylenders to carry
on their moneylending business at an unauthorised place of business,
regardless of when it commenced.</p>

touch on the amendments we are making to the Moneylenders Rules,
I will briefly explain the broad rationale for these amendments.

the moneylending regulations last year, through, amongst others,
advertising directions and licence conditions. </p>

of Effective Interest Rate; second, extend coverage of caps on interest

abolish all exceptions to the limits on the amount of unsecured
loans that a borrower can obtain.</p>

the use of Effective Interest Rate (EIR), instead of Nominal Interest
Rate (NIR), to be the basis for interest rate caps. Currently, there
are interest rate caps, based on NIR, of 12% for secured loans and
18% for unsecured loans, for borrowers earning less than $20,000
a year. Henceforth, the interest rate cap of 12% NIR will be replaced
by its approximate equivalent of 13% EIR, while the cap of 18% NIR
will be replaced by its approximate equivalent of 20% EIR.</p>

be required to compute and disclose the EIR of their loan packages
to borrowers. This is similar to the practice of banks. </p>

into account the compounding effect of the number of instalments
over a one-year period. This means that EIR better reflects the
actual cost of borrowing over a one-year period. Using EIR will
also help borrowers more easily compare different loan packages.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-265859ae-2864-4440-912c-5b28d1b72405">

provide the Effective Interest Rate of the loan package to their
borrowers are liable to a fine not exceeding $20,000, or to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding six months, or to both; and in the case
of a second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding $40,000,
or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both.</p>

the coverage of the interest rate caps to a larger group of borrowers,
from applying only to borrowers earning less than $20,000 a year,
to those earning less than $30,000 a year. This will apply to both
secured and unsecured loans. In other words, for borrowers earning
less than $30,000 a year, the interest rate for secured loans that
moneylenders can charge will be capped at 13% EIR and for unsecured
loans, it will be capped at 20% EIR. Borrowers earning $30,000 or
more a year generally qualify for credit facilities from banks,
such as credit card facilities, and are not dependent solely on
moneylenders for credit. Thus, we have decided not to introduce any
interest rate caps for them for now.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-475a16d5-dc38-4384-a582-e85e04f9bbc9">

interest rate caps in 2009, our consideration was that by allowing
market forces to freely determine interest rates, there would be
greater access to credit. This is because the credit profile of
some borrowers would make it unattractive for moneylenders to lend
to them, if the interest rates are capped and moneylenders cannot
charge an interest commensurate with the credit risk. Such borrowers
might then turn to loan sharks, putting themselves at risk, and
contributing to an increase in unlicensed moneylending activities. </p>

a key concern for my Ministry. Nevertheless, after reviewing the
developments in the industry, we have decided to extend the coverage
of the interest rate caps to a larger group of lower income borrowers.
We are conscious that in doing so, there may now be some borrowers
to whom licensed moneylenders may not be willing to lend at the
regulated rates. So this move, which ultimately is a judgement call, is
not without its trade-offs. </p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cc750105-c2cb-4245-9dba-8718eefc46ce">

framework, there are people who turn to unlicensed moneylenders,
because they cannot borrow from legitimate ones. We need to be mindful
that we do not drive more and more people to unlicensed moneylenders.
We need to try and
give protection to borrowers, without creating a situation where borrowers
cannot access credit from licensed moneylenders. This is the balance
which we have been trying to fine tune, and will continue to monitor,
to help borrowers, in a way which is practical and feasible.</p>

the charging of three fees currently permitted under the Rules,
namely, for acceptance of the loan application, for acceptance or
renewal of a revolving credit loan and for any payment not through
electronic funds transfer. These fees are typically charged up-front
by moneylenders. These fees make the cost of borrowing less transparent
and make it harder for borrowers to compare loan packages. These
fees also increase borrowing costs.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-37bd6f0b-8390-458e-80bc-27a7f2b4b39c">

fees, there are six conditional fees permitted under the Rules. These
fees can be charged only if certain conditions arise, for example,
upon borrowers breaching or varying the loan contract. These will
continue to be permitted. </p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-318c1240-1091-4227-9414-2f38cda470f3">

all exceptions to the limits on the amount of unsecured loans that
a borrower can obtain. The limits to loan quantum serve to prevent
excessive borrowing. However, these exceptions allow individuals
to borrow more than the loan quantum caps stipulated in the Moneylenders
Rules. For example, borrowers with an annual income of $20,000 or
less are not allowed to take unsecured loans of more than $3,000.
However, the exceptions have allowed such borrowers to borrow more
than $3,000, when they borrow for purposes, such as business or
renovation. The exceptions also allow moneylenders to impose interest
rates beyond the stipulated interest rate caps. These exceptions
can lead to borrowers taking on excessive debt. As such, we are disallowing
these exceptions.</p>

to the Rules have been approved, but will take effect only on 1
June 2012, to give the industry sufficient time to adjust to the
changes. </p>

with the House that my Ministry has recently set up an Advisory
Committee on Moneylending Issues (ACMI), which I am chairing. The inaugural
meeting was held last month. The committee comprises representatives

Singapore, One Hope Centre and The Silver Lining Community Services.
One Hope Centre and The Silver Lining both provide counselling and
rehabilitation services for people with gambling and debt problems,
and their involvement in the committee will give us insights into providing
safeguards against excessive debt. The Committee has two grassroots advisors
as members, as well as representatives from MHA, MCYS and MAS. ACMI

industry firmly but fairly. We will continue to keep a close watch,
and will recalibrate the regulatory framework whenever necessary.

Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>
                     </span>: Thank you, Sir.
I support all the four regulatory changes announced by the Senior
Parliamentary Secretary. I also support the suggested enhancement
to the enforcement processes with added appointed staff, with the
auxiliary police being authorised to carry out inspections. I hope
with this we can have more frequent and more regular checks. However,
I would like to clarify the following:</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ff168a98-6c92-4834-8056-6facd723befe">

these additional persons will not be allowed to seize, remove or take
any documents and equipment from the premises, then in the event
when these are required to be carried out, who and how will it be
done? Do these additional persons then have to call the designated
officers to come to do it? Will there be delays? My concern is that
in the event that this happens and if it needs to be done urgently,
and we certainly cannot deny the possibility, especially in this
industry, can these persons be given approval under special circumstances
to carry this out? </p>

positive developments and the effects of the measures implemented
since we last had an amendment to this Bill? Currently, there is
still a widespread need to educate our populace on recognition and
awareness in order to safeguard them from getting involved in illegal
and unlicensed moneylending activities. I have personally come across
people who have been cheated by their own family members in relation
to unlicensed moneylending activities. This is really a sad situation. Perhaps,
this can be included in the public education that the authorities
are going to carry out.</p>

also reports of housing agents involved in moneylending schemes.
How are we working with the Council for Estate Agencies on this
matter? What about moneylenders who advertise using SMSes? What
is the Ministry's stand on this? And what is the best way for the
public to handle this if they get caught in a situation? Can we
also have an update on the recently introduced testing used to assess
eligibility and the understanding of moneylenders? Can the Ministry
share with us the numbers that have applied, the numbers tested,
the numbers passed, and also if the test is available in different
languages?</p>

Assoc Prof Fatimah for speaking in support of the Bill. Let me address
her queries and concerns. First, she asked if there could be delays
in inspection of moneylenders since those persons authorised by
the Registrar to assist in inspections will not be allowed to exercise
powers of seizure and removal.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-743029b7-004b-4019-9878-98d059ef9b74">

that our intention is for these persons such as auxiliary police
to be deployed together with the Registry officers during inspections.
Where there is a necessity to seize and remove documents and equipment
from the premises, the Registry officers will do so there and then.
The auxiliary police officers will assist in other aspects of inspection
for which they have the powers. These are to: inspect the premise where
a moneylender is carrying on his business and the documents kept
there, require the moneylender or any other person to furnish any
documents, copy any documents inspected and take photographs or

about the need for educating the population on moneylending and
this is something that we agree very much with her. The Registry
of Moneylenders has developed a Borrower's Guide which is available
in both English and Chinese to educate borrowers on what to look
out for when getting a loan from moneylenders. This is available
on the Registry's website. The moneylenders are also required to
display these at their premises. We will be doing more this year
as part of the implementation of the new measures to reach out and
educate borrowers. In fact, this is one of the reasons why we have
set up the Advisory Committee on Moneylending issues which I have
talked about earlier.</p>

MinLaw on public engagement and outreach efforts to educate borrowers
on areas such as the "dos and don'ts" of borrowing from licensed moneylenders,
the safeguards under the moneylending regulations that protect borrowers
and how to distinguish between a licensed moneylender and an unlicensed moneylender.</p>

asked about estate agent's roles in referring clients to moneylenders.
I understand, Sir, that the Estate Agent's Act disallows estate
agents from referring their clients to moneylenders. So, this is
disallowed.</p>

also raised some problems that moneylenders could face with errant
borrowers. I wish to say here that they do have recourse against
errant borrowers under general criminal law and contract law. For
example, if a borrower threatens or cheats the moneylender, the
moneylender can report the matter to the police. </p>

borrower defaults on repayment, the moneylender can take legal action
against the borrower to recover the sums. As for potential borrowers presenting
fake credentials like banks and other financial institutions, moneylenders must
take their own measures to adequately and appropriately assess the
borrower.</p>

for an update on the moneylender's written test, since its implementation
on 1 June 2011, Sir, the Registry has conducted more than 300 tests.
The passing rate is less than 50%. As for whether the test is available
in multiple languages, I would like to mention here that the test
is conducted in English only because it is the subject matter of
the test, namely, the statutory requirements on moneylenders as
set out in the Moneylender's Act and the rules are published in English.</p>

the key points that have been raised by Assoc Prof Fatimah and I

                     <strong class="ph b">The Leader of the House (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, before I move for Parliament to adjourn, let me use
this occasion on behalf of all Members in this House to thank you
and your Deputies for chairing the Budget debate and Committee of Supply.
There were many significant firsts in this year's proceedings.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f7550b5d-6871-4691-8bc8-95d4bb9cb172">
                  <a name="budget__id-f7550b5d-6871-4691-8bc8-95d4bb9cb172"><!--a--></a>It was the first Budget
and COS of the Twelfth Parliament after the 2011 GE. And for new
members, their birthing encounter with the legislative process.
We have 37 new Members – 26 newly elected, three new NCMPs, eight
new NMPs. For the NMPs, they were literally thrown into the deep
end because they were sworn in only three days before Budget Day
on 17 February 2012. I think they did not drown. They are still swimming
well.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-afa97c4f-b959-4932-ac7a-1a72b874b892">
                  <a name="budget__id-afa97c4f-b959-4932-ac7a-1a72b874b892"><!--a--></a>Another significant first,
the largest Parliament since Independence, we have 98 Members compared
to 94 Members last year. As a result, we had more speakers during the
Budget debate and more cuts filed for the Committee of Supply (COS).
Four hundred and fifty-three cuts were filed, compared to 411 last
year, 405 the year before and 374 in 2009. We therefore had to sit
longer compared to previous years – same number of days – six-and-a-half
days for COS but with an additional hour-and-a-half at eight-and-a-half hours
daily.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4ffdce37-dacf-4f78-a45f-c2ad2cfec6b5">
                  <a name="budget__id-4ffdce37-dacf-4f78-a45f-c2ad2cfec6b5"><!--a--></a>The Budget debate and
COS sessions witnessed articulate and passionate arguments and advocacy,
and a healthy dose of verbal sparring. The issues discussed spanned
all Ministries and affected all aspects of the lives of our people.
There were practical questions: who have we left out? How can we
serve better? How can programmes be improved? And philosophical questions:
what kind of Singapore do we want? With issues relating to social
capital, maids' day off, help for the less fortunate and the disabled,
and promoting and preserving our arts, culture and heritage and
so on and so forth. Whether practical or philosophical, the main
theme of an inclusive society featured large in this Budget and
COS.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2516</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5c0c7c55-fe56-497f-bbe0-2b8429224d9f">
                  <a name="budget__id-5c0c7c55-fe56-497f-bbe0-2b8429224d9f"><!--a--></a>We were united in the
aim to get as many Singaporeans on board the ship of progress but
as our debate wore on, we realised that inclusiveness must first
mean building a robust and sea-worthy vessel, with strong engines
of growth, lest we imperil all on board if we either overload it
or if it capsizes in rough weather.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f87f093a-ccba-49eb-ad9c-d6328cb98fc1">
                  <a name="budget__id-f87f093a-ccba-49eb-ad9c-d6328cb98fc1"><!--a--></a>Members of Parliament
pointed out that, indeed, this is now happening to the EU countries,
UK and USA who are struggling with huge debts. Members rightly observed too
that Singapore was, indeed, fortunate in comparison. Both Ministers
and Members of Parliament reminded us that this virtuous state was
because we have always sought to spend within our means. Long may
we keep this state of affairs! </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-57d22af0-d404-4f22-bcef-84a74b8545de">
                  <a name="budget__id-57d22af0-d404-4f22-bcef-84a74b8545de"><!--a--></a>This House too debated
inherent trade-offs, reflecting maturity and intellectual honesty.
Two examples come to mind. One was on the impact of reducing our dependence
on foreign workers and its effects on wages and cost of living and competitiveness.
Second, as we include more into the social nets, the rising cost
of coverage. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-77c0f7ea-52d0-4e5c-95ae-c1d2553b750c">
                  <a name="budget__id-77c0f7ea-52d0-4e5c-95ae-c1d2553b750c"><!--a--></a>In the end, the Budget
was supported and the Supply Bills approved. But of course, this
is the beginning and not the end. The real work for this fiscal
year begins for Government and us as Members to ensure that the
full benefits of these programmes reach out to our residents. All
in all, we had good sessions and outcomes. Where could we do better? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6f9d6018-610c-4a17-85a5-f110d89e491d">
                  <a name="budget__id-6f9d6018-610c-4a17-85a5-f110d89e491d"><!--a--></a>The importance of improving
productivity was a recurrent theme and, I think, one that applies
to this House too. For both front and back benches, let us aspire:
Speak less, Impact more. Focus more on substantive issues, debate
core policies rather than numerous cuts and agenda items for each
Ministry. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6b30172e-0673-4332-b179-bdf3051f130f">
                  <a name="budget__id-6b30172e-0673-4332-b179-bdf3051f130f"><!--a--></a>Some Members were more
effective than others, but let us all continue to strive to "upgrade
our skills". I thank all Members for observing the decorum and dignity
of this House. I also congratulate all first-term Members, who spoke
cogently and acquitted themselves well as representatives of their
voters. There was another significant first, but on a regrettable
note. We entered into Budget debate with one less Member, who was
expelled from his Party. This was again the first ever in our Parliamentary
history. I think I speak on behalf of the House, with the wish that
such occurrences should remain few and far between. This episode
also reminds us each to uphold high standards of integrity and honesty
for this office that we have been appointed and for all political parties
to maintain high standards for their candidates.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b4983764-b229-4a58-aa65-09138f131444">
                  <a name="budget__id-b4983764-b229-4a58-aa65-09138f131444"><!--a--></a>Finally, I thank the Speaker,
Deputies and staff of Parliament for their assistance. Thanks also
to the Whip for his gentle reminders and mild lashings. Speaker,
you and your Deputies presided over long and sometimes arduous sessions
but always with a keen eye and steady, impartial hand that guided
each session to a smooth and productive
conclusion. When the guillotine fell, the execution was generally
deserving and I could hear a faint applause.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 2517</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1d67b13a-36cb-4ff5-a9f2-4351c974342f">
                  <a name="budget__id-1d67b13a-36cb-4ff5-a9f2-4351c974342f"><!--a--></a>Easily forgotten here
was another significant first. It was the Speaker's first Budget too.
Sir, your sustained attentiveness during the session is an admirable
quality. I have a confession to make. There were rare occasions
when, for myself, my mind did wander during the very few speeches
that were less than enthralling. I could only count one or two moments,
at the most. But in the spirit of full transparency, my confession
ought to go further. In one of those rare moments, I imagined you
as a poster boy in an advertisement holding up an energy drink related
to a specific, chromatic and bovine persuasion. If you want a clue,
it is closer to the green blue spectrum. The drink is marketed for
its effects for inducing wakefulness. I am contrite and I promise
that I will dispel these images if they ever come into my mind again.
Whatever your secret, this House is grateful and thank you for so
ably presiding over the sessions. We look forward to your continued
presence in that Chair.</p>

                  </span>: I would like
to thank the Leader of the House for his kind words and I assure
him that I would not be posing with any energy drink, whether green,
red or blue.</p>

marks the conclusion of the debate on the Budget Statement and COS
for 2012. With your cooperation, we have managed to end the debate,
I think in quite good time. Indeed, as the Leader has highlighted,
it was the first Budget of the Twelfth Parliament and it set a positive
tone. It maps out this Government's initiatives to prepare our country
for the many challenges that lie ahead. These include the need to
restructure our economy and to prepare for an ageing population.
I am heartened that the Budget contains measures to strengthen our
social support and inclusiveness for all Singaporeans and, especially,
those that are less advantaged, from entrenching various rebates
through GST Vouchers to enhancing the means by which our seniors
can remain active, healthy and employed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-21b80864-5653-4c15-a761-ff64af1a459f">
                  <a name="budget__id-21b80864-5653-4c15-a761-ff64af1a459f"><!--a--></a>On the whole, the debate
was lively and the speeches were thoughtful and of high calibre
– and, indeed, that had kept me so attentive. The exchanges between
the front and back benches were robust. More importantly, the exchanges
reflected the level of seriousness and commitment with which Members
regarded their obligation to scrutinise the many different facets
of this year's Budget. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-23c362b4-99d8-4a4e-8719-ed2b59d5748e">
                  <a name="budget__id-23c362b4-99d8-4a4e-8719-ed2b59d5748e"><!--a--></a>Most Members kept to their
allotted time for their speeches, while a few pushed the boundaries,
which may be forgiven in view of the gravity of the issues being
debated. However, some of the clarifications expressed were not
as productive as they could have been and could have been more succinct.
At times, I felt that the clarifications of some Members were almost
addendums to their speeches, rather than concise questions aimed
at eliciting further and better particulars. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cdafc530-a06d-40c5-b2b6-116c4d854cb4">
                  <a name="budget__id-cdafc530-a06d-40c5-b2b6-116c4d854cb4"><!--a--></a>I was glad to see that
several Members made use of the new direct VGA plug-in for their
notebooks or iPads to display slides during their speeches. I felt
that this enabled Members to illustrate their speeches with greater
clarity, and it is also an environmentally friendly alternative
to paper handouts. Should Members be minded to use video presentations,
I would ask them to keep in mind that one of the primary purposes
of their presence in this House is to advocate and articulate their
views and those of their constituents. Hence, video presentations
should be used judiciously and sparingly, lest they usurp this function.</p>

the Leader of the House and the Whip, and their respective Deputies,

I also thank my two very capable Deputy Speakers, Mr Charles Chong

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>
                  </span>: The shining
of laser lights at aircraft can be hazardous to aircraft operations.
The lights can confuse, distract or cause discomfort to pilots.
In more severe cases, powerful lasers that are directed at the subject's
eyes could cause temporary flash blindness, and even eye injuries
leading to incapacitation. These effects are significant hazards
to flight operations especially during the critical phases of flight,
that is, during take-off and landing. The International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) therefore recommends that the use of lasers
should be restricted around an airport. </p>

                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-5f70290e-c159-48de-978b-7e18d2085efe"><!--a--></a>As inexpensive, high-powered
laser pointers become more widely available, the number of reports
by pilots on incidents of laser lights being directed at aircraft
has increased. In Singapore, there were five incidents reported
in 2009, 10 in 2010, and 24 in 2011. The increase in such incidents
in Singapore is consistent with the upward trends reported in other
countries, such as the US and the UK.</p>

of activities which may affect the safety of aircraft and the travelling
public. Under the Singapore Air Navigation Order, pointing a laser
light or any other form of light whose glare may endanger an aircraft
operation is an offence. Any person convicted of such an offence
could be liable for a fine of up to S$20,000; or in the case of
a subsequent conviction, a fine of S$40,000 and/or imprisonment
of up to 15 months. </p>

shining of dangerous lights at aircraft, the Civil Aviation Authority
of Singapore (CAAS) will convey the report to the Singapore Police
Force (SPF). While the SPF will investigate the matter upon receiving
the report, SPF patrol units on the ground face difficulties in
apprehending perpetrators as it is difficult for pilots to pin-point
the exact location of the laser beam source. Moreover, high-powered laser
pointers can be easily hidden from sight. For these reasons, there
have been no arrests for this offence thus far. Nevertheless, I
would like to assure the House that CAAS is working closely with
SPF to explore ways of building up the policing and enforcement capabilities
on this front. </p>

role to play in minimising incidents that will endanger aircraft operations.
We will step up public education efforts to raise awareness among
the public of the risks that shining of laser lights pose to aircraft
safety. In addition to acting responsibly, the public can also help
to alert the relevant authorities or stop such mischief if they
come across such incidents. </p>
