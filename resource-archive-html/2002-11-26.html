<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>MEDISAVE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use for angioplasty procedure)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a) the rationale for disallowing the use of Medisave  to

pay  for  the costs of inserting stents in an angioplasty

procedure  when  Medisave can be used for  other  charges

related  to  this  procedure and (b)  will  his  Ministry

review this policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to clarify that Medisave can be used

to  pay for stents in an angioplasty procedure.  Surgical

implants,  including  stents, are eligible  for  Medisave

claims as part of the total hospital bill, subject to the

daily  withdrawal limit of $300.  Implants  can  also  be

claimed  under MediShield and Medisave-approved insurance

schemes,  where the maximum amount claimable ranges  from

$1,500  to  $3,500, in addition to other claims  such  as

room   and   board  and  surgery  procedures.   Together,

Medisave  and MediShield can cover more than 80%  of  the

average  B2  patient  bill  for  a  coronary  angioplasty

procedure involving stent implants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health, however, recognises that the

costs  of  implants vary considerably, depending  on  the

type  of  medical  condition  treated.   Therefore,   the

current Medisave withdrawal limits and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



MediShield claimable limits may not fully cater  for  the

wide  range  in  costs between treatments  for  different

medical conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this, the Ministry will reset the

Medisave   withdrawal  limits  and  MediShield  Claimable

limits for inpatient and day surgery cases to be based on

Diagnosis-Related-Groups (DRGs)  next  year.   This  will

better   reflect  the  resources  needed  to  treat   the

different medical conditions, and will allow patients  to

withdraw  or claim more from Medisave or MediShield,  for

medical conditions that are on the average more expensive

to   treat.   Under  this  new  structure,  Medisave  and

MediShield  would be able to fully cover  the  bills  for

most  subsidised patients undergoing coronary angioplasty

procedures  with  stent implants.  The price  of  medical

technology  like  stents  can vary  greatly  and  equally

effective   stents   can   be   priced   differently   by

manufacturers.   If  a  patient wants  a  more  expensive

stent,  Medisave and MediShield will not fully cover  the

patient's bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

ask  the  Minister whether the stent insertion  procedure

that  can  be  done  in a day surgery be  applicable  for

Medisave application as well?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The answer is yes.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> I would like to ask the

Minister  whether the review, where the payment  will  be

based  on  diagnosis-related  illnesses,  will  still  be

subject  to  a  maximum claim amount.  The  Minister  did

mention  that  the  costs  of the  stents  vary.   To  my

knowledge,  very often, the patient does not have  enough

understanding to know what the cost of the best  kind  of

stent  that is necessary for an angioplasty procedure  is

and, therefore, would take advice from the doctors.   So,

the cost of the procedure and the stent is something that

is  very  much  not within the control  of  the  patient.

Could the Minister therefore consider that point as well?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

has raised three related issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue, as I explained, is the way we

structure the withdrawal limits of the claims.  Today, it

is  a  very  blunt instrument where we have  a  table  of

operations with seven categories.  When we change over to

the  DRGs  next  year,  this will be  a  more  responsive

system, with over 600 categories.  So, the claims will be

more related to the type of medical treatment undertaken.

But that alone will not solve the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is what is the withdrawal limit

that  we allow.  As long as we have Medisave, which is  a

compulsory  savings scheme, it cannot be a  free-for-all.

So,  the  Ministry will continue to set some  kind  of  a

maximum, because the whole idea of Medisave is to be able

to   provide  savings  for  the  future  medical   needs,

especially when one grows old.  So, we cannot allow  free

use  of  the  Medisave.  There will continue to  be  some

limits.  Of course, we will review these limits regularly

to make sure they keep up with the medical technology and

changes in medical procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue is how do we address very expensive

medical devices and medical technology.  What we have  in

the  Ministry of Health is a procedure by which we review

what  are considered standard treatment, standard devices

and  standard drugs.  These will be subsidised and  these

are  the kinds of things for which we will allow Medisave

to be withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical technology changes very rapidly, and there

will be non-standard procedures, non-standard devices and

non-standard  drugs.   So, how do we  address  this?   We

could  take a very strict approach and say, "If they  are

non-standard, they will not be allowed in our  hospitals.

If  you  want,  you  will  have  to  go  to  the  private

hospitals."  Or we could take a more liberal approach and

offer  the patient some choice, eg, "This is the standard

that   we   will   subsidise  and  will  allow   Medisave

withdrawals, but if you want a non-standard drug or non-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



standard device, then you will have to pay the full  cost

of  that", in which case, we must make sure that there is

proper   financial  counselling  and  that  the   patient

understands  what  he  is in for.  On  the  ground,  with

thousands of such operations, there could be lapses,  and

there  will  be  the kind of cases that the  hon.  Member

raised, ie, where the patient may not understand that  by

selecting  a  particular stent, he is  selecting  a  very

expensive  one that costs $6,000 and, later on,  when  he

has  to  pay for it in cash, he then finds that he cannot

afford it.  This is the kind of issue we have to address.

We  are reviewing this and we will lay out the parameters

sometime next year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether it is

correct to say that the stent insertion procedure is used

to   treat   ischemic   heart  disease   and   myocardial

infarction,   and  these  two  conditions  caused   3,243

Singaporeans  to  die last year, and the  second  highest

incidents of deaths in Singapore?  In view of this  fact,

will  his Ministry prioritise and allow patients to  have

full claim from Medisave or even subsidised for such life-saving procedures?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Stent is almost used as a

standard device nowadays, and if you are admitted as a B2

patient  and the average stay perhaps is four  days,  the

average  B2 patient bill for such a procedure is  $4,600.

The  total amount that can be withdrawn from Medisave and

MediShield  is  about $4,000 or 86%.   So,  you  pay  the

balance  in  cash.   If you go for a  standard  procedure

involving  standard stents, our current rules  allow  the

withdrawal which is about 86%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arises when the patient chooses a top-of-the-market stent which costs $6,000, as is the case which

I  understood from Mdm Halimah.  In that case, he had two

stents, which cost $12,000.  This is obviously way beyond

the  Medisave  limit.   This is a non-standard  procedure

and,  therefore,  he was asked to pay cash.   How  do  we

address this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said in my answer, we could say that such

things are not allowed in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



restructured  hospitals.  If somebody  wants  to  go  for

these  top-of-the-range stents, then  please  go  to  the

private  hospitals.  We will then not have such  problems

in  the  restructured hospitals.  Or we can take  a  more

liberal  approach  and say, "These are non-standard.   If

you  want  them,  please be sure you know  the  financial

repercussions",  and  we  make  sure  we  have  financial

counselling.  But I can assure Members that  out  of  the

1,000  cases, there will be lapses or claims  of  lapses,

and we will face these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is something that we will have to review

and  we  will decide next year whether or not we  take  a

more stringent approach or we still allow this choice  in

our restructured hospitals.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Am I correct to say that the stent

insertion  procedure  can  be  done  as  a  day  surgery,

therefore, saving patients hospitalisation costs  and  is

also  a  good way of reducing hospitals' operating costs?

Will  the  Minister prioritise or encourage  patients  to

have the stent procedure done as a day surgery?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am no doctor.

I  leave this to the professionals.  If the professionals

feel that in a particular condition stents can be done in

a  day  surgery,  we encourage them to do  so  in  a  day

surgery.   If  the professionals say that this  is  safer

done  in an in-patient setting, then we will do it in  an

in-patient setting.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

what  the Minister is saying.  I hope that in the  review

the  Minister  would  also take into  consideration  this

point that while the Government wants to try and persuade

people  to be prudent in the management of their hospital

bills ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Mdm Halimah?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> My question is: would the

Minister  also take into account in the review the  point

that  when  someone has enough Medisave  savings  and  he

wants  to  use  it for a stent and angioplasty  procedure

which  is  expensive and he thinks that it is useful  for

him, then

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



he  should be given some flexibility to take care of  his

own interests, although I understand the basic premise of

some of the principles there?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> On the use of Medisave, we have

to  be  very  clear.  There has to be some restraint  and

discipline  and,  therefore, there will be  some  maximum

withdrawal limits imposed.  I am not prepared to say that

everybody is allowed to use his Medisave in whatever  way

he  likes.  We can use our cash in whatever way  we  like

but, for Medisave, its purpose is forced savings intended

to last us a lifetime and, therefore, it cannot be a free-for-all.  Whether or not we allow you to spend your  cash

freely  in  the restructured hospitals, that is something

that  we  want to consider.  Even if it is your cash,  we

may  not  allow you to spend freely in the hospital.   We

may  say, "If you want to spend your cash freely  in  the

hospital, please go to the private hospitals."   This  is

something that we are considering.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister  has  missed my point.  My point really  is  not

that  we  should  encourage people to  use  the  Medisave

flexibly   and  freely,  but  that  for  life-threatening

procedures,  such as angioplasty, there  should  be  some

flexibility  to  let the individual  decide,  if  he  has

enough  Medisave savings that he wants to  use  for  that

purpose, without too much restriction on the use, ie, for

life-saving  procedures, not just any frivolous  kind  of

procedures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained in my answer,

we  have a team of cardiac surgeons and cardiologists who

regularly  reviews these procedures and makes  sure  that

our  list  of  standard procedures covers all  the  cost-effective procedures that we want to subvent and that  we

allow  Medisave  to  be  used for.   The  problem  arises

because there are claims by manufacturers that if you use

this  latest stent, it will give you additional benefits.

But  this is not assessed by our team of experts to be  a

cost-effective  procedure that we want to  include  under

our Medisave list based

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



on  proper  evidence, but it is available on the  market.

So, do we allow this choice, or do we say, "If you go  to

a  restructured  hospital, we will only  do  those  cases

which  are  recommended  and  assessed  by  our  team  of

experts"?

(ii) consider banning those below 18 years from tattooing

themselves unless they have parental consent  as  is  the

practice in some countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, tattoo

practitioners  do  not  come under  the  purview  of  the

Ministry   of   Health,   as   they   are   not   medical

practitioners.  Services provided by these practitioners,

which  are non-medical, are therefore not required to  be

licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical  Clinics

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, if they carry out practices or

procedures  that  are considered medical treatments,  ie,

they  use  harmful  medical products  or  they  prescribe

poisons  or controlled drugs, or use unlicensed equipment

such  as lasers, then they will be in contravention of  a

number of legislation.  The Ministry of Health will  then

investigate  into  these  tattoo practitioners,  if  they

contravened any of these acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tattooing procedures carry the risk of transmitting

blood-borne  diseases, like Hepatitis B, C and  HIV.   If

sterilised needles and other hygiene measures  are  used,

of course, the risk of infection is small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations into all the notified cases of blood-borne diseases in Singapore, including HIV, have

indicated that none of these reported cases from 1985  to

date   have   acquired  the  infection   from   tattooing

procedures in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Infectious Diseases Act, the Ministry of

Health has the power to prohibit any person from carrying

out  any  occupation,  trade or  business  if  these  are

conducted  in  such a manner as is likely  to  cause  the

spread  of  any  infectious diseases.  If  there  is  any

evidence that the practice at any establishment is likely

to have caused the spread of an infectious disease, these

establishments can be closed down under this Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health so far has also put in place

health   education  programmes  mainly   through   health

education  pamphlets, etc, to advise the  public  on  the

prevention of transmission of infectious diseases  during

tattooing.  This is to ensure that the public  will  take

the  necessary  precautions to  minimise  the  chance  of

infection. However, the best precaution is not to undergo

a tattooing itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point we feel that it is not necessary to

regulate  tattooing, nor require those below  18  to  get

parental  consent.  However, we will continue to  monitor

the practice and we will review the situation regularly.

<div align="center"><b>LITERATURE AS A COMPULSORY SUBJECT IN SCHOOLS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Education  based on the merits of Literature as  endorsed

by  the Ministry and the Economic Review Committee, if he

will  (i) consider making Literature a compulsory subject

for all students at the upper primary and lower secondary

school  levels  using  a range of  books  to  manage  the

different  linguistic  abilities of  children;  and  (ii)

introduce  a  compulsory module  of  Literature  for  all

polytechnic   students  to  give  them   an   all-rounded

education.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, currently, all lower secondary students  in

the  Express and Normal (Academic) courses already  study

Literature.   Normal (Technical) students  do  not  study

literature as their curriculum is focused on giving  them

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



literacy  and  numeracy skills as well as a  technically-oriented  foundation  to  enable  them  to  benefit  from

further  education  and  training  at  an  Institute   of

Technical  Education  (ITE)  after  10  years  of  formal

schooling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the primary level, the use of language for

literary response and expression is taught as part of the

English  Language  programme.  An integral  part  of  the

syllabus  is the students' exposure to a wide variety  of

texts  appropriate to their needs.  This means  that  our

students  would have adequate opportunities to  read  and

see  how  language  is used in various  texts,  including

narratives,  and  to  arrive at conclusions  about  story

lines, events and characters.  While literature is not  a

subject in the upper primary curriculum, our children are

encouraged  to read and such programmes are pervasive  in

our   primary   schools  and  are  often   conducted   in

conjunction  with our partners in education such  as  the

National Library Board and parent volunteers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the introduction of Literature into the

polytechnic   curriculum  as  a  compulsory   polytechnic

curriculum, our polytechnics are geared towards providing

a  curriculum that prepares their students for employment

opportunities in industry. Their curriculum is constantly

reviewed  and  customised  to meet  the  requirements  of

industry.  Besides this focus, the polytechnics do  offer

a  balanced  and well-rounded education.   This  is  done

through including subject modules in the curriculum  that

provide  their students with a creative outlook  and  the

ability to exercise and apply critical thinking in  their

work.   In  addition, students are exposed to  programmes

that  promote  national education and community  service.

They  also  participate in co-curricular activities,  for

example,  in sports and the arts.  There would  therefore

not  be  a  need  for MOE to require the polytechnics  to

introduce Literature as a compulsory subject in order  to

provide  students in the polytechnics with a well-rounded

education.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Could I

ask the Minister how then can we enhance or deepen this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



reading  habit especially among the polytechnic  students

and  upper  primary  students  because  there  have  been

reports  that  the standards of ability to  converse  and

dwell and discuss in English are getting lower?  What are

the efforts we can take on then?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

I  disagree  with  the Member that our  English  Language

standards are getting lower.  I think if you look at  the

usage  of English Language in Singapore and you  look  at

the  top 5% of English speakers and you compare them with

the  top 5% of the population 20 years ago, I think  they

are  comparable.   If  you  go  down  to  15-20%  of  the

population,  they  are  speaking  English   today.    But

probably  when  you  get  down  to  about  20%   of   the

population, they were not speaking English 20 years  ago.

If  you  get  down  to  50% of the population,  they  are

speaking English today, not perfect English, not the  way

the Member speaks English or the Member would like others

to   speak   English,  but  they  are  speaking  English.

Therefore, the English that we hear today, because it  is

being  spoken  by a much wider spectrum of  Singaporeans,

who  might never have spoken English before, on  average,

may  be  lower.   But the English level in  Singapore,  I

think, is indeed higher than it was 20 years ago.   So  I

disagree with the premise of the Member's question.

<div align="center"><b>(Translation of documents)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Zainudin Nordin</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Community  Development and Sports and  Minister-in-charge

of  Muslim Affairs (a) what is the number of requests for

translation of documents and rulings of the Syariah Court

from  Malay to English; (b) is there an increasing number

in  such request; (c) does his Ministry find it necessary

for  future written documents and rulings of the  Syariah

Court to be given in both Malay and English.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Syariah Court

started    issuing    its   summonses,   correspondences,

documents, decrees and orders in English in August  1999.

Prior to that, such documents were issued in Malay.   The

switch  was made for the benefit of divorcees who  needed

to submit the documents for various applications to other

Government  agencies such as the CPF  Board,  Immigration

and  HDB.  Before the switch, divorcees had to go to  the

Supreme  Court to translate the documents from  Malay  to

English for a fee.  This meant that such families had  to

incur  additional costs, suffer inconvenience and  delay.

The present arrangement serves the interests of divorcees

better.   It  saves  them time and they  need  not  incur

additional costs for translations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although important documents such as Court orders

are  printed in English, the proceedings of the Court are

always conducted in either Malay or English, depending on

what  the  divorcees themselves are conversant in.   Very

often,  simultaneous interpreters for Tamil,  English  or

other  languages are used to assist parties  who  do  not

understand  Malay or English.  In cases  where  there  is

more than one language chosen, the Court will conduct the

proceedings  in  either language and an interpreter  will

simultaneously interpret into the other language.   These

interpreters are engaged at the Court's expense, and  not

by the divorcees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divorcees will thus understand the proceedings,

the  testimonies and examinations that  go  on  in  their

presence  in  court.  Subsequently, the orders  that  are

pronounced by the Court in their presence will be in  the

language  that they have chosen.  For example,  in  cases

where  the  divorcees  do  not  understand  English,  but

understand  Malay, the Court will conduct the proceedings

in  Malay  and will pronounce its decrees and  orders  in

Malay,  whilst the written document reflecting this  will

be in English.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN MAID LEVY</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower whether the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



Ministry plans to increase the foreign maid levy and,  if

so,   whether   the   Ministry   has   considered   other

alternatives other than just increasing the levy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government announced in May this year that the moratorium

on  all  foreign worker levies, of which foreign domestic

workers fall under this category, would be extended until

December  2002.   We  will announce the  outcome  of  the

review on the foreign worker levy in early December.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Could the

Minister  of  State give working women  in  Singapore  an

assurance  that there are real and adequate  alternatives

in  the  form of local domestic and nanny or  child  care

services  available before any increases in foreign  maid

levy are decided upon?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to give that

assurance means that you will have to answer a number  of

needs.   I  think  we would have painted ourselves  in  a

corner  if we had worked on that principle.  Yes,  it  is

difficult to raise families when you want to juggle  that

with  your  work  commitments.   Yes,  it  is  also  more

expensive  to  hire local help.  But we have  to  balance

this  with  the  increasing number  of  foreign  domestic

workers  that we have already seen.  From the  moratorium

last  time,  the number of maids has increased  by  about

20%,  so  much so that one in eight households  currently

have   a  foreign  domestic  worker.   There  are  social

repercussions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can do is to continue to provide and expand

domestic  service  as affordable alternatives  for  local

households.  For  example, the CDCs, in  particular,  the

Southeast CDC has piloted training emplacement programmes

for  various domestic services.  These include  cleaning,

laundry,  child  care or eldercare.  In line  with  these

efforts,  we  will  need to maintain a  FDW  levy  at  an

appropriate level to moderate household demand for  FDWs.

But   whether   this  would  satisfy  the   majority   of

households,  and  whether this  would  be  an  attractive

option remains to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>



be  seen and is relative.  But we will continue to expand

these efforts so that there are these alternatives.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

1999, we imposed a moratorium on the increase in the  FDW

levy  because  of the uncertain economic climate.   Would

the Minister of State agree that the economic climate  is

still uncertain and likely to be uncertain next year and,

therefore,  all  the more reasons to  continue  with  the

moratorium on any increase?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I agree with the hon. Member that

the economic conditions are uncertain.  But the other arm

of the planning parameter was the rate of increase in the

number  of  foreign  domestic  workers  and  despite  the

moratorium  that has increased out of proportion  to  the

households.  As I have said, the moratorium continues  to

stand  and when we do review the levy, we will take  into

consideration these factors and decide then whether there

should be an increase of the levy or not.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> As the Minister of State has

observed, the number of foreign workers has continued  to

rise  despite the levies.  Would it not seem  obvious  by

now,  after so many years of experience that we have had,

that the answer must be in something other than the levy?

Would  it  not be a better approach therefore to  analyse

and permit families to have foreign workers based on need

rather  than by increasing the levy to an extent that  it

becomes unaffordable?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to decide between

one  family  and  another based on need is  an  extremely

difficult  exercise  and  for society,  I  would  say  an

invidious one.  How would I judge, for example, whether a

family  with  a diabetic mother of a blood sugar  of  400

requires less of a foreign domestic worker versus another

family  who  has three children and is making ends  meet?

Do  I then train my officers to cater to each individual,

assessing their needs?  And upon pronouncement,  would  I

have  one  happy family versus the other 10 families  who

have applied based on need who go away

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



angry  at the system?  I think, based on a quota  system,

and  to decide whether one family gets a foreign domestic

worker   based  on  another  is  an  extremely  difficult

exercise.  The  levy  is not a perfect  solution.   Other

countries  have tried other means. We will explore  these

means  but I think it will be hard to run away  from  the

conclusion or to arrive at the wrong conclusion that  the

levies do not work.  The levies do moderate demand.   But

we  will take into account these considerations and  also

the  median household income over the last few  years  as

well  as the numbers that are in and what numbers we  can

fix  socially  which we can accept before arriving  at  a

decision.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Nominated Member):</b> May I

ask  the Minister of State, for every family that  has  a

maid,  there is only one maid in a family.  So what  kind

of social concern is the Minister worried about by having

more maids in the country?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the NCMP would

have gone through the papers for the last few months,  he

could  not have but seen a number of abuses that we  have

talked  about  in  this House. Let us say  that  we  have

140,000 foreign domestic workers.  Even if you take 1% of

households  that, for some reason or other,  abuse  their

maids, we are talking about 1,400 maids.  Over and  above

this,  there will be repercussions on our social  fabric.

We  cannot run away from the fact that the people are  of

different  origins, different cultural  backgrounds,  the

problems  that they have in assimilation and  the  effect

and  distortion it creates in our own society.  We do not

want  to  make  it harder for families to  continue  with

their  lives  as it is.  But we will have to  judiciously

balance this with other concerns.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, does the Minister of State not

think  that  it is a bit disingenuous of him to  actually

say  that he would refrain from prescribing criteria  for

maids when, in fact, this Government has never been  slow

to  prescribe,  when  it never had  any  doubts   of  its

ability to prescribe what is in the best interest of  the

people?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what advice would the Minister of State

give  to  working  women  in Singapore  should  there  be

increases  in  the  maid  levy, which  actually  make  it

extremely difficult for them to continue to have  a  maid

and  yet balance all the responsibilities that they  have

between their home and their working roles?  What  advice

would he give them in that circumstance?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the advice sought from me was

premised on the fact that the levy will be increased.   I

never said that the levy will be increased.  I said  that

we  will review it.  So, I would not give advice when  it

is not needed yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was accused of being disingenuous about not

being able to prescribe criteria since this Government is

so  good at prescribing.  I do not think it is a question

of  whether  we  can  devise a  series  of  formulae  and

prescriptions.   But just think what the  craft  of  that

policy would lead society to.  Do we really want to run a

system and judge each family based on need?  Picture,  if

you  will, the desk at my Ministry and a line of families

bringing with them their parents and children to  assert,

to  emphasise, to prove that their need is  greater  than

the person behind them.  Do you really want a society  to

go along that line?  I do not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1982, when we

first  introduced the foreign domestic worker levy, which

was  then 30% of wages, and wages were much lower at that

time,  we  had  something  like 14,000  foreign  domestic

workers.   But now that it is $345 a month, we  have  got

something  like 140,000 workers, and it is  very  obvious

that  the  Government  is still not  satisfied  with  the

situation.   Can  I therefore ask the Minister  of  State

what would be the number of foreign domestic workers that

would be deemed acceptable to the Government?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, that is an intelligent question.

The  answer is no one knows, because we are at the  front

edge.   No  country  has  a large proportion  of  foreign

workers  as  Singapore  does.   We  are  second  only  to

Luxembourg,  and I assure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



you  that  the  character of the  proportion  of  foreign

workers  in  Luxembourg is quite different from  what  we

have  in Singapore.  We are testing the norms and we  are

pushing  the  envelope because we are at the front  edge.

When  our neighbouring countries decided that they had  a

problem with foreign workers, there was hell to pay.   Do

we  know  when we will reach breaking point?  We do  not.

Have  we  crossed it?  I do not know.  It has  just  been

increasing.   So,  we  have  28%,  based  on  our   local

population  of  foreign workers.  Let me just  say  this.

When  we  do know, I think it will be quite late and  too

late.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, every Singaporean

matters.   When families employ maids, they pay $750  per

month which includes the levy.  They go out and work in a

factory  for  $1,100.  $350 per month  counts  for  their

family.  If the maid levy is raised ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Mr Fong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> I want to know whether the Minister

is aware that when families go out to work and pay $750 a

month  for  employing a maid, the $350 or more per  month

for  the family means a lot to them, rather than get $250

or  $350 from the CDC.  This is the self-reliance that we

are  talking about.  Would that not promote self-reliance

that  we  have  been talking about?  And also  with  this

policy, it actually shows that every Singaporean matters,

if you think about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you wish to answer that question, Dr

Ng?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, actually, I do not know what he

asked.   It  has  something to do with every  Singaporean

matters.   I am trying to see the connection.   It  is  a

disingenuous question.  I am trying to see the connection

between  what  the levy has to do with every  Singaporean

matters.   Yes, it is difficult to ration out a  resource

-   foreign  domestic workers.  Yes,  we  impose  a  levy

because it is a good tool to moderate demand.  Is it  the

best  way to do it?  Are there other options that we have

considered?  Yes.  Do we think that they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



workable?  No.  Can we then help Singaporeans who need to

pay  the  levy  and  who want a foreign domestic  worker?

Yes, we do.  We have waiver of levies built into the  tax

system.   Can  we do without it?  I do not think  so.   I

think we still need it to moderate the demand.  We cannot

manage  at  the  level of each individual household,  who

needs  and  who does not.  I think this will continue  to

stay.   But  as I said, I am in no hurry to review.   The

moratorium  has  already been set, and  I  do  not  think

Members would want my Ministry to hurry to review this.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, certain households

have two maids.  Can I ask the Minister of State, in  his

review, to perhaps consider a higher levy for the  second

maid?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, as what the NMP has said, we

will consider it.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> I hope to ask an intelligent

question, Sir.  My question to the Minister of  State  is

that  since  there is a gap that needs to be filled,  and

that  is  why  there is an increasing demand for  foreign

domestic workers, what has the Ministry done in order  to

promote local industry services to fill this gap?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Objectively, the Ministry has done a

lot.   It  tried  to promote a number of  local  domestic

companies.   Members would have read  in  the  newspapers

which we have promoted for them to portray local domestic

companies  who  do cleaning, laundry and childcare.   But

the  economic reality is that it is a wage problem.  Yes,

we  can hire someone for a much cheaper wage and it is  a

convenience factor.  Unless and until we reduce that wage

disparity,  it  is an uphill climb.  But until  we  reach

there,   we  will  continue  to  stimulate  and   provide

alternatives.  But the families and Singaporeans  at  the

ground  will  choose,  and  they  will  choose  based  on

economic concerns and economic planning norms.   I  agree

with Mdm Halimah that there is a wage disparity which  is

hard to address, except through other means.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, if the Minister of

State is concerned about the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



number  of  maids  in Singapore, would he  also  consider

limiting the number of maids per family?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, foreign maid levy tax relief has the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does help singles who look after

their parents.  All taxpayers, regardless of whether they

the  existing  parent  relief, will  be  introduced  with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



disparity if a married person is looking after an elderly

person,  employs  a  maid and gets tax  relief  versus  a

single person?  It seems there is a disparity.  Would the

Minister like to comment, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I said, the foreign maid

tax relief is to encourage women to continue working.  As

long  as  the person is married and is working,  she  can

claim the relief.  Whether the maid is used to look after

parents,  children  or family, we do not  really  bother.

The criteria are that the person must be married and must

continue working, and the relief will be granted.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> The question is about

singles.  A single person could be a case where he or she

cannot  go  to work unless he or she has a maid  to  look

after  an  elderly parent.  Should this  not  be  equally

applied irregardless of status?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I said in my reply, if the

singles need to look after handicapped parents, there are

other forms of reliefs.  It is not that these reliefs are

not available to singles.  If the single person wants  to

work,  she  can  claim  relief under  handicapped  parent

relief.   Or if she has to look after siblings,  she  can

claim  relief under handicapped siblings.  But this  maid

relief  is  a  misnomer.   It should  be  called  married

woman's relief.  Then things will be clear.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, a point of

clarification.   A single divorced woman can  claim  maid

relief.  But a divorced man is not entitled to claim maid

relief.  What is the reason for this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, we look at such cases and we

try to be as sympathetic as possible.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, I have to go back to

it.   I  still  see  a  disparity between  being  single,

wanting to work and getting a maid just to look after  an

elderly person or sibling.  Why can the single person not

enjoy  tax  relief  for employing a maid  for  that  very

purpose?  Sir, I am sorry but I have to get back to it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, obviously, we are not

communicating.  If you are single and you want  to  work,

there  is  no problem.  Go and work.  If you are  married

and  you want to work and you have responsibilities  with

the family  -  whether looking after the house or looking

after  children  -  this is where the maid  relief  comes

in.   If  you  say  that you need a maid  to  look  after

handicapped parents or handicapped siblings, as  I  said,

there  are  reliefs too.  If you are single and  want  to

work, nobody is stopping you from working.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I

think the issue is that if the woman is married ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Dr Maliki?

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Is there a

differentiation in terms of what a married woman gets and

an  unmarried woman gets?  The woman who is married  gets

double relief, meaning that she can also claim relief for

looking  after her elderly parent as well as employing  a

maid.   Whereas  the person who is single  does  not  get

double relief.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Yes, if you are married, you get

the  extra relief.  So if you want to get the relief, get

married.

<div align="center"><b>LAW ON PUBLIC SPEAKING</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs in view of Singapore becoming a  more  open

society, if the law on public speaking will be relaxed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Entertainments and

Meetings  Act (PEMA) requires that a Public Entertainment

Licence  be  obtained before a public talk can  be  held.

Public  talks,  especially when they touch  on  politics,

religion  and  race,  can give  rise  to  law  and  order

problems.   If the talk is held at an outdoor venue,  the

talk can attract large crowds and curious bystanders.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



Speeches   can  become  inflammatory,  thereby  eliciting

disaffection.  People of different political persuasions,

religious inclinations or racial groups in the crowd  may

hurl  abuse;  first, verbal and then  physical,  at  each

other.   In  other  words,  a  public  talk  on  even  an

innocuous topic may become unruly or degenerate into  mob

violence, if troublemakers are at work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a small, compact, multi-racial and

multi-religious country.  Past events show how easily  it

is  for troublemakers to make use of gatherings to incite

racial  and religious riots, resulting in loss  of  lives

and  property.   Indeed, events over the last  two  years

around  the world demonstrate the disruptive forces  that

can  be  unleashed  due to racial and  religious  strife.

Regulation  of  public talks is therefore  necessary  and

continues to be needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, MHA proactively reviews the

licensing laws under its purview and has relaxed rules on

public talks.  For example, in September 2000, we set  up

a  Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park.  Singapore citizens

who  wish to express their opinions on any issue,  except

religious speeches and speeches that would cause feelings

of   enmity,   hatred,  ill-will  or  hostility   between

different  racial  or religious groups,  merely  need  to

register  their  intent to speak at the Kreta  Ayer  NPP,

which is located next to the Speakers' Corner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PEMA is administered with a light touch.

The   facts  speak  for  themselves.   Between  2001  and

November  2002,  Police approved 1,341  applications  and

rejected only 5 applications for public talks.  That is a

high  approval  rate  of  99.6%.  The  applications  were

rejected  because  inadequate  time  was  given  by   the

applicant  for  Police to process the application  before

the event, or the venue was not suitable for the talks to

be held.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Singapore is becoming a more open

society,  regulation of public talks is still  necessary.

In  any  case, the provisions under PEMA are  not  overly

restrictive and the regulation of public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



talks  is administered with a light touch.  Let me assure

the  House  that MHA would regularly review the licensing

laws  under  its purview as society evolves and  people's

aspirations change.

Hean].

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br>1.18 pm



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much of

the  debate  yesterday  focused on whether  the  proposed

changes in the White Paper will ring in more stress and a

more elitist system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like others in this House, I too am concerned

whether the increased subject - from five to seven at the

JC  level  -  will  mean more stress  for  our  children,

especially those at the borderline.  More likely, greater

stress  will  be  faced not so much by  the  top  10%  of

students,  but  the Mr and Ms Average and  the  Slightly-Above-Average in the JCs.  But how stressed they will end

up  depends very much on how the subjects are taught, and

how  the  students approach the subjects  and  their  own

expectations  and that of their parents'.  We  know  from

our  own experience, that if you enjoy a subject, it will

cease to be stressful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if the broader based education curriculum

does  prove  to be more stressful for some  students,  we

have  to  ask ourselves which would be more stressful  in

the final analysis.  To be stretched a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



few  years  in  school with a broad based education  that

prepares them well for the future, or to come out to  the

workforce  ill-equipped  for the lifetime  of  challenges

ahead?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern - whether this would make for a

more  elitist system - is to my mind the wrong  question.

The question to ask is:  with this education reform, will

the masses in Singapore have a better future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a society that is mainly middle class. Over

the  years,  however, the income gap has widened  between

the  top  earners and those at the bottom.  It  would  be

much simpler to look for ways to distribute our country's

wealth  more  equitably, than  it  would  be  to  try  to

distribute  one group's intelligence more equitably.   We

should put our efforts into nurturing those who are  more

gifted and intelligent among us, so that they can add  to

the  country's progress and wealth, which can  be  shared

more equitably with all citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Education Minister said yesterday, and I

quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Those students who will benefit from the greater

educational  options being introduced,  must  not  forget

that  the  opportunities that they enjoy  are  ultimately

justified  only  by the quality of their  commitment  and

service  to our nation and the general social  good.   If

our  JC  students  leave  the system  very  bright,  very

creative  and innovative, having benefited from the  best

that  our  system has to offer, but without  a  sense  of

commitment  to  country  and  obligation  to  his  fellow

citizens,  then  all  these efforts would  have  come  to

nothing.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

I agree fully with the Minister.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not particularly care if this reform would

produce  Nobel  prize  winners at the  end  of  the  day,

although  it  would be good if it did.   The  fundamental

thing  is  to  give  every  citizen,  every  student,  an

opportunity to reach a place in which he or she  can  and

will  make  the  greatest possible  contribution  to  the

public good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to focus on is to continue to

strengthen  meritocracy  and to remove  all  barriers  to

social mobility and create a level playing field so  that

all   citizens   can  truly  partake   of   equality   of

opportunity.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



this  respect, Sir, I find the proposed education  reform

very  exciting.   It  is  exciting  because  it  embraces

enlightened  and forward-looking values as  its  starting

point.    It   believes  that  each  person  is   unique,

possessing  diverse  abilities and talents.   It  affirms

that  diversity  is valuable and enriches the  community.

It  signals that society values individuals who excel  in

different  fields, be it sports or arts.  It  promotes  a

more balanced view of success and self-worth, beyond just

academic results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight in particular four

proposals in the White Paper for discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the proposal to set up new Specialised

Schools  that cater to students with talents in  specific

fields,  such  as  the  arts,  sports,  mathematics   and

science.   This  would contribute towards broadening  the

range of career paths and opportunities for Singaporeans.

Indeed, the promotion of arts, through the proposed  arts

school, cannot come at a better time, especially for  the

arts scene when Singapore is gearing up to be the art hub

for  the  region, and with the building of the Esplanade.

If this bold experiment succeeds, it will contribute to a

higher quality of life for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pursuit of excellence in any field requires

substantial   effort   and   investment.    Many    young

Singaporeans I spoke to have felt that, for a long  time,

they have not been able to develop the artistic interests

because  of societal pressures to pursue the 5Cs via  the

tried and tested traditional academic route.  There seems

to be no room for the creative, the offbeat, the dreamer.

With   the  specialised  schools,  they  will  have   the

flexibility  to  pursue their interests and  passions  in

arts  or  sports without having to opt out of the system.

They  can  combine academic study and the  arts  or  with

sports.   The signal to society is profound:  the  softer

side  of  life  matters.  It redefines  the  conventional

definition of success in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these specialised schools in arts and sports

would not succeed or take root if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



there are not enough jobs waiting for their graduates  at

the  end  of  the day.  Hence, I would like to  urge  the

relevant  Government agencies, such as MITA and MCDS,  at

the same time to actively develop the cultural and sports

industries  also.   If  not, then  all  this  effort  and

investment will go down the drain as parents and students

realise  very  quickly  that  the  arts  and  sports   in

Singapore do not offer viable career options.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also cultivate an appreciative audience for

the  arts  and  an  interest in the humanities,  such  as

literature.  This brings me to the second proposed change

I want to highlight and that is the proposal to integrate

an  arts and humanities component into the core education

curriculum in regular schools.  This is to be welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, more and more schools have been dropping

literature as a subject for their students because it  is

difficult  to score high marks for the subject,  and  the

poor  scores  were pulling down the school's ranking  and

the school's average.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, literature is important not only from the

perspective  of promoting the arts and to  help  them  to

speak  better English, but it is also important  for  the

personal  development  of  an individual,  to  help  them

express  themselves better and to see the  world  through

different  lenses.  Literature has elements  of  history,

geography,  philosophy,  sociology  and  psychology.   It

deals  with  the  intellectual and emotional  realm.   In

short,  life  itself, in all its richness and complexity.

Literature is not known as the "Queen of Humanities"  for

nothing.  But given the emphasis on school ranking, I  am

not  hopeful  if  this  proposed change  would  see  more

schools  offering literature or more students  taking  up

literature  again.  They will more likely  go  for  other

subjects which are easier to score, such as geography.  I

would  urge the Education Ministry to relook the  ranking

system, a point I will come to shortly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There also needs to be a comprehensive drive to

address  the  serious  shortage of qualified  literature,

arts and sports teachers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third proposal I found exciting about the White

Paper  is  the added emphasis on non-academic  curriculum

with  more  weight given to co-curricular activities.   I

commend  the  move to introduce a holistic  certification

whereby  the  CCA  achievements and  academic  grades  of

students  are reflected in a single "A" level certificate

and  the proposal to give CCA additional weights  in  the

university admission criteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, when we look back on our school days, we do

not  think  "Oh  yes,  I had a great  time  solving  that

mathematics  problem."   No, more  often  than  not,  the

memories that stay with us for the rest of our lives  are

times  singing  around the campfire as a  Girl  Guide  or

staging  a school play, or running around in the  netball

field.  Our memories intuitively give more weight to CCA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should review how we rank schools, now

mainly based on academic results.  Ranking criteria  also

have  to  be broad based, in tandem with the broad  based

education  we  want to introduce, and the school  ranking

should  give due recognition to schools that do  well  in

literature, the arts, sports and CCA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that all schools in Singapore use the School

Excellence   Model   for   self-appraisal    for    their

performance.   The  School  Excellence  Model  recognises

achievement  and effort beyond academic results,  in  the

arts,   physical  fitness,  sports  and  uniformed  group

activities,  and  so  on.  But as I understand  it,  this

model does not contribute to the ranking of schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the green light for a few private schools to be

set  up,  perhaps  we  should  consider  setting  up   an

independent  body in Singapore, equivalent  to  the  UK's

Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.  Its  core

business is to review the quality and standards  of  UK's

higher  education.   Such an agency in  Singapore  should

audit  the  way  in  which each JC and  secondary  school

manages  the  overall  quality  and  standards   of   its

provision and review academic standards and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



quality  of  teaching and learning in each subject  area,

and  also  give points to CCA in the ranking of  schools.

This  will also help the public to be better equipped  to

make  informed  decisions on which school to  select  for

their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth proposal I want to highlight is that

allowing   a   few   privately-run  and  privately-funded

secondary  schools or JCs.  This is a good move,  despite

the  allegations of elitism, as this will allow those who

could  not  fit into the regular system a menu  of  other

choices.   But why not go all the way and also  allow  at

least  one  private university, privately-run, privately-funded,  to  complete the track and to compete  with  our

universities  for the good students in each  cohort?   Or

else  our  good  students produced up to JC  level,  then

already  used  to  a more rigorous intellectual  climate,

would  have  little option here but to go to  Ivy  League

universities in the US, such as Harvard and Princeton, if

our  own  universities do not also revamp their  teaching

methods or their curriculum.  This would not help  us  to

achieve our vision of being the Harvard of the East.  The

American system offers the choice of both a public and  a

private   system.   At  the  university  level,   private

institutions outnumber public institutions by a factor of

three to one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to align our universities to

the  changes as part of this education reform and, at the

same  time, to broaden the choices for our students  with

at  least  one  privately-funded university.   I  do  not

believe   that   this   greater   differentiation    will

necessarily lead to a more elitist system where only  the

rich  and powerful would benefit.  In Harvard in  the  US

for  instance,  those who can pay full fees  are  charged

full  fees.  The middle class and poor get financial  aid

of  a  sliding  scale.  All financial aid at  Harvard  is

based on need, and almost half of its students get direct

grants which come up to just under half the tuition bill.

Or  take  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   It

also offers an array of financial assistance schemes  for

deserving  students.  Each admission criterion  is  based

not on the ability to pay but on a complex evaluation  of

the applicants' aptitude as well as their attitudes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Dean of MIT Admissions, Marilee Jones was

quoted  as  saying  in one article,  one  way  they  sort

applicants, other than the academic qualification, is  to

rate  them  on three specific dimensions of the student's

life   -   initiatives   in   co-curricular   activities;

initiatives  in  inter-personal  skills;  initiatives  in

extra-curricular activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicants may vary greatly, but that is what

the MIT wants.  As Ms Jones explained, and I quote,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The key word, as you can see, is initiative because

this  is the most important characteristic we select for.

We  try  to  admit  people who take initiative  in  their

lives, who take responsibility for their education.  Many

students  study  hard, get good grades and  good  scores.

But   many  of  those  do  it  because  it  is  a  family

expectation  or community pressure or a myriad  of  other

reasons.'



She  added  that it was passion that they look  for.   We

have  a  high tendency to admit students, she  said,  who

pursue   their  activities  at  a  very  high  level   of

distinction but these activities can be anything.  "It is

the passion that counts."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the passion that counts indeed. And it

is  no  wonder  that  you do not hear many  MIT  students

complaining endlessly of stress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper offers an exciting

vision  of  the  future.  There are so many opportunities

for the students to maximise their potential.  That said,

however, the dazzling array of choices can also be  quite

confusing.   How  are the students going  to  know  which

subject to take and which combinations of those subjects,

which  route to take and which school to opt for to  give

the  courses and the route that they choose, whether they

can  afford  to  go  to a particular school,  private  or

public and, if not, what financial aid is available,  and

so   on?     Students  from  low  income   families,   in

particular,   will  be  disadvantaged   as   their   home

environments  may  not  provide  them  the  support   and

guidance that they need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot presume that somewhere along the way,

a  teacher, administrator, or coach will take  a  special

interest in each student or help the

young person

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



to  recognise  his  or her strengths and  abilities,  and

encourage that student to plan for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to place more emphasis on

providing   schools  with  good  qualified   counsellors.

Without adequate counselling, students have no choice but

to  revert to self-selection and, too often, that is  the

base  where their friends are.  Low-income families  must

be  assisted  if  you are to substantially  increase  the

number  of  students  of different  races,  cultures  and

backgrounds in higher education.  We have been working on

class-size   reduction,  higher  standards  and   greater

accountability.  We have begun to address the  importance

of    preparing   more   and   better-qualified    school

administrators.  To complete the job, we need to be  sure

we have enough qualified counsellors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers already complain of being overloaded with

work.   With  enough  counsellors on hand,  teachers  and

administrators   can  better  focus  on   their   primary

responsibilities.  The provision of high quality, readily

accessible counselling must be at the heart of a  culture

that  is committed to enabling each individual to realise

his or her full potential.  With adequate counselling, we

will reap the full benefits of this education reform.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while in Delhi last week attending the Asian

Network  of  Major Cities Meeting, I met the Governor  of

Tokyo,  Mr  Shintaro Ishihara, who is also  a  well-known

writer  and  a  critical thinker.   He  was  awarded  the

prestigious  Akutagawa  Prize for  the  novel  "Taiyo  no

Kisetsu"  (or  "The Season of the Sun").  He  was  indeed

full  of praise for our education system.  He cited  what

he  saw  in  how  music was taught in our schools  as  an

example  of what he would like done in Tokyo.  Similarly,

he thought that it was strange that Singapore was already

using  the  ERP technology, he said from Japan,  but  yet

that system was not even introduced in his own country.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beauty of our system. It is a subject

of  praise  in  many countries, both in third  and  first

worlds, but that did not stop us from improving and  fine-tuning it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the purpose of this exercise. The

proposals put forth by the Junior College/Upper Secondary

Education Review Committee, in the words of Minister RAdm

Teo Chee Hean, will assure future cohorts of Singaporeans

of  a  relevant  and  forward-looking education  that  is

always in time for the future.  I strongly agree.  Senior

Minister  of  State Tharman Shanmugaratnam and  his  able

Committee  deserve  our  encouragement  and  support  for

bravely  venturing into those proposed changes,  although

there are those who feel that they could still be bolder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, the future challenges awaiting are

innovation-driven and more globalised.  Present standards

of  secondary and JC education will not be  adequate.   I

share  the  confidence  that the  changes  proposed  will

nurture  the skills, spirit and values required  for  the

more  competitive  world.  In fact, the  inherent  spirit

shown  by  MOE, indeed Singaporeans as a whole,  to  make

refinements to an already successful system of education,

will bode well for our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the broader the education system, the more

flexible  our students will be and thus the  easier  they

adapt  to changing needs.  We must move away from strait-jacketed  systems  that  will hamper  our  movements.   I

realise  that many of us, especially parents,  are  often

hamstrung   with  outdated  ideas  about  education   and

careers.  Parents often think of their children in  terms

of  being a doctor, lawyer or engineer.  But the  profile

of the economy has changed so much that we have to change

our mindsets and look at alternative routes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the North East CDC, for example, we have chosen

Creativity and Entrepreneurship as one of the  key  areas

of our activities.  The idea being, not just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



to  create  more  entrepreneurs but  more  important,  to

instill a sense of enterprise in the hearts and minds  of

our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was in secondary school, the mindset was

to  go  for  medicine.  When I failed to get a place  for

Medicine  in  the  Pre-University class,  I  remember  my

`mentor   friend', a retired British Major,  telling  me,

not to worry, I could be a good nurse.  Little did I know

that  I  would end up `nursing' the community.  Community

development  and upliftment became my passion  for  life.

This  helped after I switched from the science stream  to

doing arts or humanities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also glad, Sir, that during my secondary

education,  the Principal of RI then, the  late  Mr  E.W.

Jesudason,  introduced Current Affairs, as an  examinable

subject.  I remember counting the number of coconut trees

in  the school compound and the question came out in  the

test  paper.   And I scored. Sir, not to  be  accused  of

failing  to  see  the  wood for the trees,  my  point  in

mentioning  this anecdote is to emphasise that  education

is  more  than  just a matter of passing the conventional

subjects taught in class.  Current affairs taught me  the

importance of knowing what is going on around us, and  it

gave  me a good foundation for my journalistic career  of

more than 20 prime years of my life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that now "diversity and flexibility" is

the  "way  forward".   A  broader and  more  flexible  JC

curriculum,  with a focus on skills, more  than  content,

giving  students breadth and more flexible options,  will

certainly  open  new horizons for what  education  means.

This  has  implications not only  for  JC  and  secondary

education  but  also at the lower levels of  primary  and

even pre-primary education.  Parents not only need to  be

alerted  but  they must also be garnered to  support  the

proposed  changes.  While communications skills  will  be

given  due  and greater attention to the JC  students,  I

hope  and  trust  MOE will also polish its communications

skills with parents to win over their support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of competition in the system needs

addressing.  As criticisms

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



seem  rife  as  to  the  fact that the  new  system  only

encourages  further elitism and an even greater  struggle

to  get into the band of 'elite' students who will get to

benefit from the more 'flexible' options in the system, I

think  we,  as  a  nation, must be prepared  to  realise,

welcome and cherish competition rather than shy away from

it.   Yet, it does not mean that students who do not  fit

into the top bandwidths will be forgotten.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility should be tailored to ensure that

students  who  do  not excel in the normative  system  of

education,  be  given  a  chance to  excel  in  different

fields.   This  is  something which  Singapore  has  been

consciously striving for through the Polytechnic and  ITE

education systems.  I was among those who visited the MOE-arranged  ITE  visits and I am very  impressed  with  the

attention given and progress made in those areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But further flexibility is required. We should be

prepared  to  recognise talent from within these  systems

which   are   seen  as  secondary  in  stature   to   the

contemporary secondary education-JC route, and  hence  be

prepared  to  offer  them and welcome them  into  further

education  in  their  later life.   In  this  respect,  I

support the proposal to continue with the three-year Pre-University   Centralised  Institutes   system   and,   if

necessary, open another to provide more opportunities for

those on the borderlines who might have the potential  as

late-bloomers.  The proposal to allow some JC students to

do their course in three years is also worthy of support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system must be prepared to recognise

that the future of national educational systems must take

as  their top priority the infusion into young minds  the

hunger  for  knowledge,  the ability  to  learn  and  the

freedom  of  expression.  This hunger for  knowledge  and

ability  to learn should be given a longer leash,  so  to

speak,  by  allowing students to choose at an  early  age

areas of interest and to encourage their development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pointless to encourage creativity in general

while keeping the options of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



student encased within what are deemed as 'guidelines for

success'.  It would be an even greater mistake to try  to

teach  a  person  to be creative and expressive.   It  is

something  that  has to be realised, or  released  .  not

taught.   One sure way to encourage it is to ensure  that

students  know that wherever their passions may be,  they

will  be  supported and given an avenue of expression  by

the education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, however sound the principles

proposed,  the  teachers must be prepared to  play  their

part.  Teachers come with their own mindsets too.  A good

remake  programme  is necessary to help prepare  teachers

for their new role.  This needs time and closer scrutiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other area which would help the proposed changes

to  take  root faster is to infuse more foreign  students

especially  from  countries which have a  more  open  and

liberal  structure.  Scholarships could  be  offered  for

some  of such students to encourage our students to  also

open up and benefit from the new system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, Sir, these proposed changes clearly

send a strong signal on the needs for change.  Similarly,

I   hope   those   running  `alternative'  systems,   the

madrasahs,  for example, will take note and heed  of  the

changes also needed there.  I hope that the MOE will also

be  able  to  provide help to ensure that  the  secondary

madrasahs  also  measure up to the changing  demands  for

secondary education for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

first  say  what a pleasure it is to be able to  rise  in

support  of a motion on education in this House.   I  say

this  with a lot of feeling because, in this House,  over

the  last  five  or six years, I have witnessed  numerous

debates on education policy, some of which had been quite

pungent,  all motivated by very fundamental concerns  for

our educational system and our children.  But this is the

first time I find

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>



myself  heartened by what I see as a broad-based systemic

response  from the Ministry of Education to  a  long-term

challenge that we face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was therefore with some concern that I listened

to  some of the speeches we heard yesterday, where a  lot

of focus and attention were drawn to various concerns and

aspects of these recommendations which are likely  to  be

problematic.  I fully agree that there is a  whole  range

of  concerns to be addressed, and one could argue that no

debate  on  education  would  be  complete  without  such

concerns.  But the key point really is that we should not

lose  sight  of  the bigger picture, as Dr  Wang  put  it

yesterday, not lose sight of the wood for the trees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, this Report and the changes it

recommends represent a watershed in our education system.

Why?   Because, over the years, the education system  has

had  a  host of criticisms levelled at it, and I  believe

that  we  have  here,  after several  decades,  a  robust

systemic  response to such criticisms.  What  were  these

criticisms which still continue to occupy a big  part  of

our  discussion?   We  say  that  our  students  are  too

narrowly  or  academically focused.   We  say  they  lack

creativity  and thinking skills.  We say  the  system  is

rigid, it does not have enough flexibility or give enough

choice,  and  that it does not cater to  those  who  have

specific  strengths,  whether  it  is  in  one   or   two

particular academic subjects or to those who may excel in

sports or the arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, many of the Ministry of Education's

initiatives,  I  felt,  addressed  these  criticisms   in

incremental    steps.    But   the   Report    and    its

recommendations  represent  a  systemic  review  and   an

overhaul  of the upper secondary and JC education  system

that substantially address these points.  In terms of the

curriculum,  as the Report says, it is broader  and  more

flexible.   We talk about breadth through this  Knowledge

and  Inquiry  component or Project Work.  We  talk  about

variation or diversity in the education landscape through

specialised independent schools

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



and  integrated programmes.  I believe these  will  go  a

long  way in addressing many of the concerns that we have

had and will continue to have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I believe these changes are profound

because  of  the  principles that  are  embedded  in  the

recommendations,   specifically,   the   principles    of

flexibility  and  diversity.  I believe  they  provide  a

foundation  upon  which  we  can  build  an  even  better

education  system  for  - as the Minister  put  it  -  an

innovation-driven future which, by implication, is  going

to  be less deterministic.  But these principles are  two

sides of the same coin.  Many of us have argued, in  this

House  and  outside, for flexibility and diversity.   But

when  these  are  in  the offing now,  we  need  to  also

squarely face up to the challenge they pose to all of  us

who are part of the Singapore system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I mean by that? I believe that when we have

greater   flexibility  and  diversity  in  the  education

system, we are now seeing that the equilibrium, in  terms

of  the  responsibility  for  education,  shifts  towards

parents  and  students, and away  from  the  Ministry  of

Education and the school system.  And I think that  is  a

shift that is in the right direction.  What it means  is,

for  example,  when  we have greater flexibility  in  our

system,  it allows an individual to explore his interests

and  discover his strengths.  But what it also  means  is

that that individual has the onus upon himself or herself

to  make  the  most of what is presented to him  or  her.

There  is  no one-track cookie-cutter approach  which  is

going  to deliver a definitive outcome.  It is now a  lot

more variable and we have to take responsibility for it - the parents and the students together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same could be argued for the point about

diversity.   The Report outlines numerous initiatives  on

how the educational landscape in Singapore will or can be

different.  If you contemplate it, it is, as the previous

speaker,  the  hon.  Member Ms Irene  Ng  put  it,  quite

exciting.  We would have a range of schools, all of  good

quality,  some  within  the public  system  who  will  be

outstanding  in certain areas, whether it is in  Science,

Mathematics or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>



others;  there  will  be  private  schools  with  foreign

students making up to 50%; and there will be schools that

offer  integrated  programmes  and  a  variety  of  other

choices.   In  a sense, the mind boggles at the  kind  of

options that will be presented to parents and students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the flip side of such diversity or

differentiation in the system is that there is  the  risk

of  elitism.  And we cannot run away from that.  What  we

have  to ask ourselves is: on balance, is it a good or  a

bad  thing?   Does  it  enhance our system  as  a  whole,

providing benefits to all?  I believe the answer would be

an  unequivocal yes, especially if the Government - which

I  believe the Minister has already given some  level  of

undertaking - will address some of the issues  pertaining

to  the  negative  aspects that  might  arise  from  such

differentiation, eg, enhancing access to  these  schemes,

so  that one's socio-economic background is not a factor,

but  rather  meritocracy.  I think that is a  fundamental

principle that needs to be upheld throughout.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the benefits that accrue from such

flexibility  - and the Report here focuses  primarily  at

the  top  tier  -  must percolate to all  levels  of  the

education  system.   These are the  ways  we  can  ensure

greater  equity and broader benefit from what I  consider

to be such path-breaking moves in the education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think this Report and its

recommendations are a panacea, and this should be obvious

from  the debate so far.  There still remain many  issues

in  people's minds.  And it is by no means the end of the

debate  on  education.   But  I  think  it  sets  a  firm

foundation  upon  which we can build the  future  of  our

education system to meet the challenges ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider doing

two  things.  One is to do more; the other is to do less.

Let me take the do-less first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as with any change in the curriculum, we are

faced  with  the tension between breadth  and  depth.   I

readily

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>



concede this is not an easy trade-off.  After all, we  do

not  want  to  have students skimming the surface  for  a

whole  range  of subjects without really  having  a  deep

appreciation  of  any one of them.  Neither  do  we  want

boffins  who  drill so deep in one particular  area  that

they  are  lost  to  the world when  it  comes  to  other

aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I look at the Report, I felt that, yet

again  perhaps, we seem to want to have our cake and  eat

it.   With the new system at the JC level, students  will

take  at  least  seven subjects - Project  Work,  General

Paper,  Knowledge and Inquiry, Mother Tongue -  at  least

three  core  subjects  and a contrasting  subject.   That

compares with the minimum of three "A"s and two  "O"s  in

the  current system or, if you are a student doing a full

load, then it is four "A"s and two "O"s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of curriculum time, we are told that for

the  Science students, there may be a 10% reduction  and,

for Arts students, there may be no reduction.  My concern

is  this: curriculum time represents the front end of any

education process in the schools.  It is a measure of the

direct contact time that the student has in his classroom

or  in  the  lecture theatre in the junior college.   But

there  is a lot that happens outside curriculum time  and

that  indeed  ought  to  happen outside  curriculum  time

which,   in   a  sense,  we  cannot  capture  with   this

arithmetic.  There is a multiplier that we will  need  to

factor  in, whether it is in self-study, research or  any

other   endeavour   that  is  related,  peripherally   or

otherwise to the subject at hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would like to urge the Minister to do less,

ie,   having  taken  the  bold  step  of  creating  these

differentiated pathways in the secondary, upper secondary

and junior college system, and acknowledging the need for

diversity,  why not go a step further and ensure  a  more

substantial  reduction in the curriculum  time,  say,  by

20%?   I am not saying this because it is going to  be  a

solution  to the question of stress.  I think stress  has

many  sources.  The time spent on curriculum is but  one,

and   I  do  not  think  any  amount  of  reduction  will

necessarily solve that.  But I am saying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>



this  because, first, the same curriculum time under this

equation  does actually mean a heavier workload  for  the

students.  So, we would be disingenuous if we say that as

a  result  of  these changes the students have  the  same

workload.  The answer is that it is not.  The reality  is

that  they will have a higher workload.  So, let us  face

up to it and let us all be prepared for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I do believe that a certain amount of

downtime,   especially  from  such  diverse   educational

opportunities,  is  necessary to  allow  the  student  to

reflect,  to  synthesise - whether it is through  project

work  or  other  activities  -  in  order  to  allow  the

different  educational disciplines  that  he  or  she  is

exposed to, to have an impact on him or her.   After all,

Sir,  we  have  to let the land lie fallow  for  a  while

before  we seed it for the next cycle.  In the same  way,

it  may be useful to give our students a little bit  more

time  to pursue something in greater depth or to look  at

the  inter-linkages or through other  measures,  and  not

look  at  it  as a container or a vat that  needs  to  be

constantly  topped up for fear that any vacancy  will  be

misused or mis-spent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, on doing more, Sir, I am convinced

of   the  benefits  that  a  system  embedded  with   the

principles of flexibility and diversity will bring to our

students  as  well as our general system.  My  lament  is

that the proposals here are confined primarily to the top

quartile  of  our  cohorts.   It  can  be  argued   that,

actually, the top quartile are the most resilient of  any

cohort,  and  perhaps  the  most  flexible  in  a  cohort

because,  presumably, they have the turn of  mind  to  be

able  to  adapt  themselves to different challenges  more

readily than the next quartile or two in a cohort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, I would like to ask and urge

the Minister to see how quickly at least core elements of

the  proposal that have been laid out before  us  can  be

extended to the broader education system in Singapore, so

that all students and, in particular, those who might  be

weaker

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>



have  the  opportunity  to  benefit  from  such  multiple

pathways - pathways that will enable them perhaps to find

their strengths much earlier and capitalise on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a system where after 10 years they go

to  ITE or, beyond that, to polytechnic, JC or university

and  so  on.  But in the secondary school itself,  giving

them those opportunities to discover their strengths  and

to  capitalise on them earlier is critical.  I  think  we

have the seeds of such a possible system in what has been

recommended today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect I would urge the Minister to

consider - and this is a point that Dr Jennifer Lee  made

yesterday  and which I want to echo - is that  whilst  we

focus  at the upper secondary and junior college  levels,

it  would be a natural progression - some might argue, as

Dr  Lee did, it might be an inverse progression - for  us

to  consider what can be done at the primary level, maybe

even pre-primary.  I know the Ministry is already doing a

review   for  pre-primary  education,  but  for   primary

education  we  have used our core subjects - Mathematics,

Mother  Tongue and English - and, I think, Science  after

Primary 4.  The question is: is there scope to do more to

create greater latitude within the primary school system?

That, I know, is an open-ended challenge.  I do not  have

a specific proposal for the Minister but I do ask that he

and  his  team commit to finding a broader-based  primary

school education system for Singaporeans as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

thank you for allowing me to participate in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report on the JC/Upper Secondary Education

Review Committee contains two broad proposals - a broader

and  more  flexible JC curriculum and, secondly,  a  more

diverse educational landscape.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support these proposals which I feel are

long  overdue.  In fact, the proposals are comprehensive,

considered and, most importantly, take into account a lot

of feedback which we have obtained from parents, students

and   employers.    It  is  a  common   complaint   among

Singaporeans that they give a lot of feedback but nothing

happens.   But  I think this is one example where  people

have  given feedback and it actually finds its way  in  a

concrete  form  in  this report  which  I  hope  will  be

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three proposals in the report in which I

have  particular  interest. First, the recommendation  to

focus   on   skills  more  than  content.   Second,   the

recommendation  to  give  students  more  flexibility  on

subjects.  Third, the recommendation to place emphasis on

the  non-academic  curriculum  to  develop  strength   of

character, leadership and team skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On skills rather than content, we do acknowledge

that  the weakness of our education system thus  far  has

been  over-emphasis on content.  Sometimes, I cannot help

comparing  our  educational system to the  production  of

foie  gras.   Foie  gras, as you know, is  a  gastronomic

delicacy.  It is duck or goose liver, very high  quality,

very   expensive,  top  of  the  range,  very   painfully

produced.   It  is the fatty liver which is  produced  by

over-feeding  ducks and geese.  Just let me describe  the

process  which may sound vaguely familiar.  In  order  to

achieve  the desired taste and texture, ducks  and  geese

are force-fed two or three times a day with up to half  a

kilogram of grain and fat.  After two or three weeks, the

birds are ready for slaughter and their livers would have

swelled  to about between six and ten times their natural

size.  Apart from being fed for more than they would  eat

naturally,  the  diet of foie gras birds is  deliberately

deficient  in  basic nutrients and this makes  the  liver

accumulate  so much fat that they can no longer  function

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that our entire education system is

quite  as  bad  as that, but we must admit  that  our  JC

students

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



have been stuffed with quite a lot of content and many of

them have been stuffed with Science at the expense of the

humanities, which leads to a certain imbalance.   I  will

speak a bit more about that later.  The point I am making

is that the over-emphasis on content means that they have

not been able to think out of the box. They have not been

trained  as  much as they ought to have been in  critical

and   independent   thinking.   I   fully   support   the

recommendations from this Committee because I think  they

are  aimed at promoting and developing critical  thinking

which is going to be extremely important in an innovation-driven global society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I know of one university lecturer, a

Caucasian, whose daughter was in a local school.  But  he

transferred her out of the local school after a while  to

an  international school because apparently, the teachers

at  the local school complained that she kept asking  too

many  questions.  She always wanted to know  "why".   She

just could not memorise the answers but asked, "Why this?

Why  that?"  But given the new global circumstances  that

we  find  ourselves  faced with, "why"  is  an  important

question, "how" is an important question.  Can  I  do  it

better?  What are the reasons? Can I get round this?  All

these  are  questions  that  we  need  to  encourage  our

students to think and to develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the function of education is

not  just  to prepare people for jobs.  It is to  prepare

people  for  life.   And  that  brings  me  to  the  next

recommendation which is having more flexible options  for

our  students. Currently, about 40% of JC students  offer

only  Mathematics and Science subjects with no humanities

offered beyond their "O" levels.  One of the reasons  for

this,  as  my colleague in this House, Ms Irene  Ng,  has

pointed out, is that it is easier to score in Mathematics

and  Science subjects which are either formulae in nature

or  heavily memory-based, at least at JC level.   Another

reason   is  that  in  the  past,  these  subjects   were

emphasised to equip the students for specific jobs.   But

the job landscape has now changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singapore and our society as a whole have

suffered to some degree from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



an  over-emphasis on the Sciences at the expense  of  the

Arts   and  it  is  high  time  that  we  corrected  this

imbalance.  Science  and Mathematics  teach  you  how  to

construct  a gun.  It is humanities, philosophy  and  the

law  that tell you when to pull the trigger.  Having  one

without the other is like "yin" without the "yang" -  you

have  a serious imbalance.  This lack of emphasis on  the

humanities  would, to some extent, explain  the  lack  of

creative  thinking,  the weakness  in  our  communication

skills.   And I dare say if we improve on the humanities,

MCDS  may be a happier Ministry because it might actually

improve  the  marriage  rate of  highly  educated  single

women.  I do not promise this but I am saying that it may

have an impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also improve on Singaporeans' social

skills.  Yesterday, in his speech, Assoc. Prof. Koo  Tsai

Kee  mentioned the fact that we were first in Mathematics

and  second  in Science.  That is true.  But we  are  the

only  society in the world, when you are driving and  you

signal  because you want to change lanes, the car  behind

you  in the other lane speeds up, it does not let you  go

into  the lane.  When you are in Europe, when you signal,

they slow down and they let you go into the lane.  But in

Singapore,  this  is  what  we  do.   We  are  first   in

Mathematics  and second in Science, but we will  not  let

somebody get into the lane ahead of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you tried going into the lift, not just HDB

blocks,  but  any  office blocks?  Somebody  is  actually

there  in  the  lift,  but when he sees  you  coming,  he

quickly  presses  the "close door" button.   This  is  an

educated  society.   Our  town councils  are  in  despair

because  we  always have a problem of  urinating  in  the

lift.   Then we have things like the "Hello Kitty" queues

where  Singaporeans jostle one another to be able to  get

the free gift.  The point I am simply making is this.  We

may  be  very good in the Sciences, we may be  very  good

technically, but we still have a certain way to go in the

social  graces which I think the humanities will help  in

some  measure to enable us to bridge that gap. We  are  a

developing society, granted,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>



but  our  education system has a lot to do  with  how  we

develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the next recommendation on the

emphasis  on  the non-academic curriculum to develop  the

strength  of character, leadership, and team  skills.   I

think  that is extremely important.  We will be excellent

technocrats   but  without  leadership  skills,   without

values, without principles, we are really not anything at

all.  There  is one international law firm when  I  asked

them  what  was  the criterion that they used  for  their

recruitment, they said that one of the things  that  they

looked at was to see whether a potential candidate  plays

team  sports.  They actually prefer people who  excel  at

team  sports  rather than those who excel  in  individual

sports  simply because it means that the person is better

able  to work in a team and that is more valuable to them

as an organisation than someone who is a prima donna.   I

fully support this recommendation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will comment briefly now on the workload and

stress.  I notice that one of the recommendations in  the

report  was  to trim the curriculum and I hope  that  the

Ministry will take due note of that.  In comparison  with

the  United Kingdom and United States, for example, where

the  average curriculum time for "A" level-type  subjects

over  two years is 280 hours for the United Kingdom,  240

hours  for  the  United  States,  it  is  330  hours   in

Singapore.  We  have commented a lot  on  stress  in  the

system  and MOE's usual response is that this is  due  to

society's distorted definition of success.  That is  only

part  of the story.  I would ask MOE not to keep trotting

this out as the usual answer because it does make parents

grit their teeth with frustration.  The truth is that  it

lies  in  between.  Stress is a combination  of  societal

expectation and that is attributable to society.  But  it

is also partly due to the system and that is attributable

to MOE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents want their children to succeed. That is a

given.   They would measure that success by the benchmark

that  the system sets as indicia of success.  So  ranking

matters, results matter, grades matter.  If

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>



we  want to reduce the stress and if we do not want to do

away with the ranking system, then what I would do is  to

ask  MOE  to  look at the other indicia  of  success,  to

signal to society that just because you do not make it to

JC  or  university, it does not mean that you are  not  a

success.   That is why I fully support the recommendation

for specialised schools for arts and sports, for example.

But  I  would ask MOE to consider some form of signalling

to  parents that just because their children are  in  EM3

and  land up in Normal (Technical) and ITE, that  ITE  is

not  the  end.  Find some form of signalling  to  parents

that  ITE  is  actually a beginning. Find  some  form  of

giving  indicia  to society whereby they  can  understand

that  their  children are in this stream rather  than  in

that stream, their children are not failures.  It has  to

do with both the system as well as society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, one area of concern I have,

which  is  the  same  concern expressed  by  some  of  my

colleagues  in  this  House, is implementation.   Who  is

going to design the curriculum?  If it is the same people

with the same ideas, you may have the same old things but

just in a new packaging.  I sincerely hope that when  the

new  curriculum  is  designed, it will  be  what  it  was

intended  to  be,  which is fresh,  new,  innovative  and

exciting.   And the teachers too matter because  teachers

obviously cannot change their mindsets overnight.  If  it

is  the  same  teachers,  they  have  got  to  either  be

retrained or think of a different way in which to  teach.

Sir, I hope that the MOE will look at that as well.  I am

sure that MOE has already thought of these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations are for JCs alone, but

obviously,  you cannot expect a student, who  has  always

been thinking in the box, through nursery, primary, lower

secondary, to suddenly to be able to think out of the box

once he hits JC.  If you have ever gone to the wet market

and  bought  persimmons, they put these  persimmons  when

they  are  not  fully ripe into these boxes  with  carton

grates and the cardboard grates are square. So after  the

persimmons ripen, they all come out square which  is  not

their actual shape.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>



If  we  have  all these little "square persimmons"  going

through nursery, primary and lower secondary school,  you

cannot expect them to suddenly become round in JC.  I  am

sure  that  MOE will be looking at this but I would  urge

them to reconsider the whole system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to how we measure our success. In

today's  Straits Times, Tan Tarn How in his column  "From

the  Gallery" commented on the "mind-numbing  surfeit  of

middle  management minutia" and he said that the question

that  cries out to be asked is this:  how does  one  know

when  one  has succeeded?  How should this recommendation

be  measured in terms of success?  I agree,  as  he  said

that  you  cannot measure it by the usual  pure  academic

yardstick  of  whether  we are first  in  Mathematics  or

Sciences. He suggested that one way was using the measure

that  we lag behind in, the number of Nobel prize winners

you  can  produce  and  the world famous  academics,  the

number  of  patents filed.  I disagree  with  that.   The

number  of people who can actually achieve a Nobel  prize

and  the number of people who become world-famous is very

few.   Our  education  system is for  Singaporeans  as  a

whole.  This is what will be the measure of success.   We

will  know  these  recommendations  have  succeeded  when

Singaporeans are no longer afraid of foreign talent, when

we are no longer afraid of competition, when we know that

we are innovative, creative enough to take on competition

and  foreign talent anywhere, anytime, any place. We will

know  we  have succeeded when our SMEs are not afraid  of

our  GLCs. We will know we have succeeded when we  become

internationally known, not just for being  good  stewards

but  good  CEOs and good leaders. We will  know  we  have

succeeded  when you signal and the person actually  drops

back and lets you change your lane.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am heartened that

all  Members who have spoken thus far have supported  the

motion  and the recommendations of the JC/Upper Secondary

Education Review Committee.  However, not a few have said

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>



that  these  changes were good and worthy of support  and

implementation should be extended to the majority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, MP Amy Khor and NMP Dr Jennifer Lee have

called these educational changes to be extended to  more,

so  that more can benefit. And, today, Mr Iswaran  echoes

this  call.   Intended  or not, these  points  raised  by

speakers  before  me may have given the wrong  impression

that  MOE  would  be  neglecting the majority,  as  these

measures  largely benefit the top 10% who, in Dr Jennifer

Lee's   words,   "are  more  than  able   to   fend   for

themselves''.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to address this concern. Implicit

in their comments that MOE may be neglecting the majority

are  two assumptions, both which are debatable.   One  is

that   parity  of  attention  is  achieved  through   the

provision   of  similar  programmes;  and,  two,   better

treatment is accorded to the top echelons of our students

at the expense of the weaker students.  Sir, let me state

in umabiguous terms as clearly and succinctly as I can  - when   it   comes  to  paying  heed  to  the  educational

opportunities  for  the  masses,  especially  the  weaker

students, we have, we do, we will continue to do so.  Let

me substantiate my assertions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have. Educational reforms for the masses,

as  hon. Members Cedric Foo and Wee Siew Kim have pointed

out,  require enormous will and courage and effects take,

in  political  time-scales, well, forever, which  is  why

beyond the political dimensions, countries which had  the

temerity  and succeeded in educational reforms have  done

so  because of added strategic reasons.  Those that  have

succeded are like Singapore, Ireland and Denmark,  island

states  or  countries  surrounded  by  competitors   with

greater hinterlands and resources.  To survive, we had to

get  the  best,  not from some but all  our  people.   In

contrast, large countries with better resources have  had

less strategic reasons to enable the masses to `level up'

in  education.  Do not get me wrong.  All countries  want

it but the need to achieve that egalitarian goal is less

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>



urgent    for   these   countries.    So,   like   Senior

Parliamentary Secretary Koo Tsai Kee recounted, Bush Snr.

promised reforms but like so many before and indeed after

him,  failed to deliver.  Politically, it is a card  they

play because people keep hoping that finally someone will

deliver.   And even if you do not, because so  many  have

previously failed, people forget.  So, when previous  MPs

declared  that  we  should  also  pay  attention  to  the

majority,  I was bemused because it seems, in  Singapore,

even  when you have succeeded magnificently, people  also

forget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the last 20 years or so, since a similar

motion on educational reform standing in the name of  the

then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee was accepted, we

have  been  doing just that  -  paying attention  to  the

masses, not those on the top.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. Prior to those educational

reforms,  only  one  of two students completed  secondary

school education.  Even now, the adverse consequences are

felt.   This  is  the group of 400,000  or  so  that  NMP

Jennifer Lee alluded to.  But we broke the back  of  that

problem,   and   now  more  than  90%  finish   secondary

education.  The problem of masses of uneducated will  not

be  repeated.   So,  if I were asked  the  question,  who

benefited  the most from the educational efforts  in  the

last  20 years, I can objectively assert that it was  the

masses  and not the academically brightest.  Because,  as

Members themselves have said that in most countries, even

in  the  USA, the rich and able are able to take care  of

themselves.   Streaming of aptitude and resources  occurs

spontaneously  and to the disadvantage of the  less  able

and less well off.  A strong central system is inherently

stacked against the elite because it enables the rest  to

catch up.  This is exactly what happened in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, only 5% of each birth cohort went to

university.  Now, if you were in families of the 5%,  why

would  you  want it changed?  When others are less  able,

with  less  access  and untutored, there  would  be  less

competition  and, yes, as many Members have mentioned it,

less stress.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



Indeed,   this  occurs  in  the  States  even  now.    By

gravitational affinity, students from the more  resourced

families  congregate  at  specific  schools  followed  by

better  teachers.   They therefore do  better.   But,  in

Singapore, we do not send all our best teachers  to  only

RI  and  RGS.   We  spread  them out.   These  systematic

changes  opened up access to all and sundry.  As I  said,

it  is school proof  -  any school will get you there  if

you have the aptitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the International Mathematics and Science

Competitions conducted a study and chose our students  at

random.   And  as we have mentioned, our students  scored

very  highly.    In  Mathematics, 93%  scored  above  the

median.  In Science, 80%.  Let me try to present this  in

mathematical terms.  Mathematically, it means that if you

closed your eyes and plucked any student in any school in

Singapore  and  transported him to  an  equivalent  grade

anywhere else in the world, even if the student was  91st

out of 100 positions, he or she would be above average in

that system.  Is it any wonder that parents come back who

have  brought these students overseas and said how  their

children `blossomed' when they went overseas?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, contrary to what was implied, we have enabled

the bottom 90% to be the best that they can be.  We added

to  the  stress  because now one in every  four  students

comes  within  striking distance of  a  local  university

education.  And because we have grounded them so well  in

fundamentals, about 40 to 50% of each cohort get a  local

or overseas university degree finally.  40% get a diploma

and  another 25% ITE certification, and this latter group

with above 80% employability, even in this recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is looking into the educational needs of the

bottom  90%?",  NMP  Jennifer Lee asked  yesterday.   The

Government has for the last 20 years, thank you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we do. Having raised the water level across

our  nation,  are  we  now poised to spend  inappropriate

resources only on the more able  -  cries of elitism?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



Not  so.  Minister Teo, because of these changes,  wanted

to  convince  ourselves  at MOE  that  we  are  expending

appropriate  resources  to  those  with  lesser  academic

aptitude.   He asked for comparable figures  of  spending

between JC  and ITE students, ie, different ends  of  the

spectrum  in  terms of academic ability of similar  ages.

We  did not quite know what the results would be, but the

results are illuminating and indeed gratifying.   Let  me

share them with you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, developmental cost. Both ITE and JC

institutions cater to similar sized intakes, about  1,500

students.   We  spend  $37  million  to  build  one   ITE

institution and $36.8 million to build one JC.  MPs  know

because they have seen it with their own eyes that we  do

not  shortchange  weaker  students,  when  it  comes   to

facilities!  In fact, equipment donated by industry, such

as  in  the  case of Balestier ITE, can come  up  to  $10

million more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, but you say, JC students get better and

therefore more expensive teaching.  Well, let us look  at

the  figures.  The recurrent operating cost for JC is $11

million and $7,879 per student per year.  For ITE,  $10.5

million and $8,030 per student per year.  The ITE student

is  worth  102% compared to the JC student  in  terms  of

spending.   And for both JC and ITE students,  Government

charges  for their education a `princely' sum  of  $25  a

month.   Let  me  say that MOE does not a priori  provide

educational  programmes to different aptitudes  based  on

equivalent spending.  In other words, we do not start  by

saying  that  this  is the sum, we will  spend  the  same

amount for all groups.  That would be unenlightened.  Our

guiding  principle has and will be, enable  each  student

according to his aptitude to realise his potential.   And

for  an  ITE  student  to  have 80%  employability  at  a

starting  salary of $1,300 is something we can  be  proud

of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we will continue to do so. Our educational

system,  though  streamed and segmented by  aptitude  and

pedagogy, is nonetheless interconnected.  In other words,

changes  at any point will have an impact throughout  the

system.   NMP  Jennifer  Lee  asked  another  intelligent

question  -  and Mr Iswaran also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



repeated it  -  if changes are to be effected, why did we

choose to start after the student has had about 6-8 years

in  our current system? Our response is a practical  one.

It  is  easier to do and that is why we chose to work  at

the  `product'.   The University Sector  Review  is  also

concurrently  underway  and the recommendations  will  be

presented in January.  The recommendations will reinforce

and be aligned to the objectives of this present preview.

And I believe to start at the end is a smart thing to do.

If  we  chose to start at the primary one level, we would

have  to  systematically train and enable all  45,000  of

students and their teachers to effect these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said educational reforms take quite long to

effect, but some of us would wish to see changes  in  our

children's  lifetime!  I also think it will work  because

Singaporeans,  by  their very nature,  respond  to  clear

signals.   Take  project  work in schools,  for  example.

Even though it is not yet implemented as a criterion  for

university  admission,  already  project  work  has  been

introduced  at the primary school level, as every  parent

who  has  to  spend nights preparing his child's  project

work  will  testify.   Similarly, the JC/Upper  Secondary

recommendations,  while  physically  affecting  only  10%

initially,  will have a leavening effect  on  the  entire

system.  For example, once the specialised sports  school

is  well  established, I foresee students  who  excel  in

sports,  but  are  continuing in the mainstream  schools,

participate in and upgrade through events in  the  sports

school.    Similarly, the Arts school,  the  Science  and

Mathematics schools will have spillover effects.  Indeed,

the  training of teachers to facilitate these  programmes

that  we  have  talked about will also have an  uplifting

effect.   Singapore is small and teachers meet  regularly

and    interact.   They  will  discuss  new  methods  and

challenge  outdated  ideas.   A  change  in  the  overall

educational milieu will result and will make it easier to

effect changes in the mainstream schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, however, agree with Members who feel that

these changes may not reduce

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



the  workload.   Regardless  of  the  system  and  beyond

educational goals, students will still want  to  go  that

extra  mile, put in that extra hour of mugging to be  one

up   on  his  fellow  students,  to  enter  into  a   top

university.   How  and should we ameliorate  this  drive?

Realistically, we can only aim to influence not how  much

but  what they spend their time on.  That is why  the  JC

review calls for a contrasting subject to achieve breadth

and  for  co-curricular activities to  be  considered  in

university admissions.  A recommendation which  the  hon.

Member John Chen, I am sure, would fully support,  as  it

would have enabled his `borderline example of a badminton

player' who excelled in sports to enter university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me reiterate that these changes do not in

any  way signal that we are going to neglect the majority

and  focus only on those who are more able.  We  continue

to  be  guided by the vision of to each his  ability,  so

that we can get from each his best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the main recommendations made

by theWhite Paper are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Introducing broad-based education and asking

students to study both science and humanities subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Emphasising on thinking skills and not on contents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Enhancing students' communication skill and to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be more creative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main arguments in support of the recommendations

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To remedy the problem of a lack of

communication skill among our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To prepare the students with necessary

qualities  needed  by  the new era of knowledge-intensive

economy; namely, independent thinking, broad-based knowledge and creativity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose if we accept the said two main arguments,

I  would  say  that  this  White Paper  provides  a  very

comprehensive and very thorough solution for  our  future

needs.   It  also  takes care of the likely  queries  and

doubts  resulting from the newly proposed  JC  structure.

It  could be said to be an almost perfect White Paper for

the JC educational reform.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after having carefully read the White

Paper,  I  feel  that  there are many  points  which  are

debatable.  Firstly, in order to satisfy the needs of the

knowledge-based economy, do we really need to have a very

broad-based education?  If it is going to be broad-based,

that  means  there will be no avenue for  specialisation.

Except  those  subjects  in the H3  level,  most  of  the

subjects  in  H2  and H1 levels will have lower  standard

after  the  recommended  reform.   The  results  of   the

reformation will be contrary to the  requirements of  the

knowledge-based   economy  which   requires   people   of

specialised  and  in-depth knowledge in specific  fields.

This  is because in the knowledge-based economy, we  must

have  some  unique or specialised knowledge  which  other

people  do  not  have,  so that  other  people  would  be

prepared to pay a premium for the access to the knowledge

or  in  order to benefit from the knowledge.  So who  are

the  people  who  can claim to possess  this  specialised

knowledge?   I think they must be the specialists.   They

are certainly the jack of all trades, and master of none.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Philip Yeo, Chairman of A*Star, made some highly

controversial  remarks recently.   His  remarks  coincide

somewhat  with the point I am trying to raise  here.   He

said  that in the field of bio-medical research, a  basic

science  degree  qualifies a person  only  to  wash  test

tubes,  a Master's makes him an advanced washer.   A  PhD

makes  him  an  ordinary worker.  So Philip  Yeo's  point

really  hits the nail on the head, because if we want  to

go  into this economy where it is knowledge intensive, we

have  to  be  specialists rather than  generalists.   The

Provost of NUS, Prof. Chong, was reported as saying  that

the  NUS  would  run  their own  JC  in  mathematics  and

sciences to train the students

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



with   the   right   aptitude  to   meet   specific   NUS

requirements.   He  meant  students  with  the  depth  in

mathematics  and science knowledge and not  the  breadth.

So this recommendation to broaden the scope of curriculum

would  definitely  reduce the standard of  the  students.

Even  if only 10% of the students read their subjects  at

H3  level, the standard of the other subjects at H2 level

would   definitely  be  lower  than  before.   The  trend

nowadays  seems  to  be  that, not  only  in  the  junior

colleges, even in the university, we are going  for  this

broad-based education.  I doubt this is really beneficial

to  our students, and wonder whether it will satisfy  the

needs of our knowledge-intensive economy in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the promotion of thinking skills in our

curriculum.  I come from the science stream.  By learning

the  science subjects, it is already a good training  for

our  logic  analytical skills.  In the university,  those

who are stronger in their studies will have no problem in

their thinking skills.  But for those who are weaker, the

thinking skill is actually very, very low.  But why is it

that  there  is  such a phenomenon?  I believe  this  has

perhaps something to do with our system of assessment  in

our  education system.  For the weaker students, they are

not  so  concerned  with  the  process  of  learning  but

concerned only with examination results.  So long as they

can pass the examination, it is not their concern whether

they have succeeded in enhancing their power of analysis,

their power of thinking and power of problem solving.  To

them, all these are not important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion I asked a physics lecturer in a

junior college why is it that the junior college students

are  weak in their power of analysis and problem solving.

His answer came as a great surprise to me.  He said, "Oh,

of  course,  it  should be that, because  in  the  junior

college  it  is  the teachers who do  the  analysis   and

problem  solving, not the students."   In  my  view,  the

recommendation of enhancing the student's thinking  skill

would only be achievable if we do have a major reform  to

our assessment methodology.  We must place attention to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



the  process  of  learning and not purely  based  on  the

assessment  on  the paper and pen examination.   This  is

particularly important if we wish to enhance the thinking

skill of the weaker students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the communication skills of our students.

Generally  speaking, if we want to compare the  level  of

English of our students with English in the UK and US,  I

think  we  cannot  compare with them because  English  is

their  mother tongue and they have a much better learning

environment  for  good English communication  skill  than

that  in  Singapore.  In our case, we have to  learn  two

languages  and  the students generally  use  Singlish  in

their casual conversation.  On other occasions when  they

are discussing more serious matters, like their homework,

they use their mother tongue.  Among the students in  our

universities,  some  come  from  China.   In   order   to

accommodate them and to show that they are not a  "banana

race"  (yellow  outside,  white  inside),  many  of   our

students  use  Mandarin as their means of  communication.

Although it is recommended in the report that we want  to

improve  the  standard  of English communication  of  our

students,  I  think  we have to endeavour  to  create  an

environment  conducive to the students to communicate  in

English.  Apart from our bilingual principle that  cannot

be  changed, we have at least to create an environment in

the campus whereby English would be the main language  of

communication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that the science students are weaker in

expression than the arts students because when  they  are

learning  the science subjects like mathematics,  physics

and  chemistry, not much language skills are needed. They

just need to know the equations and symbols.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, the power of expression

does  not  improve  with  their  subjects.   Perhaps  the

writing skill is stagnated before the JC level.   In  JC,

the  only  subject that involves writing is  the  General

Paper  for the pure science students.  As far as I  know,

the students write less than one essay a month.  So

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



how  could  the science students in the JC  possess  good

communication skills?  Although it is recommended in this

report  that the communication skills of the students  be

improved, the only subject reported to have some links in

achieving this objective is the Project Work and not very

much elsewhere.   I hope the new amended curriculum would

create more opportunities for our science students to  be

trained in this skill.  They should be given more chances

to write and to express.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, improvement of creative thinking and

writing skills. In the project work, generally, a lot  of

technicality would be involved.  Now, in JC 1 and  JC  2,

if all the students spend two years doing these projects,

this  would  mean that, at any one time, there  would  be

about  24,000  projects being carried out simultaneously,

and we can expect a lot of duplications.  I would like to

know  whether  or not we have any means  to  prevent  the

students from copying from one another or duplicating the

work of others.  Some years later, the colleges will have

received  more  than 10,000 reports on the project  works

conducted  by  the students, and they are probably  quite

easily  accessible  to  the  other  students.   The  good

students  would  use them as reference,  and  the  weaker

students  would just copy from them.  If this  becomes  a

trend,  then this project work will become like  a  joke,

because  everyone would be plagiarising to get  admission

to the university.  Besides, if every one of the students

has to do project work, a lot of space and facilities  in

the  school  would be needed.   Do our  JCs  have  enough

facilities  to  satisfy the needs of  the  students?   If

there is not, then the chances are more students will  go

for   the  software-type  of  projects  rather  than  the

practical ones which involve more hardware.  We will  end

up  with a lot of students doing theoretical work  rather

than practical work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we can see that this recommendation for project

work  will  have  a  lot of problems,  and  it  is  quite

different  from the traditional subjects.  If  we  cannot

resolve this problem on the project work, it will  be  an

obstacle for us to attain the target that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



we  have  set out to achieve.  No doubt, our existing  JC

system  is  not  a  perfect system.  There  are  inherent

shortcomings and these shortcomings are reflected on  the

weaker students, in other words, those who are unable  to

communicate,  unable to analyse, unable to have  creative

thinking.   Under this new system, although there  are  a

lot  of  recommendations, which are structural in nature,

we  must also look squarely at the existing weaknesses in

our  existing  system.   If these  weaknesses  cannot  be

resolved first, it would be difficult for the new  system

to attain the objectives set out in the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  too  would like to fully support the  motion  to

adopt  the  recommendations of the Review Committee  with

regard  to  Junior College and Upper Secondary Education.

Indeed  the Report is a very excellent blueprint to  take

the JC and the Upper Secondary Education into the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the key is summarised in paragraph 26 of the

report,  which  states that "The focus of education  must

shift  from  efficiency  to diversity,  from  knowing  to

thinking,  and  from fitting people to specific  jobs  to

equipping  them for lifelong learning and creating  their

own opportunities."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact this is a very powerful statement with

intent to empower people.  It also sums up where we  have

been and where we want to be.

In   the  past,  our  strategy  has  been  to  focus   on

efficiency,  on  knowledge and  on  fitting  people  into

specific  jobs.   Every  strategy,  indeed  in  business,

cannot be perfect, but the bottom line counts.  And,  the

bottom  line is that it has produced the results we  have

today.  It has served us well as a small and fast growing

nation  and has brought us clearly to where we are today.

And  I  think all Members have also agreed that in  going

forward,  we  have  got to change our  educational  focus

because the world we live in is vastly different.  We now

have a global economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



Information explodes all around us, and changes the world

and our chosen careers. It is just inevitable and we just

have got to continue with life-long learning in order  to

stay relevant.  And businesses too are focusing on people

who  are  creative,  people with  unique  ideas,  problem

solvers who are able to communicate the ideas as well  as

focusing on people, on their well-being.  And competition

is  clearly demanding that all of us have got to  enhance

our  productivity in more ways than one to produce  goods

and services better, quicker and cheaper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most of the solutions can be shaped by education

because  education is a powerful tool to  reshape  minds,

reshape  attitudes  and reshape  behaviours.   So  it  is

timely  that  we relook and re-challenge our  educational

system to take us forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, just like any investment, we look for

the  best yields.  Happily, now, we can afford a lot more

of   the   recommendations  put  forward  by  the  Review

Committee so that we can embark on broad-based education,

we  can  do more for our students so that they can  spend

more time on non-academic projects, project work, as  has

been said, as well as on character building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a professional accountant and one trained with

specialist  skills, I am a firm believer  in  broad-based

education, general-based education, at all levels.   Most

of  my  colleagues trained in Europe, in US  and  UK  are

trained in that way.  They first of all have to obtain  a

General Degree first and we would prefer them to  have  a

discipline, other than accounting.  We would prefer  them

to  have  a degree in philosophy, in engineering,  before

they  embark on their professional qualifications.   This

has  made  much  better multi-faceted professionals,  not

only  effective  in  their  own  individual's  sphere  of

profession, but also well-equipped in business as well as

social  settings.   I  think this  should  apply  to  all

professionals, as well as technicians, that create people

as  well.  Just as we have moved away from the idea  that

accountants should be locked up in backrooms,  buried  in

ledgers, we should also move away from the idea that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



technicians should hide behind machines and work  quietly

with  their  hands.  All of us got to  be  equipped  with

multi-faceted  skills  so  that  we  can   operate   more

effectively as leaders and managers in the global economy

and global marketplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the concerns on JC and upper secondary

education,  my  little concern has been answered  by  the

Minister  of  State, and what further  changes  would  be

brought  about  by changes introduced at one  level,  the

before  and the after.  Before, being at the primary  and

lower  education, lower secondary education level to  set

the scene for the broad-based education to be experienced

at the upper secondary education level, and the after, at

the  tertiary  education so that students  who  had  been

brought  up in a different and more challenging way  will

still  continue  to  receive the  same  level  of  mental

stimulation and challenges under the new system.  I think

this  is nitty-gritty stuff that MOE would take care  of.

What  I  foresee  is an education system which  will  get

invariably more and more complex and I think it cannot be

helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has already been said about the educational

reforms, about execution and about training teachers.  So

I  would  not dwell on them.  I would like to add further

comments on reforms beyond the educational reforms.  When

I  first read the Report, I said, "Wow, as a parent, this

is  going  to cause more stress for parents and  students

alike."  I think probably more so for parents.  As it is,

our existing streaming system is causing much stress.  So

as  we  open new channels, a superior education  for  our

best and our brightest, parents, I feel, would invariably

get more pressured to ensure that the students make it to

this  category.  They will get a crack at  Primary  6  to

make it to one of these Integrated Programmes, if not  at

Secondary  2,  and  for  the  late  bright  bloomers   at

Secondary 4.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report did acknowledge that such changes would

bring about some level of elitism.  But it was felt  that

it was inevitable.  And I must say I agree.  I agree

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



with  streaming, I agree with segmentation, I agree  with

setting  up  new channels for our best and our  brightest

because these are the very people who will pull the  rest

of society forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not against elitism because it is a fact

of life.  It is required given the constraints as a small

country.   But it is important to recognise  the  stress,

and  we  ought  to  recognise and  manage  the  resultant

stress.  I  also agree that much of the stress  is  self-imposed  -  by society and by parents.  All parents  want

the  very  best for their students to excel in everything

from  academic to arts, to music, everything is just  not

realistic, but yet we push ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the New York Times article recently and it

said  the Singapore problem is experienced elsewhere  and

it  emphasised  that children must also lead  a  balanced

life.  To the Americans, they said they also need time to

veg out.  In our lingo, just switch off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is heart warming that the Report has sent out

a  very important signal where they recommended that  the

hours  be  reduced for each subject.  Some  Members  have

argued  that  they should be reduced even  further.   But

what  is  important is that they have  sent  out  a  very

important  signal that the hours ought to be reduced  and

more hours be spent doing other things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think parents ought to take cue to lessen the

pressure on their children.  But educational reforms  can

only  do so much.  At the end of the day, society,  as  a

whole,  must  also change its mindset  and  seek  a  more

balanced  life.   Because  we can  be  a  high  achieving

nation, but if we are completely stressed out, we  become

ineffective and it becomes a case of diminishing returns.

It  is  also  good  that  the Report  therefore  is  also

recommending  that  we  alleviate  the  pressure  on  our

students by allowing them to seek and to fulfil their own

interest  and their own inclination.  Because  when  they

pursue  their  interest,  they excel  through  enjoyment.

Frequently, students are channelled into programmes where

they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



have  no aptitude or motivation for.  And this is because

of  peer  pressure or family expectations.  And it  is  a

tragic  waste of resources both on the point of  view  of

the individual as well as for society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, another side effect of this proposal, elitism,

is  of  course labelling.  We already have so many labels

in  the  marketplace  - Normal, Express,  scholars,  non-scholars  and  we  have  got  elites  versus  non-elites.

Again, I like to emphasise that I am not against elitism.

But it is important to recognise it and the downside that

it  would  produce a greater divide on society  and  will

produce more of the so-called quitters in society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would also like to add that the elites

themselves would also form a pool of potential  quitters.

As  we  raise the bar for our best and brightest,  as  we

create  more savvy, more creative people, more  thinkers,

more   leaders,  they  would  also  tend  to  be   brash,

opinionated and self-centred.  So it is also important as

we teach them humility, we also have to alter our social,

as  well  as political framework, in order to engage  and

accommodate  a  new  breed  of  Singaporeans  who   might

otherwise pack up and go, if they are not satisfied.   So

we need more social reform.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the decades, we have also evolved as a nation

of  small families, one or two siblings or no siblings at

all,  both parents working, the womenfolk getting  better

educated, they will pursue their aspirations and you will

have  more of family members working in the future.  What

we  get  is  latchkey kids, we get kids subject  to  maid

culture,  we  get lonely kids, and we also get  ambitious

and guilt ridden parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So more and more the traditional discipline and

support system of the family will get eroded and we  have

got  to  face the consequences of this reality  squarely.

So  what I would like to suggest, and I wonder whether it

would be possible, is whether it would be reasonable  for

some of these family responsibilities to be undertaken by

the  State.   Whether we could have,  on  a  much  bigger

scale,  across national level, after-school care for  our

children so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



they  can  be minded, so that the value system  and  life

skills  can  be better developed, better honed.   Because

when  our  children get better cared, they become  better

adjusted individuals and they will do better, not only in

terms  of  academic,  but in terms of  pursuit  of  other

interests,  in  terms of music and arts, it  will  create

teamwork, it will create enjoyment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about music and arts, again, it is great

that the Report is recommending academies for music,  the

arts, the drama, and so on.  But it can only flourish  if

our society places value on such areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sportsmen cannot just wait to win gold medals at

ASEAN,  the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games before  they

get rewarded.  Even just being good, and not world-class,

they  must  earn  a living.  So we have  to  create  real

economic opportunities for these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder whether our new commitment can also be

endorsed  to  the  highest  level,  in  terms  of   State

scholarships, whether the President's scholarships can be

offered  for  the  music, the arts, the drama  and  film-making.  It is all very well that we develop our best and

our  talented in particular fields.  At the  end  of  the

day,  I  agree that one of the primary goals of education

must  be  to meet the needs of our economy and to provide

jobs and gainful employment for our young when they leave

school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State has very positively confirmed

that  the Ministry of Education has done and will  always

do  more  for the greater masses, and this is  important.

Because the true test of the success of our schools  must

be   the   preparation  and  motivation  of  the  greater

majority.   And  it  will  be wonderful  if  the  greater

majority, especially the less academically inclined,  the

late   bloomers,  can  be  motivated  to  excel  and   to

contribute effectively to our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, and this is noted in the Report,

education  for all must be a lifelong process, a  process

which extends from infancy to the end of one's life.   So

we must create a learning society which will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



help  us  to  progress  and  prosper  in  a  world  where

creativity  and knowledge clearly rule.  So  the  primary

goals of education must be, firstly, to provide our young

preparation  for lifelong learning; secondly,  to  launch

them into careers where their aptitude, ambition and  the

skills match; and thirdly, to continuously develop  their

potential throughout their adult years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an easy subject. And indeed, it must

extend  beyond the educational reforms in order  to  draw

the  true potential of the next generation.  We have  got

to look at the total picture - the family, the social and

the political framework.  We have got an enormous task at

hand.   I do not envy the Ministry of Education.  But  by

just  recognising the nature of the task, I think we have

taken  major steps towards tackling it.  There can  never

be  a  perfect and all-encompassing solution.  We  cannot

cure  all the problems at the same time, and we must  not

postpone improvements today, taking one step at a time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I commend the Report. I support

the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



Education Review Committee 2002, contained in Paper  Cmd.

8 of 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes proposed in the Report are of

fundamental  importance to the remaking of the  Singapore

economy  and  society.  It is therefore appropriate  that

the  Whip  be  lifted on this debate, so that  when  hon.

Members  vote on the motion they will do so  not  because

they  have  been instructed by the Government  Whip,  but

because  they have studied the proposed changes  and  are

personally  convinced  that  the  changes,  even   though

difficult  to  implement and unsettling  to  parents  and

students, are nevertheless necessary, if Singapore is  to

nurture a generation of students who are well prepared to

face  a  different world from that experienced  by  their

parents in the first 37 years of our independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the education system of a country cannot be

divorced from the country's economic circumstances.   For

Singapore,  our education system has evolved in  response

to  changes to Singapore's economy and society.  Prior to

our  independence in 1965, when we were a British  colony

and  our  economy  depended on trade  and  servicing  the

British garrison in Singapore, there was no real need for

widespread education of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the British authorities concentrated

on  nurturing a small number of English language  schools

to  educate  clerks and a few professionals, particularly

in medicine and law, to assist the Colonial Government to

run   what   was   then  basically  a   simple   economy.

Consequently,  large numbers of Singapore  children  were

educated  in  vernacular  schools,  where  teaching   was

conducted  in  Chinese,  Malay  and  Tamil,  and  largely

outside the purview of the Department of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After our independence in 1965, the need was for a

national  integrated  system of education,  with  uniform

characteristics which would be taught to all children  in

Singapore,   regardless  of  their   race   or   language

background.  A national system of education proved to  be

enormously   difficult   to   realise,   with   political

disturbances and even communal riots in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



1960s and 1970s disrupting the process of integrating the

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A landmark in educational development in Singapore

was  the adoption by Parliament in March 1979 of the  Goh

Keng  Swee  Report  on the Ministry  of  Education  which

shaped  our  present education system, with streaming  at

primary and secondary schools to enable children to study

at  a  pace  appropriate to their intellectual abilities.

The  success of streaming in our schools can be  seen  in

the  dramatic fall in the secondary school drop-out  rate

from 13% of each Primary 1 cohort of students in 1978  to

just  2.7%  last year.  The primary school drop-out  rate

has similarly fallen from 6% for each cohort of Primary 1

students  in  1978 to almost zero - actually,  only  0.3%

last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore is admired throughout the world for

our  success  in  educating students of all  intellectual

capabilities, not only the gifted students but  also  the

average students and all social classes.  Our schools  in

Singapore, whether the elite independent schools  or  the

more  numerous neighbourhood schools, are all  well-built

and  well-equipped, and give to every child in Singapore,

no matter what is his or her social class or intellectual

capability,  at least 10 years of basic education,  which

will  enable  the  child  to proceed  further  to  junior

college,  polytechnic or Institute of Technical Education

and,  from  then,  on to university for  those  with  the

determination and ability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Education from 1985 to 1991, I

built  on  the solid foundation laid down by Dr Goh  Keng

Swee to fill out the education structure by upgrading our

schools'  physical infrastructure, improving the training

of  our teachers, and emphasising the critical role  that

principals  play in motivating and guiding  teachers  and

students in the search for excellence.  Over the last  10

years,  subsequent Ministers for Education - Mr Lee  Yock

Suan and, now, RAdm Teo Chee Hean - further improved  the

system   with   innovative   measures,   such   as   mass

customisation  and encouraging the learning  of  critical

thinking skills.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as I have said, we have an education system

in  Singapore which is admired throughout the world, even

in  developed countries like the US and Europe, and which

delivers a high standard of education to virtually  every

child  in  Singapore.  If the system is working so  well,

the  natural question to ask is:  why then do we have  to

change it?  Why try to fix the machine which is operating

smoothly and delivering the goods?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why we have to change our education

system  is  because  the world has changed,  and  changed

dramatically.  We could have carried on with the  present

system for possibly the next 10 years, making adjustments

here  and  there  to  meet difficulties  or  to  fill  in

inadequacies as they arise.  But when confronted  with  a

major   change   in   the  operating  environment,   such

incremental   adjustments  do  not  solve  the   problem.

Instead,  they  aggravate  the  problem  by  perpetuating

practices that should be jettisoned, if a country  is  to

move ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vivid example of how small incremental changes do

not  solve  but merely aggravate a basic problem  is  the

response  by  successive  Japanese  governments  to   the

chronic problems in the Japanese economy.  Japan  had  an

enormous  record of economic success for  three  decades,

from  the beginning of the 1960s to the end of the 1980s.

Japan  as  Number  One, the influential book  written  by

Harvard  Professor  Ezra Vogel received  wide  publicity.

Nations  in  search of development were urged to  emulate

the  Japanese  way  of doing business.   Japan's  leading

position  in the world economy's sweepstakes came  to  an

end  in  the  late  1980s when the world  moved  from  an

essentially manufacturing based economy to an innovation,

knowledge-driven economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new economy, Japan's strengths of group

cohesion,    incremental   improvements   and   life-time

employment systems hindered rather than promoted economic

progress.    Many  commentators,  both   in   Japan   and

elsewhere,  have  come  to the conclusion  that  for  the

Japanese  economy  to  revive, a major  restructuring  of

Japan's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>



economic  and  monetary policies is necessary,  and  that

minor  adjustments  would only prolong  the  deflationary

slowdown in Japan, which has now lasted for more  than  a

decade.  As Japan shows no sign of embarking  on  such  a

major  restructuring  of  its economy,  there  is  little

expectation  that the Japanese economy will  recover  its

former vibrancy in the foreseeable future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the two decades of the 1980s and the 1990s,

Singapore,   in  general,  enjoyed,  despite   occasional

hiccups  in  1985 and 1998, a very favourable combination

of  factors that enabled a small export-oriented  economy

like  Singapore to achieve high growth.  After struggling

in  the  1970s,  the  US  economy  began  getting  effect

together  in the 1980s.  Companies restructured,  slimmed

down,  took advantage of the latest developments in real-time   information  technology  systems   and   generally

achieved  a sustained rise in productivity in the  United

States,  which  was  not only higher  but  several  times

higher  than  that experienced in previous decades.   The

whole  world,  including Singapore,  benefited  from  the

strong  growth  of  the US economy, particularly  in  the

1990s.    And  in  addition  to  a  buoyant  US  economy,

Southeast  Asia was also rapidly growing with  the  tiger

economies  of the East Asia being hailed as  the  fastest

growing and most promising economic region in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these favourable developments however came to an

abrupt  end with the Asian financial crisis in  1998  and

the  meltdown of the dot.com and technology boom  in  the

United  States  in  2000.  As the United  States  is  the

growth  locomotive of the world's economy, a slowdown  in

the  United States has repercussions not only within  the

United States but also throughout the world.  When the US

economy   began  to  slow  down  in  2000,  the   initial

expectation among many economists was that it would  take

perhaps 18 months, at most 24 months, for the slowdown to

run  its  course  and after that, the  US  economy  would

settle to a new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>



base from which it would grow again.  What is clear today

is  that this period of adjustment is going to be  longer

than had been expected in 2001 or even earlier this year.

How  long this period of adjustment will be is a question

which is perplexing the best economic minds in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the US slowdown are being felt

throughout the world, including in Singapore.  Due to the

impact  of  the  US  slowdown and the stagnation  of  the

region's economies, our economy turned down sharply  with

negative growth last year and slow growth this year.   In

view  of the current economic and security uncertainties,

the outlook for the Singapore economy is cloudy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even after the world economy has recovered,

Singapore   will   be   faced  with  different   economic

circumstances  from those we enjoyed  during  the  1990s.

For  one  thing, there will be more competition with  the

entry  of China into the world market.  In the long  run,

China  will make a positive contribution to world  growth

with  its  large domestic market.  But in  the  immediate

future, China will present fierce competition for foreign

investments.   With its large reserves of skilled  labour

at  very low cost, China will exert deflationary pressure

on  prices world-wide and be a strong economic competitor

to  countries throughout the world, including  Singapore.

As  a small open economy, Singapore will have to continue

to  rely on attracting multi-national corporations (MNCs)

to locate their operations, particularly manufacturing in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the competition, we have fortunately been

able  to  hold  our  own  in  attracting  foreign  direct

investments  (FDIs).   EDB  expects  manufacturing  fixed

asset  investment commitment this year to remain at about

S$9  billion,  with  more  than  two-thirds  coming  from

foreign  investors.  However, to progress ahead, we  need

to move up the value chain and restructure our economy to

complement  our MNC base with a larger base  of  domestic

enterprises  and  entrepreneurial  companies.    As   our

economy  becomes more sophisticated, our  people  require

different  skills to survive and thrive in an environment

of rapid and drastic change.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At independence, what Singapore needed to do was to

industralise  rapidly  to  create  a  large   number   of

relatively  unsophisticated  jobs  to  absorb  the  large

number  of  Singaporeans who were unemployed or  entering

the  workforce.  In the 1970s and the 1980s, we moved  up

the  skill  and  value chain, attracting industries  that

needed   large   numbers  of  trained  technicians   with

technical skills at the polytechnic and the Institute  of

Technical  Education  level.  As our  enterprises  became

more  capital-intensive  and sophisticated,  and  as  the

supply  marketing chain became more integrated  into  the

world's  logistics, it became necessary for us to educate

more  professionals with university degrees.   Now,  with

the  knowledge-based economy and our move into new  areas

like  the  life sciences, we not only need better-trained

and innovative people, but also people with post-graduate

education at the Masters and PhD levels.  All these  will

ensure that we can keep ahead of the competition of  low-cost countries like our neighbours and China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an uncertain economic climate, it will also be

more  difficult  for companies to rely on products  which

have  long  production runs.  Companies will have  to  be

flexible and change their products more frequently.  This

puts  a  premium on having Singaporeans who are not  only

well-educated but who also have a flexible frame of  mind

and  a nimbleness to cope with more rapid changes in  the

business  and  economic  environment.   Sir,  in  today's

world,  competency in skills is necessary but  no  longer

sufficient  for  economic success.  For  our  economy  to

succeed, our people need not only to be skilled but  also

be flexible and innovative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new junior college curriculum and diversified

upper secondary school system seek to nurture flexibility

and   innovation  in  our  students  by  making  the   JC

curriculum  more broad-based and providing more  latitude

for  our schools and junior colleges to provide education

programmes  that  are better tailored to  the  needs  and

capabilities  of  their respective cohorts  of  students.

The  new  system is a radical departure from the  present

system

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>



where  the scope for a junior college or secondary school

to go its own way is kept within fairly narrow latitudes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new system, more initiatives will be given to

junior  colleges and secondary schools to decide  how  to

teach  subjects  and  how to prepare their  students  for

school-leaving or university entrance examinations.  Sir,

implementing  the new system will not be easy.   A  whole

generation  of  teachers will have to be  re-educated  in

order  to  teach  the new curriculum and, eventually,  we

will  need  our  own  examination  system  in  order   to

complement  the  new  JC curriculum and  upper  secondary

school  structure.  Constructing a new examination system

is difficult for a small country like Singapore.  MOE has

wisely chosen to continue to work with the University  of

Cambridge,  Local  Examination  Syndicate,  to  keep  the

Singapore-Cambridge   "A"   level   brand   name    while

implementing  the new JC curriculum and  upper  secondary

school  structure to allow schools to take various routes

to prepare their students to sit for a variety of school-leaving    examinations   including   the   "A"   levels,

International Baccalaureate or the American SAT I and II.

With  more  experience,  we will eventually  be  able  to

settle  on our own examination system which is  not  only

rigorous and appropriate for our own needs but which will

be internationally recognised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new upper secondary school system also provides

for  the introduction of private schools.  I welcome this

initiative  because  it promotes  competition.   We  have

developed  our  national  secondary  schools  and  junior

colleges  to  a stage where they are world-class.   I  am

confident that our junior colleges and secondary  schools

will  be  able  to  meet  the  competition  from  private

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, MOE could also consider allowing

more  flexibility  in  allowing Singaporean  children  to

attend  foreign systems schools.  This will help to  ease

the worries of returning Singaporeans about the education

of  their  children  and will spur  our  own  schools  to

achieve new heights of excellence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Mr Speaker, Sir, we need a new junior

college  curriculum and upper secondary school  structure

because  the  world  has changed.   If  we  continue  the

present  system, making adjustments when necessary,  this

will  only  defer  the changes which will  ultimately  be

necessary.   It is better for us to grasp the  nettle  by

the  thorns and change the system so that we can keep our

education  system abreast and up-to-date and prepare  our

students to face the future with confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we embark into the 21st century, these changes to

the  junior college curriculum and upper secondary school

structure will be among the most important steps that  we

can make in the process of remaking Singapore.  Much work

lies ahead for the Ministry of Education to translate the

proposed   changes   into   workable   procedures.    But

notwithstanding the bumpy road ahead, I urge all  Members

of  this  House not to let down our children but to  have

the  courage  to attack this problem head-on and  endorse

changes proposed in the MOE's report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>JUNIOR COLLEGE/UPPER SECONDARY EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like to use the following  three

criteria to evaluate the recommendations of this report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, are the recommendations of this report in

keeping with the direction of the time?  Secondly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



of  different strengths with opportunities to  give  full

play  to  their potential?  Thirdly, does  it  result  in

disadvantages for the weaker students?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in this motion before the House, this report

proposes  a  general  educational  direction  to   better

develop the students' thinking, communication skill,  and

engage  students in greater breadth of learning to create

greater  diversity  and  to  open  new  pathways  in  the

JC/Upper  Secondary education to cater to  the  different

strengths and interests of students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrival of the era of new knowledge-intensive economy, technology is advancing at a very fast

pace,  and  globalisation has created a lot of challenges

for  the  various economies. Singapore too  cannot  avoid

facing such challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Workers' Party's 1994 Manifesto,

our  educational perspective is that if  we  educate  our

people  so  that they have thinking skills and  cultivate

their accounting and design capabilities, it would be  an

impetus  for our economic growth. We also feel  that  the

education  system  should allow for more  autonomy,  more

participation  by the teachers and the parents,  so  that

there will be a more creative learning environment in our

schools,  and  the  educational  content  could  be  more

diversified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general educational direction in this report and

the   motion   before  this  House  coincide   with   the

educational   perspective   in   our   Workers'   Party's

Manifesto,  and is in keeping with the direction  of  the

time. I would, in principle, support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must ask, "To whom is the educational

direction proposed by this Junior College/Upper Secondary

Education  Review  Report  targeted  at?  What  are   the

objectives?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Education has mentioned, it is

targeted  at  the  students.   This  report  proposes   a

"through-train" system built on the premise that the  top

5%  students  in  the  PSLE examinations  would  have  no

problem  getting  through the "A" level examinations.  In

other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



words,  this through-train system is meant for the  elite

who have obtained excellent results in the PSLE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not neglect the long-term impact brought

about by this secondary school through-train system. I am

concerned   with  the  following  problems.   First,   by

deciding the future of the students merely by their  PSLE

results will inevitably generate great pressures  on  the

parents,  the  students  and  the  teachers.   Under  the

present circumstances where so much emphasis is placed on

the  scores, streaming and ranking, an additional  system

whereby  the PSLE results will decide whether the student

would  qualify for the best chance to be admitted to  the

university   will  certainly  intensify  the  competitive

pressure,  resulting in a vicious cycle.  As parents,  if

you  want  your  children to board this through-train  in

order  to  travel farther ahead, you may  have  to  start

educating them even when they are still in their mothers'

womb, otherwise they may not make it in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the reformed junior college curriculum

would  be even more demanding, as students will  have  to

read  more  subjects.  Those who did not do well  in  the

PSLE, and hence missed the through-train, would have only

two  years  in a junior college to prepare  for  the  "A"

level examinations. Would they not be handicapped?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The through-train system enables the better students

to  have ample time. They are exempted from the "O" level

examinations, and have a longer period of time  to  start

early   in   their   preparation  for   the   "A"   level

examinations.  On the other hand, those who  did  not  do

well in the PSLE will have just two years to  prepare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, this through-train system will broaden

the  students'  scope of learning and will inspire  their

creativity  and  cultivate  their  independent   thinking

skills.  It also enables the colleges to be more flexible

in  determining the pace of learning and the  arrangement

of  subject  combinations.  However,  under  the  present

circumstances whereby so much importance is attached

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>



examination  results, what assurance is  there  that  the

colleges,  the students, and the parents will not  demand

and   make  use  of  this  opportunity  to  advance   the

preparation   of   the  students  for   the   "A"   level

examinations, so that they will score even more As?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, if we set the examination papers based on

the  standard of the students in the through-train system

and  their syllabus, then those who have missed the train

will  be at a distinct disadvantage.  Is it fair to them?

After  all,  what  is the purpose of this  JC  curriculum

reform?   Is  it meant to favour those students  who  did

well  in their PLSE so that they stand better chances  of

getting  into  the university, and to make it  even  more

difficult for those who did not do well in the PSLE?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, with the implementation of these

recommendations, Singapore will have a  new  category  of

integrated  high schools.  All these integrated  schools,

which admit only qualified "through-train" students, will

become  elite  schools.   Their  students  will  have  no

opportunity  to  interact with students in  the  ordinary

schools.  This will result in the disintegration  of  our

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, many of the likely through-train schools,

such  as  ACS and Chinese High School are boys'  schools.

Would this make it more difficult for the girls to get on

board the through-train?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, teaching resources. To attain the

objectives  of  the  through-train  system,  a   lot   of

adjustments have to be made on the teaching methods.  Our

current  lot  of teachers were trained in the traditional

pedagogy.   How is MOE going to resolve this  problem  of

teaching resources?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I agree with the general

direction  of this motion, and I agree that the  through-train  system  will better develop the potential  of  the

students,  I  think  the problems brought  about  by  the

actual  implementation of this through-train system  will

result  in  more defects than merits. I think MOE  should

conduct further studies on the solutions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



so  that  the  implementation of  these   recommendations

would attain the predestined goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report has also recommended the establishment of

specialised independent schools to cater to students with

talents in specific fields, so that they could be trained

to  fully develop their special abilities.  I agree  with

this  recommendation.  As for the setting up  of  private

schools,  some  people feel that, apart  from  migration,

this  may be an avenue to get round the problem  of   the

mother tongue requirement. Although I welcome the setting

up  of  private schools to offer the parents more choices

and   to   facilitate    the  formulation   of   creative

educational  concepts, I must urge  MOE  to  compulsorily

require all private schools to comply with the Ministry's

bilingual  policy. Students in the private  schools  must

also  attain the minimum standard in their mother  tongue

language  before they can advance further. The Government

must  adhere  to  this  policy. Otherwise,  there  is  an

absolute possibility that the private schools will become

a  Pandora's box. The other problem likely to arise  with

the   independent schools is that they may  develop  into

aristocratic schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that if the Government recognises that the

purpose  of education is to enable the people to  have  a

better  understanding of the world they live in, so  that

they would be able to make wise decisions and live better

lives,  then it should, first of all, change its attitude

of  giving  high priority to the elite in  our  education

system, and change the objective of using education as  a

means to train and develop the human resources needed for

the new economy. The Government should look at the entire

education  system from a higher angle, to comprehensively

raise  the educational quality of our people. The  entire

education package should be reviewed at a macro level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this reform is targeted at the junior

college  and  higher secondary curriculum   so  that  our

students will have more broad-based learning to deal with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



the  rapidly  changing times, with  a  recommendation  to

promote cross-discipline curriculum structure, we  should

pay even more attention to the fact that providing cross-discipline  curriculum alone is not enough to  train  our

students to possess better ability to achieve mastery  of

the  subjects.  We  need to have also a  big  environment

conducive to this principle of learning, a batch of like-minded educationalists, and a brand-new set of assessment

criteria.    MOE should proceed to create  this  kind  of

environment  so  that  this reform could  be  implemented

effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think MOE should also consider conducting a review

on  the primary and secondary school curriculum as  well,

so  that there will be continuity in our entire education

system.  At the same time, it should also review  whether

there  is  a  need  to  carry on with  the  Primary  Four

streaming. I would also suggest that MOE study  into  the

possibility of having a through-train from primary school

to secondary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the impact of the recommendations of this

report  on  the general student population  is  not  very

great, as students who have missed the through-train  can

still  take the 'O' level, proceed to the junior  college

or   upper  secondary,  and  then  take  the  'A'   level

examinations  after  two  or  three  years.    This   new

curriculum will be implemented only in 2006 to  give  MOE

enough  time  to make the necessary preparation.  What  I

emphasise is that, in any kind of reform, those  students

who  are  unable  to quickly adapt to  the  changes  will

inevitably be affected. We should be sympathetic  towards

these students and offer them some buffering avenues,  so

that  they  will  not  be sacrificed  in  this  necessary

educational reform or be made guinea pigs under  the  new

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

like  the  other colleagues in this House, I support  the

motion in the name of the Minister for Education for  the

reform  of  our education system.  I am a member  of  the

Review Committee.  When I was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



working on the review and talking to the various parties,

I  noticed  that  everyone  we  talked  to  -   from  the

academia,  private sector, entrepreneurs  themselves  and

professionals  -  unanimously supported the idea that  we

should  reform and introduce new changes to our  JC/Upper

Secondary  schools.  Everyone knows  that  the  world  is

changing, the economy is changing.  As a Chinese  proverb

said, before a storm, there will be strong winds blowing.

We  all  feel the wind, and know we must prepare for  the

rain.  We  must retool and rebuild. All these  will  take

time.  So we must plan and prepare early, and allow  time

for implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the professionals and the educationists, the

teachers  and principals, the people stand  to  face  the

greatest  impact with the changes, are also  prepared  to

face  the  changes,  albeit with some apprehension.  They

unanimously  agree  that we must change,  and  change  we

must, whatever the difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am very glad to note that Mr Low Thia

Khiang too supports this motion, in principle.  I believe

this  motion  before  the House will  get  the  unanimous

support  of Members.  The main consideration  is  on  its

implementation.  We must implement it well.  The Ministry

of  Education  has  given itself  4-5  years  to  do  the

important  preparatory work, and will not  implement  the

changes  hastily. This is an admirable spirit.  In  fact,

our  education system has been good and praised by  many.

We  are  only  talking about adjusting the JC  and  upper

secondary  school  system to face the  challenge  of  the

times.   It is essential that the motion gets our  strong

support, so that our professionals in MOE and the schools

and   JCs   would   be   able  to  concentrate   on   the

implementation of these changes in the next 4 to 5 years,

without having to look back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To implement such changes, we will, of course, have

to  take care of some concerns.  For example, will  there

be  too  much  emphasis on elitism?   Will  there  be  an

increase  in  stress  on  our  students?   On  the  first

question, I think the Minister of State Dr Ng Eng Hen has

already explained very clearly that in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



past  20-odd  years, under this education  system,  there

were  fewer  and  fewer  dropouts, reaching  almost  zero

level.  If our education system is tinted towards looking

after  the elite, then there will not be such an outcome.

So  we  can  accept the assurance given by MOE  that  our

educational  direction will not be focusing too  much  on

the  elitist.  Having taken care of the masses,  however,

we   should   also  give  our  strongest   students   the

opportunity to give full play to their potential so  that

they  can  become more creative, more innovative,  to  be

able to compete better in the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is on stress and pressure. We

must  understand what stress is and who generates stress.

I  feel that the so-called stress is not because you have

too   much  work  to  do.  Too  much  workload  does  not

necessarily  lead  to  pressure.  For  some  people,  the

greater  the workload the happier they are.  If  you  ask

them  to  sit  down  and do nothing, that  would  be  the

greatest  stress. So more work does not necessarily  mean

greater  stress. Stress is a feeling of helplessness,  of

not knowing what to do. I hope that parents, like many of

us,  must fully understand this point.  We must help  our

children  to handle stress.  Is stress generated  because

we  have  too high expectations on them, and  hence  they

feel  helpless  and do not know what to do  as  they  are

afraid of letting us down?  They cannot do what they want

to  do, and they have to do what we want them to do.  Put

ourselves  in  their  shoes, and we  can  understand  the

stress they face. So I hope that as parents, we should be

rational in handling our expectations on our children  so

as  not  to  put unreasonable stress on them.  Times  are

different  from  the past. When I was  young,  my  father

asked me to study well, study properly.  He told me this,

"If you do not study properly you will end up working  as

a coolie.  As a coolie life is very, very tough."  During

his  time, in his village, there were probably  only  two

persons who did not have to work in the paddy field.  One

was the village head and the other was the village school

teacher.  Apart from these two, everyone else would  have

to  work  in  the  paddy field.  So the choice  then  was

between working in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



the  field and studying hard. Both are hard work, but  to

many the choice is quite obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have more choices than that now. If we cannot

jump  on  the  through-train, we  can  still  have  other

regular channels of education through which you can go to

the  JC, and then the university.  Or, we can go overseas

to  further  your  studies.   Many of  our  parliamentary

colleagues  here have mentioned examples of students  who

left  Singapore  to  study overseas, and  did  very  well

because our good education system had prepared them well.

So  in  our  education system, all roads  lead  to  Rome.

There  are successful role models in every channels.  For

polytechnic students, they have a model in Sim Wong  Hoo.

He   is  a polytechnic, and definitely an elite.  He  may

not  have  an university education, but his products  are

well  known  throughout the world.  Everybody  knows  the

name "Creative".  Can you say that he is not an elite?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must understand that in Singapore's education

system, all roads lead to Rome.  If you want to become an

elite  there  are many, many roads for you to  take.   So

long as you are prepared to work hard, try it out, you do

not  necessarily  need to go on the through-train.   Will

our children who cannot go on the through-train be called

a  non-elite, and have to till the land, work  the  farm?

There  is no such thing.  There are other routes to take.

They  can still succeed by other routes.  So I hope  that

parents  like  us  must be rational in  looking  at  this

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must understand that, with the proposed changes

in  our  JC/Upper  Secondary  education  system,  MOE  is

introducing more channels, more routes for us  to  choose

from.  Of course, if there are many choices, it may  also

lead  to  some stress, because there can be a feeling  of

helplessness arising from not knowing which road to take.

I  remember  when  I first went to the US,  I  wanted  to

install  a  telephone-line. I was told that I have  three

sets of numbers to choose from.  Back home, in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



the  1980s,  we  had no freedom to choose  the  telephone

number  you wanted.   So, I felt a little stressed  then.

So  too many  choices could lead to stress, that is  when

we  do  not  know how to choose.  But in reality,  having

more  choices  is good. It is having no  choice  that  is

really  stressful. The many options open to the  children

will  give them opportunities to do even better for their

future.   If  they are unable to go on the through-train,

we  should  not  force them.  They need  not  be  on  the

through-train.  There are other ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JCs may want to have their own characteristics.

They  all try to be creative.  They want to emphasise  on

culture,  the arts, etc. So they offer more  choices.  We

must  learn how to make choices, and we can benefit  from

the advantage of having many options. If you say I do not

care  how  many roads there are, I just want to take  one

particular road, then when you find that you cannot  make

it,  you will be very stressed.  The stress can be  quite

unbearable and it is a self-generated kind of stress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that through these changes which would bring

about   creativity   and  innovation,   Singapore   would

gradually  evolve  into  a really gracious  metropolitan,

where all the flowers bloom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now a population of 3 million. If tomorrow,

Singapore suddenly disappears, what would the world  have

missed?  Perhaps Singapore Airlines, and perhaps Creative

Technology.   That  is  about all.   I  cannot  think  of

anything else which the world would feel have lost.  But,

if  tomorrow, Scotland disappears, what would  the  world

miss? Scotland has a population of about 5 million,  less

than  twice of ours.  They would miss the game  of  golf,

the  biscuit  called  shortbread, the  unique  kilts  and

bagpipers, it's the song of Auld Lang Syne, and the drink

of  whiskey.   So there are many things which  the  world

would miss if Scotland were to disappear.  And these  are

the  products of their culture and marketing  skills.  We

have not reached that level of culture.  But through  our

continuous efforts to go up, to diversify, to be flexible

in  all other fields of arts and culture, I think one day

we will also reach

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



the  stage  that despite our small 3 million  population,

we  contribute  to  the  world in  such  a  way  that  if

Singapore   should  disappear,  the  world   would   miss

something important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that of late, the morale of our people is

generally not very high. We worry about retrenchment,  we

are  concerned  with  unemployment.   But,  we  have   to

remember the big picture, and be bold enough to plan  for

necessary changes, and have the drive to bring about  the

changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I reaffirm my support to this motion. I

also  hope  all  of us in this House give it  our  strong

support,  so that the professionals, the principals,  and

the teachers will go full steam ahead without worries  to

do  a  good  job.  This  will be a  new  chapter  in  the

development of education in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Clarification from the

Minister of State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): The Minister of State referred to the

question of pressure and said that we should look  at  it

rationally  and take it easy.  I would like to  tell  him

that  it  is always easier said that done.  He said  that

those  who cannot go on the through-train can go overseas

for  their  studies.  This is not easy.  To go  overseas,

you need money, lots of money.  If you have no money, you

cannot  even  cross a river, how do you go overseas.   He

also  mentioned  that  Sim Wong  Hoo  was  a  polytechnic

graduate.   But  he must not forget that Sim  Wong  Hoo's

success is ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, what is the clarification you are seeking?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am seeking

clarification  on what the Minister of  State  has  said.

Does  he not agree that the opportunity given to  Mr  Sim

for  the breakaway success was when he was in the  United

States and not in Singapore?  He also mentioned that with

too  many  options,  he  was troubled  and  it  became  a

pressure to him.  I think Mr Chan should consider himself

lucky  that  he has the opportunity to be presented  with

many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



choices.  To me, it is having no option that presents the

greatest pressure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

hope  that Mr Low Thia Khiang will not look down  on  the

polytechnic  students.   When  I  was  working   on   the

Singapore 21 project, I had the opportunity to  speak  to

many  young  people.   I  observed that  the  polytechnic

graduates    were    very    aggressive.     They    were

entrepreneurial,  strong in their spirit,  even  stronger

than  the  University graduates.  I  asked  some  of  the

polytechnic graduates why this was so.  They told me that

they had two options after their graduation.  One was  to

fight  it  out like Sim Wong Hoo who was their  idol  and

role model.  The other option was to be contented with  a

$3,000-$4,000 salary job and live in a 5-room flat.   So,

if  you want to strike it big, you fight for it.  I  hope

that  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang will not  look  down  on  the

polytechnic  graduates.  As for the  so-called  pressure,

let me tell him a story.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encouraged my son to take up a third language, the

Malay language. When he was in Secondary 3, he said  that

it  was  too much pressure for him and he wanted to  drop

it.   I asked him why.  He said that the teacher was  not

good, and that it was likely that he would fail his  oral

examination.   I  told  him not to  worry,  and  that  by

acquiring  one additional language he would have  another

passport, one more path to take.  I told him that it  was

not necessary to strive for an A1, just manage a pass,  a

C6  would do.  Maybe it is a smaller passport but  it  is

one  extra passport.  He said, "Let me try."  In the end,

he  succeeded.   So  one extra path, a  little  bit  more

pressure, but it is worth it!

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I clarify

because  the Minister of State has misunderstood  what  I

said?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): I would like to clarify that I am

not  looking  down  at  the  polytechnic  graduates.    I

actually respect our polytechnic graduates.  They may  be

our enterpreneurs in future.  What I am saying is that in

the  case  of Sim Wong Hoo, did Singapore really  provide

opportunities   for   development  of   the   polytechnic

graduates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



in  the past?  Sim Wong Hoo had to go to US because there

was  hardly  any opportunity available to him  here.   In

order   to   say  that  if  we  have  more  options   for

development,  we  must  give  opportunity  to   everyone,

including non-graduates, to develop and upgrade.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I believe that if we

were  to implement these recommendations proposed by  the

Minister  for Education, in five to 10 years'  time,  our

values  would be changed.  This is something which  is  a

long term endeavour.  We may not yield immediate results.

But  I  think we should support this motion so that there

will be better opportunities for our future generations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we have enough of

clarifications.  Next, Miss Penny Low, please.

<br>4.17 pm

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the Education Review

Committee  attempt to prepare our students  to  face  the

challenges  in the changing global economy.   The  global

economy  today  is  heavily  driven  by  technology   and

innovation - which has revolutionised the way  we  learn,

the  way we live and the way we think.  These innovations

will  continue to change our lifestyles as well as life's

demands.   The  future ahead is both uncertain,  and  yet

filled with opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, education must, in short, prepare our

young to face the future.  In fact, it should aim to give

our   future  generation  a  competitive  edge   in   the

increasingly integrated world.  This is possible with not

just  economic relevance or consciousness, but  also  the

virtue  of a good value system and community spiritedness

built into the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education must help students to become more

efficient and effective, be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



able  to  think creatively and critically, so  that  when

they  are  given  a  series of  choices,  they  can  make

critical  decisions and make the choices, and  equip  our

younger  generation with lifelong skills.  As demands  on

specific  skills  and job types change  at  unprecedented

rates,  it  will  no longer be sufficient  to  train  our

youths in specific skill sets that are narrowly defined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I am heartened to know that the proposed

changes aim at a broad-based education which includes the

introduction  of  subjects  like  Knowledge  and  Inquiry

skills.   I am also heartened to know that a more diverse

landscape  with  at  least  three  new  routes  will   be

introduced.   I  am, however, not so heartened  to  learn

that  the  three new routes as well as the Knowledge  and

Inquiry skills will only be made available to the regular

group  of  creme  de la creme.  If it is  good,  why  not

engineer it into the mainstream education?  Why  stop  at

the  top  10% for the Integrated Programme Schools  which

may also benefit the not so examination-savvy type?  Does

this  imply  that the proposed changes will only  benefit

those who qualify for JC, ie, 25% of each cohort, and the

10%  that  qualify for the Integrated Programme  Schools?

If  so,  then there is really no significant overhaul  in

the  curricula  for  the majority of students  undergoing

secondary  education.  In other words,  despite  all  the

good  intentions  of the changes, the  majority  of  each

cohort  will  still  be 'stuck' in the current  education

system  which may not prepare them sufficiently  for  the

new challenges ahead.  It will be difficult to battle new

grounds with old weapons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope MOE would perhaps run that 10% as a pilot

scheme with the intention of incorporating the Integrated

Programme School system into the mainstream structure, if

found to be suitable.  I also hope that, for a start, the

schools elected in the IP School system would comprise  a

good  mix  of  schools  from  both  the  elites  and  the

neighbourhood schools.  I think the demonstration  effect

of such a scheme would be far reaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since many of my colleagues in this House have

spoken extensively on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



possible   social   effects  of  the  proposed   changes,

especially  on the topic of adding more stress  into  the

current system and even possible elitism, I shall refrain

from repeating the arguments here.  I will, however,  add

that  any  attempt at creating a level playing  field  or

creating  a totally egalitarian society may be an  uphill

task, as each individual is differently gifted.  Hence, a

good  education system must aim to bring out the best  in

the  individual,  and  allow room  for  them  to  blossom

according  to their gifts.  The focus should then  be  on

whether  the  proposed  changes  retard  or  improve   an

individual's potential to be the best that he/she can be.

My  sense is, on paper, the proposed changes will improve

the   current   system,  provided  more  flexibility   is

exercised in the implementation.  The devil, I am afraid,

may lie in the implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crux would be whether we are ready for these

changes.   To quote William Shakespeare, "All things  are

ready,  if  our minds be so."  The proposed  changes  are

significant  and  constitute  a  paradigm  shift  in  the

established education system.  However, for any change to

take  place, there must be a certain amount of belief  in

the  changes and a momentum that is built up.  The  speed

of  change  is  directly correlated to  the  momentum  of

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corollary, the better convinced and prepared the

various  players  in  this equation are,  and  that  will

include the principals, teachers, MOE personnel, parents,

students  and the society at large, then the  faster  and

higher the chances of success would be.  As such, I would

like  the  Minister to comment on the  current  state  of

readiness  of  these  various  players,  especially   the

principals,  teachers, and even MOE  personnel  and  also

whether the parents and students have been told about the

changes and explained to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher readiness is pivotal to the success of the

proposed changes.  In the new economy, the teachers' role

has shifted from that of a content provider to that of  a

facilitator.  Today, with easy access to the Internet and

other  media, there is information overload even  at  the

school level.  Therefore, a teacher plays a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



vital  role  in  helping students direct and  manage  the

content  available on the Internet and other  media.   As

aptly  put  by  a  John  Naisbitt, "We  are  drowning  in

information but starved for knowledge".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, a teacher should be able to

groom,  inspire and spot talent and further help  develop

and  guide  these  talented students  to  maximise  their

potential.  It has been said that it is harder  to  teach

old  dogs  new tricks.  So while the students  may  adapt

faster to the changes, the teachers may find it difficult

to  acquire some new teaching techniques and habits,  let

alone  exercise them.  Hence, I would like MOE to comment

on  what  measures are in the pipeline to  help  teachers

plug  into this new system and whether MOE would consider

the  'external  consultant' approach to  jump  start  the

shift in thinking and habits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to move my focus to an area which

is  somewhat  less  talked about, that  is,  of  a  value

system.   Education which stops short  at  economics  and

efficiency  may  prove  to  be  the  greatest  menace  of

society.  In the words of Martin Luther King Junior, "the

most dangerous criminal may be the men gifted with reason

but with no morals".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us learn some lessons from the United States.

The  recent scandals in the corporate America are lessons

in  which our education system can draw upon.  As  highly

intelligent  men conspire to cheat, there can  be  severe

repercussions on the whole capitalist system in which the

global  economy  operates.  We saw how  Arthur  Anderson,

Enron,  WorldCom,  amongst the others,  fell  from  grace

globally  within a few months, wiping some US$5  trillion

in  market value.  This cost is equivalent to an  average

of US$60,000, or S$106,200, in losses.  These huge losses

are caused only by a handful of people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, apart from good institutions and laws in our

country,  we  need most of all good people.  People  with

good  values and ethics, people with integrity.  As  part

of  the  total education, our education system should  be

broad-based enough to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



encompass these teachings.  The report, I feel, does  not

sufficiently address how it will focus on such  teachings

or  even include this value system consideration into the

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ERC, not the Economic Restructuring

Committee,  but the Education Review Committee,  gathered

insights  from top schools in the UK, US, Hong  Kong  and

China, it would also be useful to note that, in Thailand,

a  ministerial committee is developing a system to record

the  "goodness"  of high school students.   Colleges  and

universities country-wide will take the goodness  records

into  account  when deciding whom to  admit.   They  have

realised  that to admit students with high  morals  would

also be one way of eradicating corruption in the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we do not face serious corruption problems

in   our  country,  this  system  nonetheless  encourages

students to be good and maintain moral integrity.   I  am

not suggesting that we adopt exactly the same system.   I

am saying that these are important components.  We, in  a

multi-racial Singapore, have shared and common values and

if  we  can  inculcate  some of  these  values  into  the

education  system,  we can then benefit  our  society  at

large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education on our shared values can also do greater

good  in  highlighting common traits amongst us, although

being  people of diverse cultures and religions, to  come

together  as  one  people, one nation and  one  Singapore

caring  for each other, crossing all boundaries.  This  I

feel  should be part of the total education in  which  we

impart to our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education system in the country can also play a

role  in nation building by inculcating a sense of  civic

consciousness,  ie, a sense of community  and  rootedness

and  promote  the  spirit  of active  citizenry  with  an

objective of bringing about a gracious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools can play an important role in building a

gracious community and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



promoting  active citizenry through active  participation

and  engagement in community activities.  Currently, most

links  between the schools and the community are at  best

loose  and ad hoc.  There is more that can be  done.   We

should  devise  ways, schemes to engage and  tap  on  the

energy  of  students and expose them in a more meaningful

fashion   through  the  community.   Instead  of  one-off

projects  with "term" engagement, we should prolong  this

"engagement  process" which can continuously  take  place

from primary school to university, thereby cultivating  a

lifelong  relationship  between  the  community  and  the

individual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some suggestions here:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Schools can work with grassroots organisations

(GROs)  to  contribute and improve the  neighbourhood  or

community that they are situated in.  The objective is to

get  the  students integrated into the GRO.  One possible

example would be to link the NPCC or NCC to the CDEC,  so

that  students get real world experience in their  weekly

drills  and simultaneously learn more about the community

that  they  live in or serve.  This process of engagement

between  community  could  be  built  into  the  school's

curriculum on "Life Skills".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) They could link project works directly to

community - research work.  For example, students can  be

asked to research on how the community operates, ie,  the

functions, the impact and the importance of each organism

in the community eco-system.  This could include the role

of    community   centres,   town   councils,    business

organisations, VWOs, and so on, and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project works can further incorporate hands-on

participation  where, in such activities, students  would

be  given the experience and exposure to work with  these

various  organisms.  This way, they would also learn  the

skills  of  communication beyond that of their peers  and

their  school environment.  They would have what we  call

experiential learning built into the school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) They could also learn and suggest solutions to

current real-life challenges

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



that are faced by the community.  Student task forces can

be  formed to tackle the common issues on transportation,

environmental problems, crime prevention, or even finding

ways  and  means to help the needy within the  community.

They can then present their findings, either in a written

or  oral  presentation, and such presentations should  be

looked  at  seriously  and  given  a  certain  amount  of

weightage.   In  other words, they  should  not  be  seen

purely  as  ECA  that is not relevant  to  their  overall

academic performance.  It should, however, not add stress

to the system by giving them an examination at the end of

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to incorporate some of these schemes,

I  believe that most students will then be able to  learn

to  think  out  of  the  box,  to  think  creatively  and

critically,  because  when they are  doing  syllabus  and

subject matters that are close to their heart where  they

are  living  in  or in the community that they  live  in,

chances  are  it  would help them to  identify  with  the

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people become interested in the events and

happenings  in the community and society, and where  they

have made efforts to improve the community they live  in,

in  the  long run, we will be able to build  a  sense  of

belonging,  of rootedness and we will have  a  population

that  is not being accused of being bo-chap, which  means

they do not care.  Perhaps we will have citizens who will

always care for the community that they live in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be the kind of heartstrings that we want

to  form, that will tie us to our friends, neighbours and

the  community  that we belong to.   These  will  be  the

stayers who will have a bond with Singapore wherever they

may  be  in  this world.  For many years,  our  education

system  and our society have focused on building economic

strings,  job  strings and asset strings.   We  must  now

realise  that  in  this age and time of a  highly  mobile

population,  where our citizens possess the language  and

the  passport  to the world, it is only the  heartstrings

that  will continue to bond us to Singapore and  make  us

feel like sons and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



What  better  place  to  start than  with  the  education

system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the changes recommended will

prepare  students as leaders, innovators and citizens  of

tomorrow.  For it to work well, all the partners  in  the

education system must come together and work together  to

provide  our students with this total education  to  help

them to attain not just academic excellence but also life-long skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the greatest impact that these changes

will have will be on our young and on Singapore's future.

As such, I think it would be good for us to know who they

are, what they are like and how they think, to gauge  the

suitability of the proposed changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be useful to note from none other than the

man  in  touch with youth culture, the President  of  MTV

Asia,  Mr  Frank  Brown.   He refers  to  today's  young,

today's 3G, as the "Dual Passport Generation".  He  notes

that  Asia's 3G these days value their individuality  and

are   completely  comfortable  with  modern   consumerist

experience.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They can multi-task - watch more TV, do more on the

computer and read more magazines - all at the same  time.

They can be both local and cosmopolitan simultaneously  - there is no identity crisis.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, he goes further to disagree with

Harvard   don  Robert  Putnam's  term  "blowing   alone",

referring  to  the  3G  as people who  prefer  to  remain

passively  disengaged, rather than join any  clubs  of  a

grassroots,  commercial,  industrial,  moral  or  serious

nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people today, says Frank Brown, are more

active  than any previous generation in terms  of  social

communication   and   community.    If   Frank    Brown's

observations are correct, then the proposed changes which

we  seek  to implement, which encourage a diverse  broad-based  education,  and  if we can  incorporate  community

spiritedness value system into the system, then  I  think

it  will be suitable for the type of people whom we  seek

to provide this education to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us then, as Members of this House and leaders of

today,  capitalise  on this spirit and  vibrancy  of  our

youth  in designing for our students an education  system

that  will equip them with a blend of academic  and  non-academic  skills  coupled with  moral  values  and  civic

consciousness,  thereby  making  them  good  leaders  and

citizens  of  tomorrow.   Only then  can  we  ensure  the

survival of our country, our nation, our Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak  on

this  motion.  I wish to speak in support of this  motion

standing in the name of the Minister for Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no quarrel with the intention of the Report

to  develop  thinking and communication  skills  for  our

students in upper secondary and junior colleges, as  well

as  to  provide a wider range of subjects  and  areas  of

learning  for our students.  The diversity we require  in

knowledge and thinking processes cannot be doubted.   The

mark  of  our Ministry of Education's mandate as well  as

the slogan of "Thinking Schools and Learning Nation",  as

first  articulated in 1997, can be said to be  milestones

in the development of our education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report essentially proposes a wider gradation of

the  education system to give depth and width to a larger

group of our students.  There will be new subjects at  H3

level, and new subjects of learning for the new system of

examinations.  This is good.  After all, any  old  system

of  examination developed decades ago, having  served  us

well, should give way to newer ones, more suitable,  more

relevant  to the time.  The world after all is not  quite

the same, and knowledge has exploded in this period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the Report, we are introduced to new

areas  of  enquiry,  communication skills,  language  and

knowledge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



skills, humanities and the Arts, mathematics and science.

An Integrated Programme Structure of six years through to

complete  pre-university  will replace  the  present  4-2

system.   How  can we quarrel with learning more  things,

learning  deeper  about  things, talking  and  discussing

about  them  in an intelligent way?  How can  we  dispute

about the importance of greater diversity in learning for

our students?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A famous philosopher - I think it was Wittgenstein - once said: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one does

not  know."  I wonder whether the fact that our  students

are  found  to  be poor in expressing their  thoughts  is

really  due  to  their  language  difficulties,  ie,  the

complexity   of  learning  languages  in  Singapore,   as

mentioned in the Report, or is it because they  have  not

quite  really learnt the subject properly.  Is it because

the  way our subjects are currently being taught and  the

way  we assess them that do not give them much chance for

discussion  and expression in order for them  to  clarify

their  thoughts?  In ancient Greek culture, the  learning

process  centres  on  dialogue.   One  has  to  refer  to

Socrates  and Plato.  I suspect teaching in Singapore  is

more  monologue than anything.  This new system  proposes

to make changes to the current system to give more skills

at  learning or on knowledge acquisition.  I welcome  the

proposal, but I hope we will do it right.  It is quite  a

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can cram our students with content, but what are

they   going  to  do  with  these  contents?   Have  they

understood the facts and how the facts stand in relation,

in  order  to  adequately express what they  think  about

those  facts and the contents they learn?  Do  they  know

what  they  are talking about?  And if they do not  talk,

maybe  they  do  not know.  When will  the  magic  moment

strike  in  thinking when the facts are resolved  into  a

recognition  of  pattern  that can  be  expressed  to  be

something meaningful to the persons listening to you?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning more about content, while good, cannot lead

to  the  act  of creation in engendering  a  new  way  of

looking at the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



causal  relationship  or  the pattern  of  occurrence  of

events.   This capacity for creative imagination  springs

not  just from the analytical process of the human  mind.

It  has to do with perception as much as conception.   It

has  to do with what the mind can see than what the  mind

can think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning about facts alone will not necessarily

prepare our kids for the future.  It is the way we relate

the  facts  and  the content that will determine  whether

these  facts  are going to be meaningful to the  students

learning about them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creative thinking is important. New ways of looking

at  things  or  even  inducing  facts  from  observation,

hypothesising anew and challenging sacred cows require  a

new frame of mind.  It is important to teach our children

to  be  creative, to give them room for creative thinking

and  imagination.   Project  work  can  be  a  basis  for

allowing creative imagination, but it depends on  how  we

conduct  the project.  Time must be given to explore  and

challenge  the  usual frame of reference of  our  current

thoughts.  To do this requires a new frame of mind.   The

school  children  should be given  not  the  syllabus  as

important as the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, it is not by saying that we

allow  for  wider  and deeper subject learning  that  the

creative impulse will come.  There must be time and space

allowed for the students' imagination to fallow, incubate

and  envision.   It  depends  on  the  way  we  teach  or

communicate the wonderment of the subject.  It depends on

how we test or evaluate them.  We must give them time  to

explore  and express.  Perhaps the way we evaluate  their

competence ought to be varied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the new facts or content we learn or know

that  will determine whether they are of any use.  It  is

the way we interpret or relate these facts that will lead

to  a  new discovery, new process, new product or  a  new

solution to an age-old problem.  Hence, the new programme

structure, while commendable, is only half the story.  It

is  in the things and the ways we teach that will be more

critical.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



curriculum we develop for this structure and the  way  we

teach  and  evaluate  them  are  equally,  if  not  more,

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I mean? When we study a subject in school

in  Singapore, I dare say we often do not bother or  know

about  the history of a subject - whether it is a science

subject,  the  history  of some scientific  theory  on  a

subject, or the history of economic thought or theories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are interested to learn the current vocabulary

and not bother about the background of how these theories

or  concepts  came about.  Yet, understanding  how  these

current  ideas came about is most important, to know  the

underlying  assumptions,  the beliefs,  the  biases,  the

prejudices sometimes behind many of our ideas.  The great

economist  Keynes once said, "We are often the slaves  to

the ideas of some defunct economists."  Great discoveries

are  often  made  by  challenging  assumptions,  and  the

assumptions lie embedded like fossils in the  old  stone.

Unless  we know the history of the subject or the history

of  the theory, we may well be heading the wrong path, or

not aware of why we think the way we are thinking.  I  am

concerned about this as I see limitations in our  current

curriculum development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To properly cater to the diversity of strength and

interest of our students, we must give them the space  to

learn  and share.  It means more time to cover and  dwell

on  the  subject,  more time to explore and  discuss,  to

think  around the topic.  As long as the system tries  to

jam too many things, the time and space available will be

constrained, and defeats the whole purpose of what it may

be hoping to achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will always be the bright students who will

manage  to  score best in the test or the key performance

indices, but the output may not be the ones we should  be

looking  for, if addressing the challenges of the  future

in education is what we are trying to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average pre-university student today will, in

all probability, know more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



facts about the world or the solar system than Galileo in

his  time.  But we would be kidding ourselves if we think

they are all little Galileos, because the creative genius

is  not  about knowing facts and mastering content alone,

but new ways of imaginatively thinking about them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I would like to support this motion.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to participate in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said on the motion before the House

since yesterday.  The fact that 33 Members have indicated

interest in speaking on the motion speaks volumes of  the

importance of the topic.  Education policies have been in

the hearts and minds of many Singaporeans.  Yesterday, we

heard eloquent speeches from Members, some defending  the

education  system,  others presenting  their  well-argued

criticisms of some parts of the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed education is so dear to all our hearts.

The  changes proposed have far reaching implications  for

our  children.   True to the intent it  was  set  out  to

serve,  the  operative words in the proposed changes  are

flexibility,   diversity,   creativity   -    ingredients

necessary  to  survive in a new innovation-driven  global

economy.  Indeed, each talent needs to be enhanced.   The

proposed  changes  seek  to  prepare  and  develop  these

diverse  talents  through  paths  that  best  suit   each

individual's abilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a lecturer at the university, I find the

proposed  changes to the JC curriculum indeed  very  long

overdue.  I guess the frustration faced by teachers  like

myself is epitomised by the offer made by NUS to run  its

own  secondary school to overcome the problem of students

coming  to NUS expecting to be spoon-fed. Till  today,  I

still  have  difficulty getting students to open  up  and

present their own

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



ideas.  Many are still tongue-tied, expecting me to  give

them  the  "answers" to the discussion topics.   If  ever

they  spoke,  many will be guarded, often trying  to  say

what I want to hear rather than what they actually think.

Are  they thinking individuals?  Well, some are, but most

are   not  thinking  of  their  response  to  the  topics

discussed, but rather thinking of what the teacher  wants

to hear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gross lack of self-confidence in many of

them.   I  am  not  sure  how the proposed  changes  will

address  this lack of confidence among the students  that

come  to  the university.  They are the products  of  the

current  JC system.  Yes, there will be the few who  will

display  confidence naturally.  But, by and  large,  many

that we see do not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes are touted to produce students

who  have  better  thinking and  other  knowledge  skills

including  communication skills.  The recent  changes  in

the  way  the  "A" level examinations are being  designed

test   students'  thinking  skills  where  students   are

encouraged to offer personal views and bring higher-order

skills  of  analysis, synthesis and knowledge application

to  their  reading and writing.  All these are  well  and

good.    But  I  wonder  what  aspect  of  the   proposed

curriculum  changes will develop the  confidence  in  the

students  to  express  their  own  independent  thoughts,

independent of what they think the teachers are thinking.

These  students must be taught to question the  question.

Perhaps  these  skills  are not  taught  but  rather  are

outcomes  from  processes that recognise individuals  for

who  they are and for their own abilities.  It goes  back

to  the  values  that are transmitted within  the  system

itself,  to what extent do we value individual  opinions,

no  matter  how insignificant they may be.  Our  students

are afraid to speak out because they are afraid that what

they  will  say  may be wrong or they may be  saying  the

wrong  thing.  In the complex new world, right  or  wrong

are  in  themselves complex concepts.  One's opinion  may

lead  to  the  right decision today but  wrong  tomorrow.

Successful  entrepreneurs make many wrong  decisions  and

fail before they succeed.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



point  is:  do  we dare to speak up, make a  mistake  and

learn  from  the mistake?  These are important  processes

that must be part of the new system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is critical is the extent to which we develop

this culture of valuing individual ideas and opinions  in

and of themselves.  We should not value the ideas because

the  ideas  bring economic value.  We should  value  them

because  they come from an individual who is  willing  to

share  his thoughts. We value them because we value  each

individual.  Such  processes  will  go  a  long  way   in

developing self-esteem and confidence of our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, pedagogically, it is a new way of looking at

education.   Education is more than just the transmission

of  knowledge,  often  assessed through  the  outcome  of

examinations.  Education is about processes.   We  should

indeed pay equal attention to the processes as we do  the

outcomes.   We  should be conscious of the processes  for

the  best  learning is often done through processing  the

processes.   Assessment should thus not merely  focus  on

the  outcomes but the processes that students go  through

in  their  learning. Sir, I urge MOE to pay attention  to

this  aspect  of education as it implements the  proposed

changes  to  the  JC curriculum, including  training  the

teachers with new teaching methods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the recommendations of the Review

Committee  which  calls for greater  flexibility  in  the

subject combinations that students are able to take.   My

question is how flexible can the JCs be. I hope we do not

end  up  in a situation where, because of limitations  of

space,  time, manpower, it prevents students from  taking

the  subjects  of their choice.  Sir, I am not  sure  the

extent  to  which the range of subjects  offered  by  the

different JCs isimilar.  It is not surprising to find one

JC  developing  a  course  on  biochemistry  and  another

offering theatre studies.  If we are to think out of  the

box  for  a moment, in the name of flexibility, will  the

Ministry  consider  allowing  students  to  take  courses

across JCs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this point is important if we analyse the

potential fate of the students in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



3-year  Centralised Institutes.  Yes, their  numbers  are

small.  And because their numbers are small, it will  not

be  a surprise to find that the range of subjects offered

will  be  lesser  than those in the JCs,  simply  because

there  are  no economies of scale. What is the extent  of

flexibility  that  they  would  have  then?   Will  their

subject combination be limited to the subjects offered by

their   respective  institutions?   Can  the  system   be

flexible enough to allow these students to take a subject

or  two in a JC?  Impossible?  Why not?  Just as the  ERC

Sub-committee  on Enhancing Human Capital  proposed  that

Normal  students be allowed to take one or two "O"  level

subjects,   why  should  we  not  allow  the  Centralised

Institute students to take one or two subjects in the JCs

and  to take their "A" levels for these subjects earlier?

Certainly,  the  interaction with the  JC  students  will

facilitate  further  cross  fertilisation  of  ideas  and

experiences  between  the  students.   It  would   foster

interaction  between  institutions and  help  bring  down

artificial   social  barriers  between   the   supposedly

brighter  JC students and their country cousin  from  the

CIs.   Yes,  it may be an administrative nightmare.   But

since  we are remaking almost everything around  us,  why

not  reconsider this too?  These "A" level  institutions,

the  JCs  and CIs can be clustered such that each cluster

provides  the  widest  range  of  subjects  to  encourage

flexibility in subject combinations.  It is indeed a test

of  our own system's ability to be flexible and adaptable

-  values  that  the  changes hope to  inculcate  in  the

beneficiaries of the new system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard much about the

proposed   Integrated  Programme  or  the   through-train

programme. Sir, just before setting off, the conductor of

an  actual  train will usually invite all  passengers  to

come  on board.  He will shout, "All aboard."  But  sorry

to say, this particular train is only for the top few.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notably, this proposal has drawn the most

attention in the present debate.  Somehow, we often react

at  the slightest indication of a policy that will result

in  differentiating  people.   We  have  heard  arguments

justifying streaming from the Ministry for the  umpteenth

time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



Yesterday,  Assoc.  Prof. Koo Tsai Kee eloquently  argued

that  labelling or stigmatising need not be  present,  if

only  society stops doing so.  He is right that labelling

and  stigmatising are mere social constructions. They are

man-made  and can be deconstructed. But he must  remember

that these are systemic processes that take place in  any

society.  The  social construction is  dependent  on  the

social  structures that exist and the values that prevail

in  any  society.   These  structures  include  the  very

policies  that  we  are talking about today.   Unless  we

deconstruct  our value systems and social structures,  we

cannot  escape from the natural processes of constructing

labels.   The  challenge is to continuously  manage  this

complex  process and evaluate the costs and  benefits  to

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we cannot deny that the proposed

through-train   programme  is   yet   another   streaming

exercise.  Some Members have labelled it as the extension

of the Gifted Education Programme.  The GEP targets 1% of

a  cohort, approximately about 500 students per year. The

through-train programme targets 10% of a cohort  -  about

5,000  per  year.  Sir, in the report, schools  like  RI,

RGS,  ACS, Chinese High School are slated and set to roll

their  through-trains on the fast tracks.  Sir,  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister to provide the socio-economic

profiles of students in these schools who will board  the

through-train.  What proportions of these  students  come

from middle and upper-class backgrounds?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worry is that we are perpetuating further the

already  existing differentiation.  One  may  argue  that

these schools are already in operation all this while and

the  students have been differentiated from the  students

of  neighbourhood schools at present already. So what  is

the problem?  The problem is that with the new programme,

they will be further advantaged, compared to the students

in  the neighbourhood schools.  At this time, we are  not

informed of how much resources will be allocated  to  the

through-train programme but I will be surprised if the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



resources  are  not significantly increased.   Otherwise,

why talk about investing in their talents?  They will  go

even  faster  and  even further from the  rest  of  their

counterparts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do acknowledge that the social divisions due

to  our meritocractic principles are inevitable and have,

in  fact,  been accepted here as a fact of life.  We  are

always separating the bright from the less bright in  the

name of giving each child the potential to develop at his

or  her  own pace.  It is the fundamental nature  of  our

system.  Certainly it serves the needs of the nation  and

the  individual. Why hold someone back  when  he  can  go

faster  than the other?  But have we stopped for a  while

and  asked what is the cost that we may incur if our  top

performers are not interacting with the less bright?   If

we   factor  in  socio-economic  status  (SES)  into  the

equation, we will potentially be in a position where  the

haves are not sufficiently mixing with the have-nots.   I

hope  the Minister can provide the House with the  socio-economic  background of this top 10% students  to  ensure

the  House  that the SES is indeed not a  factor  in  the

equation.    If   the   top  10%  students   are   indeed

predominantly middle and upper class children, I urge the

Ministry  to put in place programmes that will facilitate

greater  exchanges and mixing between these students  and

the  rest of their cohorts.  Let us not widen the gap any

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, the digital divide has been one of the

contentious  outcomes of the streaming  processes.   Some

researchers  in  Britain  have argued  that  low  ability

pupils who are grouped homogenously compared to those who

are   in   mixed  ability  groups  are  less  likely   to

participate   in   school   activities,   exhibit   lower

expectations, experience more disciplinary  problems  and

have  higher  levels  of absenteeism and  non-completion.

Sir,  I do not have the figures, but anecdotal experience

suggests  that  this is not too far away  from  the  case

here.  Perhaps, MCDS can enlighten the House but my sense

is that the higher proportions of juvenile offenders, for

example, are from the academically weaker streams.  As we

focus

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



our  attention on the cream on the top, let us not forget

the  residue  at the bottom.  My experience as  a  social

worker  also suggests that many of them are not  able  to

fit into the structured nature of the educational system.

While  flexibility  has been argued to  benefit  the  top

fliers, have we studied the possibility of providing  the

under-achievers with greater flexibility  too?   Are  our

secondary  schools  equipped  with  the  same  level   of

flexibility?   I encourage MOE to pay attention  to  this

group of Singaporeans whose survival will ensure that  we

are able to consciously narrow the gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said yesterday that

the   through-train  programme  is  targetted  to   allow

students   who   can   do  well  with   less   structured

environment.   As  the target is the  top  10%,  he  thus

alluded  to the fact that the higher performers  will  do

better in less structured environment compared to the not

so high performers.  I am not sure what the basis of such

a  conclusion is.  I would appreciate it if the  Minister

can elaborate on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report indicated that on average, 25% of a

Primary  One  cohort will do their "A"  levels.   If  the

through-train programme is targetted at the top  10%,  it

means that there are still 15% of students who will go on

to  do their "A" levels, albeit after going through their

"O"  levels.  This works out to about 7,500 students  per

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report identified that one of the criteria for

the through-train programme is that it "must add value to

the   education  of  the  students  by  developing  their

capacities  for  creative and critical thinking,  and  by

offering  special leadership development  and  other  co-curricular  programmes.   It must  optimise  the  use  of

students'  time  to  provide them with  opportunities  to

develop  their intellectual curiosity and to ensure  they

acquire a broad-based education."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are indeed qualities that are

relevant  and critical to the new economy.  Indeed,  they

are  very much in line with the objectives of the changes

in  the  new  JC curriculum.  But what it means  is  that

these top 10% of the students will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>



prepared  with  the skills and knowledge that  will  help

them  do  well in their "A" levels and beyond.  Going  by

the  records,  these students will do well in  their  "A"

levels  even  without the through-train  programme.   The

programme will probably enhance their performance at  the

"A"  levels, perhaps just marginally. If these skills are

critical for the 'A' levels examinations and for the  new

economy,  why are we not extending them to the other  15%

who  will end up doing their 'A' levels anyway?   I  have

argued  earlier about the problem we face  today  on  the

transition  from 'A' levels to university education,  and

the  changes  to the JC curriculum aim to  address  this.

But  what  about the transition from 'O'  levels  to  'A'

levels?   Would these students not benefit from  it  even

more?  Why should they be deprived of something that will

benefit them?  Unless the skills are academic performance

dependent,  which I do not think they  are,  I  urge  the

Ministry  to  reconsider and actually extend  it  to  the

other  students at the upper secondary level.  I  believe

it  will  greatly enhance their performance  at  the  'A'

levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this brings me to my last point. The report is

supposed to look at the JC and upper secondary education.

As  far  as  I  understand,  upper  secondary  refers  to

secondary 3 and 4, focusing on preparing students for the

'O'   levels,  while  the  JCs  are  the  post  secondary

educational  institutions where students take  their  'A'

level examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes in the JC curriculum is certainly

in  line  with  the  current system in the  universities,

local  and abroad.  This is rightfully so since the  path

is   clear  for  these  students  to  move  from  JC   to

university.  Of course, the skills to be acquired will be

useful for the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the through train programme seemingly aims at

providing this seamless progression from PSLE to the  'A"

levels.   What  is  missing in the  report  is  thus  the

transition  from 'O' levels to 'A' levels  or  the  other

routes.    The   skills  like  creative  and  independent

thinking,  etc,  will  also be  applicable  even  if  the

students do not go

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>



to  JC  and  take the polytechnic route  instead.   As  I

mentioned  earlier, what is even more important  is  that

those 15% students who are JC bound too, are the ones who

will  need  the  extra  help  in  blending  into  the  JC

curriculum.   My question is: what is the extent  of  the

upper secondary curriculum, as it stands now, which is in

line  with the proposed changes in the JC curriculum?   I

believe  these  skills are important for  those  who  are

polytechnic  bound.   The report fails  to  address  this

transition  from 'O' levels to the other paths.   I  urge

the   Ministry   to  study  this  gap  and   address   it

concurrently, as failure to do so will only  disadvantage

these groups of students further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge that we are living

in  very difficult and uncertain times.  The Minister  of

State  for  Education, Dr Ng Eng Hen, has been quoted  as

saying  that  the "education roadmap needs to  move  from

uniformity  to  diversity, rigidity to flexibility,  from

conformity   to   resilience,  and   from   moulding   to

empowering."  These are indeed excellent targets to  work

towards.  We must, however, ensure that as we develop the

social  structures through our policies to achieve these,

that  we  do  not inevitably divide our society  further.

Social  stratification  is part of  society,  but  policy

makers  must be conscious of the extent to which policies

perpetuate  social stratification.  In the long  run,  we

know that whatever we are doing is best for Singapore and

Singaporeans.   Singaporeans must be made  to  understand

and own this process.  Indeed, the nation is learning  as

much  as  the  schools are thinking.   We  now  want  our

students also to think as much, as they learn to  acquire

the requisite skills to ensure their own survival.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me,

first,  address one point raised by Mr Low  Thia  Khiang.

He  asked whether we really provide opportunities for our

polytechnic students to study in our universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our polytechnics are developed as institutions in

their own right.  They are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



not  pre-university centres or institutions.   Therefore,

our  students  in  the polytechnics  are  trained  to  be

employable,  relevant to the industry.  The  Member  will

find  that  our  polytechnic students and  graduates  are

relevant  and  employable.  Indeed, the top  10%  of  our

polytechnic  graduates  enter our universities  annually,

and  I  believe that as we revamp the university  sector,

more   would   have   the  opportunity   to   enter   our

universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to address specific queries from some

Members  on  National  Education,  values  education  and

character development.  I would like to thank Members   - Ms  Penny Low, Mr Wee Siew Kim, Ms Irene Ng and  Dr  John

Chen   -   for their support for the increased importance

given  to  the  co-curricular  activities  (CCA)  and  Ms

Indranee Rajah for supporting MOE's efforts in developing

the character of our students.  However, listening to  Ms

Indranee earlier, one would have the impression that  the

poor manners of some motorists on our roads have been due

to the weaknesses of our education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take through some of the things we have done

in  our  schools  as  far as National  Education,  values

education and character development are concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October this year, I gave the House an update on

the  National Education (NE) activities, the  Civics  and

Moral Education (CME) programme, co-curricular activities

(CCA)  and  other  learning activities conducted  in  our

schools to imbibe sound values in our students.

<br><br><i>Character Development through Co-Curricular Activities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools place great emphasis on developing the

character  of  their students through  a  wide  range  of

activities and programmes.  Besides CME lessons, there is

a  variety  of  co-curricular activities  (CCA)  such  as

uniformed   groups,  sports  or  games  which   inculcate

desirable traits in our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports and games are an excellent way to promote

friendship and bonding.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



Students  learn  to work together in  the  pursuit  of  a

common  goal.  Strong friendships emerge from sharing  in

the  joys of winning or the dejection of defeat.  It also

helps  to  promote  bonding, understanding  and  teamwork

amongst  participants.  The uniformed groups are  another

means  by which students are introduced to the ethos  and

values   of  being  part  of  a  team.   Through  various

activities,  students  develop positive  traits  such  as

perseverance, resilience and adaptability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCAs expose students to real world problems where

they  need  to understand that solutions to the  problems

they  face  are  not  cast in stone.   It  will  put  our

students' capacity to think to the test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students are also actively engaged in community

involvement  projects (CIP) that give them an opportunity

to  contribute their efforts to the good of others.   The

CIP  was introduced in 1988 to nurture our pupils  to  be

socially  responsible  and to help them  understand  that

every  Singaporean has a role to play  in  enhancing  the

well-being   of  the  community  and  the  country.    In

participating in community work, the members also  learn,

from  a young age, the value of service and of developing

enduring friendships with one another.    All students do

a minimum of six hours of CIP.  In fact, in some schools,

as  I reported in October, students clock in more than 20

hours  a  year.  Since year 2000, schools have also  been

introduced to the concept of Service-Learning.   Service-Learning  is  an approach where the CIP participants  not

only  serve the community but also learn to identify  the

needs  of the community and to reflect on their community

involvement  process so that they can  better  appreciate

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students have partnered with various grassroots

and community organisations in carrying out CIP.  Through

these  partnerships, they also learn to work with  adults

in  the community.  Sir, I appreciate the views given  by

Miss  Low  and I would like her to know that our  schools

are  expanding the opportunities with the community, only

as  far  as  the  community wants  to  partner  with  the

schools.  If community organisations and community

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



leaders  take the opportunity to work the schools,  I  am

very  sure our schools will also extend a hand.   In  the

process,  both our students and our community will  learn

together to appreciate each other's contributions.

<br><br><i>National Education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increasing globalisation and mobility, a

person's  sense  of identity is less tied  to  the  place

where  he  was born.  The sense of belonging to Singapore

could   weaken.   National  Education  is  necessary   to

reinforce  national instincts and citizenship  values  so

that  our students remain rooted to the country  as  they

spread their economic wings overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Education aims to develop national

cohesion, the instinct to fight for Singapore's  survival

and instil confidence in its future.  It aims to foster a

sense   of   identity,   pride   and   self-respect    as

Singaporeans,    to    understand   Singapore's    unique

challenges, constraints and vulnerability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim suggested that National Education be

emphasised  through  Project Work  and  perhaps  the  new

`Knowledge and Inquiry' subject.  I would like  to  thank

Mr  Wee for his suggestion.  He would be pleased to  know

that schools already infuse National Education across the

formal curriculum and non-academic programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the JC level, National Education is integrated

into the General Paper whose aim is to enable students to

appreciate  the inter-relationship of ideas  from  across

disciplines  and  broaden  their  global  outlook   while

remaining   mindful  of  shared  historical  and   social

experiences, both within Singapore and regionally.  Essay

topics  could, therefore, be set that allow  students  to

consider   issues   from   an   NE   perspective.     The

comprehension passage could deal with topics  of  concern

to  Singaporeans.   Both Project Work (PW)  and  the  new

elective subject `Knowledge and Inquiry' require students

to  explore  a  range  of issues and ideas,  which  could

include   getting   students   to   consider   NE-related

perspectives. There is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>



sufficient scope for PW projects as well as KI topics  to

deal with National Education issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary level, NE is delivered through

subjects  such  as  Social Studies where  students  learn

about  Singapore's  arduous road to nationhood.   Through

case  studies,  they are introduced to the principles  of

good  governance, and the dangers that befall  those  who

are  divided  by  racial and religious strife.   Students

understand   the  importance  of  racial  and   religious

harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools also conduct a wide variety of programmes to

enable  students  to  internalise  the  NE  values.   For

example, schools celebrate the different ethnic festivals

to   raise  students'  awareness  and  consciousness  and

understanding of multi-racialism and its importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the Learning Journey Programme, which

was  launched  in  1998.  Students visit  key  Government

institutions  like the Parliament House,  URA,  and  also

important facilities like the PSA.  Through these visits,

students  come  to  grips with the constraints  Singapore

faces in terms of size and resources.  They also begin to

appreciate  how Singaporeans have succeeded  against  the

odds  by  standing  together, and working  creatively  to

overcome  the physical limits that the size of  our  land

has imposed on us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a child's experiences in school form only

part  of  the  efforts in cultivating a  sense  of  love,

loyalty   and   belonging  to  Singapore.   The   family,

community and the society play no less critical  role  in

shaping  the  values  of our young.   On  its  part,  the

Ministry  of Education will continue with its efforts  to

improve  its  National  Education programme  in  all  our

schools to ensure all our pupils are imbued and instilled

with  a  greater sense of love, loyalty and belonging  to

Singapore.

<br><br><i>Added   Emphasis  on  Values  Education  in  Revised   JC curriculum</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new revised JC curriculum reinforces our efforts

on values education and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



character  development.  To underscore our commitment  to

provide  a  holistic  education  to  our  students,   the

Committee has recommended that more emphasis be given  to

the non-academic domain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be more opportunities, inside and outside

of  schools,  for  students to  engage  in  projects  and

ventures that will help develop initiative, independence,

and an entrepreneurial mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students will be required to meet minimum

requirements  in co-curricular activities  and  character

development  programme in order to graduate  from  junior

college.    A   holistic  certification  will   also   be

introduced  whereby  the  CCA achievements  and  academic

grades  of  students are reflected in a single `A'  level

certificate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, schools cannot shoulder this responsibility

of  shaping young hearts and minds alone.  The family  is

key  to  bringing  up our children with the  right  moral

values and sound character.  As we strive to develop  our

students'  talents  and equip them with  the  skills  and

knowledge  to  tackle the challenges in a knowledge-based

economy,  parents and teachers cannot neglect the  softer

aspects of our children's education.  Values like loyalty

to the country, compassion for the community and friends,

perseverance and moral integrity, will stand  our  youths

in  good stead.  For in the end, Singapore will have  won

the  battle  but lost the war if the next  generation  of

Singaporeans  grow up smarter in the head but  weaker  in

the heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure Members that as we

embark  to  revamp the JC and Upper Secondary  Education,

the  MOE  does not neglect character development,  values

education  and  National  Education.   Our  schools   are

focusing  on  the pursuit of what I called the  3Cs,  two

less  than  the  pursuit  of average  Singaporeans.   The

schools may use different terms, but the 3Cs I mean cover

these things: Competency, Change-Management Capabilities,

and  Character  Development.  But I  must  add  that  the

inculcation of desirable values cannot just be the job of

MOE.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



Government,  parents  and the community  must  also  play

their part.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in this debate on the motion,

standing in the name of the Minister for Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I thought about the motion, I thought back about

the  entering cohort of medical students who  started  in

university with me.  One has become a very good musician,

one  a playwright, a few have become bankers, a few  have

become good businessmen, real estate developers - not all

finished their medical course - but all became successful

in their own ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in thinking of these people, I thought about the

second  part  of  this motion, which endorses  a  greater

diversity  and opening of new pathways in  JC  and  Upper

Secondary Education, to cater to different strengths  and

interests of students.  Twenty years ago, and I  am  sure

this  strikes a chord with many Members, many of  us  and

parents  would  have said that the route  to  advancement

lies  in the professions, therefore, get yourself a  good

"A"  levels, go into one of the professional courses  and

after that you can think about it.  I think this new  set

of reforms sends a strong signal that we mean what we say

in  wanting to show people that there are many, many ways

of  achieving  success, that Singapore  needs  a  broader

definition of success if we are to face the world ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an unashamedly meritocratic and competitive

society.   No matter what MOE reforms are put  in  place,

many  Singaporean parents and Singaporean kids themselves

will always strive for excellence, and subject themselves

and  their children to perhaps a little too much pressure

to  succeed.  These reforms will not change this  because

it  is  an  ingrained habit, and perhaps not such  a  bad

thing.  But what I think we would need to change is  this

broadening of the Singaporean mind.  And I think this  is

very,  very important because it is the broad minds,  the

agile minds,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



succeed in the new economy, even though that itself is  a

cliche by now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do hope to achieve is a long term shift in

society's attitudes and direction towards a more thinking

and  creative  nation  -  a nation  of  leaders  and  not

followers alone.  We need a couple of Thomas Edisons, not

a  couple of thousand of candle-makers.  Yet the  biggest

impediment to the success of these proposed changes is, I

think,  fear.   And  I  think these fears  are  two-fold.

Firstly,  a  fear  of change.  Some have expressed  fears

that  our  teachers are not used to the  system.   Others

fear  that their children would not be able to cope  with

this new system.  Secondly, a fear of missing the boat  - a  lack  of bridges between the EM3, EM2 and EM1 segments

of  society, so to speak.  Many of those who have  talked

about  the through-train approach also fear that some  of

these  young people might fall between the stools in  the

through-train system.  Many have expressed the fear  that

in  households  where English is not  the  main  language

spoken  at home, there will be children who would not  be

able  to  cope and not be able to benefit from these  new

reforms.   But  I think we can actually deal  with  these

fears  separately, and indeed some of  these  issues  are

very important, but they should be dealt with separately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the matter before us today is that we

need to give our brightest and best new routes to success

because the "A" level education model that has served  us

so  well  in  the  past is perhaps  no  longer  the  most

suitable model for Singapore's future needs.  Yet,  I  am

glad  that the report has recognised the great  value  of

the  brand name of the Singapore "A" levels and  that  we

must  not  only provide for the acquisition of  technical

knowledge, but also for the development of the spirit  of

inquiry and creativity, and the development of morals and

character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is really also about the best way to use

the  time  available  to  prepare Singaporeans  who  will

benefit from a university education, to be qualified  for

competitive  admission to local and foreign universities.

With the proposed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



changes, individuals can reach a university education  by

either proof of achieving academic excellence, or through

proof  of  academic competence, accompanied by  proof  of

excellence in some other fields, such as the arts  or  in

sports.   Is it perfect?  Perhaps not.  Because  just  as

there  are  limitations in designing, say,  a  car  or  a

military  tank,  where  one has  to  balance  fire-power,

protection  and  mobility in one fighting vehicle,  there

are  also  only 24 hours in a day, and there is  only  so

much  that  one  can cram into a young mind  in  a  week.

Instead   of   fire-power,   protection   and   mobility,

therefore, we have to balance breadth of knowledge, depth

of  knowledge  and  the ability to  apply  knowledge.   I

believe  there  are no easy solutions, and  there  is  no

perfect  design - only the possibility of a design  which

is  best  able  to  suit  our particular  needs  and  our

particular point in history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore of the future will have more and more

people  with degrees.  In fact, if you look around world-wide  trends,  the  tendency for many  of  the  developed

countries  is for the majority of the so-called  educated

workforce  to have some degree or other.  The issue  then

is: what will a degree be worth?  And, if everybody has a

degree, why would then people fight to get a degree?   We

are  familiar with what has been happening in the  United

Kingdom,  where there is a move towards getting everybody

to  have some sort of university experience.  We need  to

ask  ourselves  if the aim of our system is  to  make  it

possible  for all people to go to university.  I  believe

it is not.  And, if not, what will then be the value of a

university degree?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system aims to ensure that all Singaporeans will

have the skills to earn a living, to understand the world

around  them,  after  a fashion, and  to  understand  the

society  they live in and their own place in the society.

I  believe  this  has been very well stated  through  the

Ministry of Education's goals in education.  But  we  are

also  unique  in  that we do this through  a  variety  of

institutions,  culminating in the ITE,  polytechnics  and

university education routes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we recognise these different routes to

success,  we  are focused today on the route  that  leads

towards university education.  We need to recognise  that

there  is a bell curve for academic excellence and  there

is  no getting around that bell curve - you are either at

the  beginning, the middle, or the end of it.  But we can

recognise the existence of other bell curves, and that we

can  recognise that some of the people who are  otherwise

just  competent, to benefit from a university  education,

may  be actually the excellent end of the bell curves for

some  other skills.  And I think it is a societal  choice

whether  we should be allowing them the chance  to  enter

university.  I personally believe that it would be a good

thing  for  us  to recognise this type of excellence  and

allow  these  people  to  enter  university  because   in

Singapore, university education, like it or not,  is  one

of the big prizes of our system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise that not everyone would know what he

wants  to do later in life at the age of 16 or 18.   This

new  system will make it easier for young people to  make

better choices and prevent premature shunting into fields

which one may not have wanted to go into.  In thinking of

that,  I think of my friends, some of whom were asked  to

go  into  certain professional fields, even though  their

own  hearts say otherwise.  Also, not everyone will  have

the  benefit  of  a  family that  values  exposing  their

children to a wide range of general knowledge topics,  or

to  the  opportunity to travel.  But again, these new  JC

and  Upper  Secondary reforms will  make  it  easier  for

children, even from less privileged backgrounds, to  have

their worlds opened up to different experiences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to another point, I believe we should aim to

reduce the wastage of potential.  Currently, while one in

four  of  our Primary One cohort will sit for  their  "A"

levels,  only  80% of these candidates will  be  able  to

qualify  for  admission  to a  local  university.   I  am

particularly  heartened by the news that even  with  this

new  system, the 3-year pre-university centres will still

be retained, to allow those who need to develop at a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



But,  as  with other speakers before me, I think that  we

should  be dealing with the problem perhaps a little  bit

earlier.   I think we really need to be finding  ways  to

support  those who come from households where English  is

not  widely  spoken, where the children actually  already

turn  up in lower primary school and upper primary school

with   significant  disadvantages,  vis-a-vis   language.

Because  with this new system, where you have  to  defend

your  thoughts  and learn to present your ideas,  if  you

have  got  a  language  difficulty,  you  have  a  double

difficulty.   Yet,  I  think  the  answer  is  not  about

levelling  everybody  down, but  it  is  about  levelling

everybody  up,  and  trying  to  narrow  the  gap   where

possible.   I  think that the introduction of specialised

schools  for  sports and people who are talented  in  the

arts,  as  well as the introduction of this through-train

system,  with the potential of not having to sit for  the

"O"  level is wonderful, because we have been talking for

so  long  about  the lack of flexibility  in  our  school

system.  And I think many of us would have heard from our

friends  that,  "Well, we have decided to send  so-and-so

abroad  because  he  could not  cope  with  the  lack  of

flexibility."  Well, we are now going to have flexibility

in  our  local  school system.  Let us see whether  these

children can cope.  Yet the challenge, I believe, is  not

so  much  in  setting up these schools,  but  in  getting

parents  to buy into the idea of an alternative  path  to

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by the new emphasis on socialisation

and  on  learning of social skills in our new curriculum.

This  is  very  important.  I would also  argue  that  we

should  perhaps  include  some  learning  about  cultural

sensitivity,  perhaps even religious  sensitivity.   Much

has been said about learning how to be outspoken, but you

know  we  live in Asia, and perhaps some of our  English-stream  students  also need to learn a  little  bit  more

about  the cultures in the countries around us, where  it

pays  sometimes to be a little bit quiet at certain times

- part of doing business, right?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by the introduction of this new

subject  called Knowledge and Inquiry, which  will  train

students to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



evaluate  the  validity and relevance of new observations

in theories and teach them how to defend their arguments,

to  apply  their theories to present-day  realities.   We

know,  at  a  time when so many people claim  to  have  a

university  degree, what makes people stand  out  is  how

well  they  can  deal  with changes, and  actually  apply

knowledge,  and also evaluate a statement that  has  been

put forward to them.  Prof Low Seow Chay actually pointed

out  that  perhaps  if one were to use this  business  of

practical  work  or project, that soon there  will  be  a

whole industry, perhaps of people wanting to sell project

work.   But  I  believe there are new  computer  systems,

smart systems, that can detect plagiarism of this nature.

And it is not such a bad thing because, I think the Bible

says  that  there are not that many new things under  the

sun.  The challenge for us is actually to make use of the

available  knowledge  that  is  out  there  on  the  web,

everywhere, to rehash it, to look at ways to present  it,

so  that it becomes something new.  If our kids can learn

to do that with commercial term papers, maybe that is not

such a bad thing.  That is called synthesis of knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we also should consider teaching our JC

students about basic statistical concepts, even  if  they

are  not  headed for statistics as a course.   We  should

teach  them  about  circular arguments  and  concepts  of

management.   This  is about teaching  our  young  to  be

educated  consumers - educated consumers of  information,

of advertisements, of goods and services.  Teaching them,

as it were, to be a bit more street-smart in a structured

Singapore way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also heartened that these changes will be

implemented  only in the year 2006.  I am confident  that

this  would  give MOE the time to refine the syllabi  and

train  the  necessary teachers to undertake  the  new  JC

curriculum.  I am confident that people described as  old

workhorses and old teachers actually will be able to meet

the  challenges.   Because after all, we  are  trying  to

remake  the  whole  of Singapore, why not  the  teachers?

What  I  am  perhaps  a little less  confident  about  is

whether we can change parental attitudes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should tell parents and students who are

now  in  Secondary  1 or Secondary 2 that  these  changes

would  soon  affect  them.  We can pilot  some  of  these

concepts  now,  maybe  we  do not  have  to  make  it  an

examination subject.  We can also ensure that we will not

inadvertently  increase the tendency for people  to  take

subjects  that  score more As by devising  some  sort  of

thinking  skills  type  of questions  so  that,  even  in

Science-based   subjects,  only  those   who   can   show

independent  thinking  or higher order  of  thinking  and

deeper  understanding  can  get  this  'A'.   That  would

perhaps  balance the field for those who are  taking  the

Arts type courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, we recognise the multiplicity of

educational models out there in the world, and that  this

multiplicity  of educational models suggests  that  there

are  either many ways to achieve excellence in education,

or  none  of  the methods out there really is  foolproof.

Therefore,  we  should  choose the  best  model  for  our

nation's needs and not be ashamed about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also echo the call for a second chance to be

made  available for children who are brave enough to  try

this something new and who have made a mistake in perhaps

making  their  first  choice.   It  has  been  said  that

Singapore could not afford to give people a second chance

in  education because of scarce educational resources  in

the  early  days.  This would have been true a generation

ago.   But  what is scarce now is our young people.   Our

young  people's innate potential should and must  not  be

wasted.   If we do not make some form of a second  chance

the  cornerstone of these reforms, I fear that  we  would

only perpetuate the tendency of Singaporeans to take only

the safe route to success.  We would then have failed  in

one  of  our most important tasks, that of nurturing  the

creative, entrepreneurial and 'never say die' spirit that

we so much admire and strive for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with those who say that we should not

start off with the top 10%.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



We must not fear failure as a nation when we are changing

the  system.   But  I  think,  as  Singaporeans,  we  are

cautious.   And it is perfectly reasonable to  start  off

with  the  top  10% because these are probably  the  very

people  who are most likely to be able to cope  and  deal

with  change successfully.  I am sure that MOE will  make

use  of  these experiences to make the changes  down  the

line.  As someone else has said, "Look, I understand what

it  is like to help my little girl with the project  work

in primary school."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if these reforms succeed, I am confident

that we can sell the product, call it the "Singaporean JC

education",  to  paying students from around  the  region

and,  in  doing  so, enlarge our potential immigrant  and

talent pool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Thank you for allowing me to

join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the 21st speaker, I think it is extremely

difficult  at this late hour also to enthuse  anybody  to

continue to focus on what anybody has to say after  this.

But I do beg your indulgence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker(Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</b></div>

<br>5.35 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report, Sir, on reforms to our junior college

and  upper  secondary  education  is  indeed  timely  and

necessary.   Moving this debate to a broader plane,  this

is  not  just  about  how  we  educate  our  students  in

secondary  schools and junior colleges.  More importantly

to  me, it is about how we develop our human resources to

fully  benefit  from  a global economy  that  is,  today,

highly  integrated,  and  when  the  key  differentiating

factor  is no longer technology and capital but keyboard.

Those with the right education, skill sets, aptitudes and

capabilities    will   be   able   to   fully    maximise

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, the income gap is widening.

Singapore is no exception, although our situation may not

be as bad as other countries.  Increasingly, a clear

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



and  distinct line is drawn between those with  education

and   skills  and  those  without.   Indeed,  it  is  our

obligation and duty to ensure that everyone can aspire to

a higher income and a better life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see education and training as critical factors,

not  only  in achieving economic efficiency but  also  in

ensuring social equity.  In fact, education has been  the

greatest  social leveller in our society.  In  Singapore,

it  does not matter what social background one comes from

as opportunities are provided for all to transcend social

barriers  and  climb up the ladder.  This  is  one  major

contributing factor for the high level of social cohesion

that  we enjoy in Singapore today.  And this is something

that we must continue to emphasise and propagate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate, Sir, a bit about how job

segmentation  has  taken  place based  on  education  and

skills.   This  is really a global and not just  a  local

issue,  and  why  we have to pay close attention  to  the

education  system  if we do not want  to  perpetuate  the

problem  of  unemployment  among  the  unskilled  or  low

skilled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US Department of Labour, Sir, estimated that in

the  1990s,  occupations that required a  college  degree

were  growing  twice as fast as others.  At the  European

Union  level,  the  1995  White Paper  on  Education  and

Training  had  identified the need for  all  citizens  to

develop a knowledge base that would help them find  their

way  in  the information society.  It warned against  the

danger  of social exclusion among some groups in  society

based on lack of knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developed countries, the patterns of employment

have   changed  dramatically.   Within  firms   in   such

countries,  the labour market has become  more  and  more

segmented.   Employers have reorganised their  work  into

two  categories - core and non-core work.   Core  workers

are those with high skills and non-core workers are those

with  little or no education, or possess obsolete skills.

Needless to say, core workers receive better pay and have

greater   stability  of  employment.   Whereas   non-core

workers treated as the peripheral

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



workforce  enjoy low status, low pay, and  absolutely  no

security of employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As multinational companies operate across borders,

we  cannot  isolate  ourselves  against  such  employment

practices.   I  see the role of our education  system  as

ensuring   that  our  workers  remain  as  core  workers.

Otherwise,  we  may end up as non-core  workers  and  the

foreign  talents become core workers on our  own  shores.

In this regard, it is therefore important that our school

reforms  also  adequately  focus  on  the  need  of   the

majority,  and  not just increasingly the small  band  of

students at the top.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key question I would like to ask is whether the

reforms  have  gone far enough and fundamentally  examine

the way we have structured our primary, secondary and  JC

education.   Although this Report is  meant  to  initiate

reforms to upper secondary education, I note that it  has

basically  left  upper  secondary education  intact.   In

fact,  the only reform to upper secondary education  will

affect only the top 10% of each cohort who qualifies  for

the  Integrated Programme where seamless upper  secondary

and JC education is provided for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present system, students are streamed

into  different  streams  after  their  PSLE  examination

results.  Those who are academically inclined go  to  the

four-year  Express Stream.  Whereas those  who  are  less

academically  inclined, or need more time,  are  streamed

into   the   five-year  Normal  (Technical)   or   Normal

(Academic) programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries have integrated general and

vocational  education in unique ways and,  in  this  way,

better  prepare  students  for  either  an  academic   or

vocational path.  An example is Norway, where  the  first

two years of education are given at school.  The students

in Norway must choose different, more specialised courses

during  the second year.  These are provided in  schools,

whilst  others  are workplace-based.  The academic  track

entails three-year courses.  Under the vocational  track,

students  have  two years of school-based  education  and

another two years of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



apprenticeship  training.   The  concluding   specialised

training  takes place in the workplace.  In total,  there

will  be 190 different craft or journey-man certificates.

I  have  been told that some of these have been collapsed

to  about  a  broad  band  of  15  to  20  categories  of

certificates and skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying, Sir, that the Norwegian system is a

better alternative.  They revamped their education system

in  1994.  But I certainly think that there is scope  for

us to rethink the way in which our secondary education is

structured  and ask the question whether it really  meets

the  needs of the students and the economy.  In our case,

although  a  Normal (Technical) student would have  spent

five  years in secondary school, at the age of 17  years,

he  would  still have insufficient basic  skills  and  be

inadequately prepared for a job.  Only when he  has  gone

through  another two years in ITE, then would he  acquire

basic skills and a certificate to enter the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really think that there is greater scope for the

MOE  to examine this issue.  It can perhaps look into how

to better integrate the Normal (Technical) education with

ITE   education  so  as  to  ensure  a  progressive   and

consistent build up of skills and competency.  I  frankly

do  not  see much of that continuous flow now.   I  would

like to suggest that MOE examine this aspect and consider

the  feasibility  of creating better  pathways  from  the

Normal (Technical) education with ITE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are currently spending a lot of resources,

time  and effort to re-skill and find jobs for our lower-end workers who are retrenched or unemployed.  We have to

ensure that 10 to 20 years down the road, this pattern is

not repeated.  The answer to that, of course, lies in our

present   education  system  and,  in   particular,   the

education  for those who are less academically  inclined.

Based on what I have said earlier, I think we need to pay

some  attention  to  this  issue and  critically  examine

whether the existing system, in particular, our secondary

education,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



meets  the needs of these students and adequately prepare

them with the necessary skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related point, Sir, I would also like to join

other colleagues in asking that not only JC students  and

those  in  the top 10% of the upper secondary  cohort  be

equipped with thinking skills.  There is, in my  view,  a

certain amount of over emphasis on preparing students for

university  education.  It is as if only  those  who  are

clearly demarcated for university education need to  have

thinking, communicating and other process skills when one

would  argue  that  all students  who  come  out  of  our

education  system need such skills, if they are  to  meet

the  needs of an innovation driven economy.  For example,

Sir,  if  we  have  a  technician who has  no  university

education, do we not want him to have the same  abilities

to think, apply and communicate as the engineer with whom

he  is  working?  I would argue that all  who  enter  the

workforce would need such skills.  And there is therefore

a  need  to  review  the  entire school  curriculum  from

primary school onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister of State for Education has

said  that  such core skills are already being taught  in

primary  and secondary schools, the fact that we are  now

reforming our JC curriculum clearly shows that  there  is

insufficient focus placed on such skills.  The importance

of  having  foundation basic core skills cannot  be  over

emphasised.   In  the  1990s, Sir,  a  US  Commission  on

achieving  necessary skills defined the role of education

and  identified  the kind of core skills that  should  be

taught  in  American schools.  It described the  role  of

general  education  as  providing  individuals  with  the

minimum  requirements  to function  productively  in  the

workplace.    The  focus  should  be  on  basic   skills,

including  the  ability to identify,  analyse  and  solve

problems,  the capacity to learn new skills in  order  to

adapt to new work tasks, the ability to communicate  with

others   and  use  information  independently,   planning

skills,   computer  literacy  and  a  grasp   of   simple

scientific knowledge and technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the World Bank research has shown that, in some

countries, workers who have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



completed  secondary school have a 50% greater chance  of

receiving  on-the-job training than those with a  primary

school  education  alone.  The World Bank  also  suggests

that  training in specific skills is more effective  when

trainees  are  already  literate and  numerate  and  have

problem-solving skills that they can build upon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, the reform of the JC curriculum

and those at the top 10% of the cohort would better place

such  students  to  acquire higher skills  and  integrate

effectively into our economy.  In order to allow students

of  all  achievement levels to benefit, I would also  ask

that  the  Ministry of Education look into the curriculum

of the whole secondary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two other brief points that I wish to

touch  on.   I  would like to ask that  the  Ministry  of

Education  also pay adequate attention to the  needs  and

training of our teachers.  In this regard, I am not  sure

whether 2004 will give us sufficient time to prepare  the

teachers for the Integrated Programme, and I do ask  that

the  Ministry review regularly the staffing requirements,

so that teachers would not be overloaded and will be able

to   deliver   the   changes  in  the  education   system

effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate, Sir, that in recent years, attempts

have been made to reduce the workload in the non-teaching

areas for our teachers, but I believe that more could  be

done  to  help teachers prepare for the new methodologies

and concepts that they are now required to teach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope, Sir, that the Ministry of Education

will come out with effective communication materials,  so

that parents understand these reforms and will not be  so

bewildered.  Some parents I have spoken to do  not  quite

understand what is going on.  This is because there  have

been  many  changes to our education  system.   This  has

caused  a  certain amount of confusion and concern  among

parents.   I  would  like to suggest  that  schools  work

through  their PTAs to reach out to parents, particularly

those who have children in secondary schools.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, our education system has served

Singapore  well.  It has brought us to the present  level

of  development  and helped us overcome  several  crises.

The  path  ahead is fraught with uncertainties, both  for

the  economy  and the labour market.  People  have  asked

what  do we hope to get out of our education system.   My

hope,  Sir,  is  very simple - that we will  continue  to

provide   students   of   all  social   backgrounds   and

capabilities  with  the  opportunity  to  develop   their

potential to the fullest and, at the end of the day, have

the   skills  and  capacity  to  weather  change,  remain

employed and live a good life.  I believe, Sir, that  the

current reforms will contribute towards that outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion as proposed

by the Minister for Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore enters into the global economy, we must

equip  our  people to develop niches to stay  competitive

economically  and  lead a higher quality  of  life.   The

impact   of  information  technology  and  the   changing

landscape of the global economy have posed new demands on

our  economy  and  workforce.  While  the  Government  is

working  on remaking Singapore, we must also retrain  our

present  workforce and prepare our future generations  to

face these new challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a different set of skills and mindsets to

compete and excel in a knowledge-based economy.  To be  a

successful  global player, we must have a workforce  that

is creative, innovative and full of passion to excel.  At

the same time, our education system must equip our people

with skills to lead a meaningful and happy life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the revamp of the JC and upper secondary

education curriculum is a step in the right direction  to

nurture  our students for a globalised future.  I support

the  change  from  efficiency to diversity,  focusing  on

broad-based  skills training.  But I am  concerned  about

giving students

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



more  flexibility to decide on the scope of content of  a

subject they wish to take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our students are very practical and

may  not  be  well informed to make good  decisions  when

choosing  subjects.   Thus,  many  will  take  the   easy

options,  ie, choosing subjects which are easy  to  pass,

easy  to  score  and  are taught by easy-going  teachers.

This  may  affect  the desired outcomes of  the  revamped

curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to highlight three areas of concern in

the proposal by the Education Review Committee:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Holistic approach to revamp our education

system;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Quality assurance system to ensure sustainable

quality output; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Creative and innovative learning environment for

our students.

<br><br><i>Holistic approach to education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should adopt a holistic approach to revamp

the  entire  education system, and not just  the  JC  and

upper secondary curriculum.  As stated in Annex J of  the

Report,  the desired outcomes of each level of  education

have   undue  influence  on  the  succeeding  levels   of

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective in nurturing our future generations,

we  must  also  revamp  the curriculum  of  the  primary,

secondary and tertiary institutions.  Thus, I would  urge

the Minister to consider making the necessary changes  to

the other levels of education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the implementation of compulsory

education, all students will spend a number of  years  in

our  educational institutions.  Inadvertently, some  will

only  be able to complete their education up to a certain

level.   Therefore,  we  must re-look  into  the  desired

outcomes  of  the  different  levels  of  education   and

consider embedding thinking skills into the content-based

subjects  of primary and secondary school curricula  too.

In this way, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



nurturing  of  our  students will be more  complete,  and

students who complete different levels of education  will

be  equipped with different skills to fit into our global

workforce and lead a reasonable quality of life.

<br><br><i>Quality assurance system</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to achieve consistent desired outcomes in our

education  system, we need to develop a quality assurance

system  which  is  internationally recognised.   We  must

ensure  that  the key quality processes in our  education

system  are  in  place, and devise a  regular  check-and-balance  mechanism  to achieve sustainable  quality.   We

must have quality input and quality processes in order to

produce  quality output at every educational level.   The

quality  of students, curriculum and teachers  will  play

significant roles in determining the desired outcomes  of

our education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must change the mindsets of both our educators

and  parents  that  school curriculum  will  have  to  be

reviewed  at  certain regular intervals, eg,  every  five

years.   These reviews are necessary so as to update  our

curriculum to cope with the dynamic changes in the global

economy.   If possible, a panel of education and industry

experts   should  be  formed  to  guide   the   continual

development of our school curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also have an accreditation system which

will   make   our   school   curriculum   internationally

recognised.  This will provide additional impetus to make

Singapore  an education hub, and facilitate students  who

wish to study overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we must provide adequate training to

our  existing and future pool of teachers and  principals

to  be  creative  and  innovative.   In  particular,  the

leadership skills and passion of our principals will make

a  great  difference  to  the  desired  outcomes  of  our

education system.  To achieve this, we must first  ensure

that  our  educators  are equipped with  thinking  skills

before  even considering revising our curriculum.   Thus,

quality control in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



recruitment  of  principals and teachers  is  crucial  in

achieving the desired outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, principals and teachers should be rotated

every   five   or   six  years,  both  horizontally   and

vertically,   among  different  levels   of   educational

institutions.  This will provide good exposure  for  them

to  understand  the  different needs and  aspirations  of

different   groups  of  students  and   parents.    Where

possible,  JC and upper secondary school teachers  should

be  given  the  opportunity to lecture or  tutor  at  our

tertiary institutions.  This will provide them with first-hand  experience in understanding the quality of students

entering the tertiary institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how can we measure the desired outcomes of our

education system?  The existing criteria are rather broad

and   difficult  to  measure.   We  should  develop  some

quantitative tools to measure the output.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must also be a mechanism where employers,

alumni,  tertiary institution lecturers,  principals  and

teachers  can provide regular feedback to our educational

institutions  to  further improve our quality  processes.

Both  the industry and our educational institutions  must

share   the   same   vision  of  nurturing   our   future

generations.

<br><br><i>Creative and innovative learning environment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has provided one of the best

education infrastructures for our students.  Schools  and

educational institutions are well equipped with  abundant

resources to facilitate teaching and learning.   What  is

lacking  is  the development of a creative and innovative

learning  culture in our institutions.  To  emphasise  on

hardware  alone  may not produce the desired  results  of

encouraging our students to be creative and innovative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a more supportive learning environment where

schools, parents, employers and students can work closely

together  to  nurture  our  students.   There   must   be

effective communication among

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



principals, teachers, employers, parents and students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constant engagement of all parties involved will

provide useful information for all to better support  and

guide  our students to develop their potentials.  With  a

better-educated population in the future, I am  confident

that  communication  will improve for  all  concerned  in

nurturing  our future generations.  This will  strengthen

the  partnerships of all stakeholders, thus  spearheading

our education system to greater heights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further facilitate learning, I would propose that

the  JC  and upper secondary school curriculum be  taught

using  a  modular  system.   In our  examination-oriented

education system, using a modular teaching approach  will

provide  more opportunities for students to interact  and

work  on projects.  Students will only need to study  two

or  three subjects per semester for examination purposes.

This will reduce much stress and facilitate more creative

learning among students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>5.55 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion in the name

of  the Minister for Education on the recommendations put

forward  by  the  JC/Upper  Secondary  Education   Review

Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we compel our children to go to school, we

assume collectively an overwhelming responsibility.   For

a   period  of  10  years  or  more,  the  children   are

conscripts,  and  there  are  youths  who  mitigated  the

seriousness of this fact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school experience is a gift. It is for the

children's  own good, so we say, with genuine intentions.

Do we realise that the school experience is as good as we

make  it  to be?  In the same breath, I ask: is  it  good

enough for the society that will come into being when the

present  one  is  gone?  Would our children  have  become

people   who   rejoice  in  the  exercise   of   creative

intelligence, equipped for what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



lies  ahead?  This question needs to be asked  and  asked

again,  and  reconsidered, as knowledge and circumstances

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the educational enterprise needs to be

managed.  It needs to be managed effectively, and this is

precisely  what we are attempting to do.   Singapore  has

travelled  a  long  way  in our short  history.   We  are

evolving from an industrial-based economy to a knowledge-based  one.   The  engines of growth  are  knowledge  and

innovation.   Likewise,  our education  system  has  been

subject to multiple changes in accordance with the  needs

of nation-building.  It has generally served us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the time has come to revisit the core beliefs

and  review  them.  The rationale for a  review  is  very

clear.   Our children need to be better prepared for  the

knowledge age.  Secondly, diversity needs to be  injected

into  the  system  to  cater to the different  needs  and

talents of our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes will revolve around two central

ideas.   Firstly,  the  need to develop  thinking  skills

through a revised JC curriculum.  I wonder whether we can

actually  teach  creativity.  Perhaps, an  atmosphere  of

spontaneity is a natural way to encourage one to explore,

discover  and create.  Secondly, students with  different

talents  and  aptitudes will have alternative  routes  to

embark  upon.  The proposed changes will cater  to  their

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is felt that the JC curriculum seriously

needs  to change its focus.  In the past, it was obsessed

with  content.  Today, the emphasis must be on developing

knowledge skills that are increasingly in demand.   Tools

of  reasoning  and interpretation would be  the  building

blocks  of independent research.  A re-look at the  scope

and content of JC subjects would be imperative, if indeed

we   are  to  provide  students  with  more  breadth  and

flexibility.  Curriculum content may need to be downsized

to  accommodate the introduction of new subjects and  the

increased emphasis on the non-academic curriculum.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern, Sir, stems from parents' expectations.

We  have to allay their worries and make them understand.

Changes, to some of them, may be radical and unjustified.

JC  subjects will be redefined to keep up with the latest

advancements  in  science,  technology  and   information

technology.   It is also proposed that any  subject  that

cuts   across  traditional  disciplines  and  adopts   an

integrative approach can and should be introduced.   Take

a  subject like bio-chemistry, for example, it has become

a  must for anybody who wishes to embark on the field  of

life  sciences.  I think it is good that MOE is exploring

introducing this subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-academic area also deserves much attention

if  we  are  serious about developing more wholesome  and

well-rounded students.  It is good to know that  the  co-curricular   activities  would  be   allocated   a   high

percentage for university education.  Until now,  I  must

say  that  it  all  sounds well  and  good  but  have  we

considered the serious ramifications of this approach  of

learning?   For  example, the changes in  the  curriculum

structure  may  be matched by changes in assessment.   As

suggested  in  the report, we may need to go  beyond  the

traditional pen and paper test and introduce new  methods

of  testing  critical thinking if we  can  indeed  assess

critical thinking and creativity effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the assessment system may be complex

in  nature,  even  subjective.   How  will  students  and

parents  alike  react  to  this?   We  can  expect   that

different teaching approaches become possible as students

are encouraged to experiment, explore and discover.  This

is  surely a step forward for all.  We must keep in  mind

that  the  proposed changes can only work with  the  full

cooperation  of teachers and staff.  Will  they  then  be

adequately trained?  Implementation definitely will  have

some   teething  issues  and  we  will  need  to  prepare

ourselves for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am in full support of the

seamless upper secondary/

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



JC  education proposal.  The reason is obvious.  Students

that  are especially ready for universities need  not  be

subjected  to  two examinations over a  period  of  three

years.   The through-train period will undoubtedly remove

the elements of interruption and wasted opportunities.  I

know  for  a  fact that, as it is now, the JC 1  students

resent  having to pass yet another examination to get  to

JC  2 where in fact, the examination that matters is  the

GCE  "A" levels.  Theoretically, the through-train system

sounds simple but how do we prove that the GCE "O" levels

is  unnecessary to some?  What happens to these  students

if  they  fail  their GCE "A" levels or the International

Baccalaureate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee proposed that the IP schools that

do  not  offer  "O" levels will continue to have  school-based  assessments  to  measure the  students'  progress.

Will  under-performing  students  have  to  transfer   to

another  school?   Will  the  employment  industry  adapt

quickly to the new types of qualifications that they  may

come across or will the students have to bear the painful

cost  of  convincing the would-be employers?  Old  habits

die  hard,  so  they say.  More often than  not,  policy-makers  may  not  always be able to  see  the  unexpected

results of these changes.  IP schools can also be  viewed

as  a  disguised  form of streaming, as mentioned  by  my

earlier colleagues.  Elitists, as it is called, to  some.

How do you manage these concerns?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Committee highlighted

the  pertinent issues of privately-funded schools.   What

can  they  contribute?   How do we  position  them?   One

important  advantage  with private schools  is  to  allow

families  who  have been away to come  home  and  educate

their  children in Singapore.  Providing this alternative

is  a  sensible move.  I personally know of a family  who

returned  and was compelled to emigrate again when  their

children  simply could not cope with the constraints  and

the  requirements of our national schools.  The  language

issue  and  the different curriculum can be  overwhelming

for  both  children  and parents alike.   Exposing  young

Singaporeans to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



foreign students within these private schools can also be

beneficial to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, some concerns with regard to

such  private  entities.   If  we  are  not  cautious,  a

different  model  may  ultimately  emerge,  positive   or

negative,   one  incongruous  to  our  fairly  homogenous

education  landscape.   While we should  provide  greater

variety  and choice for Singapore students,  we  have  to

take  steps  to  ensure  that the desired  standards  are

maintained.   Also, the national education policy  should

be adhered to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final concern pertaining to the private school

initiative    is   the   exclusive   nature    of    such

establishments.   Should  they  grow  in  popularity  and

become  relatively costly, what will happen to  the  less

endowed  or  the have-nots?  Will they be  denied  entry?

The  proposal  to set up specialised independent  schools

could  not  have come at a better time.  It is an  urgent

response  to  the  diverse needs and aspirations  of  our

students.  This diversity will be our pillar of  strength

as  we  face  the very challenges of the  future.   These

schools  will offer support to students with  talents  in

the  specific  fields like arts, sports, Mathematics  and

Science.   May  I  suggest that  perhaps  more  areas  of

specialisation  could be considered.  As opposed  to  the

privately-funded schools, this category of  schools  will

complement,  if  not,  enhance our  education  landscape.

Success  is almost certain as the relevant agencies  will

be  encouraged  to  take  the lead  in  this  initiative,

naturally  with  the  support of MOE.   We  already  have

agencies  with  the appropriate expertise,  networks  and

specialised  resources that can be mobilised  to  support

this  endeavour.  Also, if I may add, in  the  long-term,

the  related industries must be developed to ensure  that

these  students have fruitful careers and can  contribute

positively to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I take one last look at the sweeping reforms we

intend to carry out, I envisage the challenge that awaits

us  and,  that is, to skilfully strike a balance  between

the  objectives that are in fact contradictory.   On  one

hand,  we  need to engage students in greater breadth  of

learning, on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



other, we must maintain the depth of our JC subjects.  We

speak of importance of flexibility, yet we will not  want

to compromise the present rigour of our education system.

Hence,  balancing  such opposing  objectives  will  be  a

challenge  for all stakeholders.  Only then will  reforms

be successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the recommended changes and

reforms  may  be unsettling but they will  certainly  add

colour   to  our  education  landscape.   It  is   indeed

encouraging to note that we presently recognise the  need

to  teach our young different life skills and we are bent

on  acting upon this realisation.  Perhaps sometime soon,

we  will realise that developing such abilities may  need

to  begin at a younger age.  The impressionable years are

precious and time may not be on our side. Hence, it  will

be   worthwhile  for  the  Ministry  to  consider  making

comparable changes for the foundation years.   Like  many

of  my fellow colleagues before me, I would like to  add,

and  I  cannot emphasise this enough, that at the end  of

the  day,  all  the  beautiful  plans  and  instructional

objectives  will  mean  very  little  if  they  are   not

implemented properly.  Hence, I earnestly hope  that  the

Ministry will give full support in terms of resources  to

the  teachers  and  principals to ensure  that  our  true

objectives are met.
