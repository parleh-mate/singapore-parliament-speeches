<div align="center"><b>ELECTION OF DEPUTY SPEAKER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I propose that Mr Tang See Chim, Member for Chua

Chu Kang, be elected Deputy Speaker of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, I beg to second

the proposal.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There being only one proposal, I

declare Mr Tang See Chim to have been duly elected as

Deputy Speaker of this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, hon. Members join me in

congratulating the hon. Member for Chua Chu  Kang  on

his  re-election as Deputy Speaker.  Ever  since  his

first  appointment as Deputy Speaker, he  has  always

been  conscious  of  his position and  spoken  rather

infrequently and with moderation in this  House.  The

indications are that he will continue to speak in the

same  restrained style. I would suggest however, Sir,

with  great  respect, that you make more use  of  his

talents and allow him more opportunities to flex  his

muscles and stretch his vocal chords in the Chair of

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRE AT PUNGGOL ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Culture and

Science  and Technology whether and when the People's

Association proposes to construct a community  centre

in  the  Housing and Development Board Punggol Estate

which has more than 3,000 units.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the hon. Member for Punggol is aware, a proposed site of 3,300

square  metres  in  area has been set  aside  by  the

Housing and Development Board for the construction of

a  new community centre to serve the residents in the

new HDB estate in Punggol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association is now negotiating with

the  Housing  Board  with a  view  to  exploring  the

possibility  of the Board building community  centres

equipped with essential facilities on reserved  sites

within  HDB  estates.  There will  be  provision  for

subsequent extensions to these basic structures, with

construction costs to be met by funds raised  through

community  participation. If the new arrangement  for

provision of community centres can be implemented  in

the  near  future, the new centre for Punggol  Estate

should  be  ready to serve the residents  within  the

next few years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, can the hon. Minister

for Culture and Science and Technology enlighten this

House  as  to  when  such  negotiations  between  the

Housing   and  Development  Board  and  the  People's

Association are expected to be completed so that work

can commence as soon as possible?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

negotiating  with the Housing and Development  Board.

As  Members know, these negotiations are usually very

time  consuming.  But I am sure the  Member  will  be

informed when these negotiations are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



completed.  As  soon  as they are  completed,  I  can

assure  the  Member  that  his  will  be  the   first

community centre to be built.

<div align="center"><b>MODERN SANITATION FACILITIES FOR HILLSIDE DRIVE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>KOVAN ROAD AND LANGE ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law and the

Environment  whether and when his Ministry  plans  to

extend modern sanitation facilities from Yio Chu Kang

Road  to  the vicinity of Hillside Drive, Kovan  Road

and Lange Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sewerage system

completed    recently   in   the   Upper    Serangoon

Constituency  serves  the area  bounded  by  Hillside

Drive,  Highland Road, Sirat Road, Yio Chu Kang  Road

and   Upper  Serangoon  Road.  However,  due  to  the

topography of the area, the gravity sewer  could  not

be  extended to Lange Road or Kovan Road. A  separate

sewer  reticulation system is required for this  low-lying area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sewerage Department is planning to provide such

a  system to the area. If the project is approved and

funds are available -- I  need  not  add, from the Ministry  of  Finance -- public  sewers should be available in  about  two  to three years' time.

<div align="center"><b>OUTLET DRAIN AT AROOZOO LANE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Heavy silting and erosion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law and the

Environment whether he is aware that the  big  outlet

drain at Aroozoo Lane leading to Tampines Road is  in

a  terrible state, cluttered up with rubbish, heavily

silted  and badly eroded, and what remedial  measures

his Ministry proposes to take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the outlet drain at

Aroozoo Lane is an earth drain subject to erosion and

silt. This area is heavily squattered and rubbish  is

thrown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>

indiscriminately into the drain by the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permanent solution to the problem is the

redevelopment of the area and the construction  of  a

concrete  drain in conjunction with the  Housing  and

Development   Board  industrial  estate   development

downstream.  The  Drainage Department  has  plans  to

build   this  drain  from  Aroozoo  Lane  to   Sungei

Serangoon  and,  if  the proposal is  approved,  work

should commence in about two years' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the Ministry will continue to

desilt  and  clear  the  drain  of  rubbish  whenever

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following address in reply to the Speech of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our thanks to the President for  the  Speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the

opening of the First Session of this Parliament".'. - [Dr Chiang Hai Ding].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, to

continue  with  my speech, allow me  to  recapitulate

briefly  what I said yesterday because  it  has  some

bearing on what I am going to say today. Although  we

in this House are all from one party it does not mean

that  our  Government is adopting a one-party  policy

because  all  of us were returned in the  process  of

parliamentary  democratic elections.  The  opposition

parties  were defeated at the last general elections;

nothing more can be done because this is the will  of

the people. Parliamentary democracy will not exist if

the communists gain control of Singapore because they

are  the arch enemy to the democratic system. Indeed,

if  they  hold power not only will we be absent  from

this  Chamber, we may be in jail or buried  six  feet

underground. But neither will the opposition  parties

exist  except  the stooges. Although they  have  been

defeated  and  have  failed to dominate  the  student

organisations and trade unions so far, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



are  not  the  type  of people who  despair  quickly.

Revelations  of the past years amongst  students  and

also the revelations of the activities perpetrated by

G.  Raman  are  proof that their objectives  will  be

persistently carried out from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday I said that there were opposition

parties which openly were anti-communist parties, but

in  the  recent  general elections  these  opposition

parties   consciously   or  unconsciously   exploited

communist issues in order to catch votes so that they

could  get  one or two seats in Parliament.  This  is

dangerous  if we are not careful and if  we  fail  to

comprehend  our  situation, i.e, that  we  face  this

communist  menace.  The  communists  can  feel  proud

because  communist issues were used by the opposition

parties during the last elections, and that the anti-PAP  votes amounting to 26% could be intended for the

communists; though not all of such votes. Perhaps  it

could  be  due to our mistake that there  were  votes

cast against us at the last elections. In the name of

democracy, I wish to call upon this House and to  the

opposition  parties  outside  of  this  Chamber   who

believe  in the principles of parliamentary democracy

not  to  be  deceived or fall into the  trap  of  the

clarion call or influence of the communists in  order

to  gain  one  or  two seats at the  expense  of  the

interests of our beloved country. There are signs  in

the  forthcoming elections that if the communists are

unsuccessful  in an attempt to control  this  country

through violence, they would opt one or two political

parties  to  replace the Barisan Sosialis  which  has

been  ostracised by the people, and they  would  then

use  these  parties  to oppose  the  party  that  has

complete faith in parliamentary democracy, especially

our    party.   We   Members   of   Parliament    are

representatives of the people and we are expected  to

express  the  wishes of the people. Because  we  come

from the same party, the voice in this Chamber can be

regarded as self-correction for the purpose of taking

remedial  measures. For almost 18 years that  I  have

served in this Chamber I had no opportunity to  speak

as  a  Member of Parliament. Perhaps. Mr Speaker too,

since his election to this House, could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



not  make  representation on the aspirations  of  the

people  he represents. But now I have the opportunity

today to say a few words, not as a Minister of State,

but  as  a  Member  of  Parliament  representing  the

Kampong  Ubi  constituency.  Hopefully,  perhaps   my

little  contribution  will  not  offend  some  of  my

colleagues,    neither    will    it    create    any

misunderstanding  at all. We know that  there  is  no

government in this world that can offer everything to

everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not repeat what has been said by Members

over  the  last few days, but I wish to add bits  and

pieces.  For  the  past few years we  have  tried  to

evolve a Singapore society, rugged, self-reliant  and

disciplined. These principles have been the theme  of

our  message  to all the people in the Republic.  But

from  day  to  day  we  seem to hear  less  of  these

slogans. What we see, of late, is not a rugged, self-disciplined society as we are hoping for,  but  moral

decadence among our youths. They imitate the  western

hippies.  They  take to drugs. We  realise  that  our

small country, without any natural resources, depends

solely on our human resources for our development. We

depend on our youth because youth is the backbone  of

any  national  development. I do not know  where  the

fault lies. Is it because our life depends solely  on

materialism  or  that  the  implementation   of   our

education  policy  has deviated to  the  extent  that

students  show  no  respect for  teachers  while  the

children  show  no respect for their  parents?  Where

does  the  fault lie? There is the theory  that  drug

addiction  is  the  result  of  activities  of  anti-national  elements, especially the  communists  whose

aim  is to destroy our youth by the use of drugs  and

hippism  so  that in the long term our youth  has  no

future.  It would then be easy for the communists  to

influence  them  and they can then  easily  rule  our

country. I hope the Ministry concerned will go deeply

into   this  theory  because  moral  decadence, drug

addiction, etc, do not affect those students who  are

less  educated.  Many  youths who  are  in  secondary

school and who have completed secondary education are

drug  addicts. This is very strange.  So  this  is  a

matter which we must look into. We hope to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



build a rugged society, self-reliant and disciplined,

but  unfortunately today the reverse has taken place.

We  will  be questioned later on. At a time  when  we

hold power and the world acknowledges our progress in

the  fields  of  economy  and  nation  building, our

grandchildren will condemn us, "How is it that during

your  period  of  rule the moral of our  grandfathers

regressed? Their lives were destroyed with the result

that   we,  the  grandchildren, are  in  a   similar

position."  To  avoid such accusation.  I  hope  hon.

Members of the House will ponder together. We  should

think  deeply  into  this with a view  to  finding  a

solution.  We  realise  that we  should  educate  our

children  in line with the principle that our  youths

should  be  educated. Give our children an  education

different  from that which we have obtained,  because

they  were born for their era, not ours, and  because

their  era is different from that of ours. But if  we

bequeath to our children moral decadence or  if  they

are  influenced by anti-national elements,  it  would

indeed  be  a  great pity to see our success  in  the

various  fields of nation building destroyed by  them

in  a  very short time, all because the basic  values

for  their future had not been sound enough.  I  hope

that  the  relevant Ministry sets up a commission  of

inquiry into the causes of moral decadence among  our

youth,  and to make recommendations on the  ways  and

means  of  overcoming  these problems.  There  is  no

difference  between  the  communist  menace  and  the

dangers  of moral decadence among our youth. If  drug

traffickers, pro-communists and others, whose country

of  origin  is  outside of Singapore but subsequently

obtained Singapore citizenship, are found and  proven

guilty  of  such  perpetrations then  the  Government

should  automatically cancel their  citizenships  and

drive  them  away  from  this  country  There  is  no

Ministry  yet to really focus attention to  lead  our

youths  on  the  correct path If we cannot  create  a

special department for the youth, a youth and  sports

bureau should be set up to look after their problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Kampong Ubi, I share the views

expressed by hon. Members in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



House  since the debate began. For instance, although

this  is a small matter but as a Member of Parliament

who  holds "Meet-the-People" sessions, there are many

matters  which are brought to my knowledge and  which

need the assistance of a Member of Parliament. One is

the  matter  of  Government officers passing  on  the

buck.  If the people want houses, "Go to the MP".  If

they  want licences, "Go to the MP." Incidentally,  I

happen  to  be  a  Minister of State,  better  still,

"Approach  the Minister of State." We emphasise  that

in  the  present,  Government there is  no  political

nepotism.  So  we  must inform  these  officers  that

disciplinary  action may be taken  if  they  are  not

careful. Likewise, with regard to payments, here  and

there  people  are  complaining about  payments.  Why

extra  payments for this month? Why merely in respect

of  PUB  charges? If the people write back to appeal,

the  answer is, "Pay up first and complain later."  I

remember  that  when I was a member of  the  People's

Defence  Force my superior ordered me to do something

and  I  was not supposed to object. "Do it first  and

complain later " This is what is happening now. If we

pay  up first, we will have to wait for three or four

months  before  we  can get a  refund,  This  is  the

problem,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  raise  this  problem

because   in  my  constituency,  which  is   a   poor

constituency, a person earning $200 per month has  to

budget  for food, and this and that. If they have  to

pay  excessive amounts on monthly bills,  it  is  not

possible for them to draw up a budget. They  will  be

forced to borrow or to pawn their belongings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem in Kampong Ubi concerns

resettlement.  I  do  not object to  resettlement  In

fact,  the  question  of  resettlement  has  been   a

political issue since 1972. When I returned from  the

Philippines  the then Minister for Law  and  National

Development  notified that Alsagoff estate  would  be

acquired.  The  people agreed to the acquisition  and

resettlement  for the purpose of redevelopment.  Then

1973 passed on until today. What I regret most is the

families  would be resettled in the north, seven  or

eight families in the south, 10 families in the east,

and  six families in the centre. The houses of  those

families who had left were not looked after.  In  the

end, the  remaining families are scattered here  and

there.  They  suffered for more than two  years  They

sent   appeals  to  the  Urban  and  Rural   Services

Committee to have the drains repaired, and the  reply

was that the houses would be affected by resettlement

but  they  took two years to move them out. A  doctor

knows which particular disease requires an operation,

but  before he operates on his patients he  would  at

least prescribe Panadol to relieve the pain. However,

not  a  single action was taken This happened  in  my

constituency of Kampong Ubi. So there was an  absence

of   fair   play.  The  clearance  was  carried   out

haphazardly.  The people were told to keep  the  area

clean  but mosquitoes were found breeding in stagnant

water  in  the  area. As a Member  of  Parliament.  I

appeal  to  the  Minister concerned to  take  action.

Clearance should be taken in an orderly fashion, say.

start  with Jalan Labu, and not clear five houses  in

Jalan  Labu  and  then another five houses  in  Jalan

Kachang.  This  is  not fair to the families  because

empty  houses  become the centre for drug  addiction.

This was the case in a recent fire which occurred  in

Geylang Serai, where an empty house was found to have

been used as a drug den. This is the after-effect  of

resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of resettlement is that the officers

are  not  trained  in  their  work.,  They  give   an

assurance  to  the people that they will  be  offered

alternative  accommodation, but when the  time  comes

there  is  no  accommodation "The  houses  have  been

occupied." When asked for a reason, they were told to

see  the  MP. The MP says that, "The flats have  been

occupied,  and  therefore, the resettlement  officers

should  not  make promises." All that I have  related

actually happened in Kampong Ubi. I have not  touched

upon the problems in other constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which bedevils the people is

citizenship.  We are aware that in certain  countries

the granting of citizenship is tightly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



controlled.  I  agree with this policy.  But  what  I

regret  is  that  because of  the  fault  of  certain

parents their children who were born in Singapore had

their  names  misreported at the  police  station  in

those days. At that time police officers passed  only

Standard II or III. For example, the name of  "Chang"

was  changed  to "Chong"; "Mohammed" was  changed  to

"Ahmad",  and mis-spellings occurred. There are  also

people  who  were  born  in  Singapore  but  are  now

stateless.  They  have no country of  origin.  Is  it

right  that  the  children  should  be  punished   by

becoming  stateless because of the fault  or  sin  of

their  parents? This problem, Mr Speaker, Sir, should

be given due and weighty consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Malaysia but I came to Singapore. I

became a Singapore citizen and I can enjoy the rights

of  a citizen of Singapore. In fact, I am a Member of

Parliament.  Why is it that those who  were  born  in

Singapore, but because of the fault of their parents,

have  become stateless? I have harped on this  matter

in  this House many a time because this issue, on the

basis  of humanitarian consideration, should be given

weighty consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not concerned about those who were born

outside  Singapore I am concerned merely with  people

who  were born in Singapore. Nevertheless, those  who

were  born  outside Singapore should  also  be  given

consideration. In the spirit of ASEAN we should  act.

so   that  our  citizens  who  were  born  in   ASEAN

countries,  for  instance, if 100  of  them  obtained

citizenship we should reciprocate on a mutual  basis.

Sometimes  in a family you find that the  wife  is  a

Singaporean and the husband a non-Singaporean, or the

wife  is  a  foreigner and the husband a Singaporean.

This  situation is commonly found for many years now.

Before  the  introduction of family planning  such  a

family  may have 10 children and yet they are without

Singapore  citizenship. In the  spirit  of  ASEAN  we

should  discuss this aspect passionately. We  do  not

wish  other citizens to become our citizens. I  think

this is not quite just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the points that are constantly brought up

by  my  constituents who see me during  my  meet-the-people sessions. As the Member for Kampong Ubi,  they

put  these  grievances to me and, as I said  earlier.

the  most  important question is our youth.  We  hope

that   the  Ministry  concerned  will  take  positive

measures  so  that  we will not  be  branded  by  our

grandchildren  later on. We cannot be  proud  of  our

developments, successes and achievements so  long  as

our children suffer from moral decadence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Member

for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the President made his policy

speech in this House, many Members have spoken in the

debate  giving  their criticisms or  views,  many  of

which  seemed quite all right, moderate or objective.

They  merit  the  attention of  this  House  and  the

attention  of the Ministries concerned. On the  other

hand, certain criticisms do not seem practical;  they

even  run  counter to the policies and principles  of

the  Government. Therefore, it behoves the Ministries

concerned  to  reply,  explain  or  to  correct  such

criticisms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe hon. Members will agree with my

views,  that in the present living environment  there

are  many matters which are easier to talk about than

to  act,  not  to speak of the complex  entity  of  a

society  consisting  of a very complicated  structure

made up of diverse factors. If we emphasise only  one

aspect  of  something it may lead to the  neglect  of

other  aspects.  So only a balanced  development  can

help maintain a balanced progress of a society. There

is  a Chinese saying to illustrate this point "Though

the  peony flower is beautiful, it needs green leaves

to  contrast  and  bring out its  beauty."  Moreover,

before  the  plant can grow luxuriantly the  gardener

has to take a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



long time and much effort to fertilise, water and  to

cultivate  the plant before it can come  into  bloom.

Therefore,  if  we just look at things  superficially

without  a  deeper  understanding  and  make  certain

assertions  about  them, that  may  not  be  correct.

Therefore, I would like to correct certain criticisms

levelled  at  the  Environment  Ministry  by  certain

Members.  At the same time, I will go a step  further

to explain the objects and the work of my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all. I will reply to the two points

of  criticism  made  by the Member  for  Changi.  The

Member  expressed his dissatisfaction  about  certain

hawker  inspectors of the Ministry of the Environment

for  having  taken action against certain  unlicensed

hawkers.  I  would  like to ask  him:  if  unlicensed

hawkers  are  allowed  the same  rights  as  licensed

hawkers,  then  what is the point of  the  Government

issuing licences to the hawkers? What then is the use

of setting up markets and food centres? Between these

two   categories  of  hawkers  there  must  be   some

distinction  made before the Ministry  concerned  can

know  how  to  exercise  control.  Furthermore,  this

matter  is  closely linked with the question  of  the

maintenance of public hygiene and cleanliness and the

preservation of the purity of water supply to  ensure

that  there  is no pollution. How are  you  going  to

exercise these functions without proper control? Sir.

before  us  is a realistic question, do  we  want  an

orderly  society  or  a loosely  knit,  undisciplined

homestead?  As a responsible Government  we  have  to

maintain law, order and peace for the people, and not

just  to curry favour with them. In so doing  we  may

offend  some  people, but because  of  our  duty  and

responsibility we have to try our best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of hawkers had been dealt with between

1966  and  1973,  that is a period  of  seven  years,

during which there was a nation-wide registration  of

hawkers  and  issuing licences to them.  At  present.

there  are  altogether some 28,700 hawkers.  Compared

with  the  present  population of  our  country,  the

number of hawkers is quite sufficient. In the Adendum

to  the  President's speech this point has also  been

clearly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



stated. On the other hand, I am sure Members of  this

House  may  not want to see a resurgence of  the  old

situation  some  ten years ago where the  roads,  car

parks  and  public  places were  all  congested  with

hawkers, At that time unemployment was at its height.

But today the situation is entirely different. We are

faced  with  a  shortage of labour. We had  to  issue

thousands of work permits to allow foreigners to come

here  to work. So the question we are facing  now  is

not  the  lack of jobs but the manpower. Under  these

circumstances, I believe the Members will, of course,

be very clear about what to do and what to follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has made another criticism.

He  criticised that the hawker inspectors  have  been

taking    action    only   in    the    Backbenchers'

constituencies    and   not   in    the    Ministers'

constituencies.  This is again even  more  incorrect.

Let  me  quote  some figures to the  Member  for  his

reference.  Since September 1976 until  recently,  in

the  Changi constituency there were only seven  cases

of   summons  against  hawkers.  In  the  Kreta  Ayer

constituency there were 52 summonses issued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on

a  point  of clarification. The comparison  does  not

seem to be quite correct, because in Changi there are

very  few  hawkers whereas in Kreta Ayer constituency

there  are  so  many. Therefore, the use  of  such  a

comparison  is not quite appropriate. It  would  seem

that   the  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary   stands

suspect of misleading the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I believe the

Member  for  Kampong Chai Chee has forgotten  another

point. Changi is a much bigger area, perhaps 10 to 20

times  bigger than Kreta Ayer. In view of  this,  the

difference  in the number of hawkers may  not  be  so

great. Maybe we have got to wait for another day when

a  proper survey can be made of the number of hawkers

in these two constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kreta Ayer constituency there were 52

summonses issued. In the Rochore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



constituency  there were 59 cases where hawkers  were

issued  with summonses. At the same time, I  have  to

reiterate   that  in  1967  when  the   exercise   of

adjustment  of hawkers and the issue of licences  was

undertaken,  the  first  constituency  to  have  such

action   taken  was  Geylang  West  which   was   the

constituency of the Minister who was in charge of the

Hawkers  Department  then.  The  second  constituency

where  the operation was done was Tanjong Pagar,  the

Prime  Minister's constituency. From these  facts  we

can  say  that  we do not make any discrimination  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about certain questions raised by

the Member for Whampoa. He said that we should

allocate more hawker stalls to those who are old,

poor, destitute or those hardship cases. In fact,

the Government has paid attention to this point for

many years. But from our experience this is not a

good way to help. I would like to say further that

the allocation of stalls has been done after a

thorough planning and consideration. The truth is

that only with proper planning and operation can

they make a profit. It is not just a matter of

being allocated a stall and you can then make

money. More important is that if you allot a large

number of stalls to the old or destitute at the

same place where the stall-holders lack experience,

then it will be of no help to them. Perhaps they

might be responsible for the poor business of that

hawker centre, and thus they would land themselves

in greater difficulty. The Member also wants to

know about the conditions for the allocation of 5%

of licences to hardship cases, This is not easy to

enumerate. I can only tell him briefly that -



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on a point of clarification. The Senior

Parliamentary Secretary referred to the criteria

for the allocation of stalls to old people. Mr

Speaker, Sir, my point was that these are people

with no other means of livelihood, Although they

may have had no previous experience in hawking they

still want to give it a try. So why cannot they be

given a hawker stall? I have in front of me a

letter written by the Hawkers Department to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



a hawker's application for a stall. If I may read out

the criteria listed here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to your request ... [etc].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform you that this Department has ceased

issuing  new  hawker licences. However, consideration

wit  be  given to applicants if they could ,  produce

documentary proof:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that they have citizen/permanent resident

dependants to support;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that they are unable to get alternative

employment  on  justifiable  grounds:  for   example.

physical disability:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that they are in financial hardship: and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) that they are 40 years old and above.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this means that if an old man does not have any

children  to support, he is, therefore, not eligible.

Or if old people are deserted by their children - the

children  may be earning a lot of money but they  are

not  filial and do not give a cent to the old parents

who  are then left high and dry, stranded without any

means  of  financial  support,  again  they  are  not

eligible.  So what do you do about such  old  people?

According to the four criteria listed, I do not think

anybody can qualify at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now the

Member  for Whampoa spelt out the criteria. If  there

is anybody who satisfies any one of the four criteria

listed, of course, he will be considered. Now let  me

continue.

Concerning the definition or conditions on the issue

of licences to the 5% hardship cases -



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary

has not replied to my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, allow me to

continue.  He  has a lot of opportunity  to  air  his

views. Sir, other than what has been said about  such

people being poor, destitute, old, or in hardship, as

the Member has said, there is another situation which

will also have to be considered. That is when someone

who  is affected by Government's clearance scheme  is

required  to be resettled and would thereby lose  his

means of livelihood.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the other criticism is about the raising of

hawkers' fees which might lead to an increase in

prices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not wish to

give way, Sir. He will have a lot of time and

opportunity to air his views. On this point we have

made a careful consideration. In fact, the

Government is not trying to increase hawker fees. In

fact, it is only a matter of reducing the subsidy

given because the subsidy to every hawker stall has

been quite substantial and has to be reduced

gradually from now. In fact, the present rate is

still far less than what is being charged by the

private hawker stalls, such as in private eating

houses or coffee shops. It is about one-half or one-third of the fees charged by the private hawker

stall proprietors. Whatever it is, when adjusting

the fees to be charged, Members will be given an

opportunity to discuss and debate the matter. When

the time comes, if the Member for Whampoa can extend

his vision further to understand the real situation

without looking through his own blurred glasses -



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.

Sir, before the fees are raised, we should be given

an opportunity to discuss, and not after.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That was what he said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng:</b> I will come to the point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) Sir, if he can see further, he will

realise   that  the  hawkers  do  not  constitute   a

significant  number  in  the business  population  to

influence  the prices of commodities. The Member  for

Sembawang appears to be putting on the same shoes  as

the  Member  for Whampoa on this matter.  It  is  the

manufacturers/distributors,   importers   and    more

important   the   production   countries   that   are

responsible  for  the  high  increase  in  prices  of

commodities  and  inflation.  Anyway, when  we  make

adjustments to hawkers' fees, then hon. Members  will

have an opportunity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



to discuss or debate about this matter before we come

to any conclusion or decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Member is that the

Government should not abolish pasar ma/am which is  a

characteristic feature of nightlife in Singapore.  In

fact,  there  are  many  features  of  nightlife   in

Singapore,  not just pasar ma/am alone.  In  addition

this  is a matter that affects the Government's long-term  planning.  The decisive factor  as  to  whether

pasar  malam  should be retained depends  on  several

factors,  such  as whether the pasar ma/am  is  in  a

residential  area, or along a main  thoroughfare,  or

whether  they  will cause complaints of inconvenience

to  the residents, such as complaints of interference

with   traffic,  noise  and  pollution, which   the

Government cannot just disregard. In such cases,  the

Government will have to consider the reallocation  of

sites  for  pasar  ma/am hawkers to  enable  them  to

continue  with  their old trade of making  a  living.

Such new sites may be in a market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point mentioned is that street hawkers

should  not  be  moved into a market or  food  centre

where  business is poor. This suggestion runs counter

to  the  Government's  policy and  principle  and  is

therefore difficult to accept. The main intention  of

the  Government in the setting up of markets and food

centres  is to raise the standard of hygiene  and  to

provide better services to the residents. Whether  or

not the removal of open-air street hawkers from their

shabby pitches to well constructed food centres  with

better   facilities  will  lead  to  better  business

actually depends on the individual hawker rather than

the  location. For instance, if the operator  is  not

"positive"  or a person without drive  and  his  food

does  not  suit his customers, then even  though  the

locality  is good, he may not get any good  business.

On  the other hand, if he can provide cheap and  good

food  and his services meet with the requirements  of

his  customers,  then  even if  his  stall  is  at  a

somewhat  lonely place, many customers will still  go

to his stall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the choice of locality for setting up

new  markets  and food centres and the  provision  of

ancillary amenities, we have all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



along  been dealing with such matters very carefully.

We  have  always considered the need for  a  suitable

locality  for  the convenience of the  residents  and

customers.  Generally, they are centrally placed  and

we  would also provide supplementary facilities  such

as car parks, tables and chairs, sufficient space and

other basic facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally speaking, in this age of progress

there  will  be produced two kinds of situations.  In

one situation, the people can change and adapt to the

new environment, where they will be quite comfortable

and  march forward together with the progress. On the

other hand, there will be those who cannot understand

and  hesitate; they do not adapt to the new situation

and  cannot face the challenge. So they become "drop-outs."  I  have  full sympathy with such  unfortunate

people. At the same time, I hope they will strive  to

catch up with time and compete with the situation for

their  own good. I would like to appeal to the Member

for  Whampoa  who  is  a learned  and  well  informed

economist and must be quite well versed with economic

matters  and the vicissitudes of economic situations.

He  should be able to show the people what to do  and

where to go. Therefore, I hope he can point out a way

to  such  "drop-outs" to look for a new economic  way

out for them - of course, not to become hawkers alone

- so as to provide new opportunities for them to make

a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would like to thank the Member

for  Anson for reminding me that we should  pay  more

attention to penalising those hawker licence  holders

who  do not operate the stalls but sub-letting  their

licence  to  other hawkers for profit.  I  thank  the

Member for such concern over the malpractice of  sub-letting  hawker licences, and we shall pay  attention

to him as we have always done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after replying to all these questions. I would

also like to avail myself of this opportunity to talk

about   the   situation  of  our  Ministry   of   the

Environment   staff  to  enlighten   Members.   These

uniformed  field  officers, in the  course  of  their

duty,  are often faced with a difficult and dangerous

situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



Sometimes they have to carry out their duty  late  at

night.  Last month, there was a case where a  thunder

flash was thrown at a few staff of our Ministry  when

they  were carrying out their duty in the early hours

of the morning. Fortunately, nobody was injured. They

were then dealing with a few cases of illegal foreign

hawkers. If I do not explain this situation,  Members

may not quite understand. I have said earlier that  a

society  consists  of various units which  interlink.

So, in such diverse units, certain members of society

occupy  jobs which are better than the others.  There

are still others who carry out certain jobs which are

less  desired.  Perhaps,  we  can  say  that  it   is

individual  luck, just as what is said in  the  Three

Kingdoms.   The  strategist  Kun  Ming   said:   "Man

proposes.  God disposes." So, there must be  somebody

occupying  some place in the society.  Such  are  the

difficulties  and onerous tasks faced by  the  hawker

inspectors.  They  are also part and  parcel  of  our

citizenry.  In the course of their heavy duty,  there

may  be  certain faults or shortcomings.  Very  often

these  faults are quickly seized upon and criticised.

However,  seldom  do we hear of any praises  for  any

good  work  done  by them in difficult circumstances.

This  is  not  fair to them. Therefore, lately,  this

work of uniformed officers is a job not liked by  the

young  members of our society. For the  same  reason,

there are people who are already in this kind of  job

in  the  Government  service and they  also  want  to

leave. I am not trying to argue for them or to defend

them.  What I am saying is that there should be  some

clearcut line drawn between what is right and  to  be

rewarded  and  what is wrong and to be  punished.  My

contention  is that if any of them has committed  any

serious  and  inexcusable error, then  he  should  be

severely punished. On the other hand, if any of  them

has  not  committed  any error  but  has  accumulated

merits for diligent and faithful work, then we should

by  word  or  deed  give  them some  commendation  or

encouragement. Seriously speaking, if we are short of

such loyal and faithful uniformed personnel, then  it

will be worse for the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



of   Singapore  and  they  cannot  enjoy  a  life  as

comfortable as the one they have now, So, in view  of

this,  we  should not single them out and  cavil  too

much  about their faults and shortcomings. I  believe

that Members of this House will share my views.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, a point of clarification. Let

me hasten to add that the Hawkers Department has done

a very good job indeed in re-locating the majority of

hawkers in good hawker centres. My point is that I am

not  against  the  re-location policy  as  such,  but

simply  requiring hawkers, already in good  locations

but  on the streets, to move into those hawker stalls

which  have  been vacant for a long time because  the

sites of those stalls are not good for business. I do

recognise that there is a personal element involved - that  some people are just no good at doing business.

But  we  are  talking about hawkers who  are  holding

temporary  licences and who are doing well  in  their

present location.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, in our resettlement policies in general,

not too much attention has been given to the loss  of

business  incurred by the people who  are  forced  to

resettle in the process, whether they are shopkeepers

or  hawkers.  I  have no quarrels  with  the  general

policy  of requiring our young people to go  out  and

work to learn a skill and so on rather than taking up

hawking.  But at the same time let us be  mindful  of

people  who  are old and who are widows,  who  either

have  no  alternative means of livelihood or  in  the

case  of  a  widow,  which the  Senior  Parliamentary

Secretary  chose to ignore altogether,  is  really  a

very  pathetic  one, Sir, As I said earlier  in  this

House,  she may be below 40 years or above 40  years,

and  if she has three or four children to support and

if  she only qualifies for a $200" a month job  as  a

sweeper or cleaner, how can she possibly support  the

children? At the same time if she has to go  out  and

work,  she cannot bring the children along with them.

So  she has to rely upon a baby sitter. But if she is

given  a  hawker  stall, she at least  can  have  the

younger children with her and that will save her  the

additional  expense of a baby sitter. So I  hope  the

Hawkers Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



will  relent  in this particular regard, namely,  for

hawkers and for widows and also for other people  who

are  resettled, like farmers who have no other  means

of livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we urbanise rapidly, the opportunities for the

small man are disappearing rapidly. If anybody

wants to start a provision shop or any kind of shop

nowadays, he has to tender thousands of dollars per

month rental in order to get any kind of business

going. When a farmer is resettled into a Housing

and Development Board flat, he loses the

supplementary income that he can derive from having

a few chickens, pigs and growing some vegetables. What can you do in a one-room flat if your children

are not supporting you, and your rentals and PUB

bills have to be paid, and the Hawkers Department

just refuses to give you a hawker's licence? What

alternative -

taken.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think the Member

for  Whampoa has not paid attention to my  reply.  He

made  several points regarding the old,  the  widowed

and  the  destitutes. In my reply  I  said  that  the

Government has all along been paying attention to all

these  hardship cases. But what I was trying  to  say

was that, in the same locality you cannot put all the

same  type  of people together because it was  of  no

help  to them. On the other hand, it would contribute

to  poor  business in such centres because all  these

people might be inexperienced in their business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another matter raised by him, namely.

resettlement.  I would say that under the  Government

resettlement  scheme  we  certainly  give  favourable

consideration  to  people  who  are  required  to  be

resettled   and  have  thus  lost  their   means   of

livelihood.  We  have in actual fact  taken  care  of

them.

<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to take this  opportunity

to elaborate on some of the more important aspects of

labour policies which are outlined in the Addendum to

the Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have natural resources or a big enough

domestic market. Our continued well being depends  on

our  ability  to attract foreign investments  and  to

sell  our goods and services abroad. We were able  to

do  this in the late 60's and early 70's aided  by  a

favourable  international economic  situation.  As  a

result we achieved double digit economic growth rates

and  enjoyed  the benefits of successful development.

Jobs  were created. Wage increases were announced  by

the National Wages Council.

There   were  increases  and  improvement  in  social

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the international economic environment has

grown  difficult. With the more than  quadrupling  of

oil  prices  and  fear of inflation,  the  industrial

nations  of  the West have aimed for a modest  growth

rate  of  5% per annum till the end of the 70's.  The

unemployment rates in these countries are expected to

remain  high.  In  1976, the world economic  recovery

slowed  down.  Though the US, Japan and West  Germany

have  announced  their intention to  stimulate  their

economies,  the international economic situation  for

1977 remains uncertain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OECD countries are our main sources of investments.

They  are also our important trading partners.  Given

the economic problems in these countries, investments

will  be  difficult to come by. Furthermore, we  will

have  to  face competition for investments  from  our

competitors   like  South  Korea  and   Taiwan.   Our

competitors will also be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



marketing  products and services in competition  with

us in these and other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given increased difficulties in getting foreign

investments and increased market competition and  the

need  to find jobs for the 26,300 school leavers  who

will be entering the labour market each year for  the

next  few years, policies to maximise our ability  to

persuade  local  and  foreign  capital  to   set   up

factories  here and for overseas markets to  buy  our

goods  and  services are called for. Where labour  is

concerned,  it  is in their long term  interest  that

unions  help to maintain industrial peace and  pursue

realistic wage and fringe benefits demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across-the-board wage increases and increases in

the range and quantum of fringe benefits would not be

possible  in  the  immediate period ahead.  Wage  and

other   increases   have  to  be   tied   to   higher

productivity.  It  is a tribute to  the  trade  union

leadership  that it has moved in this  direction.  In

the 1975/76 National Wages Council session, the union

leadership  has accepted full-offsetting of  built-in

annual  increments and a freeze on  fringe  benefits.

The   National  Wages  Council  will  look  into  the

question  of offsetting of not only annual increments

but all forms of increases in remuneration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two aspects of wage policies attracted considerable

publicity  recently. One related to  the  payment  of

annual  wage supplement. Honourable Members  will  no

doubt  recall that in April 1972, the National  Wages

Council, in an effort to end multitudinous  disputes

over   bonuses  and  to  provide  for  orderly   wage

increases,  recommended that employers be  given  the

option  of  choosing either an Annual Wage Supplement

(AWS( plus Annual Bonus or Annual Wage Increase  plus

AWS.  It also recommended the freezing of the  levels

of the Annual Wage Supplement. For those who had paid

bonuses of a month's wages or more before, the Annual

Wage Supplement would be calculated on the average of

the  bonuses  of  the last three years  or  the  last

annual bonus,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



whichever was higher, subject to a maximum  of  three

months'  wages.  The  only variation  allowed  was  a

decrease  in the Annual Wage Supplement when  trading

result or productivity diminishes significantly.  For

those  who had not paid bonuses or paid them at  less

than  one  month's wage, the Annual  Wage  Supplement

should not exceed one month's wage. The annual  bonus

paid under the first option was negotiable subject to

a   maximum   of  three  months'  wages.  These   NWC

recommendations were incorporated in an amendment  to

Section  46 of the Employment Act which were  debated

and  approved  in this House and became operative  in

July  1972.  However, it was subsequently found  that

firms  could still legally pay Annual Wage Supplement

in  excess of the frozen quantum. On 26.12.75 Section

46  was  further  amended to make  it  mandatory  for

employers and unions to observe the frozen levels  of

Annual  Wage Supplement. At the same time,  provision

was  made  for employers to make additional  payments

subject to a maximum of three months' wages with  the

written prior consent of the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bukit Ho Swee has suggested

that   employers  be  allowed  to  pay  Annual   Wage

Supplement  up  to a maximum of three  months'  wages

without  having to apply for Government approval  and

that  unions be given the right to request for higher

AWS  if  employers  made substantial  profits.  These

proposals  will mean a re-opening of negotiations  on

additional  AWS payments in the case  of  many  firms

whose  frozen  quantum of AWS is below three  months'

wages. This will be contrary to the objective of  the

Government's  wage policy of reducing  disputes  over

bonuses  in  the  form of Annual Wage Supplement  and

providing for orderly wage increases largely  through

the  form of NWC wage guidelines It will also not  be

appropriate  given the uncertain and  more  difficult

future ahead of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey of 2,016 firms conducted last

year  by  my  Ministry, 168 firms,  employing  25,192

workers, were found to have been paying AWS in excess

of the frozen quantum. Firms which have not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



been   paying  additional  AWS  in  the  past  should

continue  to pay only the frozen amount of  AWS.  The

problem  lies  with  those who have  paid  above  the

frozen  levels  in  the  past.  In  the  interest  of

industrial  relations,  the  Government  has  allowed

these  companies  to  maintain  the  1975  level   of

additional  AWS  payments if they  continue  to  make

profit  in  the year of application. If, however,  in

1976   or  subsequent  years,  such  companies  incur

losses, no additional AWS payment will be allowed and

they  will  therefore pay only the frozen  amount  of

AWS. This is a reasonable solution to the problem  of

those  who have paid additional AWS contrary  to  the

policy laid down in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect relates to fringe benefits. The

last  NWC  session had recommended a  freeze  on  the

range  and  quantum of fringe benefits  for  existing

companies  and  the provision of the minimum  in  the

Employment  Act  for new companies.  There  had  been

press  reports that some employers had tried to  take

advantage  of  the present situation  by  withdrawing

accustomed fringe benefits from their employees after

they have joined a trade union. My Ministry considers

such actions anti-union and contrary to the spirit of

tripartism  which  has  been the  foundation  of  our

industrial  harmony.  Unless  there  are  very   good

reasons, the same fringe benefits should be  paid  as

before unionisation A freeze on fringe benefits is  a

good   first   step.   The  subject   needs   further

deliberation by the NWC. Fringe benefits need  to  be

rationalised  and "bizarre" ones or those  which  are

not  conducive  to  our  economic  growth  should  be

discontinued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our workers will need to be

conscientious  and disciplined They must  strive  for

higher  skills and competence in the years  ahead  to

enable  Singapore to achieve a comfortable  level  of

economic  growth  in the midst of  a  less  promising

future  of  the world economy. The practice  of  job-hopping  among our young workers must be  curbed.  In

most  cases,  job-hopping among our  workers  can  be

attributed   to   their  lack   of   dedication   and

professional  pride in their job and their  impatient

pursuit   for  higher  monetary  rewards  and   rapid

promotion As a measure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



to  discourage job-hopping for frivolous reasons, the

National  Wages  Council will be considering  whether

employees  who  job-hop should enjoy  the  full  wage

increase  recommended.  Several  hon.  Members   have

spoken on job-hopping. Their concern and reservations

on the matter will be taken fully into account by the

Council  when it deals with the subject.  I  have  no

doubt that in making its recommendations, the Council

will  be  mindful  of those workers who  change  jobs

because  of  a  genuine  search  for  opportunity  to

improve  their skills. Monetary disincentive at  best

will  alleviate the problem to some extent. The  long

term   solution   lies  in  employers   taking   more

initiatives in building up a stable workforce through

better motivation and concern for their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our entrepreneurs and managers

must also play their part in preserving and improving

our competitiveness. They must pursue more aggressive

marketing  policies. They must seek more determinedly

to  improve the productivity of their firms. The onus

of   raising   productivity  rests  with  management.

Despite  much  encouragement  on  the  part  of   the

Government, not much progress has been made  in  this

field.  Part  of the problem seems to  be  that  both

employers  and unions do not know very  much  of  the

subject  beyond the desirability of the principle  of

higher  productivity. The hon. Member  for  Boon  Lay

himself   has   said  he  does  not  know   what   is

productivity.  One  can assume that  members  of  the

public  know even less about the matter. The National

Productivity  Board will have to do more  promotional

work in the field of productivity. For the benefit of

those  who  were absent in this House last week  when

the  Member for Whampoa elucidated on the subject,  I

would  like to add that productivity means  how  well

one uses our resources whether it is capital, labour,

materials   or  machinery,  to  produce   goods   and

services. An increase in productivity can result from

using  the  same  amount  of  resources  but  getting

increased  output  or  value  of  services   provided

Alternatively,  you  may get higher  productivity  by

producing  the  same  amount of  goods  or  value  of

services with reduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



amount  of resources. Productivity increases  can  be

obtained  through  better or more  efficient  use  of

either  one  or  more  of  the  resources  used   for

production.  Thus, management can  be  improved,  the

technology used upgraded or labour induced to give of

their best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council has been grappling with

this  problem  during its last few sessions.  It  has

come  to  the  correct conclusion that while  it  can

exhort  employers and unions to higher  productivity,

productivity guidelines should be worked out  at  the

plant  level.  I have been informed by  the  National

Productivity   Board  that  areas  for   productivity

improvement  in our firms are many. Employers  should

initiate  action to make better use of the  resources

of  their  firms. If they have difficulties  in  this

regard,  the National Productivity Board will provide

the   necessary  assistance.  The  Board  can   train

managers, supervisors   and   workers   in   modern

management techniques and systems. It also has a team

of  experienced consultants who can provide technical

advice  to  companies to improve  their  methods  and

quality   of  production  and  their  marketing   and

financial systems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management should also work out productivity

incentive    schemes.   The   benefits   of    higher

productivity  must  be shared between  employers  and

workers   This  having  been  said,  it   should   be

recognised that schemes to increase productivity will

have  to  be  worked out, implemented,  and  positive

results  achieved before incentive schemes are  drawn

up.  The  demand by union for incentives  as  a  pre-condition  to  increase  productivity  is  the  other

reason why employers have adopted a lukewarm attitude

towards any productivity scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In opening the NTUC Seminar on "Maximising the

Benefits of Productivity" at the Trade Union House on

29th October, 1976

of  NTUC  advised the participants that  productivity

programmes must precede incentive schemes,  not  vice

versa, and that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



more  rewarding strategy for trade unions will be  to

get  productivity programmes going, make  them  yield

results,  and  then proceed to the negotiating  table

with  confidence, and self-respect. I would  like  to

commend  the MPs who have spoken on this  subject  in

this  House as well as the unionists outside to  take

note  of their leader's advice. Nevertheless, it  is

gratifying to note that a number of companies have on

their   own   initiative   implemented   productivity

incentive  schemes.  Again the National  Productivity

Board  will provide the necessary assistance to firms

which  may  have  difficulties  in  setting  up  such

schemes.   The  Board  has  a  corps  of   industrial

engineering   consultants  who  are  experienced   in

setting up standards of performances which are  basic

to productivity incentive schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year the state of industrial

relations remained stable and harmonious. There  were

fewer number of strikes and other forms of industrial

actions  than  the previous year.  A  total  of  four

strikes and 10 minor work stoppages occurred in  1976

as  compared  with seven strikes and  19  minor  work

stoppages  in  1975 The conclusion to be  drawn  from

this   happy   situation  is   that   tripartism   is

progressing and collective bargaining is  working  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the challenges ahead, it is vital that we

improve on the practice of industrial relations so as

to  achieve greater industrial harmony. This requires

the  joint  efforts  of labour,  management  and  the

Government.  My  Ministry will  further  improve  its

industrial  relations services  by  adopting  a  more

alert  and  positive approach to the  prevention  and

settlement of industrial disputes. Priority  will  be

given  to  the  setting up of a  departmental  Labour

Service to build up a corps of experienced labour and

industrial relations officers. At present, almost all

the officers in the Ministry are from the common user

grades and, as part of their career development, they

are subject to external postings after a short period

on  the  job  Officers who have the  inclination  and

flair for such work and the requisite experience  are

not  able  to  remain long enough to establish  close

rapport with both management and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



unions alike, and to pass on their experience to  the

younger  officers. Furthermore, common user  officers

may  not  have the necessary aptitude for such  work.

With  a departmental service, the problems associated

with  an  open service will be avoided. Only suitably

qualified  persons and those who  wish  to  make  the

Labour  Service  their career will be  recruited  and

trained.  The Ministry of Finance is now working  out

with  my  Ministry  the details of  the  Scheme.  The

Scheme  is  intended to cover 21 Division I officers, 56 Division II officers and 70 Division Ill officers. There  is,  therefore, good prospects for advancement

within the Labour Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unions had in the past 17 years made

invaluable  contributions towards the achievement  of

the  national  economic and social  objectives.  They

could be counted upon to take the initiative to  work

for  better mutual communication with management  and

inject  greater professionalism among the second  and

third  echelon union leaders. Through training,  they

will approach labour-management relationships from  a

cooperative,  not  combative, position  :and  conduct

negotiations  with moderation and an acute  awareness

that  national  interests must not be sacrificed.  As

regards   the   third  partner  in   the   tripartite

partnership,  some of them will have to  discard  the

obsolete  concept of industrial confrontation  vis-a-vis the union. Personnel mismanagement in the form of

adoption  of  inflexible and insensitive approach  to

labour-management  problems and taking  a  too  rigid

stand  on  managerial prerogatives must be corrected.

In   many  undertakings,  systematic  procedures  for

communication will have to be set up and there should

be more consultation between employers and employees.

Through better communication, company loyalty can  be

evolved and misunderstandings leading to disputes can

be avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with our dependence on trained and

productive  manpower, optimal  utilisation  of   our

labour force must always be our goal, Not only is  it

important  for our workers to acquire skills,  utmost

efforts must be taken to preserve and safeguard our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



human  resources. The problems of safety  and  health

attendant  on our rapid industrialisation  have  been

identified  by  my  Ministry and over  the  last  few

years,  my  Ministry has, contrary to the  impression

created  by  the  statement of the  hon.  Member  for

Potong PaSir, devoted considerable effort and time to

improving  the  industrial safety and health  of  our

workers,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities were organised to promote greater safety

and   health  consciousness  on  the  part  of   both

managements and workers. Three campaigns covering all

factories,   the   construction  industry   and   the

shipbuilding and repairing industry respectively  and

one  safety month for the wood-working industry  have

been held so far, A monthly publication entitled  the

"New  Worker" on the problems relating to safety  and

health  was started in 1973. The Ministry  also  laid

down comprehensive standards of industrial safety and

health.   The  Building  Operations  and   Works   of

Engineering Construction Regulations was  enacted  in

1971.  A  new Factories Act was brought out in  1973.

The Factories Act will be further amended shortly  to

provide for enhanced penalties for contraventions  of

safety  provisions which are likely to result in  the

death  of  or  bodily injury to workers.  A  code  of

practice  and  a guidebook were issued  in  1974  for

construction  worksites. Guidebooks  were  issued  on

various  aspects  of safety and  health.  In  1975  a

guidebook  on  safety in shipyards and  on  fire  and

explosions was published. Those on power presses  and

forklift  trucks  were  released  in  September   and

October  1976  respectively. In 1973, a guidebook  on

silicosis was issued. This was followed by  others  - industrial  dermatitis and noise-induced deafness  in

1975,  and  hearing conservation and  compressed  air

illness  in November 1976. A van was commissioned  in

May  1976 to provide audiometric tests to workers.  A

tripartite  study  group  on accident  prevention  in

shipyards  was  set  up  in  1973  and  a  tripartite

advisory committee appointed in 1975 to assist in the

implementation  of its recommendations.  An  advisory

committee   on   the  construction  industry,   which

included



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



representatives  of developers and  contractors,  was

established  in 1973. Furthermore, to improve  safety

administration  in  factories, the  Ministry  enacted

legislation  requiring  the  setting  up  of   safety

committees  and  the appointment of safety  officers.

Training  programmes were also organised  for  safety

personnel,  supervisors and workers,  and  industrial

first aiders and nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also expanded its Factory Inspectorate

from  a total establishment of 36 inspectors in  1973

to  55  inspectors in 1976. The Factory  Inspectorate

stepped  up its enforcement by increasing the  number

of  worksite  and factory inspections from  9,995  in

1973  to  11,528  inspections in 1976.  Consequently,

8,741   notices  of  noncompliance  were  served   on

occupiers  in  1976 as compared to 1,689  notices  in 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these efforts, positive progress has

been   made  in  the  industrial  safety  and  health

situation  in our two most accident-prone industries.

Using  the  American Standards Association  criteria,

the   accident   frequency  and   severity   in   the

construction industry in 1973 were 6.9 accidents  per

million man-hours worked and 3,860 man-days lost  per

million  man-hours  worked as compared  to  the  1976

statistics  of  3.0  and  926 respectively.  For  the

shipbuilding  and  repairing  industry,  the  1   973

accident  frequency and severity rates were 16.9  and

2,880  as  compared  with 11.0  and  1,096  for  1976

respectively.  These figures show that  the  accident

rates have declined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this decline is satisfying, nevertheless the

Ministry is seeking to further improve the industrial

safety  and  health  standards in  our  industry.  In

absolute  numbers in 1976 there were  698  and  1,095

accidents  in  construction worksites  and  shipyards

respectively as compared with the 1975 figures of 651

and  1,142  accidents. In terms of fatalities,  there

were  in 1976, 32 deaths in the construction industry

and  15  in the shipbuilding and repairing industry

The  comparative figures for these two industries for

1975 were 36 and 21 fatalities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



respectively.  There  is some  improvement  but  more

needs  to  be  done  especially by  the  construction

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the construction industry is concerned, the

Housing and Development Board, the largest developer,

has  agreed to my Ministry's suggestion to set  up  a

safety  department and to train its site  supervisors

in  safety. We will concentrate on solving two  major

types  of accidents - falling from heights and  being

struck by falling objects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Potong Pasir has said that very

little has been done to retrain our construction  and

shipyard  workers to cope with the new situation.  He

might like to know that in addition to campaigns  and

the  supervisors'  courses, the Factory  Inspectorate

has  been  conducting safety orientation  courses  at

construction  worksites.  In  addition,  a  film   on

hazards  in the construction industry to be shown  to

workers  will  be  ready  shortly.  In  the  case  of

shipyards,  some 13,800 workers have so far  attended

the   safety  orientation  course  organised  by   my

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also opined that wooden

scaffolding  should be replaced by metal scaffolding.

This  matter  has  been considered  in  the  past.  A

committee headed by the Director of Public Works made

recommendations in 1 972 for the safe use  of  wooden

scaffolding. Its recommendations were circularised to

all  contractors. Metal scaffoldings,  although  more

stable  and mobile, have disadvantages which militate

against  their  usage.  In hot weather,  they  become

heated which render them difficult to handle. When it

rains, they are slippery and hazardous. But the  most

important  inhibitive  factor is  one  of  economics.

Metal  scaffolds are almost three times  more  costly

than  wooden  scaffolds. Until  the  costs  of  metal

scaffolds can be reduced substantially or when we are

prepared to accept a significant increase in cost  of

construction with the consequent increase  in  rental

or  selling price of HDB flats, wooden scaffolds will

continue  to  be used for many more years.  The  hon.

Member has also argued for metal scaffoldings on  the

grounds  that steel girders have to be hauled  up  to

high places.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



He  might wish to know that such girders are  usually

hoisted up through proper lifting equipment. It is an

unsafe   practice  to  pull  them  up   using   metal

scaffolding.  The  hon. Member for Potong  Pasir  can

profitably enrich his knowledge on this subject if he

acquires a copy of this report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of shipbuilding and repairing industry,

my   Ministry,  through  the  Advisory  Committee  on

Accident  Prevention in the industry, will work  with

shipyards  to implement industrial safety and  health

self-regulating  systems as part of their  management

functions.  A  consultancy team has been  set  up  to

assist  shipyards in this and other safety  problems.

My  Ministry  is examining a proposal to  set  up  an

Occupational Safety and Health Institute  to  provide

training, consultancy  and  research  services.   At

present,  training, consultancy  and  research   are

conducted  on  an  ad hoc basis by different  bodies.

Therefore an institute to co-ordinate such activities

appears  necessary,  especially  as  we  continue  to

industrialise  and meet other problems of  industrial

safety  and  health.  A report submitted  by  an  ILO

expert  on  the  matter  is  being  examined  by   my

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I agree with the hon. Member for Potong

Pasir   that  one  important  technique  of  accident

prevention  is  analysis of accident  statistics.  He

complained   that  the  statistical   data   in   the

Ministry's  Annual Report lacks vision and  does  not

allow  employers and workers to pin-point  the  areas

that   need  greatest  vigilance.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

statistical data on industrial safety in  the  Annual

Report  is to give a summary picture of the situation

in  the year reported on. It is therefore general and

not  meant  for use for specific safety  measures  by

employers or workers. The hon.

Member might like to know that detailed statistics on

industrial  accidents in construction  worksites  and

shipyards  are being maintained and analysed  by  the

Ministry.  These  statistics and their  analysis  are

supplied  to the two Advisory Committees for remedial

action.   These  statistics  are  also  supplied   to

shipyards  and  contractors. I  might  add  that  any

employer  or  occupier should  know  the  nature  and

causes of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



accidents  in their own factories or worksites.  They

need  not  therefore rely on the  Ministry  for  such

statistics  as  implied by the hon. Member.  However,

his  proposal that safety committees be  required  to

keep  standardised  accident frequency  and  severity

rates   will   be   looked  into   by   the   Factory

Inspectorate.

<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

certainly  say  that  this  House  has  become   very

interesting  and lively in the last few  days.  Every

Member who has spoken seems to be rejuvenated and has

come  out quite strongly on certain issues.  If  this

keeps  up and the debates remain as constructive  and

lively, then we shall all be working towards a better

government and administration for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  of  this  House  have  raised  a  few

matters  concerning my Ministry and I would  like  to

reply  to  them. Firstly, of course, on  sports.  The

hon.  Member  for  Telok Blangah  has  suggested  the

introduction of daylight saving so that there can  be

one   more  hour  of  daylight  for  the  people   to

participate in sports. May I point out that there  is

enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



daylight  as  it is for everyone to enjoy recreation,

if  the  people put their minds to it.  With  prudent

practice  of stagatime, the ordinary joys of  keeping

fit can still be the lot of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his references to facilities for sports and

recreation,  the  hon.  Member, whilst  complimenting

"the  many excellent facilities" which are being  set

up  for the people to enjoy when taking part in  "all

forms  of sports and outdoor activities", feels  that

the Master Plan caters for the haves and neglects the

have-nots. He may not be aware that one of the  major

objectives  of  the  Master  Plan  is  to  meet   the

deficiencies  in  popular sports  facilities.  If  he

makes  some enquiries and research he would  discover

that  there  are facilities in football fields, open

spaces,  swimming  pools, court surfaces  and  indoor

halls  which are largely used by the majority of  our

people, young as well as old. One of the offshoots of

the  Master  Plan has been the release of  many  more

school  fields  and halls, adding  to  the  array  of

facilities available to our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also said that the facilities

are    revenue-generating   and   this    immediately

eliminates  our younger citizens who cannot  pay.  We

all know, Sir, that the Government's policy is not to

provide  anything for free. Persons using the  sports

facilities are expected to pay for their use so  that

they  can  appreciate  what has  been  provided.  The

provision  and  maintenance of all sports  facilities

are  heavily  subsidised  by Government  grants.  For

example, a  football  field  at  Farrer   Park   is

subsidised  at 95% in its maintenance costs.  For  22

young persons using a well-maintained football field,

the  cost  works out at approximately 15  cents  per

head  per  day to the users, but it costs  Government

about $57 per day in subsidy. In swimming pools which

are the most popular facility the subsidy varies from

50%  -  90%  in  its maintenance costs.  These  costs

exclude  the  capital  expenditure  involved  in  the

construction of these facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young also have various fringe benefits as all

those in schools pay a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



concession rate to swimming poo1s and to the  use  of

tennis  courts on a school booking basis.  Again  all

those in National Service and reservists, who form  a

large  portion of our young citizens, similarly enjoy

concession  usage to poo1s and other facilities.  The

People's  Association Youth Group which  number  some

20,000   in   membership   also   enjoys   concession

privileges to swimming pools. The Liaison Officer and

Chairman  of  the  hon. Member's Constituency  Sports

Club would have been able to tell him that members of

his Club too enjoy this latest concession to swimming

pools.  This philosophy of our people paying a little

towards usage is to develop an attitude of proper use

and to prevent abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also spoke of his disagreement with

the  Sports Council's rationale in the Sports for All

policy. I would like to quote what our Prime Minister

said when he declared open the National

Stadium:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With a population of just over two million, let us

not  waste time to go Out of our way to produce  gold

medalists,  whether for Olympic, Asian or SEAP  games

There  are  no national benefits from gold  medalists

for  smaller  countries. For the super  powers, with

large populations, winning in sports becomes national

propaganda  to persuade people of the superiority  of

their  competing political systems. But it is foolish

and  wasteful for the smaller countries to copy  this

... Any Olympic sports council member or an affiliate

club   which  sets  Out  to  persuade  above  average

sportsman or sportswoman to devote the best years  of

their  lives to training and becoming gold  medalists

will  find their zeal misplaced, and funds  cut  off,

For they will do an injustice to these persons ...`



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said elsewhere that the Government's

policy of Sports for All cannot be achieved if sports

are  confined  only to the constituency  level.  More

emphasis will be placed on inter-constituency  sports

to  enable  a  broad base for sports to be  built  in

Singapore. It is through the building of a broad base

for  sports that Singapore can hope to produce world-ranking sportsmen or sportswomen. Our priority is  to

build  a  healthy and robust society. We  should  not

spend our time, effort and money in trying to produce

world champions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country needs the people who are fit and if

champions rise through our popular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



base  of  sports-consciousness, then  we  shall   be

thankful. But we do not need to produce champions  in

order  to encourage sports participation. Our society

has  not  the  infrastructure to support  the  narrow

pursuit  of champion production. On the contrary,  it

is  unproductive.  We  do not  need  to  purposefully

strive  to  produce a Pele or a Mark Spitz.  What  we

want  is  a nation of fair-minded sportsmen, able  to

enjoy  a  competition  in amateur  earnestness  among

friends  and  neighbours, to  enjoy  the  thrills  of

skilled  display  in  the  Athenian  sense  but   not

necessarily  to  see  regimented  materialistic   and

selfish  modern gladiators, unable to think  and  act

beyond the chase of gladiatorial glory. To this  end.

the  SSC  with  the  warm support  of  sponsors  have

schemes  for  the  improvements  of  skills  and  the

development of a skilled base.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hon. Member's observation that Constituency

Games  are  not  popular, for his information,  since

1972  when  Inter-Constituency Games were  introduced

there has been a steady growth not only in the number

of  games but also in the number of participants. For

example,   the   Inter-Constituency   Table    Tennis

Tournament  of  1977 has drawn 66  teams  out  of  69

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the suggestion that Constituency Sports Rules be

amended  to allow sponsorship by business  firms,  we

should  not adopt a commercial hard sell for  sports.

We  do  not want each constituency game to  become  a

duplication  of a Business House League.  Donors  and

sponsors are there and have been there. There  should

be  no  cause  and  call for blatant  advertising  by

sponsors.   It  is  the  subtlety  and   quality   of

harnessing  scant resources towards desirable  sports

promotion   that  have  hallmarked  our  constituency

sports promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the recommendation by the hon.

Member for Whampoa that constituency sports clubs  be

given  more  generous funds, the Sports Council  will

continue  to  provide  grants  to  help  constituency

sports  clubs  in  their  efforts  to  promote   mass

participation in sports. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



is  still no substitute for self-sustenance in sports

promotion  and I would urge that MPs should  continue

with  their  exemplary  leadership  and  approach  in

obtaining funds for constituency sports promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Long Kee has suggested that a

Department or Ministry be set up to probe into  youth

problems. I would like to point out that there  is  a

National  Youth  Co-ordinating  Committee  under  the

chairmanship   of  the  People's  Association.   This

Committee co-ordinates youth activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some comments on the care of the

aged.  Increasing  attention is being  given  to  the

aged,  particularly those who are destitute and  have

no  families  or close relatives. The  destitute  old

people are granted public assistance allowance by the

Social  Welfare Department. Those not able to  manage

on  their  own and requiring institutional  care  are

placed  in  the Woodlands Home for the Aged,  an  old

people's  home  run  by  the Department, or  in  old

people's  homes  run  by voluntary  organisations.  I

feel, as far as possible, old people should live  in

the  community  rather  than  be  admitted  into   an

institution. So, efforts are being made to  encourage

self-help among the aged so that given financial  aid

or  supportive help they can continue to live  within

the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that more has to be done for the aged,

but  the  Government alone cannot be expected  to  do

all. Voluntary efforts and community involvement  are

necessary. The community is encouraged to  assist  in

providing services to the aged. Various youth  groups

and  voluntary welfare organisations are  playing  an

important  part.  While more is being  done  for  the

aged,  the  Government is aware that it may encourage

rejection  or  abandonment  of  the  aged  by   their

families.  The  call to instil filial  piety  in  our

children and youth is welcomed The most effective way

is through the families and our education system



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Whampoa and the hon. Member for

Potong Pasir have commented on the inadequacy of  the

quantum of Public Assistance. The rates of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



Public  Assistance have just been revised last  year,

1st March, 1976 by 40% because of the substantial

increase in the prices of essential commodities since

January 1973 when the rates were last revised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since March last year, prices of essential

commodities  have  not  changed  much  to  warrant  a

further  review  of  the Public Assistance  rates  at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members are aware that the rates of

Public  Assistance are $40 per month for  a  Head  of

Household.  $26 per month for the wife  and  $17  per

month  for  each dependant, subject to a  maximum  of

$100 per household.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relief recipients, in addition to receiving Public

Assistance  are also receiving benefits in  cash  and

kind    from    charitable   bodies   and   voluntary

organisations.  Free medical treatment  is  given  by

Government  for  those who are ill.  Fares  are  also

given   to  relief  recipients  attending  Government

hospitals and clinics for medical treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort is made to encourage even the aged and

the  handicapped to do whatever casual work that  may

be available. This is partly to enable them to get  a

little extra income from elsewhere so that they  need

not   be   dependent  on  Government   relief.   More

importantly,  some casual work will relieve  them  of

their  boredom  and loneliness and make  their  lives

more meaningful



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for Public Assistance is stringent and

those  recipients who are able but unwilling to  work

are disqualified from Public Assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1976, $3.6 million was disbursed in Public

Assistance to a monthly average of 6,640 families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the case mentioned by the hon.

Member  for Potong Pasir, I would like to state  that

it  is not possible that the old lady and her husband

had  their Public Assistance reduced to $20 when  she

was  hospitalised If the hon. Member can  provide  me

with further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



information, I shall have the case investigated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department ensures that relief

recipients  are able to collect their  allowances  at

Centres nearest their homes so that they need not  be

inconvenienced  or  pay  unnecessary  expenditure  on

transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the head of a household is unable to collect

the allowance due to illness or other reasons, he can

authorise his wife or another person to collect it on

his behalf. Where a recipient is unable to get anyone

to  collect  on  his  behalf, the  Public  Assistance

allowance  is  made to the recipient  by  the  Social

Welfare  Department staff at his home. In  all  cases

where the recipients are ill or found to be bedridden

and there is no one to collect on their behalf, their

allowances are always paid to them at their homes  or

at  the  hospitals  by staff of  the  Social  Welfare

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Whampoa had asked why there is

no  provision of legal aid for criminal cases,  apart

from  murder  cases  He also mentioned  that  a  poor

person who is unfortunate enough to be involved in  a

criminal  case  and  who cannot afford  a  lawyer  is

likely  to suffer more injustice. Whilst it  is  true

that  the  legislation which set  up  the  Legal  Aid

Bureau  way back in 1958 did envisage granting  legal

aid  in  criminal cases, it was decided not to  bring

into operation this part of the legislation as it was

felt  that  there was a greater need with  regard  to

civil  matters then as now where legal aid  would  be

more effectively used to the benefit of our citizens.

Accordingly, when  the Legal Aid Bureau  started  to

function, it confined itself solely to civil matters.

The Director and four Assistants dealt with a lot  of

civil claims, ranging from the recovery of small sums

of  less than $1,000 to the recovery of premises  and

acting for squatters who were dispossessed when their

lands  were  reclaimed by their  owners  without  any

compensation whatsoever, although the squatters might

well have been in occupation for decades. Since then.

the activities of the Legal Aid Bureau have spread to

all the branches of the civil law, including drafting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



contracts  and  helping widows and  dependants  claim

their  dues from deceaseds' estates. They  have  also

been  most active and helpful to wives who have  been

deserted and left without means of support. It is  in

matrimonial  cases  that  the  Legal  Aid  Bureau  at

present   provides  the  most  appreciated  form   of

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in regard to legal aid in civil cases, the

Director  and his present staff have, at times,  been

compelled to farm out their cases to members  of  the

legal  profession. Accordingly, they find  themselves

quite  unable  to  cope with any increase  that  must

surely  come  if and when the legal aid  in  criminal

cases is introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that a request for the

implementation  of  this  part  of  the   legal   aid

legislation  has  been made to me. I  have  had  such

requests since the early sixties but on each occasion

I  have  been unable to bring about the operation  of

this  part of the legislation mainly because  of  two

reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the tremendous amount of cost that would have

been involved; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) it is felt that all prosecutions, being

supervised  by  the Attorney-General, would  only  be

brought  by the Police in cases where there is  prima

facie evidence against the accused, so that instances

of  injustice that may arise from a prosecution being

instituted  against  a citizen,  is  reduced  to  the

barest minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry feels that the social need for legal

aid in criminal cases in Singapore is not as great as

to  warrant its introduction now, but we do  have  in

mind  its  social  benefits and when  the, need  and

expense  that  will be incurred with its introduction

are  justified,  it  will certainly  be  given  every

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just

clarify?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Member can make his

clarification after I have completed my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is considering setting up a committee of

officials to look into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



immediate  welfare problems which have  arisen  as  a

result  of  developments and,  in  consultation  with

officials   of  relevant  Ministries,  to   see   how

assistance  can  be rendered in areas  such  as  rent

arrears   cases, allocation  of  flats  and   hawker

licences to welfare cases.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, quite a large number of points have

been raised by hon. Members with regard to the policy

and  administration of the Ministry of Communications

and  Ministry of National Development as well as  the

Public  Utilities Board. I do not intend to reply  to

all  of them. I will take a few points, the rest will

be taken in due course by the two Senior Ministers of

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that the fame of the hon. Member

for Kampong Chai Chee as a rat catcher has spread far

and  wide.  We also know him as a good story  teller.

But when he last spoke he revealed that he is also  a

fortune teller.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told us he foresaw the traffic jam that would

result  from  development  in  the  Central  Business

District  and  in  vain did he warn the  HDB  against

building  one-room  flats which  he  predicted  would

become future slums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us examine why no heed was taken of the

hon.  Member's  warning and,  in  doing  so,  let  us

remember that the period was more than a decade  ago.

i.e, in  the early 6Os - a period of a world removed

from  now.  Then, we were faced with the problems  of

poverty, of shortages and of unemployment. Now, after

1  7  years of political stability, economic progress

and social development, we are faced with a different

set  of  problems, though I say it is a more pleasant

set  of  problems  to  face than  the  one  we  faced

previously, and  that  is  the  problem  of   higher

expectations as a result of growing affluence



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average human being has a high propensity to

forget  the  unpleasant incidents in life.  It  is  a

useful quality and helps to keep him sane. The Member

for Kampong Chai



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



Chee must have this quality in a high degree, and  in

the   midst  of  his  great  oration,  he  must  have

forgotten  that  we were once faced  with  a  serious

shortage of housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not much construction activity, as you

will remember, Sir, in the period between the end  of

the   Second  World  War  and  the  early  60's.  The

population, however, had expanded  due  to  natural

growth and immigration and shanty towns or slums were

found all over Singapore. To the head of a family,  a

one-room flat in more hygienic surroundings  was  far

better   than  his  overcrowded, smelly   and   dark

accommodation. A one-room flat then with its  running

water.,  modern  sanitation, electricity  supply  and

proper  kitchen was heaven compared to the congested,

rat  infested, unhealthy and fire prone hovel  of  an

attap hut he occupied. Many hon. Members present here

today  must  have remembered how an applicant's  face

lit  up when he was allocated any HDB flat. He  could

not afford to be choosy then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for decent housing was urgent. Many

applicants could only afford to rent one-room  flats.

One  must  remember that the average income then  was

$124.58  per month as against the present  income  of

$506.73 per month. So whether we like it or not,  the

decision  was taken to build these one-room emergency

flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-room flat has served its purpose. It is

still   useful  and  will  still  be  useful.   While

listening  to the hon. Member for Kampong  Chai  Chee

the  other  day, I remembered a local  Malay  proverb

Lepas  jambatan buang tongkat, that is to say, "Throw

away   the  walking  stick  which  aided  you, after

crossing  the bridge". Lest we forget,  the  poor  is

still  with  us and there will be a continual  demand

for one-room flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of hon. Members, there are

3,587 applicants on the waiting list to rent one-room

flats.  This is 25% of the 14,086 applicants  on  the

waiting  list  to rent flats as at the  end  of  last

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, to come to the Member's suggestion that we

should do away with the one-room



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



flats.  Listening to him, I thought  it  was  a  very

simple  thing.  I only wish I had a magic  wand.  But

even though I had a magic wand which could, with  one

wave  change the one-room flats into an old  people's

home  or a community centre, I would not use  it  for

the simple reason that there would be trouble. He has

not thought out the problem properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, hon. Members must be aware that

there  has  been  improvement in design  as  well  as

enlargement  of the built-up area of HDB  flats.  For

example, when the first flat was built, the built-up

area  of the one-room flat was 240 sq ft. It was then

increased  to 320 sq ft. As we went on and  began  to

learn from the mistakes made, it was increased to 350

sq  ft  and the present one-room improved flat has  a

floor area of 370 sq ft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the rat catcher - I am sorry. The

hon. Member for Kampong Chai Chee gave the impression

that there was no progress made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> On the contrary, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he had

his  say  and we had all listened to him  with  great

patience. I think he should cultivate the quality  of

patience and listen in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Well said!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I get the impression that he

thinks  the  HDB  is  not concerned  with  the  older

estates. On the contrary, Sir, The HDB's priority  is

to  provide Singapore citizens with adequate housing.

It  has  done so for the majority and is now  turning

its attention to improving the older estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has already converted 904 units of one-room

emergency  flats in Bukit Ho Swee into 384  units  of

self-contained two-room flats. Similarly. Sir, in St.

Michael's  Estate, the Board has converted 816  units

of  one-room emergency flats into 360 units of  self-contained two-room flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> And raise the rent!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



Speech  with care, they would have noted that nothing

is  for  free  and  that  only  social  services  and

education will be subsidised But here. Sir,  all  the

one-room  flats  are  heavily  subsidised  and  after

conversion  they  will  still be  subsidised.  So  to

charge  a two-room flat for the price of one  is  not

possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification. Are we going to have a debate  or  are

we going to have a one-man show?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you have a point of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Point of clarification. Sir, I

said  in my speech that although this was done in  my

constituency, I decried the fact that the people were

being deprived of the cheap rental, I suggested  that

in  future  improvements might  be  made  by  way  of

increased ventilation and so on, but not to  increase

the rent. I hope that helps the hon. Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, it does help me to

refresh  my memory of what he has said. But  it  does

not  contest my point that you cannot rent out a two-room flat for the price of a one-room flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB is aware and is very sympathetic with the

desire  of  the  residents of the older  estates  for

improved  recreational facilities and amenities  such

as  those available in the new estates. It has  drawn

up  a  programme to improve facilities in  the  older

estates.  This, however, will  take  time  and  hon.

Members   must   understand  that  improvements   are

restricted   by  physical  limitations  of   existing

environment. There are also competing interests,  for

example,  do we provide car parks or open space?  The

HDB  will endeavour to strike a happy balance between

these competing interests



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of resettlement was also raised,

Resettlement  is  a  most  unpleasant  but  necessary

exercise. It has been the Government's policy to  try

and ameliorate the sufferings and hardship caused  to

those resettled. Much as we like to, we are unable to

offer the same facilities to non-citizens as we do to

our   own,   that   is,   giving   them   alternative

accommodation. Priority is always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



given  to  our  own citizens and as hon  Members  are

aware,  we have now more than 80,000 families waiting

for  public  housing in addition to our own  citizens

who are affected by resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, the rules have been relaxed

to give special consideration for permanent residents

who  are  affected  by resettlement  schemes  to  get

public housing on rental if one of their children  is

the holder of a Singapore pink identity card.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Resettlement Department has been offering

alternative  shops  to  all shopkeepers  affected  by

clearance  scheme  in  so far  as  their  trades  are

suitable  to  be  carried out in such  premises.  The

offer  is  open  to citizens as well as non-citizens.

The  only  difference is that in  the  case  of  non-citizens,  they  are not given rental concession  for

the  shops as these benefits are only offered to  the

shopkeepers who are Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to another subject, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

really  surprised that quite a number of  Members  in

this  House do not know what the surcharge on  a  PUB

bill  is.  Many  Members referred  to  it  as  a  PUB

surcharge. It is not a PUB surcharge. It is a  charge

imposed as part of Government's fiscal policy and the

PUB acts as collecting agent for the Government as  a

matter  of convenience. It does not form part  of  PU

B's  revenue and the PUB has no authority to  impose,

increase,  reduce  or  remove it.  Hon.  Members  who

request   the  PUB  to  explain  or  reconsider   the

surcharge are barking up the wrong tree



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Which is the right tree to bark?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Perhaps the appropriate place is to

raise it during the Budget debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Yes, we will.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> However. Members may be interested

to  know  that  70%  of  our domestic  consumers  are

exempted  from  the surcharge as their total  monthly

bills are less than $35. About 14% pay tax at 5%  and

the  remainder  pay  10% as their  bills  exceed  $50

monthly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the fourfold increase in the price of

oil, electricity  and  gas  charges  have  gone   up

considerably, and so have complaints over PUB  bills.

This  increase  in complaints is not only  common  to

Singapore.  It  is  a phenomenon  common  to  utility

authorities  in  other countries too. However,  there

has  been quite a number of queries raised by Members

over PUB bills and to assist them to explain to their

constituents,  the PUB has set up a  team  to  assist

Members  at  meet-the-people  sessions  in  answering

queries from their constituents. The hon. Member  for

Kampong  Chai  Chee  has made use  of  the  services.

Recently, he had a team from the PUB at his meet-the-people session.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> No. It was a forum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry. Meet-the-people forum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> It is still wrong. It was just a

forum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Right! Just a forum where they met

and  discussed the queries which his constituents had

raised.  It was a useful session except for the  fact

that the hon. Member was playing the hero and baiting

the members of the PUB team.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this House have heard from time to time about

how  uncivil some of our civil servants are.  Perhaps

it is not out of turn for me to say that from time to

time  we  also must remind ourselves that  we  should

behave  towards civil servants as we expect  them  to

behave towards us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is very difficult sometimes to resist the

temptation  to  play  the  hero  in  front  of   your

constituents but do not do it please at  the  expense

of those who cannot or will not answer back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold no brief for the rude civil servant but I

hope  and  expect  that Members  of  Parliament  will

always  behave  as political leaders should.  Members

who want to make use of the services of this team  to

help  them  explain some of the queries  which  their

constituents may raise with regard to their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



bills,  please contact the PRO. Arrangements will  be

made accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned sometime ago that the PUB is

encouraging  its consumers to read their  own  meters

and  they  will  be  billed according  to  their  own

readings.  This  will  thus reduce  complaints  about

wrong meter readings and/or over-charging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pamphlets explaining the reading of utility meters

were  sent out to all the 470,000-odd consumers.  But

so  far, only about 1,000 consumers are  sending  in

their  own  readings  for billing.  The  campaign  to

encourage  consumers to read their  own  meters  will

continue  and  the Board is working on  a  scheme  to

enable  the consumers to submit their meter  readings

on prepaid postage cards. I hope the response will be

more positive this time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Kim Seng suggests a public

debate  before  fixing  PUB  charges.  Charging   and

pricing  of  utilities is a very  complicated  affair

unlike  pricing  a grocery item off the  shelf.  Take

electricity charges, for instance. Different  charges

have  to  be  worked  out  for  different  types   of

consumers.  There  are  the  domestic  low  and  high

tension  consumers;  the  industrial  low  and   high

tension  consumers and the commercial  low  and  high

tension  consumers. Some of these consumers  have  to

pay  a  maximum demand charge in addition to  others.

These  are but some of the factors which have  to  be

taken   into  consideration  when  you  draw  up   an

electrical tariff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of Members, for the last

revision of electrical tariffs by the PUB, we engaged

a  very  well-known electrical and tariff specialist.

It   took  this  specialist,  a  well-known  company,

Messrs. Electro Watts. 2 1/2 years of very careful study

and evaluation before recommending a tariff which  we

accepted.  That is the new tariff in which  the  same

charge is levied for electricity, whether it is  used

for  power or for lighting. It is not a simple thing.

So  to suggest that we have a public debate with  the

common   laymen  before  you  fix  PUB   charges   is

tantamount, Mr Speaker, Sir, to my asking you whether

you would seek the opinion of the butcher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



before you embark on a very complicated operation.



<br><br>5.51 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to clarify

a  few  points. The first point is that  I  hope  the

House   will  note  that  I  allowed  myself  to   be

interrupted twice by a Senior Minister and I was  not

allowed  to clarify my position with one Minister  So

the  standard  is clear for all of us to  assess  and

watch.  If  that is gentlemanly etiquette  which  the

Minister expected, perhaps this is an example of what

he meant by gentlemanly etiquette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, just a few points, Sir, When I referred to the

one-room unit. I was referring to the emergency  type

one-room  unit  and not the improved  type  that  the

Minister has mentioned. That is the first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is with regard to my reputation or

whatever fame the Minister has bestowed on  me  as  a

rat  catcher. I did not ask for it. I would not  have

been a rat catcher if the Hon. Minister or some other

Member  had stood in that constituency, when somebody

else would have been the tat catcher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir, If the PUB claims to have

done so much for the people, I just want to know  the

cost  of  the construction of the PUB swimming  pool.

the  saline content of that swimming pool and whether

we, the consumers, since we pay PUB charges, are also

entitled  to  take advantage of that  pool  which  is

right at the roof-top of the new PUB building.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

know  that the Hon Minister is known for his debating

skill and verbal -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Dr Ong, are you rising on a

point  of clarification, or are you going to  make  a

speech?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think he has

unfairly distorted what I said yesterday What I  said

was   that  in  respect  of  PUB  bills  perhaps  the

television  could  provide a forum  for  the  PUB  to

explain  and justify its charges. I did  not  at  any

time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



suggest that the charges were too high or too low.



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, just now the Hon. Minister  said  that

some  relaxation was accorded to holders of Singapore

blue  identity  cards whose houses were  affected  by

resettlement schemes and that they would  be  allowed

to  rent  HDB  flats on condition that one  of  their

children  was a holder of the Singapore pink identity

card.  I  would like to ask whether, if the  children

are  minors, but born in Singapore, this aspect could

be given consideration?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, When a child holds

a card, it means that he is

grown  up. But in the case mentioned here,  just  for

the  sake of getting a Housing Board flat, they start

to  have  a  baby  immediately I  think  there  is  a

limitation there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very sorry that the Member

for Kampong Chai Chee takes it very personally. I did

not give him the nomenclature of a "rat catcher".  It

was headlines in all the papers. I do not mean it  to

be derisive. I am just making a statement of fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he is welcome as my guest to swim

in  the  PUB pool. The PUB swimming pool in  the  new

building  is part of the recreational facilities  for

members of the PUB staff. I do not think anyone would

deny employees of a large organisation facilities for

their  recreation and relaxation A swimming  poo1  is

not  peculiar  to  the  PUB.  There  are  many  other

statutory bodies which have swimming pools



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Kim Seng, maybe I did

unintentionally distort a little bit of what he said.

But  what  I am trying to convey to Members  here  is

that  to  debate  on  PUB  charges, especially   the

electricity tariff, is not a very simple proposition.

I  do  not think it is a practical proposition unless

you  are  a  specialist too. If it is  uncomplicated,

there  is  no need for electrical tariff specialists.

It  took the specialist 2 1/2 years to come up with  his

recommendation  To  spend 10 to 20  minutes  debating

this complicated subject over TV



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



with laymen is, I think, an impractical proposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have forgotten

one point. It is unfair for the Minister to accuse me

of playing hero at the forum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a matter

of  contention. I do not want to debate on this  with

him here. What I am saying is that we do from time to

time  in  this  House bring up the  question  of  how

uncivil civil servants are. We do not like that. What

I  am saying here now is that I am placing a group of

civil  servants  at Members' disposal  to  help  them

solve  their  problems with their constituents.  But.

for goodness sake, let us remember that they are also

human beings and let us be civil to them. That is all

I am asking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I am not disputing what the

Minister  has said. He is quite free to say  what  he

thought  fit. What I want to clarify is  that  before

the   forum,  we  had  a  discussion  in   order   to

crystallise  certain points to be raised.  Otherwise.

if everyone were to raise a point, the PUB team would

not  be able to emerge from the forum after midnight.

So  certain questions were crystallised and I had the

honour to mention just one of them. It happened  that

that  particular question was a bit pungent. The  PUB

team found the explanation rather difficult.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not asking

him for a justification of his attitude at the forum.

The  impression I had was that he was  playing  hero.

and my appeal to Members here is to be civil. Let  us

do  unto others what we expect others to do unto  us.

He  can  talk till the cows come home but he  himself

will  not  be convinced that he was quite  aggressive

and  he  was playing hero. I think it is a  waste  of

time  for me and him to stand up here and argue  over

that point



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I should

have the right to clarify this point. I am not taking

on the Minister on a debate on that point He got that

impression



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



Now  he is hearing it from me. There was no question

of  me playing hero. That was not my intention It was

a  simple question asked. If the Minister chooses  to

believe  the  kind of impression which somebody  else

has,  or  he  agrees to that impression,  I  have  no

control over his mental capacity. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Thank God for that!



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of National Development

appears  to  be extremely popular, as I have  here  a

whole  list  of observations and complaints  made  by

various  Members of this House. However, I shall  try

to  be  as  brief  as I can and go through  the  more

important  observations or complaints  made  by  hon.

Members.   To   those  Members   whose   queries   or

observations are not covered in my answers (they  are

actually  here) they can see me if they  really  want

the answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me start off with the most popular theme.

and  this  is the Housing and Development  Board.  To

start  the ball rolling, the hon Member for Kuo Chuan

questioned the transfer of tenancy of HDB flats  from

a deceased tenant Let me say that the hon. Member has

been  misinformed that, under the current  policy  of

the Board, transfers of tenancy or leases to the next-of-kin  in  the event of the demise of the tenant  or

the  lessee  are not allowed. The true  situation  is

that in such a circumstance, the HDB would effect  an

immediate  transfer to the next-of-kin of the  tenant

in  the  case of rental or the lessee in the case  of

purchase.  The immediate family who are  non-citizens

but are permanent residents also qualify. This policy

also  applies to applicants on the waiting  list  for

HDB flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Minister has replied to a number of queries

on the lack of recreational facilities as brought up

by the Member for Aljunied. Perhaps for the new

Member for Changi who complained vigorously on the

poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



workmanship in the construction of HDB flats, may  I.

for   brevity,   say  that  these  observations   and

complaints  were  made  at the last  Budget  session.

Could  I, therefore, indulge upon him to look up  the

Hansard  where all the reasons have been  enunciated.

One important point perhaps he should bear in mind is

that  in  1976  the  Housing  and  Development  Board

completed a total of 30,024 units of flats and shops.

This  is  almost twice the number of 16.147 units  of

flats  and shops completed by the Board in  1971.  In

terms  of  volume, this is four times the  amount  of

building space put in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I can just summarise for him, in general

headings,  what  the  HDB has done  to  prevent  this

complaint   of   poor  workmanship;   starting   from

apprenticeship  schemes with the Industrial  Training

Board.  He may have heard that the HDB has introduced

a  merit star incentive scheme for contractors. There

is  also an experimental scheme with different  types

of construction, such as the Danish industrial method

of  construction, the Australian progressive strength

method  of  construction, and  a  scheme  called  the

mental  formwork. So if he really wants to  know  all

the details, could he please refer to the Hansard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another complaint by the hon Member for Changi

is  that  the  HDB  does not give clear  instructions

regarding regulations governing renovation of  flats.

This  is also a general complaint made by a few other

MPs.  Let me state categorically that the regulations

governing  renovation work in HDB flats are extremely

clear  The procedure following the balloting of flats

is  that  the  successful  applicants  are  given   a

resident   handbook  providing  all   the   necessary

information  concerning application for  permits  for

renovation.  It also gives a list of contractors  who

are  licensed  to  carry  out  such  renovation.  The

majority  of  the  purchasers of the  flats  have  no

difficulty  at  all  in following  these  regulations

However,  there  is  a minority of  flat  owners  who

disregard  the  regulations, and therefore  run  into

difficulties with the Board. A common example is  the

removal  of  the wall tiles and also the construction

of a raised platform on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



the  floor. The HDB has to take stringent  action  on

this  as it has resulted in overloading of the  floor

which in turn gives rise to a reduction of the height

between the floor and the ceiling of the flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member has also mentioned the concession

shops at Changi. Perhaps he may want to know that out

of  a  total of 46 shops in Changi Village which were

let out solely to resettlement cases in January 1976,

the rising rental is only $277 to $555. Out of the 46

shops  let out, only one is left vacant. This  vacant

shop was open for public tender and the public tender

was  $750 per month. It is therefore unreasonable  to

suggest that the concession rentals are the cause  of

poor   business.  However,  the  Ministry  will  keep

monitoring the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson brought up the question of HDB

maintenance  charges.  I am  surprised  that  he  has

raised this question because he actually spends  part

of  his time at the HDB and he should know about  the

maintenance charges. Since he is not here now,  I  do

not think I shall answer his question because I think

he knows what it is all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next observation made by the Member for

Telok Blangah as well as the Member for Punggol is on

better timing of bus services to new housing estates.

I  think  that  is a valid observation.  The  HDB  is

equally  concerned  and,  therefore,  the  Board  has

instituted a number of formal channels together  with

the  SBS in order to plan a proper time schedule  for

buses serving new estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance for financially needy tenants was

mentioned  by  the hon. Member for  Ang  Mo  Kio.  It

suffices for me merely to mention that his concern is

well  placed, and that the HDB is helping these needy

tenants  in  various ways: for example,  giving  them

special consideration for hawker stalls, by informing

the  various CCCs and MCs and also the Social Welfare

Department on their need for financial assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Whampoa has mentioned that the

HDB should be careful in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



selecting  proper sites for hawkers. That observation

is  noted  and I can say that that is actually  being

followed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another observation made by the Member for Whampoa

is on the question of designing window grilles. Here,

the   Board   must  explain  that  it  is   obviously

undesirable to give a free hand in the decoration  of

flats  to the whims and fancies of each occupier.  As

far as the internal surfacing is concerned, they have

a  free  choice.  But  for external  presentation,  a

certain  conformity is required. If there is lack  of

such  control  in some blocks of private  flats,  the

result  is  a  chaotic presentation of  exteriors  of

buildings which becomes an eyesore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> A point of clarification, Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, On this point of window grilles,

I do not see how this can affect the exterior. I have

looked  at  many  private flats and  they  look  very

beautiful It is a matter of taste.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, as the Member has correctly pointed out, it is a

matter   of  taste.  And  since  the  HDB  has   that

authority, the taste is HDB's. Anyway, we will try to

give as best a design as we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also brought up the question of open

air coffee shops. I would like to mention that coffee

shops  also  involve the Ministry of the Environment.

If  more  tables and chairs are allowed in  the  open

areas,  there  is a possibility that  they  may  need

larger  kitchens,  perhaps bigger toilets,  and  this

could lead to the problem of obstruction and to other

complaints from residents or proprietors of  adjacent

shops.   From  experience,  there  have   been   such

complaints  in  the  past and even  of  incidents  of

fights,  and  the HDB therefore stringently  observes

the  policy  of  not  allowing extensions  into  open

areas.  Anyway, let me assure the Member that if  any

case merits consideration, it will be so given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member's observation on one-room flats has

been ably explained by my Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next lot of questions from Members is on

resettlement.  Here again. I am glad  that  the  hon.

Member for Jurong is not here because he is extremely

persevering. He has brought up the question  of  bona

fide farmer, every now and then. In fact. I just want

to  tell him that a bona fide farmer has been defined

as  one  whose  livelihood is entirely  dependent  on

farming,  and that subject has been brought  up  many

times in the last Parliament where he had asked  some

questions  and  we had given him some replies.  So  I

think there is no point `In labouring through all the

various answers which run into three pages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Member for Changi has touched on the

question  of  resettlement. He  complained  that  the

people  were not properly compensated and  even  said

that   a   resettlement  officer  actually   made   a

commitment on the amount of compensation to be  paid.

If  it was a verbal commitment, we are in no position

to  say  whether  it is right or wrong.  But  let  me

assure  him  that, as far as we are concerned,  there

can be no instance where, the actual compensation  is

different  from  the  amount  originally   given   in

writing.  If the Member is convinced that  he  has  a

case, we would be prepared to investigate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also went on to complain about the

unsympathetic, impatient and  high-handed  officials

bullying  illiterate rural folks by  asking  them  to

sign  documents hurriedly. Here again, I  can  merely

reiterate   that  resettlement  officers  have   been

instructed - and if he wants I can send him circulars

to  that  effect  -  to  provide  all  the  necessary

explanations  and  guidance  to  those  affected   by

resettlement. Again, if the Member can  bring  to  my

attention   any  specific  cases  of   rudeness   and

discourtesy, we will be happy to investigate. I think

the Member should be happy with all these replies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new MP has also brought up the question of

inadequate compensation Here again, if he could  bear

with  us  and look up the Hansard of the last  Budget

session, when we spent a lot of time explaining  the

adequacy of the compensation. In fact, it touches  on

the resettlement of farmers who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



are  allocated land and resettlement in  housing  for

farmers  who  give  up their land  and  who  are  not

allowed  to continue farming. So I would ask  him  to

look up the Hansard on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also went on to say that the Resettlement

Department is very hardhearted and that they  do  not

take  into  consideration the livelihood of  affected

elderly  farmers who have been working in  the  field

for  many  years. Here again, I can simply  say  that

farmers  who  qualify for land allocation  are  given

alternative  land to continue their  livelihood.  But

for  those who do not opt for alternative land, they

get enhanced compensation and a free flat, or cash in

lieu is given. It is the present policy of the HDB to

build  flats in the rural centres. These centres  are

close  to the farming areas where employment  can  be

found  in the larger farms which are, by the way, in

short  supply  of  farmers  or  workers.  Such  rural

centres  can be found in Jalan Kayu and Punggol.  But

if  the  Member can justify that he has a really  big

farming  community in Changi, perhaps he can  let  us

know that he may need such facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Kampong Chai

Chee has again been answered by my Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> There is no answer yet.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Is the Member referring to a

single  person  who is a citizen and is  affected  by

resettlement and that he has to combine with  another

single person to qualify for priority allocation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Well, in fact I have the answer

here.  There  are  a large number of  single  persons

affected  by resettlement schemes and that  makes  it

necessary  to suggest that they should  pair  up  for

allocation of one-room HDB flats. Our experience  has

shown  that  these single persons who seek  rehousing

are  often  quite  old  and are without  children  or

relatives,  Most  of them merely  occupy  a  bunk  or

sharing a cubicle or room with others It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



therefore more humane and indeed practical to rehouse

them  with  other persons so as to provide them  with

some   form   of   companionship  and  respite   from

loneliness and also an opportunity to share rent  and

utility  expenses.  If  they  cannot,  then  the   MP

concerned  can always write to us and, on sympathetic

and hardship grounds, consideration can be given.  As

I have mentioned many times before, each case will be

considered on its own merit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's query on permanent residents affected

by resettlement has been answered by my Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon has queried that in the

rural  areas  the  orchid growers and  tropical  fish

breeders   affected  by  clearance  could  not   find

alternative sites. In Singapore, available  land  for

agriculture   is   unfortunately  limited.   Although

tropical fish breeders and orchid growers are earners

of  foreign exchange, priorities for alternative land

is  accorded  to those agricultural activities  which

produce  food  such  as  pig, poultry  and  vegetable

growing. The Primary Production Department has  found

it  extremely difficult to provide alternative  sites

for  aquarium  fish  breeders due  to  their  special

requirements.  They  require sites  with  good  water

supply  and soil conditions which are able to  retain

water  for  proper  fish  breeding.  Such  areas  are

extremely limited in Singapore and, if available, are

normally heavily encumbered with existing farms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to orchid growers, the Department is

currently  making available the buffer zones  of  the

pig   farming   estates  at  Jalan   Kayu   for   the

resettlement of viable orchid growers



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> May I make a point of clarification? On the

question of old folks finding their own "flat mates",

if  I  may  use the word, would it not be easier  for

them if the HDB, since the HDB knows who they are and

their  whereabouts, could help them to look for "flat

mates",  rather  than asking them to look  for  their

mates themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the match-making role actually is being performed by the HDB.

If  the lonely old man seeks another old man, he  can

approach the Area Office and ask them whether or  not

there  is  any other old man interested in sharing  a

flat  with him. This is actually being done  all  the

time. I have promised the Leader of the House that  I

will finish my reply in half' an hour, and I think  I

can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied asked a question on the

preservation  of old buildings. I think  this  is  an

important observation. The Government is fully  aware

of the need to retain buildings of a historical value

and architectural merit to serve as a reminder of our

history  and cultural heritage. Arising from this,  a

Preservation  of Monuments Board was  established  in

1971  to preserve monuments of historic, traditional,

archaelogical,  architectural or artistic  interests.

The  primary task of the Board is to recommend to the

Minister for National Development the monuments to be

preserved  and  placed under the  protection  of  the

Board.  Members of the Board come from  a  very  wide

spectrum  of  our society and include representatives

from   the  architecture  and  planning  disciplines,

development   agencies,   cultural   and    religious

organisations and the business community.  Since  its

creation  the Minister has, on the recommendation  of

the  Preservation of Monuments Board, gazetted  eight

buildings, among which are mosques, temples, churches

and a medical institution for preservation. The Board

is now looking into the preservation of entire street

blocks, including some buildings in Chinatown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has brought up another point

on  the  Primary Production Department's  ability  to

teach hydroponics for growing vegetables. This is not

a  new  comment, The House was informed of the  PPD's

efforts to publicise the method of growing vegetables

at  its  last sitting in November, 1976, just  before

the  Member was elected. Anyway, may I sum it  up  by

saying  that the results of the experiments conducted

by the PPD on hydroponics have been widely publicised

over the last two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



years  by the press, RTS and in publications such  as

the PPD Bulletin and the Singapore Journal of Primary

Industries.  On top of that, there is an  Agriculture

Handbook  which is being sold to farmers and  members

of the public at $2.50 per copy. The handbook gives a

full  account  of  the setting up of  the  commercial

hydroponics  farm.  But if the Member's  constituents

are  interested, the Department will be  prepared  to

organise  classes  on hydroponics method  of  growing

vegetables.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members brought up the question of the Urban

and  Rural  Services Committee. Both the Members  for

Bukit  Panjang  and  Nee Soon  complained  about  the

inadequacy of the fund of the URSC and suggested that

more  money  should  be spent on the  rural  sectors.

Perhaps  I could merely quote that out of the 1975/76

budget provision of $3,351,920, $2,351,920 have  been

spent on the rural areas. This amounts to 70% of  the

budget for URSC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon suggested that perhaps

bigger projects, such as roads costing over $100,000,

be  carried  out by PWD. If there is a  necessity  to

build such sizable rural roads in the future, the PWD

could  look into it provided approval of funds  could

be  obtained  from the Ministry of Finance.  If  more

such  rural  projects need to  be  done  and  can  be

justified, perhaps a more practical approach would be

to  request  the Ministry of Finance  to  allocate  a

bigger  fund  for  the URSC. These proposals  can  be

forwarded   to   the   Ministry   of   Finance    for

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol brought up the question of

farm  roads in Punggol. Here again, the main  purpose

of  the farm roads in Punggol is obviously to provide

a  reasonable access to the farm holdings. These  are

not  meant to serve as trunk roads. Although they are

similar  to  the standard rural road, they  are,  in

fact, five feet wider. Unlike other laterite  roads,

these  farm  roads have been reinforced with  granite

crusher  run at additional cost. The total length  of

the  farm  roads  in Punggol farm  estates  is  about

21,730 metres. Of course, it will be ideal if all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



these roads could be metalled but obviously the  cost

will  be extremely high. Because of the limited funds

and  other claims and priority projects, it  will  be

difficult  to metal and upgrade these roads  all  the

time, but perhaps progressively we can consider them.

and  I  think my earlier answer that perhaps  getting

more funds for URSC is the answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there were comments from the Members for

Aljunied  and  Nee  Soon  on  sympathetic  or  proper

consideration  of  usage of acquired  property  after

acquisition. The acquisition of land is, of course, a

serious matter as it affects the livelihood of people

who are dislocated and required to resettle elsewhere

For  this  reason much care is taken to  ensure  that

land is acquired only for redevelopment purposes. The

exceptions  are cases where the lots remaining  after

acquisition  are too small or isolated  and  are  not

suitable for independent development. In that case it

will  be  better  to acquire them  for  a  harmonious

integration  with  their  surroundings.  Of   course,

despite  these precautions it sometimes  happen  that

due   to   unforeseen  circumstances  or  change   in

Government  policy  the envisaged development  cannot

take   place  Fortunately,  such  cases   are   rare.

Government  departments and statutory boards  engaged

in  land acquisition and development have the duty to

ensure that their acquisitions are planned with great

consideration  in order to prevent  such  cases  from

occurring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon brought up the question of

widening  of  Sembawang Road Actually I have  already

given  him  a  verbal reply just now  -  that  it  is

actually  for a three-lane dual-carriageway and  that

although  the  existing shops are not affected  there

are drains to be constructed on the side of the three-lane  carriageway  and that the drain  and  the  road

reserve would take up something like 20 feet  out  of

60  feet  of the shop-houses. So although it  is  not

immediately  knocked down, it will be taken  over  by

Government for such development



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Senior

Minister   of  State  has  not  answered  two   other

questions that I have raised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I have not forgotten to answer the

hon.  Member for Sembawang. It is not because I  have

not  got the answer but I thought it is not important

enough  to answer them. Anyway, let me reply  to  his

questions  in one minute. The matter of Tanjong  Irau

in  Sembawang area that he referred to, unfortunately

does  not come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry

of National Development. It comes under JTC So, would

the Member please refer the matter to JTC?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second question about the abolition of

the  increase of rent from $10 to $18 for  Hua  Kwang

School  in  his constituency, the primary school  was

acquired from the owner, with vacant possession, at a

higher  compensation. If the owner stays  on  in  the

premises  he  has  to  pay the rental  based  on  the

standard annual rate of 5% of the compensation.  This

revision  in rental only applies to the owners  whose

properties  are  acquired with vacant possession.  On

the  other  hand, if the property is acquired  on  an

encumbered  basis, then there is no increase  in  the

rent.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, in associating myself with

all  my colleagues in thanking our President for  his

Speech  on behalf of the Government. I would like  to

take  this  opportunity to say a few  words  on  some

labour matters raised by hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Kallang and Telok Blangah have

suggested that permanent residents should be  allowed

to  be  employed  without having to  apply  for  work

permits.  There  are  a number  of  reasons  why  the

Ministry  of  Labour continues to  require  permanent

residents  to apply for work permits. Firstly,  under

the  Regulation  of Employment Act,  all  non-citizen

employees  and  contract workers  earning  a  monthly

salary  of not more than $750 are required  to  apply

for  work permits. Secondly, it is felt that from the

manpower planning point of view, it is necessary  for

us  to  know the number as well as the deployment  of

permanent residents in the economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must assure hon. Members that usually permanent

residents do not face difficulties when applying  for

work  permit  for their employment, The  Ministry  of

Labour adopts a very liberal policy when it comes  to

issuing  work  permits  to  them.  Furthermore,  work

permits  issued to permanent residents  are  for  two

years  instead  of the usual one year.  Hon.  Members

would recall also that in 1973 the Ministry of Labour

made  a  public announcement that permanent residents

who  pass  the appropriate skill test or who  possess

acceptable  training qualifications will be  eligible

for   citizenship  if  they  satisfy   the   ten-year

residential qualification. Holders of Singapore  blue

identity  cards  who are unskilled  should  therefore

strive  to  upgrade  their skill  so  that  they  can

qualify for citizenship under this scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Kallang has urged that serious

attempts  be  made to find a solution to job  seekers

who are past retirement age. He has further suggested

that  certain  light jobs in the public  and  private

sectors be reserved for those who are old but healthy

enough to work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.  In  my  speech.  I  mentioned   about

permanent  residents who are stateless  persons,  and

not all permanent residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, it makes no difference even if

he  is stateless. He is not a Singapore citizen  and,

therefore,  according  to the  present  law,  a  work

permit is required of him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From CPF records, in the year 1974 there were 9,664

persons who reached the age of 55; in 1975 there were

12,820 persons and in 1976 there were 11,180 persons.

Yet  on the Labour Ministry's Employment Service live

register,  there  are only 480 such  people  who  are

actively seeking employment, the majority of whom are

unskilled.  Out of these 480 persons, 430 are  males.

Apparently,  older female workers are either  staying

with their families usefully engaged in helping their

children in household duties or they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



have  no  difficulties in getting jobs. These figures

suggest  that  quite a number of these older  workers

either  do  not  want  employment  or  do  not   need

assistance in securing work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present in both the private and public sectors,

persons  above  the  age  of 55  years  can  continue

gainful employment. In the public sector, although 55

years  is the optional retirement age, those who  are

in good health and choose to continue employment, can

do  so  up to the age of 60 years. Similarly  in  the

private sector, collective agreements do provide  for

employment up to the age of 60 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation does not therefore warrant the

introduction of a scheme of reservation of  jobs  for

those who are old but healthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Potong Pasir has proposed a job

quota  scheme  for the employment of  handicapped  or

disabled  persons.  Government,  together  with   the

voluntary agencies, have been actively promoting  the

employment of employable handicapped persons. In  the

job placement efforts, both the Employment Service of

the  Labour Ministry and the Rehabilitation  Unit  of

the   Social   Welfare  Department  work   in   close

cooperation  with  the voluntary bodies.  Within  the

public  sector, preference has already been given  to

the  employment  of  handicapped persons  in  certain

suitable   light   jobs  such  as   caretaker, lift

attendant,  office  attendant, telephone   operator,

tailor, typist and such like. In the private sector,

the  number of firms and factories willing to  employ

handicapped persons is increasing. A high  percentage

of  disabled persons is being employed. Of the  4,603

handicapped persons in the working age group of  15-44 years,

1,285 are currently in gainful employment.

415   are  either  attending  schools  or  undergoing

vocational  training geared to subsequent employment.

Of   the  remaining  2,903,  477  are  incapable   of

productive work, that is, they are unemployed because

of  severe disablement, 722 are not prepared to  seek

work  and  only  a  small number of  125  handicapped

persons are actively seeking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>





work  and  are  awaiting job placement.  The  present

arrangement  of Government departments and  voluntary

agencies  working together to assist the  handicapped

persons in securing employment is adequate. There is,

therefore, no need for a special job quota scheme for

the employment of handicapped or disabled persons  at

this moment of time.



<br><br>6.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his

policy  speech, the President has timely reminded  us

that  we  must  not seek to ape the  life-styles  and

norms   of  permissive  Western  societies  We  must,

instead,  preserve our time-honoured cultural  norms.

values  and  institutions which have  enabled  us  to

withstand   the  onslaught  of  the  more  pernicious

elements in the western culture. Of course, not  all

aspects of the Western culture are bad. Some are good

ones and we have benefited from them and we intend to

keep  them even though they are alien to our society.

Much  of  the undesirable part of the western culture

is transmitted to us through the media.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both developed and developing societies, the

importance  of  the  printed  word  cannot  be  over-emphasized.  Although TV can stir  up  thinking  more

quickly, it is a passing vision - it is seen, and  is

gone.  So  is  sound broadcasting - it is  heard  and

gone.  However, a newspaper exerts  a  more  lasting

impact.  It can be kept and re-read later  on.  Often

its  pass-on circulation is such that its  impact  is

understated  by  its "official" circulation  figures.

Consequently, the newspaper is a powerful  instrument

of public education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news media has acquired and wielded enormous

power within the last two decades. In some countries,

its  power sometimes exceeds that of the legislature,

the   judiciary  and  the  executive,   through   its

influence  on public opinion. Its enormous power  can

be  harnessed  for the benefit of society.  It  could

also be manipulated to tear the society apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government in democratic countries are elected

every four or five years, and they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



must  therefore  be responsive to the societies  they

serve.  This  is  not  so with the  press  as  it  is

accountable  only to its owners. In large  societies,

it  may  be  possible for newspapers with conflicting

views  and values to balance each other out, so  that

no  single  newspaper  can  unduly  influence  public

opinion. Even in these countries, it is socially  and

politically  undesirable for newspapers to  be  owned

and  controlled  by one man, or one family,  as  this

would   make  it  difficult  for  the  press  to   be

independent  and impartial. In small countries  where

the  economy  or population can only sustain  two  or

three   major  newspapers, the  capacity  of   these

newspapers to manipulate public opinion would be  far

greater



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  recall  what  happened  to  the

Singapore  Herald and the Eastern Sun. No  long  ago.

efforts   were  made  by  certain  foreign  interests

through  their local proxies to soften up the  ground

for  their  own insidious purposes, namely,  to  gain

footholds  in our society. Fortunately, their  plots

were nipped in the bud.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, legislation exists to ensure that

newspapers do not function as mouthpieces of  outside

interests   to   propagate  alien  philosophies   and

viewpoints  The Newspaper and Printing  Presses  Act.

1974,  is  to ensure that public interests are  safe-guarded  by  requiring that newspapers become  public companies with Singapore citizens as directors. It is

not  intended  to  interfere with  newspapers  as  an

economic activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Act came into force on 1st January, 1975,

the danger of local newspapers falling into the hands

of foreign interests has been lessened. Nevertheless,

the  situation is still far from satisfactory, as the

ownership  of major newspapers remains with  a  small

group of people In a small country like Singapore, it

is  undesirable to allow any person or family to have

a  monopolistic  control of any major  newspaper.  In

view  of  the  great influence the newspaper  has  on

every  individual's life as well as national  issues.

it would be safer for their ownership to be spread as

widely as possible. It is equally important to have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



balanced   representation  in   the   management   of

newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In, order to break the monopolistic control of

major  newspapers in Singapore by a  small  group  of

people, the Government is considering an amendment to

the  Newspaper  and Printing Presses  Act,  1974,  to

prohibit  any person from holding either directly  or

indirectly through a nominee or a holding company  or

in  other  manner  more than 3% of  the  stock  of  a

newspaper,  without  the special  permission  of  the

licensing authority of the newspaper. Persons holding

shares in excess of the permitted limit will have  to

dispose of them through the Stock Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed measures are not intended to be

confiscatory We do not seek more control than we have

now. We only seek to spread the ownership so that  it

reaches the small people and more people will have  a

say in the ownership of the newspaper. These measures

are  necessitated  by the need  to  ensure  that  the

newspapers  are not merely solvent in the  accounting

balance sheet but also an asset in the balance  sheet

of national well-being



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think at this juncture it would be helpful if I

were to begin my reply to the hon. Member for Kampong

Chai  Chee  and the hon. Member for Katong  with  the

anthropological  definition of  "culture"  to  ensure

that we are talking about the same thing. Culture  as

so  defined  is the sum total of the achievement  and

activities  of any specific period, race, or  people

which     include,    inter    alia,    socioeconomic

institutions,   music, art,   religious    beliefs.

traditions and language



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has inherited from the migrants who came

to  settle  here from China, India and the  Malaysian

archipelago their ancient cultures. To these has been

added  the culture derived from western civilization.

Singapore  was  a British colony for over  a  hundred

years  and  we have inherited from the British  their

system  of  law  and  the  Parliamentary  system   of

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that with such a sensitive issue as

culture, the best way would be to let these inherited

cultures develop within the Singapore context.  While

establishing cultural links with the past, we  should

not forget that we are Singaporeans. Thus, we have to

build a cohesive, unified nation out of the disparate

ethnic groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolution of a national cultural identity is.

therefore, part of the process of nation building. It

is  a  task  which has been put into motion  some  20

years  ago through our education system, our national

service  programme, our community  centres  and,  not

least  of all, through the activities of the Ministry

of  Culture  The  evolution of a  Singapore  cultural

identity  is  a long and time-consuming process.  Its

form  cannot be laid down in advance because  culture

cannot  be  subject to direction in the same  way  as

economic  development  It can only  be  nurtured  and

encouraged in an atmosphere of freedom to experiment,

choose,  reject,  or adapt the various  elements  and

forms that go to make up the whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members in this House have expressed concern

over  the  young with their high expectations,  their

preference  for  soft jobs, and their  acceptance  of

Singapore's prosperity as a norm and something  which

can  be  taken for granted. They have not experienced

the  hardships and sacrifices of their forebears.  If

we  accept that culture in its widest sense  means  a

way  of  life rather than merely confining it to  the

practice and appreciation of the fine arts, there are

certain  cultural norms and values common to all  the

three    major   streams   of   Asian   civilisations

represented in our plural society The moral precepts,

patriotism, filial piety and traditional values  such

as  industry  and  thrift are still relevant  to  our

society. These are the values our young must acquire.

and these values can only be acquired by learning and

appreciating our cultural heritage At the same  time,

we   must   not  overlook  the  fact  that   we   are

Singaporeans Only when we realise this, are  we  then

able  to  provide the cultural ballast for our  young

through  the  evolution  of a  distinctive  Singapore

cultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



identity  based  on the finest elements  in  our  own

cultures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore is heir to four great cultural

civilisations, it is thus given a rare  and  valuable

opportunity  to  learn and absorb  the  best  in  all

these.  To deny or shut out any one of them would  be

to  impoverish  and  endanger our rich  heritage  and

narrow   our  range  of  aesthetic  sensibility   and

experience.  We must be honest enough to  acknowledge

that  not  all our traditional values and  norms  are

desirable.  We  must, therefore, aim  to  achieve  a

balance  between  what is valuable  and  relevant  in

tradition and what is required in a modern industrial

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An admirable element of western culture is the

spirit   of   scientific  enquiry, of   seeking   to

understand the laws of the universe, which has led to

the technological advances of the West. We must learn

to  adapt to the imperatives of an industrial society

without losing our cultural values. At the same time,

we  have to reject life styles and values of the West

that  are  alien  and  pernicious  to  our  Singapore

society.  We must not allow permissiveness,  communal

living,  hippieism, drug taking, abhorrence for  hard

work  and urban violence to permeate our society.  To

allow  these  undesirable elements  of  Western  life

styles  into  our  society  is  to  invite  ruin  and

disaster for ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural "ballast" implies a firm and sound rooting

in  traditional  cultures, but since our  society  is

largely of migrant origin, these traditions have been

inevitably weakened with time and distance. We should

select and retain those cultural elements that have a

broader  appeal  to all This would  ensure  that  the

young will not adopt those values and norms which are

incompatible  with  our  national  aspirations.   The

awareness  of  our  cultural past together  with  the

forging of a distinctive Singapore identity will help

provide  our young with the necessary ballast against

the  inroads of undesirable western influence Without

the   Singapore   cultural   identity, our   people

especially  the  young  are like  a  rudderless  ship

drifting with the wind



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then we must not follow traditions blindly It is

true that traditions and customs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



form  part of the culture of a people. There are good

customs and there are bad ones Our duty is to try  to

preserve and promote the good ones while at the  same

time keep down or do away with the bad ones. However,

old  customs and traditions die hard and the task  to

educate  the people and change their way of  thinking

is  quite difficult. It may take years or generations

to change. But change we must. In this world of rapid

changes  it  is  necessary that we should  adopt  the

policy of P'or chiu Iih hsin (destroying the old  and

establishing  the new order). But  in  doing  so,  we

should   be   careful  not  to  open   ourselves   to

accusations  that we are ignorant  of  the  good  old

customs, or worse still, we are trying to destroy the

culture  of a people. Full explanation must be  given

and  the  issue  should  be thrashed  out  thoroughly

before  any action is taken. The people must be  made

to  understand why certain actions have to  be  taken

even  though some of them may not be happy with those

actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we handled cracker firing is a typical

example.   Cracker  firing  is  a  wasteful   custom.

Whatever  merit  it may have in an  old  agricultural

society, in the Singapore environment where more  and

more people are living in high-rise buildings, it has

become really dangerous. It has got to go. But before

imposing  a  total  ban  we  must  give  patient  and

exhaustive  explanation. The  Chinese  philosophy  on

government  is  that  when  one  governs  one  seldom

speaks. Wei ch'erng pu tsai tuo yen. That was an  old

authoritarian way of government. But in our situation

where   we   marry  oriental  society  with   western

democracy, we  must not only govern effectively,  we

must  also explain convincingly. Therefore,  we  have

suggested  that instead of firing crackers everywhere

and  disturbing  everyone, it should  be  allowed  in

controlled areas, in designated places near community

centres, where the chances of people getting hurt are

less.  We  have  tried every means  to  dissuade  the

people  from  this age-old custom. We have  even  run

films  on cracker firing on TV, in the hope that  the

people will be satisfied with watching cracker firing

and  hearing its noise on TV. All the while, we  knew

for certain that nothing short



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



of  a  total ban would solve the problem. And we also

knew for sure that, to those diehards, no matter what

we  do they will not be satisfied. But then they knew

that  we  have  tried very hard to accommodate  their

wishes.  In the end when the total ban came,  no  one

could  accuse  us  of  being an unresponsive  and  an

uncaring  Government.  And, therefore,  we  can  have

quieter  sleep  on Chinese New Year's  eve  not  only

because there is less noise but also because we  know

for  certain  that  no  one can  make  this  into  an

explosive issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, had we taken the advice of the Member for

Kampong Chai Chee and imposed a total ban right  from

the   beginning   without  any   experimentation   or

explanation, we would have plunged headlong  into  a

crisis.  The  diehards  would be  angry,  the  common

people  would be confused and the Communists and  the

anti-social elements would agitate. And  yet  we  are

being  accused of being ignorant of our  culture  and

lack  of  understanding. Sir, it is precisely because

we  know  too much and understand too much about  our

own  culture and respect our own culture that we have

to  resort to this so-called "half-way house" measure

in   order  to  solve  this  delicate  problem  which

involves a deep-rooted custom of the people. There is

nothing  wrong in it. Democracy itself  is  a  system

which  is  constantly devising a series of  "half-way

house"  measures  to solve the delicate  problems  of

society. When it comes to problems involving culture.

language and custom, they must be handled with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



tolerance, patience and understanding. Sir, these are

the  finer points in the art of government and if the

Member for Kampong Chai Chee aspires to step into our

shoes he must learn them, and learn them fast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Kampong Chai

Chee  that  there is no such thing as the  cancelling

out  game between the Ministry of Education  and  the

Ministry  of Culture. We supplement each  other.  The

only cause for him to make the allegation is that  he

saw  a few commercial advertisements on TV not to his

liking.  But  then everyone knows that TV commercials

do  not  represent Government policy.  My  Ministry's

Addendum explicitly gave the priorities of our  radio

and  television services, namely, to inform,  educate

and entertain. Educational and information programmes

acquired overseas and produced locally comprise  25%,

the largest category of TV output. This compares with

23% for programmes which can be categorised as drama.

and  9%  for  programmes which can be  classified  as

music   or   musical  variety.  This  percentage   of

educational and information programmes is  among  the

highest  in  this region for the public  broadcasting

service.
