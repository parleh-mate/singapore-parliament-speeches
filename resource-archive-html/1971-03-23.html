<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>PRICE INCREASES OF DAILY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOODSTUFFS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Committee of inquiry)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if he will consider setting up a committee

to  inquire  into the reasons for the increases  in

the prices of daily foodstuffs in recent months  in

order to ensure that the public are not cheated  by

market stall-holders and shopkeepers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not proposed to set up a

committee  to  inquire into the reasons  for  price

increases  in recent months. As I already explained

in  some  detail  on Friday, in Singapore  where  a

substantial  proportion  of  daily  foodstuffs  are

imported,  prices  are subject to  fluctuations  in

supply.  For  some  items the  price  increases  in

December/January are seasonal, due to  the  festive

season.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the main fluctuations in prices are due to

such  factors  as mentioned above, a  committee  on

prices  cannot exert any influence on prices.  This

point  was  discussed  by  the  then  Minister  for

Finance  [Dr Goh Keng Swee] in December 1968  when

the same question was raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is possibly more useful is the formation of a

Consumers'  Association  to  keep  watch  on  price

movements  and to ensure that prices  of  essential

foodstuffs  are  not  manipulated  by  unscrupulous

stallholders   and   shopkeepers   and   any   such

malpractices  are  detected and publicised.  It  is

understood  that  there  is  a  move  for  such  an

association   --  the  Consumers'  Association   of

Singapore - to be registered. The Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



on  its part, will give every assistance  to

the  Consumers' Association and will do  everything

possible to curb unwarranted price increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some remarks in Parliament

regarding  the reliability of official prices  used

in the compilation of the Consumer Price Index.  A

full list of the average retail prices of essential

foodstuffs  is published in the Monthly  Digest  of

Statistics  regularly and the study of  fluctuation

in  the  prices will clearly indicate that official

prices   do  properly  reflect  price  fluctuations

experienced by the public.

<div align="center"><b>TRAFFIC POLICE SUMMONS NOTICES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Delay in issue)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  (a)  if  he will give the reason  for  the

delay  of over one year in the issue by the Traffic

Police of a summons notice in respect of a 13-month

old traffic offence; and (b) what is the backlog of

such  cases,  and if he will take steps  to  remedy

the, situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, normally, if

the  personal  particulars of the offending  driver

are  available  on the spot and if the  offence  is

compoundable, an offer of composition will be  sent

to  him  within  two weeks of the offence.  If  the

offer is not accepted by the driver after a period,

action by way of summons will be instituted against

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many cases of traffic

violations  where the particulars of the  offenders

are  not  obtainable  on the spot  by  the  Traffic

Police.  In  these  cases, some time  is  spent  in

obtaining  the  particulars of  the  owner  of  the

vehicle   from  the  Registrar  of  Vehicles,   and

thereafter,  the particulars of the driver  at  the

time  of the alleged offence from the owner.  Often

reminders have to be sent to the vehicle owners.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the particulars of the driver are finally

obtained, it will take some time before an offer of

composition  is sent to him. If the  offer  is  not

accepted, the case will be further delayed in  that

some more time will have to be spent in obtaining a

summons from the court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also difficulties in effecting the

service  of summons. In many cases, accused drivers

change  addresses  without notifying  the  National

Registration Office and the Registrar  of  Vehicles

of  these changes, although required by the law  to

do  so.  Hence  an accused driver may  receive  his

summons for an offence committed one year ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is a backlog of approximately

21,500  traffic cases, all more than  a  year  old,

waiting for the issue of summonses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a ticketing system will soon be

implemented  to  deal with traffic  offenders  more

effectively  and  expeditiously.  Under   the   new

system,  a  ticket will be issued to the  offending

driver  on the spot stipulating the amount of  fine

which  he has to pay at the Report Section, Traffic

Police,  within  two weeks from  the  date  of  the

offence.  The necessary amendments to  the  Traffic

Ordinance  have  been  made and,  as  soon  as  the

mechanics  of the ticketing system as well  as  the

rules governing it have been finalised, it will  be

put into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, measures are being taken to

process  the backlog of traffic cases more  rapidly

without at the same time causing a drag on the pile

of current cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Sir, will the

Traffic  Police give them a target date  to  finish

all the 21,000 cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, that is hardly possible. All

that  my Ministry can say is that specific measures

are  being taken by additional manpower to  try  to

reduce this backlog as rapidly as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, may I know

what  is  the  maximum amount  for  a  compoundable

traffic offence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, the maximum amount for

compoundable cases is $50 at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Does this amount of $50 apply to

all types of offences, or does it apply only to a

particular type of compoundable traffic offence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, this sum of $50 is the maximum

amount for an offer of composition. The amount set

on a particular offence will depend on the type of

offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1101 -



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Cheong Yuen Chee.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving this amendment in order to seek

some  clarification of the policy of the  Ministry,

it  is  with some temerity that I do so,  as  I  am

fully  aware  that  the housing  programme  of  the

Housing  and  Development Board has  been  accorded

world-wide    acclaim.    The    Housing    Board's

achievements   dominate   the   low   profile    of

Singapore's skyline with the presence of more  than

a  hundred thousand housing units, many of them  in

blocks  of high-rise flats which the Board has  put

up  since  its  inception.  The  magnitude  of  the

Board's achievements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



can be further gauged by the fact that nearly

30  per  cent of our population are housed  in  the

Board's flats. We are given to understand that  the

Board  is constantly making plans to catch up  with

the past accumulated demand, and coping with future

anticipated demand for public housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these heart-warming data, plus the proud

claim that the Board is building one unit per every

half-hour,  undoubtedly make for a  very  effective

advertisement of Singapore's image abroad. However,

to   the   many  thousands  of  citizens  who   are

unfortunate enough to be still on the waiting  list

of  the  Board, they may wonder whether the housing

shortage  is ever likely to be solved.  It  is  not

uncommon to hear that an applicant has to wait  for

as  long as even one and a half years before he can

be housed. The only persons who are lucky enough to

move  into the Board's flats without having to wait

their   turn  are  those  unfortunate,  or   rather

fortunate enough, to be evicted as a result of  the

Government's development programme. In other words,

the  popular impression seems to be that  we  build

houses  only  in  sufficient numbers  to  meet  the

requirements  of  the urban renewal  scheme.  Added

force is given to such impression by the fact  that

the  disposal to private developers of well located

plots  of  land  vacated under  the  urban  renewal

scheme   has   proved   very  profitable   to   the

Government.  We  in this House know  that  such  an

impression, though invariably popular, is erroneous

and  misconceived. A blunt denial,  no  matter  how

authoritative, is not sufficient to counteract  it.

A  more  concrete answer is required of the  Board,

otherwise  the purpose of the urban renewal  scheme

will continue to be misconstrued. I understand  and

appreciate  the great strain being  placed  on  the

Housing  and Development Board as a result  of  the

spiralling  increase  in the prices  of  privately-built  houses  and  the  rents  of  privately-owned

houses.   In  addition,  the  decision  to   permit

purchase of the Board's flats by making use of  the

Central Provident Fund contribution and the raising

of the maximum income limit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



on  eligibility have helped to swell up the Board's

waiting  list. Thus, if we continue at the  present

rate  of building just sufficient housing units  to

take  care  of persons rendered homeless under  the

urban  renewal scheme, the waiting list for  public

housing  is  likely  to become longer  rather  than

shorter.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse is my fear that our building

programme may not even be able to keep up with  the

urban  renewal programme. Unless the Board is  able

to  step up its building programme, I do not  think

there  can  be  any satisfactory  solution  to  the

problem  of  mounting pressure in  the  demand  for

public  housing as long as private housing  remains

exorbitantly priced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter on which I require clarification is

the  Ministry's urban renewal programme. I am  sure

Members  of  this  House are  aware  of  the  Telok

Blangah New Town project. This is to cover  a  vast

area  of  about 932 acres. That it is a  tremendous

project cannot be denied, and in a project of  such

dimensions, many problems and vexations are  to  be

expected.  It is also to be expected that  a  great

deal  of  planning has to be thought out  and  many

preparatory   measures  in   the   form   of   land

acquisition   and   eviction   of   residents   and

arrangement  for  their  alternative  accommodation

have to be carried out before the first pile of the

project  can be sunk into the ground. My  complaint

is  directed  not to the fact that such  a  project

will  cause  hardships for some of my constituents,

but  to the fact that unnecessary hardship has been

caused. What is alarming is that the nature of such

hardship seems to indicate insufficient planning of

the  project. The project was divided into  several

phases  of development. Thus, the process  of  land

acquisition  and  eviction of  residents  had  been

effected   in   accordance  with   the   order   of

development of the various sections comprising  the

project. Suddenly it was decided that the order  of

development  must  shift from  one  section,  where

eviction  had  already begun,  to  another  section

which was originally to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



be  the  last  phase of development. As  a  result,

there is considerable confusion and suffering among

the  residents  of  the whole  area,  whether  they

remain in or move out of the area. Chief tenants of

houses refuse to repair houses and the requests  by

subtenants   for  Housing  and  Development   Board

accommodation are denied as they are not deemed  to

be  evicted  tenants as a result of  the  shift  in

priorities. On the other hand, other residents  who

are  not supposed to move out until much later  are

suddenly  required  to move at  short  notice.  All

these unnecessary hardships could have been avoided

if  the  order  of  development had  been  properly

planned  without  having to make  changes  half-way

through the project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people residing in an area prefer to remain

in  it for various reasons. Some of them because of

their business associations, employment, children's

education, and others merely because of the  social

contacts they have made.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have one more minute, Mr

Govindasamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in the case of the Telok

Blangah   project,   may  I  say   that   no   such

consideration was given in planning it. Unnecessary

hardships  could have been easily  avoided  if  the

planning had been thorough and if the original plan

had  not been changed, as I have mentioned earlier,

half-way through the project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it is a well-known fact that the achievements

of  the  Housing  and Development Board  in  public

housing  have  earned  praise,  both  locally   and

internationally.  However, there are  some  matters

concerning   public  housing   that   require   the

attention  of  the  Minister.  There  are   various

problems  facing  flat-owners and  tenants  in  Toa

Payoh   that   give   rise   to   irritations   and

misunderstanding.  One  of  this  is  the   Housing

Board's  attitude  in prohibiting flat-owners  from

making  improvements to their own flats  no  matter

how minor they are. As a flat-owner surely one can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



be  permitted to make improvements to enhance one's

own  property  provided such  improvements  do  not

alter or damage the structure of the building. Flat-owners  always have difficulties with  the  Housing

Board  over the fitting of louvered windows,  metal

grills,  gate canopies and even colour schemes  for

such  fittings. As a matter of fact, the  Board  is

now taking legal action against several flat-owners

for  installing louvered windows in  preference  to

the  casement type installed by the Housing  Board.

No  one  in his right senses would take the trouble

to make alterations to existing fittings or install

new fittings which obviously cost money if they  do

not  serve a useful purpose. If a flat-owner  feels

that  the  fittings installed by the Housing  Board

are  not  up  to  his expectations,  he  should  be

allowed  to change them. We should encourage  flat-owners   and   tenants  to  keep  the   environment

attractive instead of discouraging them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem concerns defects like cracked

floors,  cracked ceilings, and choked  and  leaking

pipes.   Here   the  dispute  is  who   should   be

responsible for repairing such defects.  The  Board

maintains  that  if  the  occupier  has   been   in

residence in a flat for more than six months, it is

not  responsible for such repairs. I believe  there

is  one such building regulation which favours  the

Board. It is absurd for the Board, on the one hand,

to  disclaim  responsibility for repairs  to  these

defects  and,  on  the  other hand,  to  discourage

owners  from  improving their  flats.  The  defects

mentioned usually appear after the six-month period

of  residence. Representations were made to  me  by

the  flat-owners and complaints were brought to the

notice  of  the  Board, but so far no  satisfactory

solution has been found. Most of these defects  are

due  to  the negligence on the part of the  Board's

contractors.  Debris  is conveniently  dumped  into

drainage  pipes  and toilets, thereby  choking  the

whole  system and affecting several floors in  some

instances. The Board should exercise more stringent

supervision of the contractors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



and  impose  penalties  if they  are  found  to  be

negligent, like barring them from further contracts

for a period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, I would like to mention the

irresponsible attitude of some contract workers  in

defacing and dirtying partially completed buildings

in  Toa  Payoh.  It is not uncommon to  find  human

excreta in some of these buildings when visitors go

up there to have a look at them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hawkers, the present policy of the

Housing  Board in allocating stalls  to  bona  fide

hawkers   only   has  caused  hardships   to   some

residents,  particularly those staying in  one-room

flats.  With more one-room flats coming up  in  Toa

Payoh,  more people will be taking up petty hawking

as a means of supplementing their income. There are

residents who because of tragic circumstances, have

to  take to hawking to earn a decent living.  There

are   others  who  are  unemployable  for   various

reasons.  It is better to allocate stalls  to  such

people   than  to  let  them  subsist   on   public

assistance.  Because of a shortage  of  stalls  and

unsuitable  location, there is an increase  in  the

number  of  unauthorised hawkers in Toa Payoh.  The

location of the market near Block 18 has also given

rise to numerous complaints from residents. Due  to

the  close proximity of this market and the  hawker

stalls,  residents  have complained  of  flies  and

noise  nuisance  coming from  the  stalls  day  and

night.  The noise starts from 5 am, in the  morning

when  stallholders arrive in the market to  prepare

for  the  day's  work. At night,  the  cooked  food

hawkers   also   join  in.  The  noise   from   the

conversation of stallholders in the early hours  of

the morning and the banging of frying pans at night

disturbs  the peace of the residents. As a  result,

many  of them have indicated that they wish to sell

their flats and go elsewhere. I would suggest  that

future  sites for markets and hawker centres should

be  so located that they are further away from  the

residential area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to car parks, much has been said in

the   local  press  about  inadequate  car  parking

facilities in Toa



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



Payoh. I must say that, overall, there are adequate

parking  areas  in Toa Payoh, but the  location  of

such parking areas leaves much to be desired. Here,

the   planners  have  failed  to  make   a   proper

assessment of the situation. Large and spacious car

parks are located near to the one-room and two-room

flats, for example, near Blocks 45, 44, 28, 30  and

99.  Car  parks near the sold properties  are  much

smaller. Common sense will tell us where the demand

for  parking space is. Block 99 is mainly  used  by

unauthorised hawkers. To solve the problem, I would

suggest  that  the Board restrict  the  parking  of

buses,  commercial vehicles and taxis to the larger

car  parks  which are less used and to  review  the

demarcation  of the smaller ones to ensure  optimum

usage of the space available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of play areas, in reply to a

question  raised  in  the  previous  sitting,   the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and

National    Development    (National    Development

Division)  stated that play areas are now  provided

by  the Board on the ground floor of flats. This is

indeed  welcome news, particularly  to  the  lower-income group. However, may I point out to the House

that  the play areas mentioned are located  in  the

west  sector  of Toa Payoh. There are none  in  the

east  sector  where there are more  people  of  the

lower-income group. There are 20 blocks of one-room

flats in the east sector compared to seven only  in

the  west. In order to meet the recreational  needs

of residents in the east sector, may I suggest that

the  Board  consider resiting some  of  the  ground

floor residents in the one-room flats so that these

flats could be converted into play areas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question that always irritates tenants is the

applications  for transfers. Most applications  for

transfers are from smaller to larger units or  from

larger  to  smaller units. There is a tendency  for

the   Board   to  treat  all  applications   alike,

irrespective of whether it is a deserving  case  or

not.  The usual reply is that all vacant flats  are

reserved for resettlement cases and applicants  are

requested to wait for their turn, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



can  be for months or years. I see the need for the

Board  to  reserve  vacant flats  for  resettlement

cases.  But allowing a transfer does not fill  such

vacant  flats.  It merely creates  another  vacancy

elsewhere.  For  instance, there is  a  case  of  a

family  whose  two  children were  murdered.  Their

application for a transfer to another  flat  or  an

early  allocation of a sale flat met with the  same

negative response.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the lifts, it appears that the policy

of  the Board, in accepting the lowest tenders  for

lifts,  has  resulted in poor quality  lifts  being

installed   in   the   Board's   flats.    Frequent

breakdowns,    inadequate    ventilation,     rusty

interiors,  inferior fittings like indicator  knobs

where the signs are obliterated after a short  time

of  usage, are fairly common. When you enter a lift

in  a  Housing  Board flat, you have a  feeling  of

insecurity. Whether the lift will move  up  or  get

stuck  halfway is a matter of interest. It is never

a smooth journey when you travel in a Housing Board

lift.  Sometimes  the  lift  vibrates  or  emits  a

grumbling  noise  which  sends  shivers  down  your

spine.  I  hope, Sir, the Minister will  look  into

these  problems  and try to rectify  them  wherever

possible.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do I have

just 10 minutes?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It is rather difficult in 10 minutes

to deal with two dissatisfied Members of Parliament

who  have raised so many points. Perhaps I can deal

with them in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah seeks clarification

of  the  Housing and Development Board  policy  and

questions  the long wait of one and a half  to  two

years  before  one gets a Housing  and  Development

Board  flat, either as a tenant or as a  purchaser.

It   is  admitted  that  the  waiting  period   for

allocation of flats is at least one and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



half  to two years, sometimes even longer.  It  was

different in the 1960s when the demand for housing,

either from resettlement or other cases, was  about

equal  to  the  number of Housing  and  Development

Board  flats built. The position today is  entirely

different  and  I  put this down to  the  extensive

concessions  granted by the Government  early  last

year,  especially the availability of  the  Central

Provident Fund monies. Previously one had  to  wait

until  one  reached  55 years before  drawing  that

money.  Now everybody is rushing to use his Central

Provident  Fund  money, and  hence  the  desire  to

purchase Housing and Development Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year alone the Board received 12,324

applications for rent and 20,598 applications  from

purchasers  desiring  to  buy  flats,   making   an

unprecedented total of 32,922 applications  in  one

single year. At the start of 1970 there was already

a  backlog. And we had to deal with another  33,000

applications.  Last year the Board built  a  little

less  1han  14,000  units. It cannot  build  28,000

units  within  one year. That is  not  all.  It  is

difficult  enough building 14,000 units, but  there

are  plans  to increase this to about 20,000  units

annually  by  1975. This year the  Board  hopes  to

build  about  17,000 units. Even if it succeeds  in

this plan and builds 17,000 units, it is a far  cry

from the 32,922 applicants who registered for flats

last  year. The position is not hopeless.  We  have

broken   the   back  of  the  housing  problem   in

Singapore, but the Member for Telok Blangah used  a

different  word, "solve". By "solve" it means  that

we  must  be  able to provide a flat to anyone  who

wants a flat. The position today is that the demand

far exceeds the supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also grumbled about the hardships that

his constituents are undergoing as a result of this

planning for the new town in Telok Blangah. He says

that  it  is  a  gigantic problem, so  on  his  own

admission it is not easy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> There is no planning!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The plans are there, otherwise you

would never have a new town, but I think there is a

little confusion here. There are plans. The work is

going  according to phases, but certain areas  were

cleared   to   make  way  immediately  for   urgent

projects. For instance, two areas within  the  town

were  cleared  for the development  of  the  P.U.B.

substation   and  the  Singapore  Telephone   Board

Exchange.  Hence  eviction. Yet another  place  was

cleared  for the cutting of a hill as  well  as  an

access  road  to this hill in order to provide  for

the   Pasir   Panjang  Reclamation  Scheme.   These

clearance  projects were undertaken and they  might

have  given  the Member the impression  that  there

have been no plans. I can assure him that there are

plans.  They are well laid-out plans, but any  plan

to  be  implemented  must be a  flexible  one.  You

cannot  say, "I am moving in here on this  day  and

there  on  that day." Circumstances change  and  if

there  is hardship we regret it. In order to  avoid

more hardship, I would suggest that the Member call

at the Ministry of National Development and look at

some  of  the plans, which I assure him we have  in

the  Ministry. I do not know how much time  I  have

for the Member for Toa Payoh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have three minutes more, Mr

Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Three minutes. Perhaps I should assure

the  Member for Toa Payoh that I will look into his

complaints.  I do not think all his complaints  are

true.  There  is  such  a demand  for  Housing  and

Development  Board flats and yet  the  Member  says

that the lifts are no good, the walls are cracking,

there is dirt all over the place, the market is too

close  to the flats, the car parks are in the wrong

place,  and the playgrounds are in the wrong place.

If  all  these are true, I do not know why everyone

wants to go to Toa Payoh. I do not know why we  had

32,000 applications by last year. Something must be

wrong!  In one breath the Member says that some  of

his  poorer constituents who occupy one-room  flats

would like to supplement their income by being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



hawkers.  In  the next breath he says  the  hawkers

make  too  much noise at night or in the market  in

the day. But there are difficulties. Everyone wants

to be a hawker nowadays.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> We are short of labour!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, we are short of labour. The

building  industry is short of labour.  Hawking  is

one  way of supplementing their income. It is  hard

work,  of  course, but there is plenty of money  in

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should deal with the business of minor

changes of awnings. In multi-storey housing, strict

discipline  must be maintained for the common  good

of  the  residents. You can have your minor repairs

provided they are within the building, but  if  you

put  an awning on to the common corridor or to some

other common area, then the neighbours grumble.  If

you  want to put a gate or a grill, put it in  your

own  house,  but do not trespass on to  the  common

area because if you do your neighbours grumble.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, your time is up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is all, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I am glad the Minister agrees

that  the  applicants will have to wait one  and  a

half  and sometimes even two years to get a Housing

and  Development Board flat. This is  the  point  I

made, but there are also one or two other points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> They have to do with planning?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes, planning, but I would

like  to come to urban renewal. I admit this  is  a

gigantic  project. I admit there are  bound  to  be

problems in a project of such vast dimensions,  but

I  have, as the Minister knows, gone to the Housing

and Development Board and looked at these plans. My

objection  is  to the chopping and  changing  of  a

decided  pattern of a plan, in the sense  that  one

area was laid down for the first phase of development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



and you moved out the people from there,  and

then   half-way  through,  perhaps  for  some  good

reason, it was decided to move the phase to another

location where the people would be evicted. So  you

have  the  situation where half of the people  were

evicted  in the first location, and the other  half

still  remain behind, thereby creating  unnecessary

problems.  If  there  had been  planning,  if  this

change  in  phase development had not taken  place,

there would not have been these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also admit that the backlog in the Housing

and  Development Board is bound to  increase  as  a

result  of  using  C.P.F. funds  for  purchase  of

houses.  The  high-cost  houses  developed  by  the

private developers will again further --



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Is that the fault of the Housing and

Development Board?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> No, but we have got to cope

up  with the requirements which we are not able  to

do.  Perhaps there may be other causes too.  May  I

suggest  one  or  two other causes which  may  have

resulted in this big backlog? One could be that  at

present there is no means of preventing members  of

one  family  from making separate applications  and

using   one  another  in  substitution   of   their

respective applications for one flat. In one family

of  six  people,  two or three  can  make  separate

applications. The enforcement of the income ceiling

for  eligibility  for the Board's  flats  militates

against fixed wage-earners, people who earn monthly

incomes  in  the  form  of  salaries.  It  benefits

business people who are likely to claim very  small

incomes and the Board is not in a position to check

and  provide flats only to those whose wages do not

exceed  the  requirement.  Similarly  through   the

absence of a cross-check between the Board and  the

Property  Tax  Department, property owners,  people

who own houses, may be also allotted flats. Not all

attap dwellers are really impoverished. Hawkers may

be people who earn very much more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



than what they claim to earn. There is no check  to

prevent them from applying for these flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Be careful of what you

say.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Point of clarification,

Sir.  The Minister has said that the fittings which

I have mentioned are regarded as an encroachment on

a  common area. I beg to differ; they are not. They

are actually installed within their own premises.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, can I raise -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Member wait until the

Minister has answered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, can the Member for Whampoa give

me  the  courtesy of dealing with these two  points

first before I hear him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah grumbles about

separate  applications being  made,  or  not  being

made, I am not sure.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Certainly "being made".



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> We catch up with the loopholes that

exist  in  the system. Cross-checks are  now  being

made with the Property Tax Division. If anyone  who

already   owns   property  is  caught   making   an

application for a Housing Board flat, he  will  not

only  lose  his  flat,  but  he  is  liable  to  be

prosecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the income of hawkers, why does the Member

not  ask the Minister for Finance how he checks  on

them?  I  do not think he has any means of checking

on  them. If the Member has any suggestions how  we

can  check the income of these hawkers, we will  be

happy to consider and to implement them. These  are

the problems - there are loopholes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell of another loophole. There are grouses

that  when you buy a Housing Board flat, it  really

does not belong to you. You cannot do this, and you

cannot do that, as the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



Toa Payoh has said. Fair enough. We have introduced

a  rule which says, "If you want to sell a fiat, go

ahead  and sell it, provided you sell it to someone

who qualifies to buy that flat and he is already on

the register." This has led to abuse. Mr X gets  a

flat  today  and sells it tomorrow  at  a  handsome

profit of $5,000. These are loopholes which we will

plug.  So  the  Housing Board  is  now  considering

imposing  a  limitation on the  resale  of  Housing

Board  flats, and anyone who sells a flat will  not

be  allowed to apply for another flat for the  next

five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the planning of Telok Blangah, my

instructions  are  that, except  for  the  specific

projects which I have mentioned, there should be no

chopping and changing about. I think the Member for

Telok Blangah will agree with me when I say that no

one  likes  to  shift on his own. And  when  he  is

evicted,  he wants to come back. The usual  excuses

are  that  they have got used to the district,  the

school is nearby, and the market is nearby. They do

not  tell you that their wives' mahjong friends are

close by, too! No one likes to move, but unless  we

move  them there will be no urban renewal.  Do  you

want  progress, or do you want stagnation?  If  you

want  progress,  you  have to evict  them.  So  you

compensate  them, but they are not  satisfied.  You

provide  them  with Housing Board flats,  they  are

also  not  satisfied. They want  a  flat  of  their

particular  choice. They want the fifth floor,  and

they  want a corner flat. And everybody wants  that

flat. We cannot satisfy everybody.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I raise

two  points concerning the economics of our  hawker

centres?  I think the Minister for Health might  be

interested in this too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I will give you a hearing!



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, it seems to me that for

want  of  space the Housing Board is able to  think

only  in  terms  of large hawker centres  sited  in

rather  remote  places. This means  that  there  is

little  business turnover for the large numbers  of

hawkers congregated at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



newly-built  hawker centres. Why cannot  the  Board

think  in  terms  of  small  hawker  centres  which

although  they can accommodate fewer  hawkers,  are

sited  at  places more likely to attract  business?

The appropriate choices for these places can easily

be  known by observing where the unlicensed hawkers

site  themselves, usually at corners of  buildings,

as one can see them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I want to raise concerns the

rentals charged for the hawker centres. It seems to

me  that the rentals are too exorbitant for some of

these  hawkers. It seems to me too that at some  of

these hawker centres, the charges are so high  that

the  hawkers  pass them on to the consumer  in  the

form of higher prices for cooked food, resulting in

a  rise  in the cost of living for the lower income

group. I hope both Ministers will take due note  of

this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> What about the Minister for

Finance?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Furthermore, I think we ought

to   exercise  leniency  in  regard  to  unlicensed

hawkers.  I  know they are a nuisance, and  I  know

their  stalls do not look nice. They congregate  in

places  where  they might obstruct pedestrians,  if

not  traffic, and so on. But until such time as  we

are  able to educate or re-educate these people  to

turn  to occupations that we want them to go  into,

that is, the factories, building construction,  and

so on, we have to let them earn their living. It is

better  they  do unlicensed hawking  than  turn  to

crime  or  some other illicit business. Thank  you,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Are you speaking as an

economist?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Economist and socialist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I think that is a good

suggestion.  In fact, the construction  of  smaller

hawker   centres  at  strategic  sites   is   being

considered by the Housing Board, because  a  hawker

goes  out  of  business if he  is  in  some  lonely

outpost.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the rentals charged, it can be looked at

both  ways. Some hawkers are making money hand  and

foot,  but others are not. But we have to have  one

standard rate, otherwise they grumble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for unlicensed hawkers, the Government is

sympathetic. The Government's policy is not to  get

rid  of  hawkers in Singapore. But licensed hawkers

complain  about unlicensed hawkers.  For  instance,

you  build a market for foodstalls. You license the

hawkers   therein.  And  as  some  of   them   were

unlicensed  before, you give them  a  licence.  But

other hawkers come in, and sell across the road. So

the licensed hawkers say, "What are you doing about

that?  We  will go out of business." An example  is

the  little  row  of stalls we built  opposite  the

entrance to the Botanic Gardens. Previously all, or

most of them, were unlicensed hawkers selling under

insanitary  conditions.  We  put  up  a   permanent

hawkers  centre  and rented out  the  stalls  quite

cheaply. They were given water and electricity, and

they  are  doing good business. But now  unlicensed

hawkers come along. And you must have read  in  the

papers  about  the  police  chasing  an  unlicensed

hawker  and,  in running across the road,  knocking

down somebody's child. Well, this happens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the hawkers at the junction of

Farrer Road, Dunearn Road and Bukit Timah Road,  in

Tanglin  Constituency;  and  yet  another  one   in

Newton,  in  Cairnhill Constituency. These  hawkers

were  all  unauthorised or trespassing  on  someone

else's  land.  They were not paying any  rent,  and

were    selling    food   in   rather    insanitary

surroundings.  We levelled the land,  cemented  the

place,  put  up  little stalls, and  they  are  now

paying  rent at about $40 a month for a  stall.  If

you  sell cooked food, for which you pay a rent  of

about  $1.50 a day, you are well in. On  the  other

hand, if you merely sell sweets, for which you have

to  pay  a rent of $1.50 a day, you might not  make

it. If you sell ice-water --



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> You boom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> - you are in. These are the

differences,  and  it  is  difficult  to  play  one

against the other. But I can assure the Member that

Government's  policy is not to  get  rid  of  every

hawker in Singapore. We have come to accept hawkers

as  part of the life of Singapore. In the past when

hawkers were moved into shops in the Housing  Board

premises, they had to pay a high rent. As a result,

the   price   of  their  food  went  up.  Customers

subsequently  stopped coming, and  then  they  went

bankrupt. But they cater for a need. The Government

realises  this, and we will continue to build  more

and  more hawker centres, so that they can hawk  at

very   cheap  rates,  otherwise  they  go  out   of

business.  I  am speaking generally,  not  only  in

respect of those built in Housing Board estates but

those  at Farrer Road, Newton Road, and the one  at

Orchard Road in front of the Cold Storage, which is

the  most  popular in Singapore. They are  doing  a

roaring  business. There is another centre opposite

the  Singapore Polytechnic, which recently  started

business - a car park by day, and a hawkers  centre

by  night.  So once again may I assure  the  Member

that  we  are not against hawkers. We have come  to

accept  them as part of the life in Singapore.  But

we  have  to  ensure  that  they  sell  food  under

sanitary conditions, so that when hon. Members  eat

at  such places they will not get a stomachache  or

diarrhoea the next day.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, may I make a further

point  on  the question of hawkers' rentals?  I  do

realise  that at certain hawker centres the hawkers

are  so  rich that they can afford to go round  the

world. But at the same time, there are other places

where  the  hawkers are so poor  that  the  rentals

which  they  have got to pay are really exorbitant.

What I would like to suggest is to apply the simple

law  of economics - supply and demand - to each and

every hawker centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to unlicensed hawkers, we have to

ask  ourselves this question: why are there so many

unlicensed hawkers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



This is a situation which reflects upon  the

success  or failure of our educational policy,  our

health  measures, and our ability  to  educate  the

public  on these matters. Sir, at one time I agreed

with  the  Housing Board and the Hawkers Department

in  the  Ministry  of Health to control  unlicensed

hawkers in my constituency. But there came  a  time

when  several  of them approached me,  saying  they

were  widows with seven or eight children  each  to

take  care of, and with tears in their eyes  showed

me  summonses of $15 each. Sir, I cannot  take  any

such action now nor can I support such action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I am not mistaken, the

summonses do not come from the Ministry of National

Development. The Member for Whampoa is  sympathetic

towards  these people. So am I! The law has  to  be

imposed,  otherwise there will  be  chaos.  He  can

philosophise,  but I have to deal  with  realities.

But  if  he  can point his finger at  a  particular

hawkers centre where the rents are too high, and is

able  to  make a case out for the lowering of  such

rents -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> He can easily get a job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> - we will consider lowering the rents,

provided, of course, it will not have repercussions

in  other  centres making the same demand. However,

if  the  business is not so good,  I  think  common

sense  should  tell  them that they  should  change

their business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Get a job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Jobs are easy to find, but I do not

know  what the Minister for Health has got to offer

them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chua, I believe you want to say

something?



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Whampoa  has raised a matter under  a  subhead

which is not within my time to answer. Otherwise  I

would  like to answer him more fully. But with  the

permission of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Law and National Development  I  just

want to say this. If, as the Member for Whampoa has

stated,   summonses  should  not   be   issued   to

unlicensed  hawkers, then he would  be  asking  the

Government   to  be  discriminatory   as   far   as

imposition  of the law is concerned.  My  colleague

has  said that unless that is done, there  will  be

chaos. What is the meaning of the rule of law then?

He  has quoted an example of how some unlicensed or

licensed hawkers are not able to make ends meet.  I

agree that the situation could be given sympathetic

consideration five years ago when there was a large

unemployment situation, but it should not be so  at

the moment. They do not have to hawk as a matter of

necessity, because there are always jobs ready  for

them.  If the hawker is a widow, and I am sure  the

Ministry  of  Labour will support me,  there  is  a

shortage  of domestic servants, and she can  become

one.  I  know that it is not easy to get a domestic

servant nowadays. Why hawk then?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, we are a free and open

society and people can choose any kind of job  they

want. And so does the Minister for Health!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> We are concerned with the

law.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I understand the law, Sir,I

am not advocating that the people should be allowed

to  violate the law. I am advocating compassion  in

the  application of the law. It seems  to  me  that

when  a  person is earning $100 a month and  he  is

fined  $15 per offence, that is 15 per cent of  his

income. If a person from the middle income or upper

income group were to face a fine of 15 per cent  of

their  income, they would raise hell  not  just  in

this House but in the newspapers too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The fines are imposed by the

magistrate in court. The magistrate hears the facts

from the prosecutor and imposes what he considers a

suitable  fine. To discuss here whether a  fine  of

$15  for someone earning $100 is good or bad  seems

somewhat irrelevant. Of course, I would agree  that

if I were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



drawing  $100 a month I could not afford to  pay  a

fine  of  $15, especially if it is quite  frequent.

But  we  are talking in general terms. I think  our

magistrates have enough common sense to  listen  to

the  facts and impose what they think is  a  proper

and reasonable fine.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1061.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the policy of the Government in carrying out its urban renewal scheme to make our city greener, cleaner and more beautiful to attract more tourists and to create a more modern metropolis in South-east Asia. However, I would like to comment on the implementation of

this policy which involves the acquisition of lands

belonging to the private sector. In the process  of

acquisition   of   private   lands   belonging   to

individuals, much criticism, acrimonious complaints

and  dissatisfaction  have been  expressed  by  the

public  over  the arbitrary prices  paid  for  such

lands  which  have no relationship  to  the  market

price  which  can  be  obtained  for  their  lands.

Private  landowners welcome and are very happy  and

willing  if lands are requisitioned to build  roads

and   other  public  projects  for  national   use.

However,  the  lands acquired by  the  Ministry  of

National  Development for the private  sector  have

been  re-tendered for sale at prices  five  to  ten

times more than the original price paid for, and it

is  in such cases that genuine grievances have been

expressed. The owners feel that they have not  been

fairly   compensated  and  that  they   are   being

exploited in order to make the rich people  richer,

especially  when land has been sold  with  all  the

built-in incentives provided by the Government. Can

the  Minister  for  Law  and  National  Development

explain to this House by what criteria lands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



which  are  to  be  acquired  for  development  are

evaluated  and  the  price  arrived  at?   Is   the

valuation   undertaken  by  a  Government   or   an

independent   valuer?  Although  there   is   legal

machinery  by  which  dissatisfied  landowners  can

appeal  to the Appeals Board, more often  than  not

the  aggrieved party is not prepared to go to court

to  get a judgment because they know that it  is  a

foregone  conclusion and, at  the  same  time,  the

legal  expenses  involved are too costly.  Can  the

Minister  give  more sympathetic  consideration  to

landowners,  especially small landowners,  who  own

small  plots of land, so that in future acquisition

of  land a more equitable price is paid for land to

be developed by the private sector?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also suggest that landowners be given a

period  of  grace for half a year to  one  year  to

develop the land themselves if they intend to do so

before acquisition?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, urban renewal schemes will be undertaken in many other areas. I am very concerned with those areas bounded by Kallang Road, Lavender Street, and Jellicoe Road where small- and medium-sized engineering works are situated. Many of these engineering workshops have been in existence for two or three generations. The business has been

passed  down from grandfather to father,  and  from

father to son. The skills also have been passed  on

from  the  elders to the children. They  have  been

acquired through the hard school of experience  and

through trial and error.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister give the House an assurance that when these areas which I have mentioned are acquired for urban renewal, he will provide a suitable area with clean and cheap factory buildings for these engineering works so that they can survive? A reasonable rental can be

charged  for these new workshops. At their  present

sites they pay low rentals and their overheads  are

low.  These  engineering works are the mainstay  in

providing  the supporting manpower skill  and  high

productivity, especially as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



sub-contractors  to  the  big  engineering,   ship-repairing and shipbuilding firms. Without them  the

big  firms  will find great difficulty in competing

with  other countries in fabricated metal work  and

other  engineering  services. I hope  the  Minister

will  bear  in  mind that these  firms  are  firmly

rooted  and  every effort should  be  made  by  the

Government to enable them to continue their  trade.

They will then be able to upgrade their skills  and

acquire new know-how it will be a big loss  to  our

Republic  without  them because they  make  a  real

contribution to our economic growth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first may I thank

the  Member  for  River Valley  for  giving  me  an

opportunity  to explode a myth? This  myth  is  the

general misconception that Government acquires land

cheaply and sells it at high prices. It is admitted

that  in  the  past year or so the  Government  has

acquired  quite  a  bit  of  land.  Most  of   this

acquisition has been made for purposes of  defence.

Our soldiers need training grounds, and, therefore,

large  tracts of land have been acquired.  However,

it  is  not true that we acquire land and  pay  the

owner  whatever  we like. The Land Acquisition  Act

itself  provides  that land  can  be  acquired  for

public  purposes  but  at  the  market  rates.  The

Government Valuer values the land, but that is  not

the  end  of  the  matter. The owner  of  the  land

acquired  has  his  own  valuer  and,  if   he   is

dissatisfied, there are provisions by which he  can

ask  for  a hearing before the Appeals Board  where

the  two valuers can set out their cases. They  can

give  their reasons why the land should  be  $10  a

square  foot  or $20 a square foot.  A  High  Court

judge sits on the Appeals Board and he decides  the

case accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to go back to the question of Government

acquiring  land cheaply and selling it dearly.  One

reason  for this misconception perhaps is  that  no

one likes his land to be acquired by Government. It

does  not matter whether it is acquired cheaply  or

dearly,  he does not like it. However, we  have  to

acquire  land  for public purposes. Perhaps  people

have this false impression because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



are  not  aware of the following factors. The  land

which   is   bought   by  Government   is   usually

encumbered. It costs a lot of money and it takes  a

lot   of   time   to  clear  the  land   of   these

encumbrances.  It is only the Government  that  can

evict  the  squatter  occupiers.  If  the  land  is

subject  to rent control, it is very difficult  and

virtually impossible for the landowner to evict his

tenant.  In some cases, the tenant demands hundreds

of  thousands  of dollars. Therefore,  one  of  the

factors  is  encumbered  land  which  has   to   be

unencumbered. The Government's offer to the private

sector  in respect of urban renewal sites  includes

many   concessions.  First,  there  is   the   easy

repayment  of the purchase price: 20 per cent  down

payment  with the balance repayable over ten  years

without  interest.  This works  out  roughly  at  a

saving  of  approximately 35 per cent of  the  land

premium.  Second,  there is  reduced  property  tax

which is one-third the normal rate. The normal rate

is  36  per  cent. The property tax for  the  urban

renewal sites is 12 per cent payable over 20 years.

Therefore, many people buy them. There are a lot of

purchasers willing to buy them. The owner pays only

12 per cent property tax for the next 20 years. The

Housing  Board flat-owners pay 23 per cent property

tax  now,  after long communication and conferences

with   the   Ministry   of   Finance.   Previously,

Queenstown  flat-owners  paid  23  per   cent   and

Aljunied flat-owners paid 36 per cent. Now there is

a  flat rate. In any case, even Housing Board flat-owners  pay more than the 12 per cent property  tax

in  respect of the urban renewal sites.  There  are

also  other  reasons. The land acquired is  usually

fragmented  with  small and narrow frontages  which

cannot  be developed. These little pieces  of  land

are  collected by the Government and  put  together

into one big complex and then sold.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, when Government sells land, it sells at

"net", if I can use the phrase. `You do not have to

set  aside part of your property for drains, canals

or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



roads.  Everything is laid on. All you do is  build

on  that land. The planning work has been done.  In

fact,  the land offered is almost immediately ready

for  construction.  And last  but  not  least,  the

simulated  plans  provided  by  the  Urban  Renewal

Department give the developer expert advice on  the

optimum  use of the land. I have not given you  all

the  factors. But these are the major  factors  why

the three urban renewal sales that we have had have

been  successful and why the public is prepared  to

pay more and more for these sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the assurance asked for by the Member in

respect of resettlement of the small industries  at

Lavender Street, Geylang Road and Jellicoe Road, he

need not worry now. No clearance programme has been

initiated for urban renewal purposes as it  is  the

intention  of  Government to ensure that  there  is

suitable alternative accommodation available before

full-scale relocation takes place. But the widening

of  Lavender Street by the Public Works  Department

will  affect a few cases in this locality, and this

cannot  be helped as the road widening is  urgently

needed.  There  will be about seven cases  affected

-four carpenters, two repairers of engines and  one

business  of  detergent packing. We will  look  for

suitable alternative accommodation for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1005*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every Singaporean knows that our Government

has  been  able  to lead us on to  the  bright  and

glorious path of national development. As a  result

of  the prosperity of our country, certain problems

of communication were created. Two years ago, Upper

Paya  Lebar Road was widened in order to facilitate

the  laying  of sewer pipes. Some attap  houses  in

Lorong Tai Seng were demolished and the sewers were

laid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paya Lebar Airport will have to accommodate the

Boeing  747s and, as a result of the need to expand

the airport, some houses in Paya Lebar will have to

be   demolished.  There  is  no  doubt  that  these

development projects have affected the people in my

constituency who have to make sacrifices.  We  have

to  be very careful in dealing with the problem  of

resettling  people  who  are  affected   by   these

projects. We should not carry out plans rigidly and

without any flexibility, thus driving them  to  the

brink of despair and hopelessness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to point out clearly that, as a

result  of  such  development  projects  as   road-widening and sewerage works, many houses and  shops

have  been demolished. Many of my constituents have

expressed  their distress and great  disappointment

when  they see their houses brought to the  ground.

However,  after lengthy persuasion on the  part  of

the local leaders and myself, the great majority of

them have come round to the point of view that  the

national  interests must come first.  The  question

now  is  how  to  resettle properly those  who  are

affected by these development projects. Because  of

improper  handling by the officials of the  Housing

and  Development  Board, many problems  which  were

originally capable of solution have become more and

more    complicated   and   have    caused    great

inconvenience to many of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a person who has been affected by

resettlement    applies    for    Housing     Board

accommodation or shop premises, he has to  fill  in

an  application  form  to indicate  his  choice  of

premises. These people have accordingly indicated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



their  preference for the location, the lot numbers

and  the  addresses. However, what they  have  been

allocated  in  the end turns out to  be  completely

different. Their original choice has been given  to

other people. This situation has made me doubt  the

statement  that  these people are, in  fact,  given

preferential treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compulsory reallocation of shop premises

cannot  work because much depends on the customers.

For  example,  if a coffee shop has been  given  an

isolated  corner to carry on the  business   ---  I

have received complaints from coffee-shop owners on

this score it has only itself to serve and no other

customers, and it will have to wait for the day  to

fold up its business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problem of allocation of premises to those

affected  by  resettlement, we  must  find  them  a

better solution and give them a better choice. Only

in  this  way  can  we say that  we  are  fair  and

impartial.   Many  people  have  been  delayed   or

disappointed  by the method and the  way  in  which

allocations  have  been made. However,  the  Public

Works  Department,  especially the  Roads  Section,

does  not  seem to be aware that these people  have

not  been  allocated their new  premises  and  have

issued  summonses to them asking them to appear  in

court.  I have emphasised this point before.  These

people  have already agreed to move away  but  they

have   not   been   allocated  any  premises   yet.

Therefore, they are still there. This anomaly quite

common  and people who are affected by resettlement

have complained to me very often about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right hand of the Government does not

seem  to  know what the left hand does. Because  of

this,  we  seem  to have lost the  spirit  and  the

quality of the P.A.P. when we first came to  power.

I  complained  to  the department  concerned  about

this. The reply was that those who were affected by

resettlement were in the wrong. Or else I would get

a  perfunctory reply full of high-sounding language

and  beating  about  the  bush.  On  behalf  of  my

constituents. I would like the Minister to instruct

his  departmental  heads that they  should  not  be

overbearing. Otherwise he will become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



embarrassed if a complaint is again raised in  this

House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise one or two

points  in  this respect. In my constituency,  more

than half the area is designated for industrial  or

military  use. In these areas, people  have  become

very  hard  pressed. First, the  period  given  for

development  is not fixed. Some of  them  say  this

area  is  to be developed in two years,  but  after

five years, nothing seems to have been done. During

this  period, the farmers will have received notice

to  cease  further cultivation of  their  land  and

their  huts, however decrepit, cannot be  repaired.

Most  of  them  do  not have water and  electricity

supplies and they are not going to have any. If the

drains  are  blocked  and  the  roads  damaged,  no

repairs  are carried out. Only until the  Citizens'

Consultative Committee have repeatedly  brought  up

their  complaints  that  the  roads  are  in   poor

condition that any action has been taken  and  only

very  minor repairs have been carried out. Needless

to  say,  these minor repairs do not help to  solve

the problem.



<br><br>4.00 pm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I have noticed that the policy of allowing no

major  repairs  but permitting only  minor  repairs

seems  to  have  been changed. Three  roads  in  my

constituency   are  in  a  horrible  and   shocking

condition. They are Lorong Kemabal, Joo  Koon  Road

and  Jalan Tuas. The people have recently submitted

their applications for urgent repairs to be made to

these three roads. I do not know why permission has

not been given. I wish to point out to the Minister

that  the  first  two  roads  are  used  daily   by

thousands  of people in my constituency. The  third

one  is  the only road that leads to an army  camp.

Many  of  the  parents  whose  children  are  doing

national  service in the camp have to make  use  of

this  road  to go to the camp. I fail to understand

why  even  minor  repairs to these  roads  are  not

approved.  This has given rise to a great  deal  of

discontent and unhappiness. I would like to ask the

Minister whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



it is true that minor repairs cannot be carried out

in  areas  designated  for industrial  or  military

development, and what is the reason for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> The Members for Paya Lebar and Jurong

are  again  singing their annual tune, playing  the

same organ-grinder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Paya Lebar,

I  do not understand Mandarin, but according to the

interpretation  I received, he mentioned  "despair"

and   "hopelessness".  I  also   heard   the   word

"inconvenience". I think that is the proper word. I

travel to Paya Lebar quite frequently, but I do not

see any "despair" or "hopelessness" on the faces of

the  constituents  in  Paya Lebar.  "Inconvenience"

yes, because they are living next to a busy airport

which  is  being extended. If they choose  to  live

near  an airport, they have got to put up with some

degree of noise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for road widening, we have been attempting to

complete  that job for the last few years,  but  we

have not managed to do so in spite of the fact that

I  have  sought  assistance from  the  Member  -his

constituents are pretty tough - they will not move,

so the road widening is still



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  point of clarification. In my speech, I said the

local  leaders and myself have tried our very  best

to   convince  and  persuade  the  people  in   our

constituency  to look after the national  interest,

but  my  point is that the Housing and  Development

Board  has not allocated any place for them  to  go

to.  The  Minister says that the road has not  been

widened because the people will not move. It is not

that  the  people do not want to move, but  because

the Housing and Development Board has not allocated

any place to them. Are you asking them to go on  to

the road?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, to come to the point, the

position  in  Paya Lebar is this. A  total  of  335

families were affected by road widening. A total of

272 families found their own accommodation or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



accepted  the accommodation offered by the  Housing

and Development Board. There are still remaining 63

families.   They  were  offered  accommodation   in

several  Housing a n d Development  Board  estates,

but they declined to accept it. They have requested

accommodation as follows: 24 families want flats in

MacPherson Estate or the Kallang Basin; 36 families

want  shops,  and  all want to go  to  the  Kallang

Basin,  two  motor vehicle workshop owners  request

locations  which  are not even available,  and  one

light  industrial factory wants another  allocation

which   is   also  not  available.   Priority   for

allocation of accommodation in the Kallang Basin is

given to those families affected by the Sims Avenue

Extension  and  the  Pan-island Expressway  cutting

across  Paya  Lebar  Road We have  not  got  enough

flats.  So the request of these 24 families  asking

for  flats in the Kallang Basin and 36 more  asking

for  shops in the Kallang Basin cannot be  met.  We

have not got them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the summonses, we cannot proceed with the

building  of  the road unless they move  out.  Yes,

they  have  agreed to move out, but they  want  the

moon,  but we have not got the moon, so we have  to

prosecute them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now turn to the Member for Jurong. He

grumbles  about military and industrial  extensions

in   Jurong.   The   Member   is   fortunate.   His

constituents can easily find jobs in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I will give the Member for

Jurong an opportunity to seek clarification or  ask

me further questions, but I have not dealt with him

in  just  one  sentence. The Member grumbles  about

repairs, that only minor repairs are being  carried

out.  To  cut  it short, proposals to effect  minor

repairs  to  Joo  Koon  Road  and  Lorong  Kemabal,

costing  $2,000, and to Jalan Tuas, costing  $1,400

were  deferred. They were considered by  the  Urban

and  Rural Services Committee but were deferred due

to   lack   of   funds  and  also  because   Jurong

Constituency had spent all the funds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



allocated  to  it.  In fact, it had  overspent.  So

there  are  no  more funds to provide  for  further

kampong road repairs and pavings. Other Members  in

this House will be interested to know that for  the

last  financial  year  a  sum  of  $61,284.65   was

approved  for  repairing and paving  kampong  roads

within Jurong Constituency. This is the highest sum

given to any constituency in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, why not Changi?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> This is not all. This is just for

kampong  roads and pavings. On the whole,  a  total

sum  of  $219,124.65 was approved for carrying  out

various  projects and services within Jurong.  This

again is the highest sum given to any constituency.

If  I  can mention it, Choa Chu Kang has the second

highest  sum  - $208,000. I am not saying  that  we

should not spend money in Jurong or Choa Chu  Kang.

It  is  only  right  that we should,  because  both

Jurong  and  Choa Chu Kang are in the rural  areas.

The rural areas are relatively undeveloped compared

to  the  urban areas, like Hong Lim, or  the  semi-urban areas, like Tanglin. [Laughter] Do not laugh,

because  Tanglin  is  partly  rural.  We  have  ten

kampongs  or more, but all I am trying  to  say  is

this.  I am surprised. We have spent so much  money

in  the  Member's constituency, which proves  again

that  he  is hardworking but do not come here  and

grumble about lack of repairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, a few points

of  clarification.  The first  point  is  that  the

Minister said we sing the same tune every year. Why

is  it  that  we have repeatedly to  bring  up  our

points?  It  is  because the departments  concerned

have  not really seriously considered what we  have

proposed and therefore we cannot help but  harp  on

the same tune.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to clarify is that I am

not  against  my constituency being  developed  for

industrial and military use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, as the Minister himself agreed,

is that Jurong is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



relatively undeveloped constituency and, therefore,

we  need  more  funds for road  repairs  and  other

facilities  and so on But in drawing up  plans  for

minor  repairs,  the  three  roads  which  I   have

mentioned require urgent minor repairs because they

are  in  a shocking condition. As the Minister  has

said, it is only a few thousand dollars. I hope  he

will approve the expenditure of this sum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I  withdraw my amendment, I would  like  to

clarify  a  few points. On the matter of summonses,

those people who are affected by resettlement  have

not  been  allocated  accommodation,  so  summonses

should not be issued to them. The Minister has said

that  the Kallang Basin has no vacancies.  I  would

like  to  ask, why then is it that the  project  in

Paya  Lebar  is to be started first? Is it  because

the  "Member for Sims Avenue," is working under the

Minister? Is it because of that that the people  in

Sims Avenue are given preferential treatment? Is it

because,  as  I  have said, the  "Member  for  Sims

Avenue" is working under the Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is the Member for Geylang East!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I did not catch what the Member asked.

Could  the Member please repeat what he said  about

my relationship with the "Member for Sims Avenue"?



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I am

trying  to say is that Upper Paya Lebar should  not

be  developed without first giving priority to  the

resettlement of the people affected in the case  of

the  shops in the Kallang Basin which were allotted

to  those  affected by the Sims  Avenue  Scheme,  I

think  it  was  because  Sims  Avenue  is  in   the

constituency of the Member for Geylang East, who is

in the Ministry of National Development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, let me deal with the Member's

last  allegation first. That is not true. I had  no

dealings with the Member for Geylang East  in  this

case



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



as  he  was  not  concerned with  the  Sims  Avenue

extension.  I think the Member for Paya  Lebar  has

done him a wrong. Those people who were affected by

the Sims Avenue extension were the constituents  in

Geylang  Serai, Kampong Ubi, and, to  some  extent,

Kampong Kembangan. We decided to give them priority

because we considered the extension of Sims  Avenue

and the Paya Lebar Expressway as matters which must

be completed quickly. So between one part, which is

in  Paya Lebar and the other part, which is in Sims

Avenue,  we  had to decide whom we wanted  to  move

first. We decided against the constituents in  Paya

Lebar. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Jurong, we have already

spent so much money on his constituency. But I  can

assure  him that after this budget session,  if  we

have  any  savings,  we will spend  more  money  to

repair the roads which he has complained about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the  detailed  answer  given,  although  I  am  not

completely  satisfied, I beg leave to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already done my duty by repeatedly

raising  in  this House the problem of the  serious

decline  in  agriculture in Singapore. On  numerous

occasions, too, I have repeatedly suggested certain

proposals  for  the improvement and reformation  of

our agriculture. The speaker may be persuasive, but

so   far,  unfortunately  the  listener  is  rather

indifferent. I hope I will not find it necessary to

repeat  again  what I have said in  this  House  in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department was established

over  11 years ago. But has it seriously considered

the  crux  of the problem relating to the  farmers?

Has it seriously considered how it should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



help   the  farmers?  Sir,  before  the  department

started to exercise farm licensing, it claimed that

it  was  not  in  a  position to  assess  the  true

position  of  the farmers. Therefore, on  the  16th

October, 1968, to be exact, the department  carried

out  farm  licensing. All the data on  the  farmers

were  gathered, but in spite of their establishment

strength  of 1,218 members, the Primary  Production

Department has not been able to disclose any  plans

for  agricultural development in Singapore.  If  at

all  any help is given, it is only for the big-time

farmers.  Little assistance is given to the  small-time  farmers. When I last visited my constituency,

I formed the impression that the small-time farmers

are still on the brink of poverty. They lead a very

simple  life  and  they use  very  old  methods  of

farming and livestock rearing. They work throughout

the day and only manage to live from hand to mouth.

They   make   up  the  majority  of   our   farming

population, and therefore the problem of  improving

their  standard of living is a very serious matter,

deserving  the attention of the Primary  Production

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although our country is unable to implement the scheme of "land to the tillers," our farmers should at least have some form of security in respect of their land. At the present moment, farmers are occupying land under Temporary Occupation Licences, a system inherited from the

days  of  colonial administration. The T.O.L.s  are

granted  to  the farmers on a temporary basis,  and

they can be withdrawn at any time. Sir, if they are

withdrawn,  the  farmers will be left  without  any

land  to  till.  Since a total area of  581  square

kilometres (permit me to use the metric  here)  for

the  various zones, like the industrial  zone,  the

Golden  mile zone, the motor repair zone,  and  the

high-class residential zone, has been drawn  up  in

the  Master  Plan,  how is  it  that  there  is  no

agricultural zone? Can we not give our farmers some

kind of lease that is more tenable so that they can

be  assured of land to till without having to worry

about the withdrawal of the T. 0. L.s?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for several years the Primary Production

Department  has  been carrying out  a   feasibility

study  of  our  offshore islands  for  agricultural

purposes;  in  particular,  Pulau  Ubin  and  Pulau

Tekong,  with  a  total area  of  about  28  square

kilometres. But why has it been so quiet about  it?

Does it not have any plans?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem confronting the farmers is

finance.  The farmers' crops are subject  to  price

fluctuations, and they require financial assistance

for   any   development  or  expansion.   I   have,

therefore, suggested to the Minister for Finance to

establish  a Farmers' Bank to grant loan facilities

to our farmers in times of need. Since the Ministry

of  Finance has not indicated whether or not it  is

prepared  to accept this proposal, perhaps  we  may

consider    converting   the   Primary   Production

Department  into a statutory board so as  to  avoid

all  the  unnecessary  administrative  restrictions

imposed  on it as a Government department, in  this

way   the  Primary  Production  Department,  as   a

statutory board, will be able to have, in  addition

to  its  existing functions, a Finance Division  to

deal specially with financial matters to assist the

farmers. The banks and other financial institutions

in  Singapore are prepared to grant loans only  for

commercial  and industrial purposes. They  are  not

prepared  to grant loans for agricultural purposes,

particularly  to  the small-time farmers.  So  they

have no choice but to resort to money-lenders or to

rely  on  tontines to raise funds.  Sometimes  they

even have to borrow from the grocers or the animal-feed  dealers. And if any epidemic breaks out among

their  livestock, or their harvest is poor,  or  if

there   is  any  price  reduction  in  agricultural

produce,  they  will be heavily in debt.  But  when

times  are good, their profits have to be  used  to

purchase   agricultural   implements, seeds   and

fertilisers.  So they have no savings  at  all  and

there  is  no  capital  accumulation.  So  whatever

techniques  you  can  create  or  devise  for   the

farmers, they are not able to take advantage of the

technical  assistance offered because  of  lack  of

finance, if the Primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



Production  Department  still  stagnates   in   its

function   to   provide  technical  assistance   to

farmers, it is of no help at all. In fact, even  in

the dissemination of technical assistance among the

farmers,   the   department  has  not   been   very

effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore say that financial assistance is

of  greater importance to the farmers than anything

else,  and  I  urge the Government to  convert  the

Primary  Production  Department  into  a  statutory

board,  so  that  it will be in a better  position,

through the proposed Finance Division, to help  our

farmers  financially. With adequate finances,  they

will  be  able  to take advantage of  whatever  new

developments,  techniques,  or  technical  aid   is

offered  to  them. At the same time, I  would  also

like  to suggest that the Finance Division  of  the

Primary   Production  Department  (as  a  statutory

board)  set  up  some  sort of  a  crop  insurance

scheme,  so  that when the farmers are  faced  with

problems   such   as  a  decline   in   prices   of

agricultural  produce, they will not have  to  lose

very much. This problem is particularly evident  at

the  present moment as their prices are manipulated

by  the  middlemen, The prices in  the  market  are

quite good, but because of the manipulation of  the

middlemen, all that the farmers get for their crops

is  very  little. So the Government  should  assist

them in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to my proposals. Farmers make up about nine per cent of our population, that is there are about 175,000 of them, and so they deserve our assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members that the

guillotine time for this Head is Five o'clock. Mr

Teong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am in

full sympathy with the Member for Jurong who has

spoken of the problems of the farmers. The farming

industry in Singapore forms quite an important

sector of our economy. At a time when our

agricultural produce brings in an income of about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



$200  million,  their contribution to  our  economy

cannot be overlooked or underestimated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what assistance has the Government given to

our  farmers?  Speaking dispassionately,  over  the

past  few  years the Government has  done  quite  a

great  deal for them through the Primary Production

Department.  The  department teaches  them  how  to

improve  their farming techniques, how to vaccinate

their livestock, and other such things. At the same

time,  the  department  has  also  been  conducting

experiments,  and the results of these  experiments

are made available to the farmers so that they will

know  how to breed their livestock. As a result  of

all  these  improvements, our agricultural  produce

has  increased. But this does not mean that we have

done  enough for the farmers, or that we have  done

all  that is needed to be done to help them. On the

contrary, Sir, the Minister for Finance has pointed

out in his budget statement a few days ago that our

agricultural industry is now faced with many  great

problems. He has also said that over the  past  few

years  there  has  been  an  apparent  decline  in

agriculture, if that is the case, I must appeal  to

the  Ministry concerned to take early steps to  try

to solve the problem.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my view, there are two problems facing agriculture. First, there is the shortage of land. As we know, consequent on the acquisition of land for industrial purposes, urban renewal and housing development, arable land is diminishing in area. In order to ensure the

development  and  viability of our  agriculture,  I

feel that the existing agricultural areas should be

preserved  for agricultural purposes. There  should

be no more acquisition of such land for other kinds

of development. In order to solve the acute problem

of  land  shortage, the then Minister  for  Finance

last year during the budget debate proposed flatted

farming as a method for rearing poultry. However, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



do   not   know  whether  the  Primary   Production

Department has made any study of this proposal.  If

so,  what progress has been made on flatted poultry

farming?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the land allotted to farmers now is barely sufficient for agricultural purposes. One acre of land allotted to a farmer is too small a size for the development of agriculture. Therefore, the farmers affected by land acquisition should be allotted a bigger area of land so that they can

carry  on  with their farming, whether  poultry  or

vegetable  farming,  and  in  this  way  they   can

contribute  to  our  national income.  The  Primary

Production Department has been allotted  huge  sums

of  money  to  carry out experiments  and  research

projects.  This  is, of course, a  good  policy  in

principle, because it indirectly helps our farmers.

However, the question is whether the results of the

research and experiments will benefit every  farmer

and, if it does, to what extent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise the question of the

erection  of chicken sheds. If a farmer puts  up  a

chicken  shed of a size in excess of the dimensions

originally approved, no mercy will be shown to him.

The  shed  will be immediately demolished,  I  hope

that  in future some sympathy will be shown to such

cases.  The  authorities should not  be  too  rigid

about the measurements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I wish to ask is this. In view

of  the  shortage  of land, is there  any  plan  to

develop  agriculture in our off-shore islands,  and

is there any plan for deep-sea fishing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I deal

with  the  question of flatted farming'? It  was  a

suggestion  by  the  then  Minister  for   Finance.

However, he is not in charge of farmers.  I  am  in

charge  of  them. But he is in charge of money.  If

you  want  to  borrow money or  if  you  want  your

farmers  to  be financed, do not ask  me.  Ask  the

Minister  for Finance. The Member should  get  this

clear.  The Minister for Finance is concerned  with

finance, and I am concerned with flatted factories.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has referred to the

income  of $200 million from farmers. Yet  he  says

they are poor. I do not follow him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member wishes to enter into this

debate?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact

that  $200  million has been earned by the  farmers

does  not  necessarily prove that they  are  either

rich  or  poor. It depends on the number of farmers

among whom the $200 million is to be divided.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is accepted. But surely in

Singapore there is not such a big number of farmers

that this $200 million does not go a long way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I do not think we have the

figures  to  prove  or  disprove  the  point.   The

Minister  is  trying to make out a  case  that  the

farmers  are not poor on the basis of $200 million.

That is not fair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am not saying that at all. If the Member has been in this House for several years, he will hear Members saying the same thing every year - that the farmers are poor! When the price of eggs goes down. I am supposed to explain why it is down, and what am I doing about putting the price of eggs

up.  When  the  price of eggs goes up,  some  other

Members  of Parliament will ask me what I am  doing

about getting it down. Anyway, Sir, over the years,

the  Primary Production Department has developed  a

network  of  ten  extension  centres  in  the  more

important   farming  areas  staffed  by   qualified

officers.  These officers visit the farms regularly

and give on-the-spot advice to the farmers, whether

they  are  big-time farmers or small-time  farmers.

They also organise training programmes and talks in

the  respective farming areas for farmers to obtain

the   most   up-to-date  information   on   farming

techniques  and  the  results  of  experiments  and

research.  Information is also disseminated  widely

through the Department's news bulletins, pamphlets,

rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



film   shows   and  rural  news  broadcasts.   More

specifically,  the  Pig and  Poultry  Training  and

Research  Institute in Sembawang organises,  within

the  station, talks and demonstrations  on  various

aspects  of  pig and poultry rearing based  on  the

results of research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agricultural Division organises regular

courses in mushroom cultivation for the public.  On

a  more  formal basis, the Farm School at Sembawang

offers  training  courses  in  which  advanced  and

proven  techniques  of farming developed  from  the

Department's  research programme are passed  on  to

our young farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that land is in short supply in

Singapore and it is really not possible to allocate

more  land  to  farmers. Land is needed  for  other

projects. Hence, the price of land in Singapore  is

going up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for chicken sheds being demolished, these are

minor   matters.   If  they  are   not   built   to

specifications, naturally they are demolished.  The

answer is, build according to the specifications, I

do  not  know  whether I have dealt  with  all  the

matters,  but  if  Members want to raise  something

which I have not answered, please do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir, the Minister has not listened to me carefully.

I  would like to raise again two questions which he

has  not answered. First, has he any plans for  the

development   of  agriculture  on   our   off-shore

islands?  Second  has he any  plans  for  deep-sea

fishing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There are plans for agriculture on the

off-shore  islands, but they are  mostly  concerned

with the growing of orchids. However, they have not

started yet. In fact, quite a bit of land in  Pulau

Tekong  was recently acquired so that our army  can

train  there.  It  meant the resettlement  of  some

farmers  there.  Therefore,  development   on   the

offshore  islands has not started. I think industry

will begin first instead of agriculture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for deep-sea fishing, most of our fishermen are

in-shore fishermen and they are reluctant to go far

out.  We have a training school in Changi to  train

them.  A  few  of  them  have  been  trained.  But,

unfortunately, it is a hard life and very few would

like  to  go far out to sea because it means  being

away  from the family. But we are trying to do  our

best  to  encourage more and more fishermen  to  go

into deep-sea fishing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   Minister  has  not  replied  to  the  various

questions  which I have raised just  now.  However,

because  of  the time factor I would  not  like  to

raise  the same points again. But I hope that  when

the  Hansard is out he will pay serious  attention

to my questions by reading them carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of fisheries was raised just now and

I  would like to express my own opinion on it. Sir,

152   years  ago  Singapore  was  a  small  fishing

village.  It  has  now  developed  into   a   great

metropolis in South-east Asia. We should  be  proud

of the progress our country has made, but we should

feel  sad  because Singapore is not self-sufficient

in  its supply of fish. According to the statistics

in  the  1969  Year Book, the quantity of  locally-produced fish was 12,714 tons, whereas in the  same

period  the  quantity of imported fish  was  41,951

tons.  In  other words, three-quarters of our  fish

consumed is dependent on foreign import. Thus every

year  there  is  a loss of millions of  dollars  in

foreign  exchange. We can see from  the  same  year

book  that  the  number of fishermen registered  in

1962  was  4,366, whereas in 1969 there  were  only

1,348  fishermen registered left. We can  see  from

this  that our fishing industry is declining.  With

the increase of our population, the demand for fish

consumed  will,  of course, increase,  whereas  the

catch   of  fish  is  decreasing.  Based   on   the

calculation  of  60  pounds of  fish  consumed  per

person  per year, by 1985 when our population  will

have reached three million, the consumption will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



80,000  tons,  whereas by the year 2,000  when  our

population  will  be four million, the  consumption

will  reach 107,000 tons. From this we can see that

while  our population is increasing every year  our

fishing  industry is dwindling. The more  dependent

we  are on imported fish, the less bargaining power

we  have over increasing prices. So now is the time

for us to save our fishing industry and I hope that

the Government will make a two-pronged approach  to

remedy   the   situation.  The  Government   should

seriously develop the deep-sea fishing industry and

provide  actual  and  positive  assistance  to  our

fishermen who are in dire difficulties.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our island is surrounded by seas all round.

In  the  seas,  there are inexhaustible  resources.

Particularly  in  the Indian Ocean  and  the  South

China  Sea there are rich fish belts waiting to  be

exploited. In the Indian Ocean, there are  lots  of

tuna  fish which is a great potential for our  fish

processing   industry.  The  Government   has   not

encouraged  deep-sea fisheries in any way.  On  the

contrary,  by  the end of 1969, the Government  has

withdrawn  the  pioneer  status  of  the   deep-sea

fishing  industry. It has spent a lot of money,  in

conjunction  with  the  United  Nations  Food   and

Agriculture  Organisation,  to  set  up  a  Fishing

Training School in Changi and also, under the aegis

of   the   South-east  Asia  Fisheries  Development

Centre,  to  set  up  a South-East  Asia  Fisheries

Research  Centre  to train our  youth  in  deep-sea

fishing.  But  then,  although the  Government  has

spent a lot of money, the trained youths cannot get

any  jobs  because  there are not  enough  deep-sea

fishing boats. Is this all that the Government  can

do?  In the end, all this is a waste of money.  The

Government    should   consider    and    encourage

investments  in deep-sea fishing and try  to  think

out  schemes to encourage its development. From the

point  of view of old-time merchants, an investment

in  deep-sea fishing is an uncertain investment. So

the Government should provide more encouragement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



to this industry and take the lead. It should

also establish joint ventures with local or foreign

capitalists in this industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our traditional fishing methods, such as kelong

fishing,  are out-dated and backward.  Our  coastal

fishing areas are limited in fish supplies. So  our

fishermen have to venture out into the open seas to

fish.  But  now and then we read in the  newspapers

about fishermen being robbed by pirates or detained

in  foreign countries. This happens when they  meet

with  a storm or an engine failure and have to take

refuge  in neighbouring islands belonging to  other

countries.  Sometimes they meet  with  pirates  and

they  incur  more  losses than  just  imprisonment,

fines  and  confiscation of their ship  by  foreign

governments.  But some of them, after  having  been

robbed  by  pirates, did not report to our  police,

knowing very well that even if they did, they could

not  get any assistance from the Government because

it   could  not  do  anything.  Due  to  all  these

hazardous  incidents  the off-shore  fishermen  are

faced  with  problems. Furthermore, the  Government

has  not  allotted them sites for resettlement.  So

all  this  has resulted in the dwindling number  of

fishermen in our country. Sir, now is the time  for

the  Government  to  save our  fishermen  and  give

positive assistance to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I hope the

Minister   will  be  patient.  He  will   have   an

opportunity to speak after I have spoken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, the Government should consider the

following points:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We have all along maintained good relationship

with our neighbouring countries. We should have

some   sort  of  fishing  agreement  with   our

neighbouring countries so as to allow our fishermen

to fish in their territorial waters. At least, they

should  be given safe passage home and  not  be

detained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should send out more sea patrol boats or

organise a kind of emergency sea relief  fleet

in order to protect our fishermen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) As regards fishermen being robbed by pirates,

the  Government  should  give  them  financial

assistance to ensure that they could  continue

with  their old trade so that they may not  be

forced to change their vocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government may perhaps set up a sort of

air   reconnaissance  service  to   spot   the

location  of  fish from the air by  scientific

means.   This   would  be  better   than   the

fishermen themselves spotting for fish in  the

vast  expanses of the seas. Furthermore,  with

our  own  planes  flying  overhead,  it  would

provide   additional   protection    to    the

fishermen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The Government should allot certain areas

near  the  sea coast for fishing  villages  so

that   fishermen  who  are  evicted   can   be

resettled  there. If they are forced  to  live

in  Housing  Board flats, they would  have  to

change their vocation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can seriously consider my

suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Members

for  Sembawang  and  Jurong have  raised  two  very

serious  questions:  one,  regarding  the  use   of

agricultural land, and the other, the promotion  of

fisheries. Just because the demand for agricultural

products and the demand for fish are both likely to

increase  dramatically in the years ahead does  not

necessarily mean that it will be economic for us to

produce  more  in respect of agricultural  products

and more fish ourselves; in other words, to be more

self-sufficient.  Much  of  modern  economic   life

depends  upon specialisation, a division of labour.

Sir,  you can imagine the kind of life each one  of

us  would lead if we were to build our own houses,

make our own clothes and so on. We would be back in

the cave age. In similar fashion, a country has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



got to specialise too. If we can use our labour and

our  resources more profitably in manufacturing and

so  on,  I  say  by all means give up  fishing  and

agriculture.  Of  course,  there  is  a  short-term

problem as well, to the extent that the farmers and

the  fishermen get penalised. I would join them  in

their  plea  for some kind of Government assistance

accordingly. But let us not lose sight of the long-term perspective for both these industries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jek, I believe you wanted to

say something?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Member for Jurong

just  now was rattling off his speech so fast  that

the interpreter was unable to catch up with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the Member for

Jurong.  I  myself was very disappointed  when  the

pioneer status for deep-sea fishing was struck  off

the  list of pioneer status industries. The Primary

Production   Department  has  done  its   best   to

encourage  deep-sea fishing. There is  the  Fishing

Training  Centre  at  Changi,  a  joint  Singapore-U.N.D.P.  (United  Nations  Development  Programme)

project established in 1969 conducting two types of

one-year  courses: firstly, a deck course to  train

navigators and fishing technicians; and,  secondly,

an  engineering  course  to  train  fishing  vessel

engineers.  Prior  to running  these  courses,  the

Fishing  Training Centre conducted  several  short-term  intensive  courses of two  to  three  months'

duration for fishermen in late 1969 and early  1970

in   seamanship,  navigation,  engine  repair   and

operation of fishing gear. A total of 51 out of  75

fishermen  satisfactorily completed these  courses.

The  centre  also  conducted a one-week  course  in

January  1970  for 32 captains of fishing  trawlers

based  at  Upper  Serangoon Road. So  the  Primary

Production  Department  is  not  sleeping  on  this

matter. But as I said, our fishermen prefer  to  do

in-shore  fishing and I am ashamed to say  that  we

import  three-quarters of the fish  we  consume  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, why should we be ashamed?

It is simple economics.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, perhaps the Member misunderstood

me. We are an island surrounded by water.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> So we should all be fishermen!



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, can you sit down when the

Minister is speaking?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am not here to battle with the

Member  for Whampoa on economics. We are an  island

surrounded  by water and we only catch  one-quarter

of the fish we eat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> We buy it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is what you say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

very  serious economic question indeed and  I  must

have some time to reply to this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, you have all the time

until 5 o'clock. You can carry on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, if we appeal to intuitive

arguments  of  the  sort that  because  we  are  an

island,  therefore we must catch all the fish  that

we  eat instead of importing three-quarters of  it,

it  just  does  not  make economic  sense.  If  our

fishermen   can  do  better,  can  earn   more   in

factories, in manufacturing and so on, let them  do

it. If they can build ships, let them do it. But if

our neighbouring countries can get the fish cheaper

than  we can, let them do it and we import  it  and

use  our  resources better. Why does  not  somebody

stand  up and ask, "Why cannot we plant rice, plant

more  vegetables? Why build Housing  Board  flats?"

Because  this  does not make economic  sense.  Just

because we are surrounded by water, we just  cannot

appeal to arguments of that sort.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Whampoa has put it very

nicely.  But  we can always import  fish  from  our

neighbours  provided fish comes in. We  can  always

import water from our neighbours provided the water

always  comes  in. When there is a  blockade,  what

happens?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Fish and water are two

different things altogether.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Fish and rice, too, are two different

things. You grow rice on land.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> We cannot live without water.

We can live without fish and we can always buy fish

from  other  places. If they catch the  fish,  they

have  to  sell it. But they do not have to sell  us

the water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I do not think we can take this

argument  any further. The Member for  Whampoa  has

his  point,  and I have mine. We are surrounded  by

water  and I say that we should catch more fish.  I

never said that we must catch all the fish that  we

eat. But we must catch more fish. I never said stop

manufacturing, stop building Housing  Board  flats.

That came from the Member for Whampoa.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> That is not fair. I never said

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is what the Member was

suggesting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> If we take it to its logical

conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is the Member's conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, this is getting to be a

terribly fishy business!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> On the Member's interruptions!



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not mind, I have got up to 5

o'clock. You can carry on. Mr Ho.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I wanted to

know  why  the  pioneer  status  for  the  deep-sea

fishing industry was struck off the list of pioneer

industries.  The  Minister has  not  answered  this

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I sympathise with the Member for

Jurong.  I am just as sorry as the Member  that  it

was removed. But I had nothing to do with it. I was

removed it. I

had  nothing  to  do  with it. I  was  against  its

removal,  like the Member. I suggest  that  at  the

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that the Drainage and Flood Alleviation Schemes in the coming year will cost about $4.5 million. I do not see the Potong Pasir Constituency included in any of these schemes, nor does the Toa Payoh scheme --

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ramaswamy, are you talking about

the   Development  Estimates  or  the   Expenditure

Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I am talking about subhead

1321 -- Roads, Bridges and Drainage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On the Expenditure Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Yes, on the Expenditure Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on, Mr Ramaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Subhead 1321 -Roads, Bridges and

Drainage.  I  wish to ask the Minister whether  the

Toa  Payoh scheme includes the improvement  of  the

drainage  of Sungei Kallang and the alleviation  of

floods  in  that  area. In the Potong  Pasir  area,

whenever there are two inches of rainfall,  Kampong

Potong  Pasir near Braddell Road is flooded  up  to

one or two feet. During



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



the 1969 flood, all the kampongs were under four or

five  feet of water. The floods were 12 to 15  feet

high.  The  Government is taking flood  alleviation

measures  in  Bukit Timah and other areas.  I  just

want  to find out from the Minister whether he  has

any  schemes for the alleviation of floods  in  the

Potong Pasir area.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps it will be more appropriate,

Mr  Ramaswamy,  if you ask this question  the  day

after tomorrow when the Development Estimates  come

that  you  are  talking  on  this  subject  in  the

Development  Estimates today when  we  are  on  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1110 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(* The same  amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sim Boon Woo)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this subhead I would like to refer to the

deterioration  in the efficiency  of  the  Building

Survey  Division. I have received  many  complaints

from  people in my constituency that there has been

an  excessive delay in their applications to repair

their  houses.  Let  me quote  an  example.  In  my

constituency,   a   certain  person   applied   for

permission to repair his attap hut. This hut is  in

an  advanced state of dilapidation, and if  repairs

are  not  carried out immediately, it will  not  be

safe  to  live  in  that hut. His  application  was

submitted  a long time, but he has so far  received

no reply. This goes to show



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



that the efficiency of the Building Survey Division

has  deteriorated very badly. I hope  the  Minister

will  order  investigations to be carried  out  and

instruct the division to raise their efficiency.  I

hope he will ask them to speed up the processing of

applications to repair houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to talk about the cumbersome

procedure in dealing with applications. As far as I

know,  it  is  as follows. In the first  place  the

applicant  must  go  to  the Ministry  of  National

Development and inform the building inspector  (Di-Niu)  that  he would like to repair his house.  The

building inspector will give him a form and ask him

to  go back and fill it. After filling it, it  will

have  to  be  returned to the Ministry of  National

Development. A month later the person will  receive

a  letter  asking  him to submit his  property  tax

receipts, land rent receipts and two  maps.  These

two  maps are to be purchased from the Ministry  of

National  Development. To purchase these  two  maps

the  person has to fill in another form. What gives

these  applicants a considerable headache  is  that

they  must supply the mukim and the lot number  for

the  area in which the house is situated.  Most  of

these  people  in the rural area are  not  familiar

with  these  mukims and lot numbers. They  have  to

consult the Di-Niu (building inspectors), and, more

often than not, they cannot help. So the applicants

are advised to refer to the landlord. After filling

in the form --



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, point of

clarification. The Member referred to  the  housing

inspector  in  the Chinese colloquial term  Di-Niu,

which  means  land  cow.  This  term  is  generally

accepted  outside the House, Sir, but as a  gesture

of respect to the civil servant, I think the Member

should  use  the actual term of inspector,  housing

inspector or survey inspector, but not land cow!



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> How do you use it in Chinese, Mr

Fong?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir,  I think the Parliamentary Secretary is saying

an  unnecessary thing. It is up to the  Speaker  to

tell  me what to do. Is the Parliamentary Secretary

the Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would have

expected  the Member, after several years  in  this

House  to understand the proceedings of the  House.

It   is   not  my  intention  to  take   over   the

responsibilities of the Speaker. I think it is  the

duty  of every Member to draw the attention of  the

Speaker to any irregularities in the House, whether

in  respect  of  speeches or the  conduct  of  hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think Mr Teong Eng Siong is

conducting himself quite well, except that  he  has

used  a  colloquial term in Chinese which  I  shall

excuse him for the time being.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, but the

Member  insists  on using the term  "land  cow".  I

should  like  to  see  how this  will  go  down  in

Hansard!



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, will you stop using the

term "land cow" and use "inspector" instead?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   regret   the   Parliamentary   Secretary

interrupted  me  for  no  reason  at  all.  Let  me

continue.  After filling in the form the applicants

have  to  purchase the maps. They have to wait  for

another  week  before they receive  them.  Together

with the property tax receipts and the receipts for

the  land rents, they have to submit the two  maps.

After  another  two or three weeks, another  letter

will   be   sent  by  the  Ministry   of   National

Development  asking for details of the  renovation,

whether it is going to be a complete renovation or,

reconstruction, or merely involve the  changing  of

the  roof or walls. The applicants have to draw two

sketches  giving the specifications of  the  length

and breadth of the existing house. Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



course,  they  have no choice but to abide  by  the

procedure. A few days later, the housing  inspector

or  building  inspector -- I hope the Parliamentary

Secretary  is satisfied with this term now  -  will

arrive and check whether the house is according  to

the  specifications.  This  is  stage  one  of  the

application procedure. The applicants will have  to

wait  patiently. After a month or so, they  go  and

ask  the building inspector what progress has  been

made. The reply is, "Hey, how can you expect us  to

work so quickly? We are very busy. Come back in two

weeks' time." Two weeks later, the answer will  be,

"The application has been submitted to the Planning

Department." The same old story - "Come back in two

or three weeks' time." After the two or three weeks

are  up,  the applicants again make inquiries.  The

answer now is, "Come back next week." At least this

is good news. One week later, they go back and ask.

The  reply  this  time  is, "Ah!  The  Ministry  of

National Development has approved your application.

However,  the  plans  have been  submitted  to  the

Ministry  of Health, and we can proceed only  after

the Ministry of Health has given its approval." But

that will take another two or three weeks. However,

at  long  last they are granted a temporary licence

to carry out repairs or renovations.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these delays here and there cause the

applicants  to go to and from more than  ten  times

altogether.  This is not the way to  do  things.  I

hope  the  Minister will consider  simplifying  the

application  procedure and  assigning  one  or  two

officers  to  assist  the  applicant  to  fill   in

application forms for permission to carry out house

repairs, and what is more important, to ensure that

there are facilities to enable them to complete all

the  necessary  procedure in one visit.  This  will

save  them a lot of precious time, which  they  can

usefully spend on working in the farms. Sir, if the

Building  Survey Division is willing  to  help  the

rural  people, it should be a very easy matter  now

because all the depart-.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



ments  of the Ministry of National Development  are

housed  in the same building. So it should  not  be

too  difficult  to  co-ordinate  the  procedure  of

applications   and  to  instruct  the   departments

concerned to liaise with one another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to raise refers to

illegal structures which are more than three  years

old.  In the past certain people in the rural areas

constructed  houses in violation  of  the  building

laws.   This  was  because  they  did   not   quite

understand  these  laws. So  in  respect  of  these

dwellings  which are more than three years  old,  I

hope  the  department concerned will  consider  the

position sympathetically, otherwise summonses  will

be  issued to them every six months, and the  fines

will increase with each summons. This will impose a

very  heavy  financial burden on them. I  hope  the

Minister  will consider the plight of  these  rural

people and help them solve their problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I would like to associate

myself with the Member for Sembawang in airing  the

grievances of the rural people in this House. But I

do not agree with him and I cannot associate myself

with  him in the matter of unauthorised houses  for

which he is asking for consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is very short and simple. What is the

policy  of the Chief Building Surveyor in  granting

permission  to applicants who wish to repair  their

houses in the rural areas? In this respect, can the

Chief Building Surveyor think of a more simple  way

to  help  these  people get their houses  repaired,

such  as cutting out red tape, as mentioned by  the

Member  for Sembawang just now, which requires  the

applicant  to  go down town to the  Chief  Building

Surveyor's office, then to the Planning Department,

and  then to the Health Ministry, and so on? I wish

such a complicated procedure can be made simpler so

that  it will also help those Members of Parliament

in the rural constituencies, including the Minister

of State for Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

for Sembawang has somewhat exaggerated the position

as   regards  the  delay  and  the  procedure.   My

understanding  is that normally an application  for

repair  of temporary houses is approved within  two

weeks from the time the application is made to  the

Chief Building Surveyor's Department. The procedure

for  submitting such applications is already  quite

simple.  There  seems  to be  no  need  to  further

simplify it. The procedure may be generally  listed

as  follows. The applicant first goes to the  Chief

Building  Surveyor's Department  and  the  building

inspector  will  help him fill in  the  application

form.  He  is then immediately advised to  purchase

two  copies  of the site plans from the Development

Control Division of the Planning Department.  Next,

the   plans  together  with  the  ground  rent   or

assessment receipt to prove ownership of the house,

are  then  handed to the building inspector.  After

this,  the  building inspector will then visit  the

site,  take  measurements of the building  and  its

location,  and  draw  up the  necessary  plans  for

approval.  Those  are  the  three  steps   of   the

procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the mukim number and the lot number, my

sympathy goes to those people who do not understand

what this is all about. But I think the Member  for

Sembawang will appreciate that no building plan can

be  passed unless the site is located. To do  this,

we  must  know the mukim number and the lot number.

But  as  far as is possible, the building inspector

will assist the applicant in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the confusion about the procedure really

lies  with  what is meant by "repairs". The  Member

for  Sembawang spoke about repairing a house  which

was in a dilapidated condition, If a house is in  a

dilapidated condition, seldom will the  owner  want

to  repair  it.  What he does is  to  demolish  the

building  and put up a new one. This is where  the,

trouble  starts. A simple application  for  repairs

can  be approved provided it is merely repairs. But

more  often  than not, you will find  the  occupier

applying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



to the department for repairs to his house when his

intention is to demolish it and put up a  new  one.

And  when the building inspector subsequently makes

a   check,  he  finds  that  the  rooms  have  been

enlarged,  the house has gone a little higher;  and

then there is trouble. I think this is the basis of

the confusion that exists, because if a house is to

be  reconstructed, the signature of the land  owner

is required as he owns the land. You cannot build a

house  on his land without his permission. He  will

not  give  the occupier permission to build  a  new

house  nor will he sign the plan, but the  occupier

comes  to  the  Chief  Building  Surveyor  with  an

application  for repairs. So there is  trouble  all

round.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the houses are reconstructed on the same

site with the same floor area as the original,  the

owner's  consent  is done away with.  But  in  many

cases the reconstruction is first carried out,  and

then  the  applicants  go  to  the  department   to

regularise  the position. It is only  in  cases  of

reconstruction of concrete semi-detached or terrace

houses  that  applicants are advised to  engage  an

architect to prepare the building and site plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also mentioned

continuous  court actions. It all starts  with  the

builder   being  prosecuted  for  putting   up   an

unauthorised building. The magistrate convicts  him

and  fines  him, and also makes an  order  that  he

should   demolish  that  house.  It  is  called   a

mandatory  order.  But,  of  course,  he  does  not

demolish  the  house. He will not comply  with  the

terms  of the mandatory order. Because of that,  he

is  brought  to  court again  and  again.  And,  of

course,  as  long  as he does not comply  with  the

order  to demolish, subsequent convictions lead  to

bigger  fines. If we are to drop the matter  after,

say,  three  years, then the position  will  become

hopeless.  He  defies  the  law,  he  ignores   the

mandatory  order,  and  after  three  years,   when

everybody keeps quiet, he has got away with it.  So

I think the Member for Changi is right on that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



score.  But  there  have been  cases  where,  after

several convictions and on sympathetic grounds, the

department has not taken any further action. But to

do  that  in  all  cases would lead  to  many  more

unauthorised  houses being put up, thereby  getting

the cloak of authority within three or four years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like the Minister  to  clarify  two

points.  First, he has mentioned just now that  the

building  inspectors will help  the  applicants  to

fill in the forms. As far as I know, they have  not

assisted  the  people from the rural  areas  to  do

that. These forms are in English, and because these

people do not know English, they do not know how to

fill  in the forms. If the building inspectors  had

assisted them, I think this problem would have been

solved.  But since the Minister says that  they  do

help,  I  hope that they will from now on  actually

assist them in filling up the forms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to repairs and renovations of old

houses,  these  houses are in many  respects  in  a

dilapidated condition. All that the occupier  wants

to  do  is to replace some of the old parts of  the

building with new ones. They are not reconstructing

the  whole  building.  They want  to  renovate  the

building on the existing site. If the Minister says

that this work does not require the approval of the

landlord,  I say that this is not so. In fact,  the

building inspectors often make it difficult for the

applicants. Sometimes they kick them about  like  a

ball  from  here to there. I think the Minister  is

not  aware  of  this  fact.  I  hope  he  will  pay

attention   to  this  matter.  This  is   a   great

inconvenience to the people in the rural areas.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people in the rural

areas,  we have often encountered problems of  this

nature. I have the opportunity to understand  these

problems  more clearly. I am speaking  very  slowly

now. I hope the Minister can understand me.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. Some houses which are

more, than three years old do not have any building

plans.   At  the  time  when  the  builders   first

constructed  their houses, they were not  aware  of

the building laws. As a result, they violated them.

The  Minister has said that one must look at  these

cases  sympathetically, and that after one  or  two

fines have been imposed, these offenders should not

be  fined  any further. However, some of them  have

been  fined  more  than  three  times.  They  still

receive a fine thereafter. I hope the Minister will

pay  attention to this matter. He has already  said

in  this  House that he will consider  these  cases

sympathetically.  I  hope  he  will  instruct   his

Ministry to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek some

clarification from the Minister. If a person wishes

to repair a house by replacing the main pillars and

changing  the roof and, at the same time, replacing

half  of  the planks, will it be considered  a  new

house or a repaired house? The sides and the height

of the house remain the same.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the repairs

mentioned  by  the Member are carried  out  to  the

letter, it will not be considered by the department

as  reconstruction but under the phrase  "repairs",

provided, of course, the rooms are not extended. If

you  re-build your house, shall we say, on the same

site  with  exactly  the same area;  that  is,  you

completely   demolish  the  house,  and   you   put

something new there but with exactly the same  area

as  before,  the department considers the  work  as

repairs. But if you increase the size of the  house

by  three  square inches or three square  feet  and

when  the  building inspectors measure it and  find

that the house is bigger, they will say it is a new

house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang seems to be at issue with

me  as  to  what  happens  in  the  Chief  Building

Surveyor's Department. My understanding is that the

building  inspectors are there to help  members  of

the public. The Member's understanding is that they

do  not help them. However, since the beginning of'

this year, my Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



Secretary has been put in charge of the Chief

Building Surveyor's Department and he can  keep  an

eye on what is happening in the department from day

to  day. If the Member has any difficulties on this

score, I would suggest that the Member contact him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the court convictions, I do not think I

need  repeat  what  I have said.  There  have  been

convictions  of even more than half a dozen  times.

But  if  there are sympathetic grounds on which  we

can  drop the whole matter, we will do it. And this

has  been done in several cases. If the Member  has

any  particular  case  in  mind,  he  can  draw  my

Ministry's  attention to it and  we  will  give  it

every consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I think the Minister is sincere in his  reply

to  my question. However, there is another point on

which  I  wish to seek clarification. This concerns

the  difficulties in the application procedure. The

Minister says that I have exaggerated the  case.  I

do  not  think I have exaggerated in the  slightest

degree, because what I know has been gathered  from

complaints  by many people who have, in fact,  gone

through this cumbersome procedure. What I have said

is  based  on  facts, and nothing else.  Since  the

Minister  has  given  serious consideration  to  my

question  and  has  assured  the  House  that   his

Parliamentary Secretary will now be responsible for

the  Chief Building Surveyor's Department and  that

every  problem can he referred to him, I beg  leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $819,150 for Head 1110 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1202 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1202 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are some junior doctors who resign

from Government service after serving a couple of





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



years.   As   a  result,  there  are  no  immediate

replacements for the vacant posts. It appears  that

the  student  doctors who are in  the  housemanship

programme have to consult the senior doctors  every

now  and then. In the end they are a burden to  the

senior doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this pressure and if the senior

doctors  resign from the service, what will  happen

to  the Hospitals Division? I, therefore, call upon

the  Minister  to  rectify  the  situation  in  the

medical  services,  or else  the  standard  in  the

hospitals will deteriorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that some doctors work from 82 to 119

hours  a week. If this is true, how can they manage

to continue in Government service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that it is not financial considerations

alone  which  have resulted in the  resignation  of

doctors.  It  is, in fact, because  of  their  poor

conditions of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if too many specialist doctors

resign  from  Government service, I fear  that  the

many costly instruments and apparatus owned by  the

Government   will  not  be  properly   handled   by

inexperienced doctors. If that is the  case,  these

costly instruments may turn out to be a waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I presume some of the departments have

insufficient staff when resignations or retirements

occur, especially in the E.C.G. Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, student nurses should be given proper training in good manners, politeness and etiquette, because I have seen some of them not performing their duties according to the above standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that it is compulsory for

student  nurses to stay in the hostel during  their

training   periods.  As  a  result,  expenses   are

incurred by them for lodging, laundry, food,  etc.,

even  though  they may stay near to the  hostel.  I

would,  therefore,  suggest  that  staying  in  the

hostel  should not be made compulsory,  because  it

will affect the take-home pay of the nurses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter which I wish to raise but

which  probably does not come under  this  subhead.

Anyway,  I will mention it, although I do not  know

whether or not the Minister will reply to it.  Sir,

with reference to the Institute of Health at Outram

Road,  it  appears  that  the  conditions  in   the

vicinity of the institute are more like those of  a

market  than  a  hospital. I  wonder  whether  some

changes  can be made to the institute so that  this

hospital   for  children  will  have   a   brighter

appearance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to know whether the Minister will

consider introducing a health service system, as is

being adopted in the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a professor from New Zealand a few days ago mentioned the shortage of doctors in Singapore. This confirms what I have told the Minister, that there is a shortage of doctors in the Singapore General Hospital.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with

the  Member for Anson that we are short of doctors.

In fact, when I made my speech last year, I did say

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking his first point, when talking about the

resignation of specialists, he has asked what  will

happen after that? Following the resignation  of  a

specialist,  the  next  most  senior   officer   is

immediately  appointed to act  in  the  post.  This

period is necessary to enable this officer to carry

out  the duties of the specialist and to enable the

Ministry  to assess his suitability for  promotion.

Promotion exercises are held about twice a year, as

the  Public Service Commission is not in a position

to  hold  them  more frequently. Furthermore,  time

must  be  allowed for officers who were  considered

not suitable in the earlier promotion exercises  to

prove their worth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also mentioned some

doctors who have been made to work from 82  to  119

hours.  Though I agree that some of them have  been

asked  to work long hours, I think 119 hours  is  a

bit  of an exaggeration. If we divide 119 by seven,

we get 17 hours. I do not think that it is possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



for any doctor to work 119 hours a week. Therefore,

this  is  quite  obviously a prima  facie  case  of

exaggeration. However, may I say that a  survey  of

the  working  hours of doctors was carried  out  in

August 1969. It showed that they were on duty  from

42  hours  to  a maximum of 86 hours  a  week.  The

matter  was looked into and in August 1970,  on  my

instruction, a circular was issued to all heads  of

departments   to  the  effect  that  whenever   the

exigencies   of  the  service  permitted,   medical

officers on night duty in a clinical unit should be

given half a day off the next day. The position  up

to the beginning of this month showed that this was

being  implemented  in 16 out of  the  23  clinical

units of the hospital services.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I just say something about the number of

medical  officers  who  are  now  working  in   the

hospitals?  In August 1970, the number  of  medical

officers  in  service was 248 and  on  15th  March,

1971,  the  figure  was  261.  There  has  been  an

increase  of  13 medical officers. In view  of  the

improvement  in the staffing position, instructions

have  been  issued that with effect  from  15th  of

March  this  year,  all medical  officers  who  are

required to perform night duty will be given a half-day off the following day. This would result in the

reduction of the total number of hours of  duty  by

doctors  by about four hours per week if an officer

does  one  night duty per week, and by about  eight

hours  per week if an officer does night duty twice

per week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the nurses, I agree again with the

Member for Anson that the student nurses - I do not

know why the Member has picked on student nurses  -

should be properly trained and should be courteous,

in  fact, they are properly trained. I can say that

the  majority of them are courteous to the  public.

Not only student nurses but, in fact, all grades of

the nursing staff are taught to be courteous at all

times  with  the patients, with the  public,  their

colleagues  and their seniors, and  this  has  been

emphasised throughout their training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



period as well as in circulars and so on.  The

Member  for  Anson will agree with me that  in  any

organisation  there  are bound  to  be  some  black

sheep.  I believe he will also agree with  me  that

there are black sheep among postmen. That being the

case,  we have devised a method whereby all members

of  the  staff of the hospitals have been asked  to

wear  a  name tag and, if there are any complaints,

to  let us have them. Has the Member for Anson  any

complaints about the student nurses?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> <i>indicated none.</i>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The Member has none.

Therefore,  may  I  say that the general  statement

made  about  discourtesy and  so  on  is  not  very

helpful to my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made a comment that the Institute

of  Health is like a market. I do not know  how  he

views it to be like a market. I agree with him that

the  building is quite old. We always  welcome  new

buildings, but so long as we have none, we have  to

make the most of what buildings we have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member mentioned the United Kingdom

national  health service. In other words, he  wants

us  to bring private practitioners also within  the

health  service. May I say that at the  moment  the

Ministry   of   Health  has  about  27   outpatient

dispensaries,  and  they are  providing  a  service

particularly to the low-income group, and I can say

that  the  service is adequate. Therefore,  at  the

moment we are not considering utilising the doctors

in  private practice and introducing a U.K. type of

national health service.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite

agree  with what the Minister for Health has  said.

But a professor from New Zealand has mentioned that

even in New Zealand doctors in private practice are

brought  into  the national health  service  for  a

certain  period. Anyway, I do not want  to  prolong

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards student nurses, the Minister has asked

me  whether I have complaints to make. These nurses

are student



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



nurses.  They are not trained nurses. If  they  are

trained nurses and if there are complaints, we  can

send them to the Ministry of Health. Student nurses

are  still  students. Therefore, I  would  ask  the

Minister to advise the heads of departments to urge

the student nurses to be courteous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received another complaint about the

nurses  of  Kandang Kerbau Hospital. It seems  that

they  are  rude to the patients. The Minister  says

that circulars are issued to the hospitals from his

Ministry,  and I ask the Minister to issue  another

circular to all the hospitals calling on the nurses

to be courteous with the patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1202 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1161.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I merely wish to inquire whether there are

trained staff under the charge of the Senior Sister

Tutor  who can undertake the training of nurses  in

industrial     health.    With    our     expanding

industrialisation,  the  question   of   industrial

health has to be scrutinised more and more.  It  is

possible  that we may at some future date  want  to

provide  the services of industrial nurses  in  the

factories  in  Jurong, and for that purpose  I  ask

this question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the

moment,  the  Ministry of Health does  not  have  a

formal  course  in our School of  Nursing  for  the

training of industrial health nurses. The reason is

that  this  subject  is  a very  new  one  and  the

training of nurses in industrial health has  to  be

undertaken   overseas.  In  the   initial   period,

however,  the  Ministry will be sending  one  staff

nurse  some  time  this  year  to  be  trained   in

industrial  health nursing at the Royal College  of

Nursing in London. Others will follow later. Once a

core  of  nurses specially trained in this  subject

has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



built  up,  the  Ministry may consider  planning  a

special  course  of  training  in  our  School   of

Nursing.  Assistance could, of course, be  obtained

from   the  World  Health  Organisation  or   other

international  agencies to  formulate  a  programme

when so required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Member for Katong may be thinking of

training  nurses working in the industries  in  the

private sector. If that is what he is thinking  of,

may  I say that at the moment the Singapore Trained

Nurses Association, in conjunction with the Society

of  Occupational Medicine, is currently running  an

introductory  course in industrial  health  nursing

for  such  nurses  and others who  are  interested.

Perhaps in the future if there is sufficient demand

from industries to employ trained industrial health

nurses,  the  professional  bodies  concerned,  and

perhaps  the Extramural Studies Department  of  the

University of Singapore, may join in to continue to

provide such courses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I do not think any voluntary

organisation or educational body can do the job  as

well as the relevant officers in the Minister's own

relevant unit. I thank the Minister for his  answer

and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.

I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1202 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1733.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our society becomes more urbanised and

more   industrialised  and  as  the  pace  of  life

quickens, it seems inevitable to me that  more  and

more  people will crack up mentally. As  a  result,

they are unable to adjust themselves and to come to

terms with the tremendously increased pressure  and

changed  circumstances of a  modern  society.  This

seems  to  be  the sad story behind the  statistics

supplied  by the Minister for Health to the  Member

for  Katong  yesterday. It will be  seen  that  the

total number of people who sought psychiatric  help

has  gone up from 28,431 in 1968 to 39,847 in 1970.

These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



are  patients who attended the outpatient  clinics.

The increase is definitely quite frightening. I  am

rather surprised to see that in Woodbridge Hospital

itself,  there is only one psychiatrist.  I  cannot

see  how  one psychiatrist can cope with the  total

number  of  some  3,000 inmates at  any  one  time.

Perhaps  the  Minister would like to  clarify  this

point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree

with   the   Member  for  Jalan   Kayu   that   one

psychiatrist  cannot  cope  with  so  many   cases.

Therefore, there must be something incorrect  about

it. It is not correct to say that there is only one

psychiatrist who is working in Woodbridge Hospital.

In  fact,  we  have three consultant psychiatrists.

They  are  the  person who is  noted  down  in  the

Estimates as Psychiatrist (Grade G), referred to by

the   Member  for  Jalan  Kayu,  and  the   Medical

Superintendent and Deputy Medical Superintendent of

Woodbridge   Hospital  who  are   also   consultant

psychiatrists   and  are  doing   the   duties   of

consultant  psychiatrists.  In  addition  to  these

three,   we   have  three  senior   registrars   in

Woodbridge  Hospital all of whom are in  possession

of  the Diploma in Psychological Medicine and  are,

in  fact, specialists in psychiatry, although  they

have not been appointed clinical consultants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that even this number of psychiatrists

will  not  be sufficient in the next few years.  At

the  moment,  we  have one officer  in  the  United

Kingdom  undergoing training, and a  further  three

medical officers will also be leaving this year  to

undertake  courses  in  psychiatry  in  the  United

Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my

amendment  I would just like to draw the  attention

of  the House to the fact that about 50 per cent of

the  number  shown against Woodbridge Hospital  are

apparently readmissions. This does seem to  suggest

that perhaps the treatment given at the hospital is

not  really  good.  I  have heard  complaints  that

patients are sent home too soon. In fact, I know of

one particular case



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



my constituent - who was beaten up twice by his son

who  was  apparently  let out  too  soon  from  the

hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to mention is

that  I use Yio Chu Kang Road quite often and  some

nights on my way home, I was surprised to see  some

patients  apparently  doing  a  striptease  by  the

roadside. They are not only a hazard to themselves,

but  also  a  danger to people driving  along  that

stretch  of  the road. This is one matter  which  I

feel  might  be due to the lack of supervision  and

possibly  could be due to the shortage of staff  at

the Woodbridge Hospital.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

unfortunately, the Member for Jalan  Kayu  has  not

understood  the  modern  psychiatric  approach   of

treatment of patients. In fact, it is the policy of

psychiatric  hospitals to have an open-door  policy

wherein  patients are allowed a more open and  free

environment  under supervision. This  more  natural

environment  helps the patients in the  process  of

recovery. In many hospitals patients are encouraged

to  run  their own wards and given the  freedom  to

move in and out. It is not true that the inmates of

the  hospital are let loose, as was put forward  by

the Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards readmissions, of course, it is best

that if a patient has recovered a certain degree of

sanity, he has a chance to return to his home.  The

idea  behind  it  is  that in  their  natural  home

surroundings   they  should  get   better   faster.

Unfortunately, there may be cases of relapse and so

on. May I just say that if a patient is known to be

unpredictably  violent or shows  a  possibility  of

violence, he will be put in a more secure  ward.  I

do  not  think the Member for Jalan Kayu should  be

very worried when he passes along Yio Chu Kang Road

at night.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> In view of the fact that the

Minister   seems  to  be  aware  of  the   problems

involved, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1203 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1601*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Conceicao.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cleaning of the Republic is not done daily,

and  there are places where rubbish and garbage are

accumulated.  Therefore, it  has  resulted  in  the

breeding of mosquitoes and flies. Will the Minister

take action to see that the rubbish and garbage are

cleared  daily?  We complained many  times  to  the

Public  Health Division but they replied that  they

were  short of men, short of lorries and all  sorts

of  things. The Minister must take action to  clear

the rubbish and garbage daily.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I wish to draw attention to the recent

outbreak  of  typhoid in Kampong  Ubi  and  Geylang

Serai.  It appears that the Health Ministry shirked

its  responsibilities by putting the blame on a man

who  had  failed to practise personal hygiene,  and

who  had acted as a carrier of the disease, as  was

reported  in  the newspapers recently.  I  consider

that  such  an accusation brings disrepute  to  the

Health  Ministry itself for trying to cover up  its

faults  regarding public cleanliness in this  area.

The  efforts of the Public Cleansing Department  in

the  Kampong  Ubi and Geylang Serai  constituencies

were  very  inefficient.  Refuse  was  allowed   to

accumulate  and became stinking, while drains  were

blocked.  The  residents of  these  two  areas  had

played a useful role during the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



Keep  Singapore Clean campaigns in 1969  and  1970,

with  the result that they are now imbued with  the

spirit of cleanliness and it has become a household

chore  to  clean  the environment of  their  homes.

However, it is a matter for regret that the  Health

Ministry cannot share this responsibility in regard

to cleanliness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister is aware that the

construction of a new road from Sims Avenue,  which

is   in   the   Geylang  Serai  and   Kampong   Ubi

constituencies up to Jalan Eunos, has  resulted  in

several  drains being blocked. If the  Minister  is

aware of the consequences after a flood, what steps

and  measures can be taken by the Public  Cleansing

Department to overcome this hardship? I am sure the

typhoid  carrier contracted the disease by accident

of  circumstances,  but up to  date  no  conclusive

evidence has been obtained. What ought to  be  done

by  the Public Cleansing Department is to send  the

cleansing  workers to take over the  responsibility

of  maintaining a state of cleanliness in these two

areas and, at the same time, clear the drains which

have been choked in consequence of the road project

now  in progress. This should be done daily and not

once  or twice a year, which has hitherto been  the

practice  of  the  Public Cleansing  Department  in

respect of these constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I refer

first to the rather blatant statement by the Member

for  Geylang Serai who attributed all the blame  of

the  typhoid  outbreak to the  Health  Ministry.  I

believe he must have followed the correspondence in

the  Berita Harian where my officer put  the  facts

quite clearly. We are not trying to shirk any blame

whatsoever,  but  we  put the  facts  clearly,  and

wherever  the  blame falls, it falls rightly.  From

what  the doctors told me - it was not told  to  me

just for the sake of trying to exculpate themselves

from  blame,  but  as  a result of  bacteriological

tests which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



had been carried out and from the evidence gathered

-  it was quite conclusive that the major factor in

the  outbreak was a break-down of personal hygiene,

and not the unsanitary conditions of the drains and

so on. This outbreak was the result of transmission

of the disease through food. In other words, it was

transmitted  by carriers. In fact,  this  has  been

borne  out  by  the  fact  that  one  carrier,  who

happened  to  be  a hawker selling ice-drinks,  was

responsible  for the people who had  bought  drinks

from  him  going down with typhoid,  and  they,  in

turn,  infected  their families and friends.  These

victims  had  informed the Ministry officials  that

they  had bought drinks from this man. It is  quite

clear  that this outbreak of typhoid was the result

of poor personal hygiene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I may explain what I mean by personal

hygiene.  It  means that you must wash  your  hands

when  you handle prepared food and before  you  eat

it.  Not only that, you must cover any exposed food

or drinks from flies around.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true to say that the Health Ministry has

been shirking its duties. It has been carrying  out

its  duty of removing the refuse in that area.  But

may I say that if there is refuse in the drains  it

is  also  the  fault of the residents of  the  area

because, as the Member for Geylang Serai will know,

in  our Keep Singapore Clean campaigns, the message

was  that refuse should be thrown into dustbins and

not  into drains. If there is refuse in the drains,

whose fault is it? Of course, it is the duty of the

Ministry's workers to collect the refuse  from  the

drains, but whose fault was it that, from the  very

beginning,  refuse  was  thrown  into  the  drains?

Perhaps  the  Member for Geylang Serai  may  answer

that  simple question. Also, we have been  informed

that  the  residents  did  allow  the  children  to

defecate into the drains. Again, there was evidence

that  many  of the lavatories - this is the  bucket

system  of lavatory which we find is unsatisfactory

-  was  not  in a good state. Does the  Member  for

Geylang  Serai  say that the Health  Ministry  must

repair these lavatories for the residents there?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he mentioned the construction of the Sims

Avenue  Expressway which he blamed as the cause  of

flooding.  I  am afraid he has raised  this  matter

under  a  different subhead. It should be  under  a

different  Ministry. There again, may  I  say  that

this is an area which is below the high-tide level.

I  think  my  Ministry officials have stated  quite

clearly that the only way to solve this problem  of

flooding is to raise the whole area, because, as we

know, water flows from a high level to a low level.

It cannot flow from a low level to a high level. So

if  the  land is below high-tide level, how do  you

expect it to flow? Is it the responsibility of  the

Health Ministry to see that water flows upward?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has said that the people in his

constituency  have co-operated with the  Government

in  its  Keep Singapore Clean campaign. I  am  very

glad  they  have done so. And he says that  because

they  have done so, they are now clean. We are  not

saying  that the residents are dirty or  have  poor

personal  habits. It needs only one, two  or  three

hawkers who practise poor personal hygiene to cause

an  outbreak  of typhoid, even though the  majority

practise a high standard of personal hygiene.  That

is  why  the  Ministry  has never  grown  tired  of

reminding  the  people of Singapore that,  for  the

sake  of  their  own  health, a  high  standard  of

personal hygiene should be maintained. My officials

have told me that even though the surrounding areas

are  insanitary,  if  a high standard  of  personal

hygiene  is maintained by everybody, this  sort  of

outbreak via carriers cannot occur. I believe  that

our Chairman, who is a medical man, will be able to

understand it even better. But that does  not  mean

that the Health Ministry is neglecting its duty  to

clear  the  rubbish. We do clear  it.  In  fact,  a

correspondent  in one of the newspapers  says  that

the  place  is  much  cleaner now.  Of  course,  an

argument can be raised that we only cleaned  it  up

after the outbreak. But if the Cleansing Department

has  not done its duty, did the Member complain  to

the  Ministry of Health before? I did  not  receive

any complaint from him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the Member for Anson. He says that

the removal of refuse in the Republic is being done

irregularly. May I say that, as far as  removal  of

refuse  is concerned, it is being regularly removed

daily.  May I also add that Singapore is about  one

of the very few countries in the world which remove

garbage   daily,  including  Sundays   and   public

holidays. The position is quite different from that

in more advanced countries like New York, London or

even Tokyo where refuse is removed once or twice  a

week.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Yes, Sir. But I agree that

there  may  he  cases of non-removal on  particular

days, and the reasons are a shortage of labour  and

drivers, and a break-down of vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually at the moment we are suffering from a

shortage of garbage truck drivers and labourers. In

fact,  there is a need for 963 cleansing  labourers

and  48 garbage truck drivers, and it is impossible

for us to --

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the

explanation given by the Minister, I beg  leave  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1203 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1721.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are trying to keep the city clean and our

campaign   has   met   with   some   success.   But

unfortunately we still find that there are  certain

areas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



where  mosquitoes are breeding.  In  spite  of  the

cleaning  of the city, these mosquitoes  are  still

active. I wonder how the Anti-Mosquito Unit  works.

Can  the  Minister see to it that the Anti-Mosquito

Unit  checks the breeding spots of mosquitoes  more

thoroughly,  so  that  these  places  will  not  be

infested  with mosquitoes? I understand  there  are

some new spray machines available in Singapore, and

perhaps  these  can be used to kill the  mosquitoes

wherever they are found breeding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, first of all, may I

thank the Member for saying that Singapore is  much

cleaner  now.  May I also say that the  problem  of

mosquitoes  will  be there so  long  as  there  are

people who breed mosquitoes in their own homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different types of mosquitoes. One of

them is the Aedes mosquito which causes dengue  and

haemorrhagic fevers. This species breeds in  water-bearing receptacles and other artificial containers

in  the  homes,  which are often carelessly  thrown

into  the  garden or into the open. Since launching

our Keep Singapore Clean and Mosquito Free Campaign

in 1969, we have had some good results in the sense

that  the  number of haemorrhagic fever  cases  has

gone  down. In 1968 the number of these  cases  was

1,000 and in 1969 there were only 200 cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the spraying of drains to prevent the

breeding of mosquitoes, that is being done. But may

I  say  this: Singapore is a tropical country,  and

the  climate is such that you may spray the  drains

in  the  morning, but if it rains in the  afternoon

all  the insecticide is really going down the drain

into  the canal. So as far as mosquito breeding  in

drains  is concerned, it is an engineering problem,

as  there  must  be proper levels of  drainage,  in

other words, water must flow from higher levels  to

lower levels.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

whether  we  are  still using D.D.T. for  mosquito

control? If so, is he aware that in countries  like

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



United  States  of America, they  have  noted  that

inordinate amounts of D.D.T. can cause all kinds of

health complications?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, there is a Vector

Control  Unit in my Ministry headed by a specialist

officer. They have experimented with a certain type

of  oil which is slightly different from D.D.T.  We

are  using this new type of oil. I cannot give  the

Member for Whampoa more details about this, but  if

he  likes  he  can file a question so  that  I  can

answer him. We are trying to go away from D.D.T. to

another type of oil, not only because D.D.T. is not

good  for  health, but because it  also  makes  the

larvae more resistant. They become more rugged and,

therefore, more difficult to kill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs. P. Govindaswamy and Yeo Choo Kok.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, Hawkers' Superintendent,

I  wish  to  bring to the notice of this House  the

nuisance  and the difficulty caused by the  hawkers

in  my  constituency. There are about  100  hawkers

doing  business  along Tai Thong Crescent,  by  the

side  of  MacPherson Market. In the mornings  these

hawkers  obstruct the flow of traffic,  and  it  is

impossible for vehicles to pass through  Tai  Thong

Crescent.  This  problem has been  brought  to  the

notice  of the Hawkers Department a few years  ago,

with  the  request that they resite the hawkers  or

allot them pitches near the market,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



in  the backlanes and sidelanes and along one  side

of  Tai  Thong Crescent. In this way they need  not

lose  their livelihood, and the traffic  also  need

not  be  obstructed. From time to time  the  Potong

Pasir Citizens' Consultative Committee and I myself

have written to the Hawkers Department, and once to

the Parliamentary Secretary about this problem, but

without any result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry take steps to allot proper

spaces  or pitches to these hawkers, and to  settle

this  matter  soon without causing any hardship  to

them?  From time to time the reason given  for  not

taking  action  to solve the problem  is  that  the

Hawkers  Department has priorities  and  that  this

case does not deserve first consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I brought up the hawker

problem  in the last budget debate, and I  have  to

bring it up again today. In the cleared areas  when

the hawkers slightly obstruct the road, the Hawkers

Department  takes legal action against  them.  But

you  find  that  no legal action is  taken  against

hawkers  in  many areas which are still  uncleared,

and  these hawkers make more profits and do not pay

licence  fees.  I  am  not  speaking  against   the

officials  concerned for not taking action  against

the  hawkers. All I am asking is that,  until  such

time  as the whole of the republic is considered  a

cleared  area,  the  hawkers in the  cleared  areas

should  be  treated  more  leniently  as  they  are

legitimate hawkers, and they possess licences to do

business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the hawker problem is

quite  a  difficult one. We heard  the  Member  for

Potong   Pasir   saying  that   the   hawkers   are

obstructing traffic, and therefore action  must  be

taken. And then we heard from the Member for  Anson

that,  although they may obstruct traffic slightly,

we  should  not  take action. So I am  between  the

devil and --

traffic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I can understand the

point of the Member for Potong Pasir. In order  not

to take action per se, but to resite them, you must

have a piece of land or site. And he also complains

of  the delay. The delay is because it is not  easy

to  get  another  site where  you  can  resite  the

hawkers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I have suggested other sites.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Are they suitable? May I say

this  then to put the mind of the Member for Potong

Pasir  at rest: something is being done about  this

problem. Although, as he has rightly said, we  have

priorities,  he  can  be  sure  that  the   Hawkers

Department will effect the resiting of the  hawkers

at  Tai  Thong  Crescent in June 1971.  It  is  the

intention of the Department to resite them  into  a

newly  paved  back-lane and  sidelanes  around  the

MacPherson Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Anson, he suggested

something which quite astounded me. He said that no

action  or  very  little  action  should  be  taken

against  hawkers  in  a  cleared  constituency.  My

rational mind says that if you clear a constituency

of  hawkers and resite them properly, you must  not

allow other unlicensed hawkers to take the place of

those who have been resited.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> May I just say this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> No, I did not mention

unlicensed hawkers. I spoke about licensed hawkers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I agree. If licensed hawkers

have been properly resited in a certain place,  but

you  allow one of them to go back to the old place,

the  others will say, "If you allow him to go  back

to the old place, why cannot you allow the rest?"



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I only said that these

licensed hawkers obstruct the road a little bit. My

point is: these hawkers have limited space, and  if

they  move their pitches a little bit, then  action

is taken against them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> If you allow him a little

bit, you can allow him a little bit more, say,  two

inches, three feet, or one mile.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad

that  the  Minister has promised  to  resite  these

hawkers  in June - after two years. I beg leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $34,052,490 for Head 1203 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1301 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr N. Govindasamy)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in our budget for the next financial year there is no increase in taxation or the imposition of new taxation. This is a very judicious financial policy, because it will not impose any additional burden on our people. This shows that our Government is looking after the

livelihood of our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should not overlook the fact that

there  has  been a general rise in  the  prices  of

various  goods recently. This has greatly  affected

the  livelihood  of the people in  the  middle  and

lower  income groups. In order to get the facts  to

substantiate  my  argument, I have personally  made

inquiries  into  the increase in  prices  of  daily

necessities. Let me quote the prices of the items obtaining in the past and compare them with  those

obtaining  in January 1971. We all know  there  are

several  items of daily necessities.  Although  the

price  of rice has not gone up, the price of  bread

has  recently  been  increased.  Bread  can  be   a

substitute for rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me mention the price of oil.

Formerly, cooking oil cost $3.80 a tin. Now  it  is

$4.20  a  tin. Salt now costs 15 cents  more.  Bean

sauce  now  costs 90 cents per bottle. Formerly  it

was  80 cents per bottle. One tin of condensed milk

cost 40 cents before. Now it is 45 cents per tin. A

five-katty tin of biscuits formerly cost $3.00. Now

it  costs  $3.30 per tin. Lean meat cost $2.50  per

katty before. Now it is $3.30 per katty. There  are

also  other  imported  goods, for  example,  frozen

beef,  which formerly cost $2.60 per katty. Now  it

costs $4.40 per katty. This is quite a considerable

rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just enumerating these few items to enable

the  Minister  and his Parliamentary  Secretary  to

understand   the  situation  better.  Perhaps   the

Ministry  of Finance has not been very  careful  in

compiling  the  data. It may well be  that  it  has

gathered the data from hearsay and, as a result, it

is  not well informed. The increases in prices have

a  great influence on our people, especially  those

in  the lower income group. Take, for instance,  an

employee  working  in  a  small  office  earning  a

monthly  salary  of $200 and with  many  mouths  to

feed. His livelihood will be made very difficult as

a  result of these increases in prices. Out of  the

$200, he will have to spend $40 on house rent,  and

in   addition  he  will  have  to  spend  money  on

education,   food   and  other   items   of   daily

necessities. How is he going to make ends meet?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the reason for the increase in prices in

recent  months? We should find out the real  reason

so  that we can deal with this problem. I hope  the

Minister  will not take a cannot-careless attitude.

On  the contrary, he should take positive steps  to

remedy  the  situation by curbing the  increase  in

prices.  I  agree with the Minister  of  State  for

Finance  when  he suggested that we should  form  a

Consumers'  Association. A Consumers'  Association,

comprising people of the middle and lower  classes,

can  see to it that the merchants and traders  will

not  overcharge the prices of goods. In  this  way,

the  consumers  can bargain with  the  traders  and

maintain the prices of goods at a reasonable level.

I appreciate the suggestion and I hope the Ministry

of  Finance  will  take  steps  to  assist  in  the

formation   of   a   Consumers'  Association.   For

instance, the Ministry of Finance can be  of  great

assistance in the field of administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to suggest to the Minister that he

should  set up a Price Control Committee.  Although

he  may  say that he is not prepared to  do  so,  I

would like him to reconsider my suggestion, because

I   think   a  Price  Control  Committee  is   very

essential. This committee can be charged  with  the

duty  of  not  only collecting data on prices,  but

also  determining whether or not certain  increases

in  prices  are justified. The committee  can  also

deal  with  merchants  who  increase  their  prices

unreasonably.   In  fact,  the   price   of   daily

necessities  does not depend on supply  and  demand

only.  Sometimes it is due to personal manipulation

and other extraneous circumstances. For instance, a

few  weeks ago when Parliament was about to sit  to

debate  the  present budget, certain  irresponsible

merchants  spread  rumours among  the  people  that

certain  goods  would  be taxed  and  that  certain

tinned   foodstuffs  would  also  be  taxed.   Even

Ovaltine and rice would be further taxed. All these

rumours  caused fluctuations in the market  prices,

especially  the  prices of daily necessities.  Some

irresponsible   merchants   made   use   of    this

opportunity to increase the prices



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



of  certain goods. If we can set up a Price Control

Committee   to   control  the   prices   of   daily

necessities and to supervise the market, the prices

of  daily  necessities will  be  more  stable.  Our

people will be able to live a more stable life  and

they  will  not  be subject to the fluctuations  in

market prices. I hope the Minister will consider my

suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after going

through the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure of

Singapore  for the current financial year,  I  find

that  I  am more confused about the actual staffing

position in the various Ministries and departments.

Let  me  illustrate my point by  referring  to  the

Ministry   of  Labour,  for  example,   where   the

incumbents  of  various  positions,  from  that  of

Permanent Secretary to those of executive officers,

are  not substantive holders of the posts. They are

merely  acting in the posts. What is most  puzzling

to  me is that some of them are acting in posts two

grades  above  their substantive grades.  If  these

acting appointments were made for a short period of

time,  it would have been more understandable.  But

the  strange fact is that these acting appointments

are  often of several months' duration and, without

exaggeration, they may be said to be made for life.

Such a situation is obviously very unhealthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said of practically all the other

departments in the Singapore civil service. Even in

the  Ministry of Finance, I believe there are  more

"actors" than substantive holders of the posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service has many types of employees,

namely,  open-vote employees, temporary  employees,

acting   employees,  officiating   employees,   and

supernumerary  employees. Open-vote  employees  are

also  known to be temporary. However, some of these

open-vote employees have been in service  for  more

than  30  years  and they are still  known  by  the

nomenclature.  Temporary and officiating  employees

are either acting for some other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



incumbents,   who   themselves   are   acting    or

officiating for others or are officiating in  their

own  right, but in both cases for long periods.  In

addition,  we  have supernumerary posts  filled  by

people who have no business to be there at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When can we expect the Ministry of Finance to

streamline   the   civil  service   so   that   all

appointments are filled by permanent employees  who

are  more likely to give better service, since  one

of  the main grouses and frustrations of our  civil

servants is that, although they may be good  enough

"actors"  for  many years, they  are  not  able  to

qualify  for the substantive appointments in  which

they  have  acted.  If they are  not  suitable  for

substantive  appointments, it is not  fair  to  ask

them to act for long periods. Perhaps we should try

to  induce more suitably qualified persons to apply

for  civil service appointments. The salary  scales

for  senior  civil  servants are not  competitively

attractive and their working conditions leave  much

to be desired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke about this aspect during the debate on the

Government's financial policy statement, and I  was

not properly answered. A committee was set up on an

ad  hoc basis to revise the salary structure of the

open-vote  daily-rated employees. Another committee

was  set up to look into the salaries of the Police

Force. And yet a third committee was set up to look

into   the   salaries  of  senior  civil  servants.

Yesterday  we were told by the Minister for  Social

Affairs that the salaries of the Fire Brigade staff

and their terms and conditions of service will also

be  looked  into after they have settled  with  the

Police  Force. The Ministry of Education  is  again

looking  into the salary structure of the teachers.

Are  we  going to continue to look into the  salary

structures  and  working conditions  department  by

department?  I  believe it is high  time  that  the

Ministry of Finance gave sufficient thought to  the

whole structure of the civil service and drew up  a

comprehensive programme for streamlining the  civil

service  in  respect  of the salary  structure  and

working  conditions if we are to have an  efficient

civil service. A solution that is framed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



in  a  haphazard manner and in isolation from other

considerations is worse than no solution at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned all this quickly because

perhaps the Minister has only ten minutes to  reply

and  I  sincerely  hope  he will  delve  into  this

problem and not into the business of the high  cost

of living, because, however important it may be, it

has been raised before.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

you  will recall that on the 16th of this  month  I

asked the Minister for Education about the progress

of  the  current negotiations between the Teachers'

Unions  and  his Ministry and the response  of  the

Ministry  to the teachers' proposal. The  reply  of

the  Minister for Education was that, as far as his

Ministry  was concerned, they had already submitted

their  proposals  to the Ministry of  Finance  some

time  in December last year. This is late March.  I

would like to ask the Minister for Finance when  we

can  expect an answer from his Ministry and whether

he  will  personally look into the matter. He  must

excuse me if I have got not much confidence in  the

civil servants of his Ministry for two reasons. One

reason is that, as the Member for Telok Blangah has

pointed out, they are in acting capacities and  are

not  confident or competent enough to make  a  very

serious  study and make sound judgments on some  of

the  proposals  that have been put forward  by  the

Ministry of Education. The other reason is  that  I

myself  have  personally  lost  confidence  in  the

manner   in   which  the  Treasury  handles   civil

servants'  problems with regard  to  conditions  of

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to illustrate my point, I quote the example

of   one  teacher's  problem  on  the  question  of

anomaly.  On 1st May, 1958, a new salary scale  was

introduced  for  teachers who  joined  the  service

after this date. This scale is inferior to the  old

scale.  The  stipulation of the  Treasury  and  the

Education  Ministry was that those who  joined  the

service after that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



date would be placed on the new scale and those who

were in the service before that date would get  the

old  scale.  And today we have teachers who  joined

the education service before 1st May, 1958, and who

were  put on the new scale. This problem was raised

with  the  Education  Ministry  years  ago  by  the

Teachers'  Unions and we received  a  reply  saying

that  the matter had been referred to the Treasury,

but up to now there has been no reply from the Trea

sury.  This is one example to illustrate  my  point

about  the  very inefficient manner  in  which  the

Treasury  is  handling some of the civil  servants'

problems  with  regard to terms and  conditions  of

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to round off my request, I would seek the

Minister  for Finance's personal attention  to  the

teachers'  proposals  so that  the  matter  can  be

expedited.  He will appreciate that on the  1st  of

September,  1970, the then Minister for  Education,

Mr  Ong  Pang Boon, made an announcement  inviting

the Teachers' Unions to negotiate with the Ministry

of  Education.  The first official meeting  was  on

10th  October,  1970.  All that  the  teachers  are

asking  for is some response to the proposals  that

were put forward at the meeting. Surely this is not

too  much  to expect from the Ministry  of  Finance

when   the   Ministry  of  Education  has   already

submitted  its  recommendations  on  the  teachers'

proposals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have the same feeling as the Member for Moulmein

has  in regard to the officials of the Ministry  of

Finance.  They are slow as snails in their  working

efficiency.  I  hope  the  Minister  himself   will

supervise  them  and  ask  them  to  expedite   the

question of teachers' salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask the

Minister one question. When we were discussing  the

question  of  fisheries, the Minister for  Law  and

National  Development  said that  the  question  of

pioneer  status came under the Ministry of  Finance

and  not under his Ministry. I want to know why the

pioneer status for the deep-sea fishing industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



was  withdrawn. The Minister for Law and,  National

Development  has asked me to refer this  matter  to

the  Minister  for  Finance. So I  am  taking  this

opportunity to do so. I notice that in the  Finance

Minister's  budget  speech, he  mentioned  that  he

would encourage deep-sea fishing. If he intends  to

encourage  it, why was the pioneer status  for  the

deep-sea fishing industry withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hon, you have 10 minutes to

reply to all the points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, because of the shortage of time, I am

afraid  I  will  not  be able  to  answer  all  the

questions. I will take the suggestion of the Member

for Telok Blangah that I should not concentrate too

much on the rise in the cost of living. This is not

because  I do not consider it important.  In  fact,

this is one of the many problems that we shall have

to  consider during this year. Perhaps I should say

to  the Member for Sembawang that I do not live  on

fresh  air  and sunshine, and that I  also  consume

some of the commodities that he has mentioned, like

rice, bread, oil, salt and so on. My wife tells  me

that  there  has been some increase  in  prices  of

goods that she buys.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Good show!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> As far as the increases in some

other   cases  are  concerned,  they  may  not   be

justifiable. We have not agreed to these increases.

For  example, in the case of bread, the  impression

that  has  been  given that we  have  accepted  the

increase  in the price of bread is not correct.  We

have asked why there has been this increase, and we

have found that even if there is an increase in raw

materials, it does not justify an increase of  five

cents.  There  may be an increase in the  price  of

flour  which might justify a one-cent increase.  We

are looking into all these matters and we shall try

to do what we can.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I do not think we can accept

the  idea  of price control, because the experience

of  people who lived with price control just  after

the   war  should  make  it  clear  that  this   is

detrimental to the supply that is coming on to  the

market at reasonable prices. But we will give  such

help  as  we  can in the collection of  statistics,

although there is some doubt about the figures that

we  produce. I think our inspectors in  the  market

are  just  as  able to find out about  prices.  The

Trade  Division  and  the  Singapore  Institute  of

Standards  and Industrial Research will  look  into

the  quality  and nature of the materials  that  go

into the finished products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come to the matter of the civil

service. I am in some sympathy with the Member  for

Telok  Blangah when he says he is confused  by  the

many appointments - acting, officiating, temporary,

supernumerary, etc. These, of course, are not there

because  we  like to confuse Members or  ourselves.

But  they  are  just the result  of  a  very  rapid

increase in the number of civil servants. In  fact,

50  per  cent  of the administrative officers  have

less   than   three   years'  service.   They   are

probationers.  In  the  circumstances,  it  is  not

possible for the posts to be filled by officers who

have  the  requisite experience and qualifications.

In  1959, our civil service had 1,255 Division  One

posts. Today there are 3,907 Division One posts, an

increase of more than three times, and we  are  not

able to keep up with the expansion of the services.

Therefore,  we  have  had  to  resort   to   acting

appointments.  Where  these appointments  are  more

than  two grades higher, then the persons who  fill

them are said to be officiating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supernumerary appointments are, of course,

necessary.  Under  various circumstances,  officers

going on very long leave or going on leave prior to

retirement, or officers who are understudying other

officers   before  taking  over  the  duties,   and

officers  in excess of requirements naturally  will

have  to be shown in the estimates, especially when

they  go  off  on national service.  These  various

designations are there because there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



a  need  to  show  them  as such,  rather  than  as

permanent  officers. Of course, we  would  like  to

have  a  civil service filled with officers of  the

right    quality   and   calibre   in   substantive

appointments, and we are trying our best to do what

we can to train our civil servants so that they can

be fully qualified for their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the salary scales and conditions of

service and their determination, this is one of the

important matters we have to look into in order  to

get a full complement of substantive holders of the

posts,  and  we  will  give  consideration  to  the

various  salary  scales.  Consideration  of   these

scales  is  being  done.  In  fact,  it  has   been

mentioned  that we are looking into the  scales  of

daily-rated  workers, the Police  Force,  the  Fire

Brigade  and so on. So some action is being  taken,

perhaps not as fast as the Members would like us to

take,  but we are looking into these salary scales.

In  view  of  the shortage of staff  which  I  have

mentioned, and the fact that we do not always  have

people in the grades doing the work of looking into

the  salary  scales,  I think  our  civil  service,

instead of being criticised, ought to be given some

praise for the work that they are doing and for the

very large amount of overtime which they are doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Ministry of Education and the

teachers'  proposals, this is not  something  which

has been set aside. I hope that after consideration

of  the budget has been gone through, we shall  get

in touch with the Ministry of Education and come to

some  arrangement  on the new salary  scales  which

have been under examination.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong asked why fisheries are not

pioneer  industries. The reason for this is  fairly

simple.  The fishing industry is really a very  old

industry, if not the oldest industry in the  world.

It   certainly  is  not  a  modern  industry,   and

therefore  we did not think that it was appropriate

that  it should come under pioneer status. We  wish

to  encourage  fisheries. In fact,  we  make  large

amounts of finance available to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



anyone  who  wishes to engage in deep-sea  fishing.

The   loans  which  have  been  approved   by   the

Development  Bank for some of the  industries  have

been  to  the extent of 80 per cent of the cost  of

the assets.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mr Hon.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I was not criticising the

civil service but the Ministry of Finance. Officers

have  been asked to act for umpteen years and  they

are doing a good job. This is quite clear. I am not

criticising  the officers who are acting.  If  they

are  found  to be suitable to act for a  number  of

years,  they should be found suitable to  hold  the

job  substantively.  As  far  as  I  am  concerned,

officiating means somebody officiating a  marriage.

There  must  be a tremendous shortage  of  suitable

persons in the civil service if officers are  asked

to  officiate  two  steps above  their  substantive

appointments. This shortage, as I mentioned earlier

when  we  debated  the Minister's financial  policy

statement,  is  due to the fact  that  we  are  not

getting  the  appropriate persons  into  the  civil

service,   as   we  are  not  offering  competitive

salaries  and  attractive terms and  conditions  of

service.  Therefore,  my point  is  that  there  is

justification  for  a  salary revision,  which  the

Government  accepts, and as a result ad hoc  salary

revision  committees have been set  up  for  daily-rated  and senior civil servants, the Police Force,

the  Fire  Brigade and the teachers.  I  think  the

Minister  accepts that the cause  for  revision  is

there. My point is, why not do it once and for  all

for  the  whole civil service instead of department

by department and division by division?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in virtually

every  country  civil service salaries  lag  behind

commercial and industrial salaries, even more so in

a  situation of very rapid development as  we  find

ourselves  in.  The danger that we  are  confronted

with  here  in  Singapore today  is  that  the  top

calibre personnel in the civil service may be drawn

away towards the commercial and industrial sectors,

leading to shortages of the kind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



which  are  very serious indeed, namely,  top-level

personnel.  In  such  a situation,  there  are  two

things  which can be done. One is a quick  revision

of   salary,  but  this  cannot  be   done   to   a

considerable  extent,  especially  in  the  present

context  of  our general wage restraint policy  for

industry  and  the commercial sector as  well.  The

other  possibility, taken in conjunction with  some

revision  of salary, is rapid promotion of  people.

We  have  to  get away from the kind  of  mentality

which  says that, because I took 20 years to become

a   Permanent  Secretary,  therefore  anybody   who

becomes a Permanent Secretary must take 20 years to

get  up  there. Why cannot a person do it  in  five

years  or seven years if he has the ability and  is

prepared to work hard? Let us change this  kind  of

mentality. Promote people rapidly. If they have the

ability, put them up there. If you put them  in  an

acting capacity for three months or six months  and

they  have shown themselves to be capable,  confirm

them  in their positions. I have argued on at least

two  occasions for the upgrading of the quality  of

the  civil  service, especially in respect  of  the

upper level and the professional staff. Our economy

is  getting  more sophisticated, and  in  order  to

understand  it, to comprehend it and to service  it

adequately,   we   need  to  have   technical   and

professional people to monitor and service industry

and  commerce. In order to do this, we have  to  be

prepared  to  pay the price for people  with  these

qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we pay Master's Degree holders two

increments  above the ordinary point of entry,  and

four  increments in respect of Ph.D.s. It seems  to

me   that  it  is  just  ridiculous  to  give   two

increments  for a Master's degree and  four  for  a

Ph.D, degree,  because, first of  all,  there  are

considerable earnings which a person has to give up

when  he  pursues a Master's degree, which normally

takes  at least one year, if not two; and  a  Ph.D.

degree  takes  at  least two years,  if  not  four,

depending on which country he goes to. In addition,

there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



considerable  effort behind the  acquisition  of  a

higher  degree. It also presupposes a certain  high

enough  level of qualifications in respect  of  the

basic  degree. All things taken together, Sir,  the

indication is that we need substantially more  than

two   increments  for  the  Master's   degree   and

substantially more than four increments for the Ph.

D. degree, and also rapid promotion for both.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, nobody cares very much

for the civil servants because they cannot run away

from a department after having served there for  20

to  25 years. The professional officers can all run

away  because they can get higher salaries outside,

but   the   poor  junior  officers,  with  whatever

salaries  they receive, will have to remain  there.

Now  legally  qualified  officers  also  come  into

Government   service  and  therefore   long-service

people  have  difficulty in getting promotion.  The

Minister  for  Finance must consider  revising  the

salaries of the civil servants because they are the

backbone of the Government. If they work hard,  the

Government will also get a better name. Because the

poor  civil servants cannot vent their grouses,  we

tend  to leave them out. Perhaps the Minister  will

consider the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I asked a

question just now, but the Minister appears not  to

have  clearly  understood  it.  It  is  about   the

establishment   of  a  consumers'  association.   I

requested the Ministry of Finance to take steps  to

assist   in   the   formation   of   a   consumers'

association, and the Minister of State for  Finance

himself mentioned this possibility. I think this is

definitely  a very good thing to do. We would  like

to set up a consumers' association to stabilise the

prices  of  our  goods. I did ask the  Ministry  of

Finance   to   assist   in   its   formation    and

administration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> As the Minister of State for

Finance  has already said that he will be  prepared

to give assistance to the consumers' association, I

think I need say nothing more on this. We will give

assistance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to answer the comments of the Member

for  Telok Blangah in which he blamed the  Ministry

of  Finance,  but  not the civil service,  for  the

present  condition of the civil service  and  their

terms  and  conditions of service. As  far  as  the

acting appointments are concerned, and their  being

done   away   with,   this  is   not   within   our

dispensation.  The  substantive filling  of  posts,

especially  the superscale posts, is a  matter  for

the  Public Service Commission. Unless it considers

that   the   civil  servant  can  fill   the   post

substantively,  the only course of  action  we  can

take  is  to  fill  it  on an acting  basis  or  an

officiating basis or a temporary basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to quick solutions to the civil

servants' salaries, of course, it is very  easy  to

suggest that we should do this in a very rapid way.

I  suppose the most rapid way is to give everyone a

10  per  cent increase. On this basis, we can  then

really get rid of the committees inquiring into the

salary  scales of daily-rated workers,  the  senior

civil  servants and the staff of the Fire  Brigade!

Perhaps  we should take some of the blame  for  not

dealing  with these matters as rapidly as possible,

but I suppose the test of any Minister for Finance,

or any of his officials, is whether or not they are

accused  of  giving in too easily to  requests  for

salary increases!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa suggested that it would be

necessary  to give salary increases for a  Master's

degree  and a Ph. D. degree beyond the two to  four

increments that have already been conceded. On this

point,  we  must  consider not  whether  the  paper

qualifications  are a Master's, a  Ph.  D's  or  an

Honours  degree, but whether the applicant  or  the

present holder can fill the job, and on this  there

is  no  other test than actual performance  of  the

job. For quality in the civil service, it would  be

very  desirable that we should be able to pay civil

servants  a  remuneration commensurate  with  their

value,  but  the difficulty in dealing  with,  say,

4,000  senior civil servants - that was the  figure

of  Division One officers which I gave is  that  we

cannot compete with the commercial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



firms  which want only one or two officers and  can

therefore  pay  10 per cent above whatever  may  be

offered  in the civil service. Even if we  increase

the senior civil servants' salaries by 20 per cent,

the  commercial firms can always up this by another

20 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Give them rapid promotion!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Well, that is being done. Perhaps

there  has  been  some complaint  that  we  do  not

consider  the  seniority principle too  sacrosanct,

and   we  have  sometimes  promoted  fairly   young

officers  to  Permanent  Secretary  grade,  if  not

substantively,  at least to act  in  the  Permanent

Secretary's post even though they have not  had  20

years  of service. If there are officers with  five

to   seven  years'  service  and  with  outstanding

ability,  and if they can perform the  job  of  the

Permanent  Secretary, I, as Minister  for  Finance,

will  have  absolutely no objection to their  being

rapidly  promoted. I think I have answered most  of

the questions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Minister

has  missed  the point regarding the two increments

for  the  Master's degree and four  for  the  Ph.D.

degree. I was not at any time implying that holding

a  Master's  degree  or a Ph. D. degree  alone  is

sufficient  to indicate quality. All I  was  saying

was   that   you   must  take  into   account   the

marketability of such degree holders. If you do not

pay them a sufficient number of increments, you are

not  likely  to  be able to attract better  quality

degree  holders into the civil service. You end  up

with  a mediocre one, from Timbuctoo or some  other

unknown university.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also vent my frustration, which I am

sure   my  fellow  Backbenchers  also  share,  that

Ministers  seem to be in the habit of  passing  the

ball  from  one  to  the other  -  from  Health  to

Finance,  now  from Finance to the  Public  Service

Commission.   Sir,   may  we  know   the   ultimate

repository of power that we may have recourse to to

get some of these things done?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Perhaps I can answer the last

one, i.e., passing the buck or the ball. As far  as

the  Public Service Commission is concerned, it  is

the ultimate authority. I do not think there is any

question of its passing the buck any further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The buck stops there!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Yes, the buck stops there. I do

not  think there is any question about it. This was

the decision of Members of Parliament here when the

Public  Service Commission Ordinance was passed.  I

still think that however much we like to be able to

promote the officers, the neutrality of the  Public

Service  Commission  is something  which  we  still

accept and would like to see continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Master's and Ph. D. degrees, it has been

considered    that   two   and   four    increments

respectively would be sufficient, because it  is  a

matter  of  opinion whether or not we  are  getting

enough  Ph.D.s. But we have quite a  number.  Those

whom  we send overseas on study courses, when  they

come back, are usually bound to the Government  for

three  or five, or even eight years in some  cases.

Our  problem really is not to recruit them into the

service  but rather, after they have been recruited

into the service, to retain them in the face of the

blandishments of commerce and industry. I say  that

is  very  difficult because the private sector  can

always  pay a little bit more than whatever we  may

want  to pay them. The final test really is whether

the  man likes the administrative work in the civil

service  or whether he wants to go outside and  try

his  luck  in commerce and industry. Perhaps  there

are  very big rewards obtainable there, but at  the

same  time  there is the great risk that his  paper

qualifications may not, after all, make him a  good

industrialist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, on the question of

passing   the   buck  with  regard   to   promotion

exercises, I accept the explanation of the Minister

for Finance that the buck has got to be passed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



the  Public Service Commission, because it  is  the

ultimate authority in determining the promotion  of

officers. But there are other civil service matters

which   the  Public  Service  Commission   is   not

concerned with, and the buck actually ends  at  the

Ministry  of  Finance. Therefore, the  Ministry  of

Finance  is  responsible for, shall I say,  messing

things up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate my point, I will just quote an

example  of what happened in the Education service.

Not  everybody  knows that there is a  shortage  of

teachers,  but  everybody knows  that  there  is  a

shortage  of  graduate teachers.  Sometime  between

advertisements for teachers, graduates applied  for

posts in the Education Ministry, and the reply  was

that  there  was no vacancy because  certain  civil

service  procedures had to be observed to determine

the  vacancies. I think it will take me a long time

to  explain how they work. In fact, I myself do not

quite  understand how they work. They have  a  one-track   mind.  This  is  just  to  illustrate   the

ridiculous  situation that exists.  You  know  very

well that there is a shortage of graduate teachers,

and  yet  you get a reply saying that there  is  no

vacancy.   And  they  quote  so  many   rules   and

stipulations to prove that there is no shortage  of

teachers.  This  proves the  point  that  when  the

responsibility  is  clearly with  some  department,

they mess things up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come back to the other point which I

mentioned  earlier but which was not answered,  and

that  is the stipulation laid down by the Education

Ministry  (of  course, with  the  approval  of  the

Finance  Ministry) that teachers who joined  on  or

after  1st  May, 1958 would receive a salary  scale

lower  than  that given to those who joined  before

that  date.  The old salary scale is  much  better.

There  are  teachers who joined the service  before

1st May, 1958, and so according to the stipulation,

they  should  get the old scale, but  instead  they

were  given the new scale. And when representations

were made to the Education Ministry, they said  the

Finance   Ministry  was  responsible.  The  Finance

Ministry in turn said the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



Education  Ministry was responsible. This  went  on

for  years. What happens then to the teachers? This

is  only one example  to show how helpless the civil

servants are.  When they  want  to  seek  redress for their grievances in matters

relating to service conditions, I do not

think the Ministry of Finance can pass the buck to anybody else,

because the buck ends there. I think this manner of handling problems

relating to service conditions and other matters has

reach such a very unhealthy level

that a log of dissatisfaction and

unhappiness is caused, apart from the poor salary scales of the civil service.

I think it is because of this situation that civil servants are just not satisfied

with the answers they get for their

grievances. They get lost. They are

helpless. They do not know where to

go to. This passing of the buck from

one Ministry to the Finance Ministry

conveniently ignores the civil servants'

problems. So unless the Finance Ministry takes the

buck and handles the

problems more intelligently - rather than with a one-track mind -

I think such problems will never be solved. But

if there is a more efficient and more intelligent manner of handling

civil service problems, many of the grievances will be removed, and there will be greater

contentment in the civil service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, first of all, I do not know

why the Ministry of Finance should be blamed even for

graduate teacher vacancies not being

filled. Quite obviously there are vacancies,

and the Minister for Education, I

believe, has made it quite clear that he cannot get

enough teachers. And if the

Member for Moulmein has got any

graduate teachers knocking at the door,

I guarantee that they will be let in.

There will be no passing of the buck in

this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the stipulation laid down by

the Ministry of Education, I am afraid

I do not know much about the circumstances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



in which the old and the new salary  scales

were  formulated.  But  if it  will give him any satisfaction, I will look  into

this  and see whether it is the Ministry of  Finance  that  is

responsible for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, will Minister consider

setting  up  a Personnel Department to look after the interests

of  the civil  servants,  as  this  will  prevent  the  passing  of  the

buck?  This  is important, because I have noticed

from the civil service structure in the Ministry of Finance

that  there is only one Executive Officer (I think  he  is

acting  as  Higher Executive Officer) looking after the interests

of about 13,000 daily-rated employees. The civil servants do

not  know where to  take  their problems to. If they take them to the  Ministry

concerned, they  are asked to refer to the Ministry of Finance, and they  do

not  know whom they  should  approach there. I think it is about time the

Government prevented  further frustrations of the

civil servants and set  up a  Personnel Department in the Ministry of Finance

to look into the  problems

of the numerous  civil servants that we have. Will

the Minister consider the possibility of setting up such a department?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I think the Member for Telok Blangah is not really aware

of  the  organisation  of the civil service. Surely

we   have   a   Personnel Department; in  fact,  it

is    the   Establishment Branch of the Ministry of

Finance,     and      the Permanent Secretary is in

charge.  He has a  number of  Deputy Secretaries in

charge     of     service conditions.  There  is  a

Career   and  Development Officer  whom we recently

appointed to take  charge of  the training of civil

servants.  The   question which   has  been   asked

about      the     Higher Executive   Officer    in

charge  of  the  Training Centre  -  I do not  know

whether this is the  same matter - but anyway I can

categorically assure  the Member that the Personnel

Department and  personnel matters  are  not   being

handled    at   Executive Officer     or     Higher

Executive Officer level.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

the  Minister  for Finance when was the  last  time

that rules and regulations governing the terms  and

conditions of the entire civil service were revised

or  overhauled? It seems to me that some  of  these

rules  must be out-dated. Although they were  meant

to  prevent  abuses and so on, they do,  in  actual

fact,  considerably tie the hands of  the  brighter

people, people with more entrepreneurial energies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, on the question of the

Personnel  Department, it is true  that  there  are

persons  or  bodies  in  this  department  handling

personnel matters and so on. But I think it is  not

so   much  a  question  of  bodies  handling  these

problems, but the approach adopted by the -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sia, what do you mean by

"bodies"? Do you mean human beings?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Persons, yes. The Minister

replied  to  my  colleague, the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah,  that there is such a department with  the

Permanent   Secretary   in   charge,   and   Deputy

Secretaries and so on. It is accepted. But I  think

it  is  the  manner  of  handling  these  personnel

problems.  And  as  has  been  pointed  out  by  my

colleague,  the  Member for Whampoa,  some  of  the

rules  and regulations are obsolete. I think  there

should   be  some  adoption  of  modern  management

techniques, personnel relationship. I suggest  that

we follow some of the private firms where they have

much  less  employees, and they adopt very  modern,

close   personnel   relations,   human   relations,

absolutely important, not bureaucratic, impersonal.

I  was told that in the civil service they are just

digits -



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Bodies!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Bodies. I think it is a

matter of revamping the whole set-up and adopting a

new  approach  in  keeping  with  the  progress  of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, this is an important

issue.  Fortunately for me, Sir, I have dealt  with

the  Ministry  of  Finance on grievances  of  civil

servants,  daily-rated  employees,  the  lot.   The

Minister  is  right  - they have  an  Establishment

Branch  where a Deputy Secretary, who is in  charge

of  so  many  other matters, is also in  charge  of

personnel problems. When I said that there is  only

an  Executive  Officer, acting as Higher  Executive

Officer, who handles the problems of 13,000  daily-rated  employees, I meant it, Sir. That is a  fact.

They  do  not  have a Personnel Department  in  the

Ministry of Finance as such. The Estimates  do  not

provide  for  it.  But there  are  persons  in  the

Establishment Branch who, when grievances are taken

up,  deal with them. As the Member for Moulmein has

pointed  out,  what  we want is a  department  that

looks after nothing else but this, and a department

which  has sufficient people to handle the  day-to-day  problems  that  arise in such  a  large  civil

service   as  ours,  perhaps  even  to  match   the

personnel departments in the private sector. In the

long run, Sir, this will be a worthwhile investment

on  the part of the Government in that it will have

a  less  frustrated civil service. Although it  may

not  be  possible  to remove all the  frustrations,

perhaps  we  could  have  a less  frustrated  civil

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> The human touch!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> First of all. I think the

question of when the rules and regulations  of  the

civil service were revised -



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report that the Committee of

Supply has made further progress on the

Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st April,

1971, to 31st March, 1972, and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.
