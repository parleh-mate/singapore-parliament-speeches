<div align="center"><b>SETTING UP OF LOCAL CORPORATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Public participation in industrial investment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if  the  Government  will  encourage   the

setting up of local corporations, public companies,

etc.,  so  as to enable the people of Singapore  at

large  to participate in industrial investments  in

the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir,  it  is the policy of Government to  encourage

the setting up of local corporations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>ESTABLISHMENT OF A CASINO IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  (a)  whether Government approval  will  be

given   for  the  establishment  of  a  casino   in

Singapore;  and (b) whether the Government  in  its

objective to boost tourism has also considered that

the  establishment of a casino may  lead  to  loose

morals  or even corruption in morals of the  people

of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is difficult for me at

this  stage  to  give a categorical reply  to  this

question,  because  no  firm application  has  been

received by Government for the establishment  of  a

casino  in Singapore. To a great extent, therefore,

my  answer  reflects my personal  thinking  on  the

subject  and also what I believe to be the personal

thinking   of   some  of  my  colleagues   on   the

establishment of a casino in Singapore. To be quite

candid, I am not at all enamoured of this proposal.

I  very  much doubt whether tourists would come  to

Singapore for a gambling spree in a casino. But the

Tourist  Promotion  Board,  who,  after  all,   are

Government's agency for the promotion of tourism in

Singapore, hold a contrary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



view  and  they tell me that they have  received  a

number  of  applications  from  various  syndicates

abroad. My own inclination would be to vote against

this  proposition,  unless it can  be  shown  that,

first,   substantial  benefits  would   accrue   to

Singapore; second, there will be safeguards against

Singapore  citizens making use of this  casino.  In

many   countries   which  allow   casinos   to   be

established, I believe entrance to the  casinos  is

only  by  a foreign passport, and if this condition

can be observed in the casino here and if it can be

shown  that  a  casino will be  of  great  economic

benefit  to Singapore, then perhaps I may relax  my

objections to the establishment of a casino.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, of

course,  there  is  the  danger  of  corruption  of

morals,  which moves me and my colleagues  to  have

these  views  on the establishment of a  casino  in

Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>BOAT RACING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Promotion of sea sports)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Culture and Social Affairs, as a means of promoting

sea-sports  in  the Republic, if he  will  consider

encouraging the authorities or bodies concerned  to

introduce boat racing, usually locally-made  kolehs

or Chinese dragon-boats, among the universities and

colleges  similar  to the traditional  annual  boat

race between Oxford and Cambridge Universities.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, as

Singapore   is  surrounded  by  sea   and   it   is

Government's  policy to encourage our young  people

to  take to the sea to obtain their livelihood,  it

is  in our vital interest to promote sea sports  so

as to make our citizens more sea conscious. Towards

this direction, the Ministry has requested the Port

of  Singapore Authority to resuscitate  its  annual

sea  sports  which had been held annually  for  130

years on New Year's Day (except in 1964 when it was

held on 3rd June) until they were suspended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



in  1965. The sea sports were discontinued after  a

decision  made to have them again on  National  Day

(3rd  June,  1965) had to be cancelled because  the

3rd  of  June was then not a scheduled holiday  for

employees of the Port of Singapore Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once resuscitated, the universities and colleges

will  be encouraged to take part in the sea  sports

by  using  locally-made kolehs  or  Chinese  dragon

boats as suggested by the Member for Mountbatten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although sea sports on a big scale were not

continued   after  3rd  June,  1964,  nevertheless,

isolated  sea sports events were held. Sea regattas

and  kolehs and speedboat races, organised  by  the

Siglap Citizens' Consultative Committee, were  held

in February and November 1966. Similarly, in August

1967,  during Pesta Sukan Week, boat racing  events

were    organised   by   the   Singapore   Yachting

Association,  various  Management  Committees   and

Citizens'  Consultative Committees in the  Republic

as part of the National Day celebrations.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO FISHERMEN AFFECTED BY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FORESHORE RECLAMATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Culture  and Social Affairs whether the  Government

will  consider  financial assistance  to  fishermen

whose  livelihood may be affected by foreshore  and

sea-bed reclamations.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, there are some 180

registered   fishermen   (including    70    kelong

operators) owning about 60 registered boats, living

along that stretch of the east coast which is being

reclaimed  by  the  Housing and Development  Board.

When   reclamation  is  complete,   their   fishing

villages will be rendered about half a mile inland.

Except  for  the 70 kelong fishermen whose  kelongs

(about  20 of them) will have to be taken out,  the

other  fishermen  are  affected  by  the  foreshore

reclamation to the extent that their access to  the

sea will be interfered with.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board will provide

suitable   accesses   at  convenient   points   for

fishermen  to  cross the reclaimed  area  to  reach

their  boats.  The Government is also looking  into

the  matter of providing suitable alternative sites

and  facilities  for the fishermen to  beach  their

boats and to keep their nets and gears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those fishermen who wish to switch to off-shore fishing, the Government will consider

assisting them. However, should there be  any  case

of  hardship  caused  by unemployment  among  these

fishermen, the usual financial aid will be provided

to  such a case under the Public Assistance  Scheme

operated by the Social Welfare Department.

<div align="center"><b>ROUNDABOUT AT TIONG BAHRU ROAD/LOWER DELTA ROAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>JUNCTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development if he will expedite  the

construction  of  a roundabout at the  junction  of

Tiong Bahru Road and Lower Delta Road to facilitate

the  smooth flow of traffic from Jalan Membina into

Tiong Bahru Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, Lower Delta Road is one of the  major

roads   in  the  proposed  road  network  for   the

Alexandra  Road/Tiong Bahru Road area. Lower  Delta

Road  would be extended southwards to link up  with

Jalan Bukit Merah extension, which is another major

road that will lead to the Kampong Bahru/New Bridge

Road area. Traffic lights will be installed at  the

junction  of Lower Delta Road and Tiong Bahru  Road

when  work on the extension to the Lower Delta Road

commences.  Although the original proposal  was  to

put up a roundabout at this junction, after further

investigation it is considered that a traffic light

control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



junction  instead  of a roundabout  would  be  more

efficient for this area. The road reserve  for  the

extension to Lower Delta Road is now being  cleared

and construction work is scheduled for commencement

in early 1968.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   the  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the

Minister for National Development has said just now

that  originally  it  was  proposed  to  put  up  a

roundabout  at  the junction. This was  the  proper

thing to do. But instead he has now said that  they

will be using a traffic light control instead of  a

roundabout. In my view, setting up a traffic  light

control  will be a laughing stock, because it  does

not  meet  the  requirements of the people.  In  my

opinion,  there  is an urgent  need  to  set  up  a

roundabout.

<div align="center"><b>(Street lighting)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Law

proposal  to  install  street  lighting  along  Old

Thomson  Road between 7½ m.s. and 9 m.s. and  along

Sembawang  Road  between 10 m.s. and  11  m.s.,  as

street  lighting could eliminate possible accidents

at  night along those stretches of roads which  are

dark and narrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the short

answer   is  yes.  But  they  are  likely   to   be

implemented  in  the later part  of  the  Five-Year

Development  Plan, in the case of Old Thomson  Road

between   7½  m.s. and  9  ms.,  the  proposal   is

complicated by the fact that it forms part  of  the

Grand Prix circuit.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, as everybody knows, has its origins in

the dramatic events of the last fortnight since the

devaluation  of  Sterling  was  announced, in  its

intent,  the Bill serves a purely technical purpose

of  making  clear  beyond all doubt  that  the  old

currency, which was pegged to Sterling at the value

of  2s.  4d. to a dollar, will circulate as  legal

tender and be exchanged for the new currency at the

appropriate  rates  of exchange  as  determined  by

their  respective  gold  parities,  it  will   also

absolve  the Government from liability  for  losses

sustained by anyone as a result of devaluation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think, in moving this Bill, I should go

beyond the mere technicalities involved. There  has

been much public debate on this subject, some of it

enlightening,  others less so. The whole  issue  of

the devaluation of Sterling and the decision of the

Singapore  Government not to devalue  the  currency

issued  by the Singapore Board of Commissioners  of

Currency would have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



a perfectly straightforward matter but for the fact

that  the old currency circulates side by side with

the new one. The intention of the original Currency

Act, 1967, was to strengthen confidence in the  new

currency as against the old currency, and  one  way

of  doing this would be to legislate that  the  new

currency shall have at least the same value as  the

old currency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history moves in a way which cannot be

foreseen  even by the most discerning persons,  and

the   present  instance  provides  yet   one   more

melancholy example of the limitations of the  human

intellect. For those who drafted the Currency  Act,

1967,  never imagined that in a matter  of  months,

some  of  the  provisions  of  this  Act  would  be

inconsistent  with those sections of  the  Currency

Agreement   of  1961  entered  into   between   the

Governments of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. This

follows from the decision of the Governments not to

devalue the new currency so that parity in terms of

Sterling  increases from 2s.  4d  to  a  dollar  to

rather  more than 2s. 8d., while the value  of  the

old  dollar under the Currency Agreement was backed

at  2s.  4d. Had it not been for the fact that  all

the  three Governments were caught at the  time  of

devaluation literally in the act of changing horses

in  mid-stream,  there would have  been  relatively

little  fuss  over  the  decision  to  retain   our

respective gold parities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hardly avoid the controversy over the

differing  values  of  old and  new  currencies,  a

subject  which  I had hitherto delicately  avoided,

because  when  people  are  in  a  state  of  great

excitement,   they   are   unlikely    to    listen

dispassionately to the voice of reason. I therefore

decided  to  leave the talking on this  subject  to

bolder  spirits  than myself,  thereby  avoiding  a

great  deal  of public wrath. But now tempers  have

subsided  and  I think that this is  the  time  for

reason and logic to reassert their position.  There

are two curious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



aspects to this subject. The first is that the real

irritation  and  resentment  that  developed   over

differing  parities had their origins in old  coins

rather  than in old notes. Only a small  percentage

of   people  had  hoarded  the  old  notes,   while

everybody had coins. With the fall in the value  of

the  old coins, businesses, had to be conducted not

in  round numbers, as had hitherto been the  custom

for  years,  but in amounts like 17  cents  and  22

cents.   Since  the  one-cent  coin  had  virtually

disappeared  from circulation, transactions  became

virtually impossible to carry out, with the  result

that tempers were frayed everywhere - in markets, in

the  shops, in street stalls, in buses,  in  cinema

ticket booths and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My officials and I had foreseen: these

difficulties and on Monday, the 20th November,  the

day  following the announcement of the  devaluation

of  Sterling, we urged Kuala Lumpur to  retain  the

parity of value as between old coins and new coins.

Unfortunately, Bank Negara Malaysia was unable  to'

accept  our  views, though happily four days  later

both  Governments agreed, that the one-cent,  five-cent  and  ten-cent old coins should  circulate  at

parity. This, immediately took the heat out of  the

situation    and    enabled    day-to-day    market

transactions    to   be   carried    out    without

recrimination between buyer and seller  as  to  who

had been cheated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect relates to the view that the

old  notes should not have been devalued  and  that

any losses sustained by accepting the old notes  at

the  value of 2s. 8d. instead of 2s. 4d. could  and

should have been borne by the Government. The  more

knowledgeable  people  say  that  since   the   old

Currency  Board, had a cover of 110  per  cent  and

since  some old notes are bound to be lost, through

fire  or other means of destruction, the loss  that

would  finally be borne by the Government would  be

small. How much substance is there in this kind  of

argument?  Sir, I am afraid I can see  very  little

merit in it. People who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



engaged   on   both  sides  of  this  debate   have

overlooked a basic point, that this is really not a

question of transferring assets from government  to

holders  of  old notes. If this were so,  then  the

questions  one  has  to  answer  would  be:   Could

Government have afforded it? How do we overcome the

technical  difficulties  of  the  legally   defined

parity  of  2s. 4d. for the old dollar?  These  can

become relevant issues. However, I believe that the

real truth is that to pay holders of old notes  the

same value as the new currency does not involve the

transfer  of assets between the Currency Board  and

the Government on the one hand, and the holders  of

old  notes  on the other. It involves nothing  less

than  redistribution of assets  between  those  who

hold  the new currency and those who hold  the  old

currency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the position in simple terms to

hon. Members, because the issue has been clouded by

irrelevant  arguments as to whether Government  can

or  cannot afford to make this payment.  For  the

sake  of argument, let us assume that there are  no

excess funds in the old Currency Board's funds, and

further  that there are no reserves upon which  the

Government can draw to make the additional payments

to  holders  of old currency notes. This additional

payment  would  amount  to  some  $30  million   in

Singapore and $60 million in Malaysia, if every old

dollar were to be exchanged for one new dollar  and

not  for  87  cents, the additional money  must  be

obtained  somehow, tinder the assumptions  that  we

have  made that there are no surplus funds  in  the

Currency Board or in the Government accounts, this

money  must be obtained by new taxation. Therefore,

to  pay  holders  of old notes the additional  sum,

Government would have to raise some $30 million  as

taxes,  and  perhaps  the most  equitable  form  of

taxation  in this instance would be a once-and-for-all  poll  tax, say, at the rate of  $15  per  man,

woman  or  child. This would mean  that  a  working

class family of man, wife and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



three  children  would  have  to  pay  $75  to  the

Government  who would then pay this sum to  holders

of  old  currency  notes - the dear  old  ladies  who

stashed away enormous sums under mattresses!  If  I

were  to act in this way, it is obvious that  there

would  be  howls  of rage from the populace.  There

would  be very few kind words spoken in the defence

of the rights of holders of old currency notes. All

this  is perfectly clear, as is also the fact  that

the additional payment of $30 million to holders of

old  currency notes represents in this  exercise  a

redistribution  of  assets from  the  rest  of  the

population  to holders of old currency  notes.  The

argument   would  not  be  in  the  slightest   way

nullified  if we were to make this payment  out  of

reserves  rather  than from taxation.  In  the  end

Government  reserves would go into expenditure  and

the present Budget session provides an apt reminder

of  this truth. We are not a trading concern  where

surpluses  are divided as dividends to shareholders

or  bonuses  to  employees and fees  to  directors.

Cabinet  Ministers do not get additional  pay,  nor

are  Government  employees paid a bonus  should  we

reduce expenditure. Surpluses are transferred  from

the  Consolidated Fund to the Development  Fund  to

pay  for projects like new schools, housing, roads,

power  stations, wharves, water supply,  industrial

estates and all the things which are of benefit  to

our  citizens. The withdrawal of $30  million  from

the  reserve  fund to pay holders of  old  currency

notes means that there will be just that less money

to   spend   on   these   items   and   that   this

redistribution   of  assets  from  non-holders   to

holders  of  old currency notes is  none  the  less

real,  even  if  there were no new tax  to  finance

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that what I say will remove the common but

primitive method of thinking about public  finance,

i.e.,   when   government  withholds  spending   on

something,  the people are being deprived  and  the

government benefits. All government funds  are  for

the  purpose  of public expenditure, and  the  real

argument is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



what kinds of public expenditure are most conducive

to  the common good? I am not easily persuaded that

paying $30 million to holders of old currency notes

is conducive to the common good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is  difficult for me to support this  amendment

Bill  as  I  have  certain objections  to  make  in

respect of this proposed Bill which is to amend the

Currency Act of 1967. The most significant point to

which I wish to draw the attention of this House is

not  the  amendment  itself but  the  retrospective

effect  of  the amendment. . Members of this  House

are  aware that the currency notes and coins issued

by   the  Commissioners  of  Currency,  Malaya  and

British  Borneo, are stated to be legal tender  for

their full face value according to the provision in

section 14(4) of the Currency Act. Members of  this

House  are  also  aware that the occurrence  of  an

event beyond our control - namely the devaluation of

the  Pound  Sterling - has resulted in the Singapore

Government  having  to declare  that  the  currency

notes  and  coins  issued by the  Commissioners  of

Currency,  Malaya  and British Borneo,  are  to  be

depreciated  in  value  by about  14  per  cent  in

relation  to the national currency of Singapore.  I

appreciate that this drastic step has to  be  taken

by the Singapore Government because the old Malayan

currency  was fully backed by the English Sterling,

which  was devalued on Sunday, 19th November, 1967.

But  this  depreciation in value has brought  great

hardship  on  those persons who  have  old  Malayan

currency  in  their  possession,  particularly  the

working  class who cannot afford to operate banking

accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as currency notes are

concerned, I am of the opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Government  has some  justification  for

devaluing the old Malayan currency because the  new

Singapore  currency has been introduced since  12th

June,  1967, which gave ample opportunity for every

Singaporean to convert his or her holdings  of  the

old  Malayan  currency notes into the new  national

Singapore  currency. But in the case of the  coins,

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  position  is   radically

different because up to November 1967, no new coins

had been introduced or circulated by the Government

of  Singapore. So by depreciating the value of  the

old  Malayan  coins in relation  to  the  Singapore

national   currency,  it  would  appear  that   the

Government  of  Singapore sought  to  penalise  the

residents  of Singapore through no fault  of  their

own.  As  I  see it the only way that  Singaporeans

could  be  blamed for holding old Malayan coins  is

that they had not changed the old Malayan coins for

new  currency  notes  between 12th  June  and  19th

November,  1967. But if they had done  so,  then  a

most ridiculous situation would have resulted, that

is,  no one would be in possession of any coins  at

all.  Mr Speaker, Sir, such a situation would have

a  disastrous, if not a totally paralysing,  effect

on our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my purpose is to bring to the attention of

this  House the grievance of, if not the people  of

Singapore,  at least the voters of my constituency,

in  respect of the old devalued Malayan coins which

were  the  only coins in active circulation  before

the  unfortunate event took place on 19th November,

1967, it is not so much to criticise the Government

of   Singapore  but  to  show  how  ridiculous  the

situation  had  become.  I  appreciate   that   our

Government, by reason of the fact that it is one of

the  three  constituent members  of  the  Board  of

Commissioners  of  Currency,  Malaya  and   British

Borneo, is not free to act in a way it thinks  best

for  the interest of the people in relation to  the

question of depreciating the value of the old Malayan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



coins.  It is also obvious, from  the  close

economic  link  and proximity of West  Malaysia  to

Singapore,  that  the Singapore  Government  cannot

afford  to  take any unilateral action relating  to

the  value  of the old Malayan currency  notes  and

coins.  If our Government were to declare that  old

Malayan 20-cent and 50-cent coins are redeemable at

their nominal value, Singapore would be flooded  at

present with all the 20-cent and 50-cent coins that

were in circulation in West Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Finance will put up this

argument, but I would like to inform Members of the

House  how  many 20-cent and 50-cent coins  are  in

active circulation. This is from the Report of  the

Board  of  Commissioners of  Currency,  Malaya  and

British  Borneo,  1965. The value  of  the  50-cent

coins  is $767,037.50, and the value of the 20-cent

coins  is  $485,870.00. Assuming  that  from  1965,

these  figures have been doubled, then the  20-cent

and  50-cent  coins  by now in  active  circulation - assuming that every 50-cent and 20-cent coin is in

active    circulation   - will   amount   to    only

$3,758,722.25.  So  it is really  inconceivable  to

think   that  the  three  Governments,   that   is,

Singapore,  Malaysia and Brunei, cannot  afford  to

redeem one-third of this amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am given to understand that

the  Singapore Government played an important  part

in  the subsequent reversal of the initial decision

of  the  Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya

and  British Borneo, to depreciate the value of the

Malayan coins of whatever denominations in relation

to the respective national currencies of Singapore,

Malaysia  and  Brunei. This decision,  needless  to

say, had caused a lot of confusion among the people

of  the  three  territories, especially  among  the

working class who are the ones dealing in terms  of

cents instead of dollars. Sir, it was a relief  for

everyone when the Board subsequently announced that

the old Malayan coins of one-cent, five-cent and 10-cent denominations are redeemable at their par



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



value,  if the Singapore Government could obtain  a

partial reversal of the decision to depreciate  the

value of the Malayan coins, it is conceivable  that

if  our Minister for Finance makes a greater effort

to  persuade  the other two Governments,  then  the

decision  reached might be entirely reversed,  that

is,  20-cent  and 50-cent Malayan  coins  would  be

redeemable at their par value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to devalue the old Malayan currency,

particularly  the coins, is bound to  have  a  far-reaching  effect  on  the  morale  of  the  people.

Recently  the  three  Governments  made   a   joint

statement  that  the  old  Malayan  currency  would

continue  to  be  redeemable  (of  course,   at   a

depreciated  value)  with  regard  to   the   three

respective national currencies up to 31st December,

1968.   The   question  here  is  that   with   the

devaluation  of  the  Pound Sterling,  there  is  a

distinct  possibility  of  the  U.S, dollar  being

devalued  - I am not saying right now, but  assuming

by  next  month - then what will happen  if  such  a

devaluation of the U.S, dollar occurs? It must  not

be  forgotten  that a substantial  portion  of  our

foreign   exchange  holdings  consist  of  American

dollars.  Does  it  mean that  devaluation  of  the

American dollar will mean a further depreciation of

the  old  Malayan currency? If such a  depreciation

should occur within the next month, it might  cause

greater confusion, particularly in respect  of  the

old  Malayan coins. After two weeks of  its  issue,

new Singapore coins are hardly in evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish the House would consider seriously

the  question  of depreciation of the  old  Malayan

currency  and its effect on the economy.  With  the

devaluation  of the Pound Sterling, there  is  much

speculation about the possible devaluation of other

currencies, particularly the American currency.  In

this context, I am also requesting the House to pay

much  more  attention  to  our  nearest  neighbour,

Malaysia. Although it has not devalued its national

currency in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



line   with  the  Pound  Sterling,  there  is  much

speculation  that  it  might have  to  devalue  its

national  currency within a year or two. Since  the

Singapore  Government has agreed with the Malaysian

and   Brunei   Governments  that  their  respective

national currencies are to have customary tender in

one  another's  territories, the Government  should

take  steps  to  inform the people that  they  hold

Malaysian and Brunei national currencies  at  their

own risk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of what I have outlined for the

consideration of this House, I would  suggest  that

the  Singapore Government make a further effort  to

have  the decision to depreciate the value  of  the

old  Malayan  20-cent and 50-cent coins  completely

reversed.  Such a reversal is urgently required  as

there  were no new coins available on 19th November

of  this  year, when the devaluation of  the  Pound

Sterling  was announced. The obligation  to  redeem

the 20-cent and 50-cent coins at their par value is

moral  and  not legal. But our Finance Minister  is

going  to  make it legal by introducing  this  Bill

with  a  Certificate  of  Urgency.  But  from   the

political  and  social point of  view,  failure  to

carry  out a moral obligation is much more damaging

than failure to carry out a legal obligation.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Minister for Finance has  tabled

the Currency (Amendment) Bill in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange rates have been mentioned in the

Bill,  but  the  one-cent, five-cent  and  ten-cent

coins  have been accepted at par value and the  20-cent  and  50-cent coins have not been accepted  at

par  value. No explanation has been given for this.

The  old currency has been devalued by 15 per cent.

The  people have lost as a result of such  exchange

rates.  They  have  not  been  given  enough   time

because,  after  separation, Singapore  has  stated

that  a  dollar for a dollar will be given for  the

old currency, but no time limit was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



imposed  at  that  time. So what  will  the  common

people  do?  The Minister should think about  this.

Moreover, there is no justification to say that the

exchange rates are fair. For example, if the  Pound

Sterling  is further devalued tomorrow or  after  a

few months, we think that the value of the currency

will  still  go down. No assurance has  been  given

that  the  same  rate will prevail. What  will  the

Minister  do  if  the  Pound Sterling  is  devalued

further?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the first point that I

want  to make in reply to the last two hon. Members

is   this.  The  value  of  currencies  and   their

international  backing are not matters  upon  which

one   should  lightly  embark  in  public  address,

because  these are very delicate matters  and  what

responsible  people say in public  will  have  some

effect  on the confidence which is so necessary  in

the  smooth  running  of currencies.  Unfortunately

neither  of  the speakers has shown  the  slightest

evidence that they understood the subject. There is

no  reason to believe that the U.S. dollar is going

to  be  devalued next month. In fact, if the Member

for  Bras Basah really believes that, then  he  can

make a small fortune!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am saying that there is a

possibility  of the American dollar being  devalued

but not that it will be devalued.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is loose talk of this

kind  that creates all sorts of trouble. If you  do

not  believe  that  it will be devalued,  then  you

should not say so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot follow the figures quoted by the

Member  for Bras Basah. I have taken down notes  of

what  he  has said about 20-cent coins and  50-cent

coins.  He says that the total value in circulation

is  not large. In 1965 it was $760,000 worth of 50-cent  coins  and $485,000 worth  of  20-cent  coins.

Adding  these two figures up, he gets  a  total  of $3.2 million. I do not quite follow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



this  kind of arithmetic. May I urge the Member  to

read the report more carefully? Now, he cannot have

it  both  ways.  If  he  says  that  the  value  in

circulation of these 20-cent and 50-cent  coins  is

very  small, then it does not inflict much hardship

if  they are devalued, as they have been. The  fact

of  the matter is, in my estimation, that the  one-cent,  five-cent  and ten-cent  coins  would  total

something  like  two-thirds or more  of  the  total

coins  in circulation. In fact, by accepting  these

coins at their face value, the Singapore Government

has to sustain a loss of $2 million. And if we were

to take on the other two sets of coins, the 20-cent

and  50-cent coins, at their face value,  we  would

suffer a loss of another million dollars or so; not

an  awfully big sum, but obviously in these matters

it is necessary for all concerned to act together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad to note that the Member for Bras

Basah  agrees  that  we  acted  correctly  in   not

accepting the old notes at their face value.  I  do

not  think  that  the Member for Anson  has  raised

anything new, and I think that my remarks about the

comments of the Member for Bras Basah also apply to

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved it-self into a

for Finance.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the Government for the year 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years of independent existence, the

Republic of Singapore continues not only to survive

but  also  to  flourish, to the  surprise  of  many

observers.  In  his  Budget  Speech  last  year  my

predecessor, now the Defence Minister, gave a  full

account  of  the  growing strength of  the  economy

achieved   in   1966.  Expansion  of  the   economy

continued this year. Trade figures show an  overall

growth  of  8  per cent. In the period  January  to

September  1966, the total imports and exports  was

$5,513 million. The same period this year showed an

increase to $5,956 million. These are increases  in

terms  of  value.  Because of the  decline  in  the

prices of primary products such as rubber and  tin,

value figures understate the growth in the physical

volume   of  trade.  The  total  amount  of   cargo

discharged and handled this year compared with last

year  showed an increase of no less than  15.3  per

cent  -17.3 million freight tons in the first eight

months of last year compared with 19.9 million tons

for  the same period this year. The number of ships

using  our  harbour showed an increase of  8.8  per

cent  over  last  year. In terms  of  tonnage,  the

increase was 11.5 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other indicators support the evidence of rapid

growth.  For instance, the volume of bank  deposits

in  the  first  10  months of this  year  shows  an

increase  of no less than 29 per cent - from  $1,312

million  at  the  beginning of the year  to  $1,697

million   at   the   end   of   October.   Building

construction also shows substantial increases.  The

number  of new buildings commenced this year showed

no less than a 66 per cent increase over last year.

Construction  of 5,096 units started in  the  first

six  months of last year compared with 8,461  units

for the same period this year. Private construction

was particularly active,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



showing  a  94.5 per cent increase.  $21.8  million

worth  of private construction was started  in  the

first  six  months  of  1966  compared  with  $42.4

million this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of granite continues to increase. In 1966

it  averaged 100.9 thousand cubic yards a month. In

the  last three months of this year the figure  has

increased  to  nearly 130 thousand  cubic  yards  a

month, which is more than two and a half times  the

volume  in 1961. This is an indication not only  of

housing  construction, but also  of  a  substantial

increase in the construction of new roads  as  well

as improvements to old roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a rapid expansion in the tourist

trade.  Last year the occupancy rate of first-class

hotels averaged 84.2 pet cent. Now all these hotels

are   solidly  booked  several  months  ahead,  and

thousands of tourists had to be shunted to  second-class  hotels, much to their discomfiture. Business

expansion  gene-rated by growth in these and  other

fields,  has  created an acute shortage  of  office

space.  Nor  can  it  be said  that  this  rise  in

affluence  is  confined only to  the  wealthy.  One

economic  indicator  which I  find  interesting  to

watch  is  the number of motor cycles and  scooters

registered  each  month.  Five  years   ago,   this

averaged  548 per month; the average for  the  last

three  months was 1,258. This gives some indication

that  the  skilled  artisan and  the  white  collar

worker are also benefiting from economic expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the reasons for the good performance of

Singapore's  economy this year? I think  there  are

three main reasons. First, the growth of trade with

Indonesia;  second, expansion of exports  to  South

Vietnam;  third,  a  substantial  increase  in  the

inflow of Hong Kong industry into Singapore. Let me

deal  with each of these factors in turn. The total

merchandise  trade  with Indonesia  in  1967,  i.e.

trade  excluding petroleum and petroleum  products,

is  likely to surpass the pre-confrontation  level.

The oil trade with Indonesia, which was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



very substantial before confrontation, is now but a

shadow  of its former self. We used to import  more

than  $200  million  worth  of  oil  products  from

Indonesia  a  year and export $90 million  to  her.

Imports  are  now  running at a third  of  previous

levels and oil exports to Indonesia are negligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture, however, is different with the

merchandise trade. Before confrontation,  Singapore

was  importing an average of 30,000 tons of  rubber

per  month  as  well  as  a substantial  volume  of

coffee,  pepper, copra and other tropical  produce.

But  the  rubber trade accounts for more than  two-thirds  of the value of imports from Indonesia.  By

September this year the physical volume of  imports

of   rubber   had  exceeded  the  pre-confrontation

average of 30,000 tons a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the exports side, performance this year is

likely to surpass the highest level achieved before

confrontation, and that was in 1962. In that  year,

our  exports  of  merchandise, excluding  petroleum

products, to Indonesia amounted to $226.5  million.

This  year the figure is likely to be in the region

of  $355 million. One reason for this is the  ready

availability   of  supplies  of  manufactures   now

produced by our new industries such as wheat flour,

galvanised  iron  sheets, cement,  iron  and  steel

construction  material and so  on.  Early  delivery

dates  and attractive credit facilities had enabled

us  to  increase by a very substantial  amount  our

export trade to Indonesia. Also the rational policy

of  the  Government of Indonesia in granting export

bonus  certificates  has  helped  to  increase  the

supplies    of    necessities    - foodstuffs    and

construction material - to Indonesia. The  expansion

of  our  trade  with Indonesia is  undoubtedly  the

principal  reason for the present buoyancy  of  the

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Hong Kong industrialists, I reported

to  Parliament  on  the 2nd November  that  a  very

substantial   number  of  them   have   made   firm

arrangements to establish manufacturing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



facilities  in  Singapore. The  number  since  then

continues  to  grow at a gratifying rate  and  Hong

Kong  industrialists have bought up  all  available

factory    accommodation   - both   those   recently

completed  as well as under construction.  It  has,

therefore,   been  necessary  to  mount   a   crash

programme  of  new  factory building  to  meet  the

requirements  of  Hong Kong industrialists  as  all

available buildings have already been taken  up  by

them.  This is being done in the Kallang industrial

estate   as   well  as  in  Jurong.  The   Economic

Development  Board  has now under  construction  no

less  than  131 factories which would be leased  or

rented out on completion to industrialists. Tenders

for  another 76 factories will soon be called  for.

Thirty of the 131 factories under construction  are

in  Jurong  and  the rest are in the Kallang  Basin

Industrial   Estate,  Redhill  Industrial   Estate,

Kampong  Empat  Industrial Estate and  the  Tanglin

Halt  Industrial Estate. They include several types

of  factory  buildings, such as blocks  of  flatted

factories,   box-beam   type   temporary    factory

buildings,  terrace type factories and so  on.  The

figures  I give do not include factories which  are

being  built  by the industrialists  themselves  in

Jurong and elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these activities reflect the growth of our

manufacturing industries, particularly the  pioneer

firms.  As at June this year, there was an increase

of pioneer firms in production from 97 last year to

126,  an  increase of 30 per cent. Total investment

in  fixed  assets increased from $293 million  last

year  to $336 million this year, an increase of  25

per  cent. The number of persons employed increased

during  the  same period from 11,000 to 13,400,  an

increase of 22 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards trade with South Vietnam, this has

been  helpful  but  the extent  has  probably  been

exaggerated  by people who look only at  the  gross

figures. Five years ago, before the increase in the

American  military  effort in  South  Vietnam,  our

exports to that country were in the region  of  $50

million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



to  $60  million a year. In 1965 this increased  to

$110 million, going to $256 million last year. This

year  it  is  running  at the rate  of  about  $300

million  a  year.  However, most  of  the  products

exported  to  Vietnam  consist  of  petroleum   and

petroleum products. While these no doubt have  been

useful   to   our  refineries  and  to   businesses

connected  with  tanker  operations,  the  benefits

accruing  to our manufacturing industries are  much

less.  For  instance, in 1966, 80 per cent  of  the

exports  were  petroleum products  and  exports  of

other  manufactures  amounted  to  only  some   $50

million - a useful sum, no doubt, but not one  which

can  explain  the rate of our economic growth;  nor

should it place our industry in severe difficulties

should the war there come to a close.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is gratifying to note the sturdy growth

of  our  economy  and  its present  rather  healthy

condition,  our  future prospects can  give  us  no

cause for complacency. Everybody knows that we  are

now  faced with a severe challenge to our  economic

prosperity,  when  the British  plan  for  reducing

their military forces in Singapore gets under  way.

The   programme   is  to  reduce   their   military

establishment by half by 1970/71. Concurrently with

the  run-down of the military establishment,  there

will  be  corresponding reductions in the  civilian

establishments which provide supporting services to

the  fighting units. By 1970/71 the extent of  the

run-down,  so  far as Singapore is concerned,  will

mean  a  reduction of half of the  31,500  locally-enlisted  personnel and locally-recruited civilians

now  employed in British bases. In other words,  by

April  1971,  there  will be  approximately  16,000

people  now  working in British bases who  will  be

retrenched.  A  quarter of these  are  non-citizens

coming  from Malaysia and India, and the rest  will

be  Singapore citizens for whose welfare we have  a

responsibility.  The Government is preparing  plans

whereby  discharged civilians who are  citizens  of

Singapore  may  be  re-absorbed into  industry  - if

necessary, after a period of industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



training. These details will doubtless be announced

in due course by the Minister for Labour and I will

not encroach on his territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the economic effects are concerned, the

British  military run-down will mean  not  only  an

increase  in  the number of unemployed  persons  in

Singapore,   but   also  a   reduction   of   local

expenditure.  Undoubtedly  these  effects  on   the

economy will be severe and protracted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary that we should quantify these

effects  as  precisely as we can. On the  basis  of

this numerical assessment, we would be able to have

an  accurate idea of the magnitude of the  counter-measures  that we have to take to counteract  these

effects.  A lot of this work will be possible  only

when the detailed plans of the force reduction  are

known.   Also,   the  counter-measures   that   are

available to us must include the productive use  of

base  facilities  when they  are  released  by  the

British. A special unit has been established in the

Prime   Minister's  Department  to  go  into  these

details.  What  I need to do here  is  to  give  an

indication  of the order of magnitude involved  and

the  terms of the general policy which we  have  to

evolve and implement to cushion off the effects  of

the  military  run-down from unduly  upsetting  our

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of the military reduction can be

viewed   from  two  angles.  First,  in  terms   of

reduction  of  local expenditure which  these  base

facilities   generate.  This  includes   not   only

payments to civilian and locally-enlisted personnel

but  also expenditure by British military personnel

and  their  families, and expenditure  by  military

forces   on   local   goods  and   services;   such

expenditure  has been running at the rate  of  $281

million in 1961 and increasing to $450 million last

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that in 1966 the total local

expenditure of the British military forces amounted

to  no  less than 14 per cent of our gross domestic

expenditure. If we can assume that this expenditure

will be halved by April 1971, that is, three and  a

half years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



from now, this will mean a cumulative reduction  of

two per cent of our gross domestic expenditure each

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given figures of the expected

numbers  of  civilian and uniformed  employees  who

will  be  discharged  in the  first  phase  of  the

British  run-down. Roughly, this will mean that  we

have to find some 12,000 additional jobs if we want

to  re-employ  all our citizens discharged  by  the

British. If we assume that the rate of discharge is

evenly  spread  throughout the  three  and  a  half

years, this will mean an additional 3,400 jobs each

year. We are thus faced with a substantial increase

in  the  number of persons unemployed while at  the

same  time  there will be a reduction  in  spending

which,  unless balanced by additional  spending  in

other  sectors of the economy, will not create  the

circumstances  favouring the growth of  economy  to

absorb retrenched base workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to deal with the subject of unemployment

in  some  detail. This has always been the  central

economic problem of Singapore and the military run-down will obviously make it even more acute than it

had  been  during the last several years.  I  would

therefore  like  to  discuss in  some  detail  this

problem   as   there  appears  to   be   widespread

misconception  about  the  extent  and  nature   of

unemployment  in  Singapore. There  have  been  two

excellent  studies on the subject  made  last  year

which  had  received  inadequate  attention.  These

studies  are the Government tabulation of  National

Registration identity cards made last year when the

old  cards were exchanged for new cards. There  was

also  an excellent piece of research undertaken  by

the  Economic Research Centre of the University  of

Singapore  which  carried out a  very  large  scale

sample survey of households in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the analysis of unemployment was made in

these two studies, the only current source of data

was  the  registration records  maintained  by  the

Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



Exchanges  of the Ministry of Labour.  Anybody  who

wants  a  job registers his name there. He  may  be

unemployed or he may be working and in search of  a

better  job.  Since registration is not compulsory,

nor  does it carry with it cash benefits by way  of

social security payments, there is no inducement to

register apart from the hope of getting a job,  and

there  must be many unemployed people who  did  not

register.  So  the figures reported by  the  Labour

Exchanges  must be taken as uncertain as  to  their

exact   meaning.   Provided,  however,   that   the

different  biases  entering into  the  figures  are

constant  from  year to year, then changes  in  the

level of Labour Exchange registrations may be taken

as  an  indication  of  changes  in  the  trend  of

unemployment.  But even this is  a  risky  exercise

only to be undertaken as a last resort for want  of

anything better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sample Household Survey carried out by the

University  of  Singapore Economic Research  Centre

enquires  of  all  economically active  persons  10

years or over what they are doing. It considers any

persons unemployed if he or she is not working  and

is   actively  looking  for  work.  The  number  of

unemployed  estimated  in the  Survey  amounted  to

52,630  as  compared with a working  population  of

524,025. This gives an unemployment rate of 9.1 per

cent. A count of identity cards gives the number of

unemployed  as 43,405 against a working  population

of 541,758 - an unemployment rate of 7.4 per cent.  I

have  circulated to Members of the  House  a  table

setting  out the findings of these two studies  and

would  ask  Members to refer to this  table  marked

Appendix "A"* (* See cols. 503-4.). The differences in

the two estimates are  no  doubt the result of

different definitions,methods of enumeration and

other technical factors.But  whichever  figure we

take, the  rate  is  very high,  though not as high

as the estimates made  by some  alarmists. A closer

study of the  composition of unemployed persons reveals







<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19671205/19671205-HA-0260503.pdf"">Appendix "A" to Annual Budget Statement(Col.448) (Cols 0503-0504)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



certain  interesting  features.  Both  the   Sample

Household Survey and the National Registration data

are  agreed that the majority of unemployed persons

were those who never previously worked and who were

looking   for   their  first  job.   The   National

Registration data estimate this group at 28,826, or

66  per  cent of all unemployed persons. The Sample

Household Survey estimates it at 28,789, or 54  per

cent  of the total unemployed. Both are agreed that

the  majority of those unemployed persons who  were

looking for work for the first time were teenagers.

This   is  what  one  would  expect.  The  National

Registration  data  give the number  of  unemployed

persons looking for their first job aged between 12

and 19 years as 21,937. The Sample Household Survey

places the figure at 18,545.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the majority of those looking for their

first  job were teenagers, the majority of  persons

unemployed  who had previously worked were  persons

aged  20  or over. Of the 14,579 unemployed persons

who  became  unemployed  by losing  their  previous

jobs,  only  2,813 were teenagers and the  rest  20

years  or  older.  Very much the same  distribution

appears  in  the  Sample  Household  Survey   data,

although   the  figures  of  persons   who   became

unemployed by losing their jobs, as contrasted with

those looking for their first job, are considerably

larger  in the Sample Household Survey. It  is  not

easy  to reconcile these two sets of figures. I  am

inclined  to  believe  that  the  Sample  Household

Survey  data  are  more  reliable.  The  method  of

enumeration  by trained interviewers is  likely  to

produce   less   recording  errors.  The   National

Registration  data  were  compiled  by   relatively

untrained clerks, and recording mistakes could be a

serious  source  of error. All this strengthens  my

belief  that  there  should be established  in  the

Government  machinery  a system  for  the  periodic

estimation  of the number of unemployed persons  by

some  reliable statistical method. This is the  one

key economic variable in Singapore and yet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



it  cannot  be  known  with  any  certainty  simply

because  of  the absence of a machinery to  collect

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back to the studies, 21,900 teenagers

looking  for work is not suck a horrifying  problem

considering  that  each year  some  40,000  persons - boys  and  girls  - reach the age  where  they  can

reasonably  be  expected to earn a livelihood.  But

the  number  of people unemployed as  a  result  of

losing their jobs - 14,600 according to the National

Registration  data  and  23,900  according  to  the

Sample   Household  Survey  data   - these   numbers

constitute  a very serious problem. Most  of  these

people  are of the age where they could be expected

to be supporting families. The number comes to some

10,000  in  the National Registration data  and  no

less  than  19,000  in the Sample Household  Survey

data.  While  we  can  expect  teenagers  to  spend

another  year  or  two living with  their  families

without experiencing undue hardship, the older ones

who  have  lost  their jobs and are trying  to  get

another  create  both  an  economic  and  a  social

problem  of some importance. As I have said before,

their ranks will soon be swollen very substantially

by  those who would be retrenched from the military

bases.  If  we  regard the Sample Household  Survey

figures  as  the more reliable one, in addition  to

the  19,000 adult persons unemployed in 1966, there

will  be  a  further 16,000 persons now working  in

military establishments who will be thrown  out  of

job  in  the  next three and a half years.  So,  in

addition to teenagers who are looking for  work  in

increasing numbers each year, we are faced  with  a

substantial  increase in the number  of  unemployed

persons  with family responsibilities. We  have  to

try  to  provide them with a livelihood. To sum  up

the  figures, we have 12,000 Singapore citizens who

will  lose  their jobs in military bases  over  the

next three and a half years. This is to be added to

some  52,000  already unemployed. A further  25,000

must  be  added  each year, representing  teenagers

entering  the labour market. This is the magnitude of the problem we have to solve.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pose the problem in summary form, what we have

to do in the next three years is -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) generate an additional $80 million

expenditure each year to offset the  reduction

of British military expenditure;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) create 18,000 additional jobs a year to

absorb  those  who are now unemployed  and  to

provide  work for base employees  expected  to

be retrenched;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) create a further 25,000 new jobs each year

for  the  teenagers coming of age and  looking

for work.



<br><br>Can we do this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer these questions with any degree of

completeness,  I think it is necessary  to  make  a

review  of our performance over the last ten years.

Members know that the prime objective of the P.A.P.

Government since 1959 has been to create  new  jobs

for  Singapore's growing population. So in a sense,

what  we are faced with now is not so much a  novel

situation but an aggravation of an existing one.  A

review  of  our  performance over the  years  might

yield   some   insight   as   to   what   practical

possibilities  exist  for successfully  surmounting

the very grave difficulties that lie ahead for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1961, we have embarked on a major attempt

to  industrialise the economy and there  have  been

visible changes in the shape of industrial estates,

new  factories which have given a concrete form  to

our policy. It is possible, however, in our concern

over  day-to-day  events, to  overlook  the  rather

radical  changes  which  have  resulted  from  this

policy  in  the  structure of our economy.  I  have

circulated  a  simple Table (marked Appendix  "B"*)  (* See cols. 505-6.)

which  sets  out  the distribution of  the  working

population between the various industries  in  1957

as  ascertained  by the Population Census  of  that

year and in 1966



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19671205/19671205-HA-0260505.pdf"">Appendix "B" to Annual Budget Statement(Col.448) (Cols 0505-0506)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



as ascertained in the Re-registration exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Registration data shown in this

table  show  a  very good degree of  correspondence

with the Household Survey and I therefore have  not

used the latter data. The first feature that stands

out is the very substantial reduction in the number

of  persons occupied in agriculture and fishing. In

1957, 31,500 were so engaged. The present number in

1966, namely, 22,800, shows a substantial reduction

of  more  than  a  quarter. The  reasons  for  this

decline must await closer investigation. All I  can

say   is  that  the  probable  causes  lie  in  the

substantial decline in small-scale fishing  and  in

the  increasing  use of rural land for  residential

and industrial purposes. The next important feature

is  the  substantial  increase  in  the  number  of

persons  engaged in manufacturing  from  68,000  to

106,300, an increase of 56 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the number of persons engaged in

the  manufacturing industries is confirmed  by  the

annual  census  of manufactures.  This  covers  all

manufacturing  industries engaging  10  persons  or

more.  It  therefore  excludes the  small  backyard

enterprises which in Singapore account for  a  very

substantial   number   of   persons   working    in

manufacturing  industries.  In  the  larger   firms

covered  by the census of manufactures, the figures

run as follows:



<pre>

                        1959      25,607

                        1960      27,416

                        1961      27,562

                        1962      28,642

                        1963      36,586

                        1964      41,488

                        1965      47,334

                        1966      52,594

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures show that significant industrial

expansion  did not start until 1963 and since  then

there  has  been an annual net increase of  between

5,000  and 6,000 jobs each year. This figure  takes

into  account  not  only the  additional  new  jobs

provided by new industries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



and expansion of old ones, but it also takes

into account jobs lost by contraction of industries

or closing down of established firms for one reason

or another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a sobering thought that with the

prodigious  efforts we put in and the vast  amounts

of  money  and  resources which the Government  had

been  channelling towards increasing the growth  of

the  manufacturing industries, all  that  bad  been

achieved is a net increase of some 5,000 jobs  each

year  in  these industries. Clearly  this  rate  of

increase is inadequate to meet our future needs. It

has  not  even absorbed the increasing  numbers  of

young  people  looking for jobs though,  no  doubt,

without  the effort that was actually put  in,  the

unemployment situation today may well  have  passed

the  critical point at which social discontent  may

seriously   disrupt  all  prospects  of   political

stability  and economic growth. This  element,  the

rate  of  net  increases  in  jobs  in  the  larger

manufacturing  industries, is a  critical  economic

variable, to which I will later return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspects of this Table do not call for

much comment. The increase in the number of persons

engaged  in  construction is  substantial,  37  per

cent,  and of course is the natural result  of  the

large   building  programmes  under  way.  A   very

noteworthy feature is the number of persons engaged

in trade which has virtually been stagnant over the

last 10 years, being 115,000 in 1957 and 116,800 in

1966.  This  stagnation in the  number  of  persons

engaged  in  commerce  is something  which  we  had

expected  when we came to office in  1959.  In  the

outcome, our expectations appear to have been fully

realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt with this subject in considerable

detail, taking into account the researches made  in

the  past  which have a bearing upon it, because  I

want   to  establish  beyond  all  doubt  that   to

counteract  the effects of military reductions  and

to reduce the number of unemployed persons, we will

have literally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



to  redouble our present efforts, to  promote

industrial  growth.  First,  I  think  I  have  to

establish  that it is this sector of  the  economy,

the manufacturing industry, which lends itself most

easily  to expansion as a consequence of deliberate

government policy. This is the experience not  only

in  Singapore  but  also  in  most  under-developed

countries  which had attempted the same  policy  as

ours.  The second conclusion is that the  scale  of

our  past  efforts  is quite insufficient  to  meet

future challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then are we to do? What measures must we

take to bring about sufficient industrial growth to

provide not merely 5,000 new jobs a year but  twice

or  even  three  times this figure?  A  preliminary

question we have to dispose of before we go to  the

main issue is what other sectors of the economy can

we  hope to produce economic growth? We have  ruled

out   the  trade  sector  and  we  have  seen  that

agriculture is a declining occupation. Construction

of  buildings is a good provider of jobs, but  this

is  dependent on other sectors expanding to produce

a buoyant economy. In itself, the growth impetus of

the  construction industry will dry up as  soon  as

people who buy private housing run out of money  or

when   the  development  funds  of  the  Government

diminish   because   economic  growth   cannot   be

sustained.  Here, fortunately for  us,  Singapore's

unique  geographical position once again  comes  to

the rescue. Our central position in South-East Asia

had  enabled us in the historical past to become  a

trading centre, which we still are. When trade  had

become stagnant as a provider of employment, we had

to  diversify our economy with useful  but  limited

results.   Now,   the   military   value   of   our

geographical situation, hitherto a large source  of

employment  and income, will be reduced in  stages.

However,  a new factor emerges which, without  much

merit or great effort on our part, will come  as  a

very   welcome   element  generating   much   local

expenditure  and  providing  a  large   volume   of

employment. This is the tourist trade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had earlier referred to the great influx of

tourists  which  has  now  resulted  in  an   acute

shortage  of  hotel accommodation. To  remedy  this

shortage,  there are under construction five  large

first-class  hotels  totalling  1,509  rooms.   The

capital  invested in these enterprises is estimated

at  $45  million aid they should provide employment

for 2,500 when completed. A third of this new hotel

capacity will be completed next year, giving  us  a

badly needed additional 566 rooms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a large number of applications to

the  Chief Building Surveyor's Department  for  the

construction  of  more  new  hotels  or   for   the

extension  of existing ones. Building approval  has

already  been  given to 16 new hotels or  extension

projects. These involve another 2,089 rooms with an

employment   potential   of   more   than    3,500.

Applications  have also been received from  another

nine  concerns for which building approval has  not

yet  been  granted. These involve 1,240  additional

rooms  with  a corresponding increase in employment

potential. So over the next three and a half years,

most of these projects should have come to fruition

and  they  will generate are additional 9,000  jobs

directly  in  these  hotels  with  many   more   in

associated  tourist industries. Combined  together,

they  constitute a very welcome additional  impetus

to our economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aggregate, the newly created employment in

the  tourist  industry will  equal  in  volume  the

number of citizens retrenched from the bases.  This

does not mean, however, that the expected growth of

tourism will completely offset the effects  of  the

run-down.   There   is   the  additional   indirect

employment created by the expenditure of servicemen

and their families and of service departments which

have  not  been  allowed for.  All  the  same,  the

expansion  of tourism will provide, as  I  said,  a

very welcome relief.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I return to industrial growth which remains

our  principal  weapon to provide more  income  and

employment.  Our policy in the past  has  been  to

encourage  industries of any kind so long  as  they

are  economically viable, that is to say, they  can

make  a  decent  return on capital invested.  As  a

result  of  this,  we  have seen  a  miscellany  of

factories established in Singapore. This phase  - if

I  can coin a phrase to describe it. "the shoes and

ships  and  sealing wax" phase of industrialisation - must   give   way   to   a  more   selective   and

discriminating policy. This does not mean  that  we

would  not  support any proposal to  establish  any

kind  of  plant in Singapore by a local or overseas

industrialist who is willing to put  in  the  money

and  take the risk. All proposals are welcome,  but

some will be more welcome than others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new phase, it is necessary for the

Government,   through  its  agency  of   industrial

promotion, the Economic Development Board, to  make

a deliberate selection of those kinds of industries

which  have  the greatest potential  for  long-term

growth.   Every   economy   has   certain   natural

advantages  which are related to and are determined

by  the  natural  resources that it possesses,  the

size  of  its  domestic market,  access  to  export

markets  and other economic factors. In  Singapore,

we  have no natural resources worth the mention and

the  domestic market is really too small upon which

to  mount  the kind of industrial development  upon

which  we must now embark. Obviously, we must  look

to export markets, but here the difficulty is this.

Where  we  depend  on  capital  and  know-how  from

overseas - as we now must for any industry that goes

beyond  a  certain  level  of  sophistication  - the

question which the overseas industrialist will  ask

of  himself, even if he is too polite to ask it  of

the  Economic  Development  Board,  is  this,  "Why

should I want to establish a plant in Singapore  to

produce for an export market in Europe, the  United

States or the Soviet Union? Why can't I do it  more

safely and more easily with the plant which  I  now

have, in my own country?" There are specific



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



instances - textiles, for instance - where there  are

good  reasons  why  overseas  enterprises  gain  by

establishing a factory in Singapore. In the case of

textiles,  there  was  a brief  escape  from  quota

restrictions   until  these  were   unceremoniously

banged  down  on  us  as well, but  in  general  no

convincing answer can be given to the question that

I  posed,  unless we can create tangible incentives

for  exports.  The  award of  pioneer  certificates

carrying with it exemption from income tax for five

years  is  one such incentive. The specific  export

incentives  incorporated in the  Bill  which  I  am

taking  through Parliament today will provide  even

more substantial benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But merely providing incentives would not produce

the  results that we want, unless it is  backed  by

the   right  policy  implemented  by  an  effective

administrative agency. In this second phase of  our

industrialisation programme, it will  be  necessary

for  us  to  make  increasingly  large  outlays  on

selected   growth  industries.  In  the   case   of

Singapore,  the experts in the Economic Development

Board  and  I have independently come to  the  same

conclusion, and that is that the growth  industries

which  we must foster are the engineering and metal

fabrication industries. These industries are labour

intensive which, of course, is a decided advantage.

Further,  they  require  a  substantial  amount  of

skills at all levels from the machinist working  on

machine tools to professional engineers with a wide

range  of  background  and training.  The  greatest

asset,  however,  that  this  group  of  industries

possess   lies  in  what  economists  call  "inter-industry  linkages". Firms in the  engineering  and

metal  fabrication industries buy a lot of products

and  services  from each other. So an expansion  of

one  unit  or one branch increases the  market  for

many  others, allows them to lower costs by  making

possible the purchase of more costly equipment  and

to resort to better techniques used in larger scale

production.  This built-in tendency  towards  self-reinforcing  growth  is one  which  marks  out  the

engineering and metal fabrication



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



industries as deserving of special attention.

The  products which these industries will turn  out

cover  a very wide range of commodities, from ships

to engines of various kinds powered by a variety of

fuels to the making of different kinds of machinery

and  components. There is a very substantial volume

of international trade in these products and within

this  vast complex volume of international business

in  engineering products, we should be able to find

that  mixture of products which we can  produce  on

advantageous and competitive terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a start, I have asked the Ishikawajima-Harima

Heavy   Industries  of  Japan,  the  largest  ship-builders in the world, to make a technical study of

the   prospects   of  building  medium-size   ocean

freighters  in Jurong. Their team of engineers  and

naval  architects recently returned to Japan  after

an   intensive  on-the-spot  study  of   production

facilities  in  Singapore which must support  ship-building  operations. Their recommendations  should

be made available to the Singapore Government early

next  year. The Economic Development Board are also

conducting    feasibility   studies   into    other

engineering  industries.  There  has  been  a  very

substantial  expansion in the training and  service

facilities   for  the  engineering  industries   in

Singapore  undertaken by the Service  Divisions  of

the  Economic Development Board, and these will  be

of  growing importance. Sometime next year, I  hope

to  receive  from  the United  States  through  the

assistance  of the International Executive  Service

Corps  a  personal adviser on policies relating  to

the expansion of the engineering industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that technical and production problems

can   be  solved  provided  one  spends  sufficient

resources  by  way of training, capital  investment

and  supporting infra-structure facilities.  To  be

sure,  this  is  going  to be a  vast  undertaking,

larger  than anything we have undertaken so far.  I

do  not imagine it would be the production problems

that  would  be the major difficulty.  We  have  an

energetic population which does not shirk work  and

which  is  willing to put in arduous and  sustained

effort  in  work,  in training and in  professional

studies. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



will, of course, take much time to turn out a  wide

range of professional technical competence which we

need to man a sophisticated industry, and this must

be a long-term and continuing undertaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe that the real difficulty is not in

production but in marketing. Of course, it is in  a

sense   artificial  to  regard  these  aspects   as

separate   issues,   for  they   are   inextricably

connected. For instance, if your production  is  so

efficient that you can undercut all competitors  in

the  world in producing a given product,  then  no

marketing problem exists, for you will be  able  to

sell  all  that you produce. We cannot, of  course,

assume  that  we  shall reach this happy  stage  of

excellence, for all that we can hope for is that we

would be roughly competitive `with other countries.

In  regard  to some aspects and some countries,  we

may  have  the  advantage of  higher  standards  of

education, more finance capital, easier  access  to

export markets, better communications, lower labour

costs   and  so  on.  In  regard  to  others,   the

relatively  low stage of our technical  development

must  be  a  severe  handicap  which  needs  to  be

overcome by exploiting our other advantages to  the

full.    On   balance,   an   efficient   marketing

organisation  which will transmit  the  demand  for

machinery  components and engineering  products  in

international trade to manufacturers in  Singapore,

will  be  a  decided  advantage to  our  industrial

growth.  By  this,  I  do not  mean  merely  export

promotion  activities  which  governments  normally

engage  in  and  which take the  form  of  overseas

market    research,   special   products   display,

dissemination of information, and so on. These  are

necessary but not sufficient. We must establish  in

the not too distant future an international trading

agency   of  some  kind  which  will  relieve   the

manufacturers in Singapore of many of the  problems

connected  with  the export of  their  products  to

overseas  markets. This subject is  receiving  very

close  attention in my Ministry and in the Economic

Development  Board, and I would say  no  more  than

that  the  implementation of this policy  may  well

result in far-reaching rearrangements in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



structure  and  pattern of our international  trade

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the problems we are facing. Many

of  them, as I have said, are not new, but with the

run-down of the bases, they have acquired an  added

urgency. I have outlined both the magnitude of  the

problem and the broad lines of policy upon which we

have   to  embark  in  attempting  a  solution   by

accelerating  our industrial growth.  I  would  not

like  to be more specific than I have been, if  for

no  other  reason  than that a great  deal  of  the

details of policy will have to await closer  study.

For  instance, it is clear that the Government will

have  to put in more capital into industrial growth

both by way of direct investment as well as by  the

provision  of infra-structure services,  especially

in  the shape of additional technological and  sub-professional training institutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Government investments in new

industrial  projects, the policy in  the  past  has

been  one  of  prudence.  Obviously,  the  Economic

Development  Board must make its calculations  with

some  accuracy before it invests in a new  venture,

since   it  cannot  risk  failure  in  its  initial

attempts. The result has been that nearly  all  its

equity  investments in industry have been extremely

profitable.  For  instance,  the  share  value   of

National  Iron  and  Steel,  in  which  it  has   a

substantial  equity holding, has increased  to  two

and  a  half  times  in  value.  Similarly,  Jurong

Shipyard, where the Economic Development Board owns

nearly  half  the capital, is known  to  be  making

large  sums  of money this year. I do  not  suggest

that  in  future  we  should be reckless  in  these

matters, for such an attitude is completely out  of

place  in responsible government. What I do suggest

is  that  calculated risks must be taken where  the

promise of growth makes this worth while. All  this

means  that  substantially  larger  funds  must  be

allocated  to building up our economic sinews  than

had  been  the case in the past, and it  cannot  be

said  that  the  Government has been  niggardly  in

providing  these funds. A whole host  of  questions

follows upon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



such  a  policy. For instance, will it be necessary

to  create new financial institutions for the  more

effective mobilisation of domestic capital? To what

extent  can we look for useful assistance  from  or

fruitful alliance with external sources of finance?

These  and  many other aspects of the  problem  are

constantly  exercising the minds of my  staff,  and

the   coming  months  should  see  some   important

developments in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go to discuss the estimates before

Parliament,  may I bring together the main  threads

of the arguments which I have been developing? They

can be summarised under six main headings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The last 10 years have seen a marked change

in  the structure of the economy of Singapore as  a

result of our policy on industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Industrial growth has managed to keep

unemployment  within  manageable  proportions.   In

spite  of rapid population growth, the increase  in

unemployment has been from 29,600 in 1957 to 52,630

in   1966.  Most  of  the  unemployed  persons  are

teenagers  looking for their first  jobs.  However,

the seriousness of the present position must not be

under-estimated, for the present level of some  9.7

per  cent of the work force is not very far removed

from  the danger level where social discontent  may

provoke instability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Unemployment created by the reduction of

British  Forces would present the Republic with  an

aggravation  of  an  already  serious  unemployment

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The expected expansion of the tourist trade

will present the Republic with much needed relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) This will not, however, obviate the necessity

for intensified effort to produce faster industrial

expansion.  Such future efforts will  require  much

larger allocations of financial and other resources

and  at  the same time the effort will have  to  be

more  selective in the choice of growth  industries

to be encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The additional effort will call for the establishment of new institutions in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



at  least  two fields, namely, the mobilisation  of

domestic   capital   and   the   exploitation    of

opportunities in export markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments I turn to the Estimates that

now lie before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point is that the considerations which I

have  discussed at such length and in  such  detail

have  placed certain constraints on the policy that

has to be followed in the allocation and raising of

funds for next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the detailed items of the accelerated

growth policy which I have outlined have yet to  be

worked  out into an operational programme,  it  has

not  been  possible to quantify actual requirements

by  way of funds and resources. For this reason,  I

have  adopted what virtually amounts  to  a  normal

continuation  budget with no major  innovations  or

changes  both  in  the Ordinary Estimates  and  the

Development Estimates. In the first place,  I  have

not  provided  in this Budget for  an  increase  in

taxes  next  year. So the Estimates of  Expenditure

have  to  be  framed within the expected  yield  of

existing taxes. Secondly, a large proportion of the

additional  revenue resulting from normal  economic

growth  will  have  to  be  allocated  for  Defence

expenditure. This is not the result of any increase

in  our  Defence programme, but merely  the  normal

implementation of `the Defence Plan worked  out  in

previous  years. This point is of some  importance,

and perhaps I may be allowed to elaborate on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned withdrawal of the British military

presence  by the mid-70's has happily no effect  on

our  Defence expenditure for next year. The  reason

is that in framing the original Defence Plan of the

Republic,  some two years ago, one of  the  crucial

elements which had to be taken into account was the

probable  duration of the British military presence

in  Singapore  and in the region. We  came  to  the

conclusion in the Ministry of Defence that we could

not  depend  on the continued presence  of  British

Forces in this area beyond 1975.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>In  the event, this planning assumption turned  out

to  be  virtually  identical  with  the  intentions

subsequently  announced by the British  Government.

So provided there are no further changes of mind on

the  part of Her Majesty's Government, the build-up

of  our  Defence  Forces on land will  continue  as

planned. The additional money provided for  in  the

Estimates is to pay for the implementation of  this

Plan, now in its third year. As I had informed  the

House  in  m previous capacity as Defence Minister,

the  Plan provided for the establishment of a total

of seven Infantry Battalions which, with supporting

arms  and  services, would provide the elements  of

two  infantry Brigades. In our estimate, this Force

should  be sufficient for our protection in  normal

times.  I make this point lest the modest increases

in   our   Defence  spending  occasion  unnecessary

speculation as to our intentions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice not only in this

Parliament but also in those of other countries for

Finance  Ministers to discuss in detail the  totals

of   expenditures  under  the  various  heads   and

subheads  of the Budget and to discuss the expected

yields of various items of revenue. In the past,  I

too   have  taken  to  this  practice.  This  year,

however, I intend to introduce an innovation by not

entering into a statement of this kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that I have long suspected that

nobody pays the slightest attention either in  this

House   or  when  they  read  the  proceedings   in

tomorrow's newspapers or in Hansard nobody pays the

slightest  attention to the interminable series  of

figures involved in an exposition of this kind. The

average  human mind unfortunately does not  have  a

high  degree of perceptivity in respect of numbers,

and  I  am  afraid  that it is  the  misfortune  of

Finance  Ministers in their Budget presentation  to

labour   under  the  misapprehension   that   their

audiences  are eagerly and intelligently  digesting

the  outpouring of numerical data. I have  come  to

the conclusion that this is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



a waste of time both on my part and on the part of

hon. Members.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.33 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, I intend to present, as an attachment

to  the  Ordinary  and  Development  Estimates,   a

written   statement   setting   out   the   Finance

Ministry's  account  of  the  sums  entered   under

various  heads  of  revenue and  expenditure.  This

year,  I  suggest that these matters of detail  are

best   dealt  with  in  Committee  stage   and   I,

therefore, propose to do no more than to allow  the

figures to speak for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aggregates to take note of are that

expenditure  has been estimated at $646.4  million,

and  revenue  at $646.7 million. Both represent  an

increase   of   $56.2  million  over  last   year's

estimates. Since there is no increase in  taxation,

the  additional  revenue accruing to  the  Republic

will   be  the  result  of  economic  growth.   The

percentage growth in this instance is estimated  at

8.7 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure of $646.4 million is distributed

as follows:



<pre>

                  (i) Social Services, i.e.,

                          Education, Health and

                          such like items                      $281.3 million

                                                               (  by far the

                                                                    largest

                                                                    figure   )



                (ii) Economic Services                         $ 82.2 million



               (iii) Statutory expenditure,

                         i.e., Pensions, Funding of

                         public debts, etc.                    $ 90.6 million



                (iv) Police and Defence                        $100.8 million



                 (v) Others                                    $ 61.5 million

                (vi) Transfer to Development Fund              $ 30.0 million

                                                               ------

                                       Total                   $646.4 million

                                                               ======

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development expenditure authorised in the

Development  Estimates comes  to  $296  million  as

against  $249  million authorised last  year.  $178

million of this year's development expenditure will

be  incurred  in  the  Government  sector  and  the

balance. $118 million, will be by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



way  of loans to statutory authorities. Of the $178

million  provided  for  as  Government  Development

Expenditure,  the classification by sectors  is  as

follows:



<pre>

                 (i) Economic Development                      $80 million



                (ii) Social Development                        $39 million



               (iii) Defence and Public Administration         $59 million

</pre>



<br><br>By  contrast  with recurrent expenditure,  most  of

which is spent on the social services, the emphasis

in   development  expenditure  lies   in   economic

development.  The preponderance of  expenditure  on

economic development will be even larger if we take

into  account  that nearly all the  expenditure  of

statutory  authorities is to improve  our  economic

strength; this is as it should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will content myself with this

brief  version of the aggregates contained in  both

the  Ordinary and the Development Estimates  before

Parliament.

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The active promotion of manufacturing industries

has  been  a  cardinal feature of this Government's

economic  policy  since  1959.  At  that  time  the

Pioneer  Industries Act had just been brought  into

effect. It had served its purpose over the years in

introducing   a   wide  variety  of   manufacturing

activities  into the island. Today  the  number  of

pioneer  certificates issued stands at 243 and  the

number of pioneer firms at 224. 155 of these  firms

have commenced production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our separation from Malaysia, which has put

a  seal  on the still-born Malaysian common market,

it has become abundantly clear that only through  a

rapid  increase in domestic exports of  traditional

products in traditional markets as well as  of  new

products  in new markets that Singapore can  attain

salvation. The first tentative steps were  made  by

the  Government in late 1965 through a special  tax

deduction for export promotion activities. Then  in

his   Budget   speech  last  year,  my  predecessor

outlined  a range of fiscal concessions on  profits

derived  from  the export of domestic products.  It

has  taken us a full year, however, to grapple with

the  legal and administrative complexities of these

proposals. I am, nevertheless, satisfied  that  the

time has been well spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks, inter alia, to

provide   the   maximum  incentives  to   exporters

without,  at the same time, allowing them too  much

fat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



In respect of old companies with established export

markets,  it  is  only those who improve  on  their

export  record  who  will  benefit.  Exporters  who

prefer  to rest on their oars will get nothing,  as

befits members of a thrusting and dynamic society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides export incentives, the Bill seeks to

offer  tax  concessions  on  payments  for  foreign

royalties,  technical assistance and  research  and

development,  as  well  as on interest  liabilities

arising   from  foreign  loans  utilised  for   the

purchase of productive equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for a tax holiday in

respect   of   profits  from  sales   of   approved

manufactured  products resulting from an  expansion

of approved enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill provides for the repeal and re-enactment with minor amendments of the well-known

Pioneer Industries Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I set out below details of each significant part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II is essentially the same as the Pioneer

industries  Ordinance  of 1959.  Its  incorporation

into  the  present Bill is to place all  incentives

together  in  one  piece of legislation  so  as  to

assist investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III gives incentives to manufacturing

enterprises which expand their productive capacity.

Any  manufacturing company which incurs new capital

expenditure  for  the  purpose  of  manufacture  or

increased manufacture of an approved product may be

entitled  to such benefit provided such expenditure

exceeds $1 million, or exceeds $100,000 as well  as

results in an increase of not less than 30 per cent

of the value of existing productive capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax concession which is computed on the basis

of  a formula set out in clause 19 is available for

a  period of three or five years, depending on  the

amount of capital expenditure. The purpose of  this

provision  is  to encourage enterprises  to  expand

their  capacity in order to improve their economies

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



scale.  This is an important supplement to the  tax

relief for pioneer industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV provides tax relief for the export of

domestically  manufactured  products  and  deep-sea

fish. The domestic market in Singapore is too small

for  many  manufacturing industries to achieve  the

optimum   scale   of  production,   and   therefore

production  for  export  is  necessary.   In   most

developing  countries and in many of the  developed

countries, the domestic market is protected by high

tariff  barriers  so  that domestic  consumers  may

absorb completely overhead costs while exports  are

priced  at variable cost only. With a small  or  in

some  cases non-existent domestic market,  this  is

not   possible   in  Singapore.  It  follows   that

industrialisation  depends  very  largely  on   the

incentives  given  to  the export  of  manufactured

goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that profits of approved

manufacturing  companies from the export  of  their

manufactured  goods will be subject to  a  rate  of

company tax of four per cent instead of the regular

tax of 40 per cent. The same tax relief is given to

companies engaged in deep-sea fishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that separate cost accounting

for  exports and local sales is not practicable for

many   manufacturing  concerns.  Moreover,  it   is

difficult  for  the  Inland Revenue  Department  to

assess   the  exact  export  profits.   The   Bill,

therefore,   adopts  a  simplified  formula   which

assumes  that the rate of profit from export  sales

and  domestic sales is the same. To the extent that

actual profit is usually smaller than profits  from

domestic  sales, the simplified formula gives  some

additional  advantage  to exporters,  but  it  also

saves  a  lot of administrative work in the  Inland

Revenue Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the present exports of manufactured goods

other than those produced by pioneer industries are

subject  to  the  full 40 per  cent  tax,  the  tax

incentive given to exports will somewhat lower  the

total  revenue from company tax for the  first  few

years  after the adoption of the Act.  But  as  the

incentive will encourage many more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



manufacturing  industries  to  be  established   in

Singapore,  there  will  soon  be  an  increase  in

employment and income and eventually an increase in

tax  revenue  from  all sources. Also,  as  exports

increase,  the  loss  of tax  revenue  from  export

profits will decrease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To aim at maximum market diversification and to

reduce  partly  the loss of existing  revenue,  the

Bill  provides  that  in the case  of  established

markets  for certain products, the tax relief  will

apply  only  to  the increase of exports  of  these

products  to such markets. In order not  to  offset

too greatly the export incentive, and to reduce the

work  of  tax  administration,  the  condition   of

established markets will be applied only  to  cases

where   a   given   product   has   been   exported

continuously for a minimum period of five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tax relief on export profits, a company

qualifying  for  such  relief  shall  no  more   be

entitled   to  the  double  reduction  of  overseas

marketing expenditure for tax purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V aims at reducing the cost of manufacturing

companies which borrow from abroad for the purchase

of  machinery  and  equipment.  Provided  that  the

amount  of the loan is not less than $200,000,  the

interest  on such approved foreign loans  shall  be

exempt from tax, subject to the condition that such

exemption  does  not  result  in  an  increase   in

liability  to  tax  by the foreign  lender  in  his

country  of  residence.  Since  tax  liability  has

hitherto  been borne almost entirely by  the  local

borrower, this concession will reduce the borrowing

costs  and  facilitate foreign loan  investment  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing industries depend not only on

capital but also on techniques. Part VI of the  Bill

provides   that   approved   royalties,   technical

assistance  fees and contributions to research  and

development costs payable to non-residents shall be

taxed  at  20 per cent instead of the regular  non-resident  tax of 40 per cent. Such royalties,  fees

or contributions, if used to acquire ordinary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



share  capital  in  the  company  from  which  such

payments are received, shall be exempt from tax. In

special  cases, the Minister may also  exempt  such

royalties, fees or contributions from tax  even  if

they  are not used to acquire share capital in  the

company.  Tax  concessions on royalties,  fees  and

contributions  are given subject to  the  condition

that they do not result in an increase in liability

to tax in the non-resident's country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII of the Bill relates to consequential

matters  such  as  repeal of  earlier  legislation,

transitional provisions, penalties and so  on.  The

Minister  is  empowered  to  make  regulations  for

carrying out the provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I venture to suggest that this Bill, which

consolidates and expands our industrial incentives,

heralds  a  new and bright phase in our  industrial

progress,  one  which  holds  out  hopes  that  our

efforts   to  overcome  the  serious,  unemployment

problem of our time will eventually succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I close with a word of assurance to our

manufacturers? I would have liked to send this Bill

to  Select Committee if this course of action  were

at  all  feasible. But it is necessary that  export

incentives promised a year' ago become law now  and

this  rules  out consideration by Select Committee.

At  the  same  time,  I am conscious  that  further

consideration may bring about improvements and I am

open    to    suggestions   and   proposals    from

manufacturers and other interested parties,  which,

if   they   are   of  sufficient  merit,   can   be

incorporated in a future amending Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of the Bill which,

in  effect,  re-enacts the principal provisions  in

the  previous legislation governing the  industrial

development  of Singapore. As such,  the  Bill  not

only provides for the establishment of new pioneer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



industries   and   for  expansion  of   established

enterprises,  but  also  places  emphasis  on   the

production  for  export.  This  is  a  Bill   which

everyone   in  this  House  I  am  sure   supports.

Nevertheless, I have some criticism to make against

it.  It  is my regret that I do have some criticism

to   make,   especially  since  this  Bill   is   a

comprehensive   Bill   governing   the   industrial

promotion of Singapore. I appreciate that  no  Bill

can  be  perfect in the sense that it provides  for

all  possible eventualities or contingencies within

the scope of the Bill. I feel, however, that it  is

my duty to bring to the attention of this House the

main defect which I consider to be present in  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill, as stated in the Bill

itself,  is  to  amend  and  consolidate  the  laws

relating  to  incentives for the  establishment  of

pioneer   industries  and  for  economic  expansion

generally,  by way of providing relief from  income

tax  and  so  on.  It  is about seven  years  since

Singapore   embarked   on   its   industrialisation

programme.  I am surprised that during this  period

of seven years the various authorities, such as the

Economic Development Board which is responsible for

the   implementation   and   the   supervision   of

Singapore's industrialisation programme,  have  not

found it necessary to incorporate into the relevant

legislation    covering    the    industrialisation

programme   of  Singapore  a  distinction   between

genuine Singapore-based pioneer industries and non-genuine Singapore-based pioneer industries. From my

experience   as  the  Secretary  of   the   Pioneer

Industries Employers' Union, I regret to note  that

there are two such categories of pioneer industries

in  Singapore  today. In the case  of  the  genuine

Singapore-based pioneer industries which are set up

by foreign investors with or without local capital,

the   pioneer   industrial   concerns   are   fully

controlled   by  local  boards  of  directors   and

establish  for  themselves  their  own  network  of

export  markets.  In  the case of  the  non-genuine

Singapore-based  pioneer industries  which  may  be

similarly set up by foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



investors  with  or  without  local  capital,   the

pioneer   industrial  concerns  mainly   serve   as

adjuncts   to  the  overseas  industrial   concerns

belonging  to the foreign investors. The policy  of

such  local industrial concerns is dictated through

local  boards of directors with no effective power,

but  by  the foreign investors from their  overseas

headquarters.  To  give  an  example  by   way   of

illustration, a Hongkong industrialist may set up a

local  textile firm which avails itself  of  income

tax relief under the relevant legislation. In spite

of   the   stringent  provisions  in  the  relevant

legislation in respect of the valuation of  second-hand  machinery,  this Hongkong industrialist  will

benefit  immensely  from the disposal  of  obsolete

machinery from his Hongkong factory to the  pioneer

factory in Singapore. Secondly, the textile firm in

Singapore, besides meeting the negligible demand of

the  local Singapore market, does not establish for

itself  any  contact with any foreign  market.  Any

export to overseas markets is directed through  the

Hongkong   firm.  In  other  words,  the  Singapore

factory  serves  as  a  "relief"  factory  for  the

Hongkong  textile concern in the sense that  it  is

only  when  the Hongkong firm is not able  to  cope

with  orders from its overseas customers that  such

surplus  orders  are passed over to  the  Singapore

factory. Such a textile factory, in my opinion,  is

not a genuine Singapore-based pioneer factory. As I

see it, the Singapore factory is fully dependent on

its   Hongkong  principal  and  its   interest   is

subordinated  to  the  interest  of  the   Hongkong

textile  concern. It is not in the general interest

of  Singapore to have such factories which  do  not

actually  contribute to the industrial  development

of  Singapore, because the principal  objective  of

the  establishment  of  any industrial  concern  in

Singapore  is  to  establish for itself  an  export

market and enhance the reputation of Singapore-made

goods. This is not being achieved by firms such  as

the  one  which  I  have  just  described,  because

whatever it is doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



only serves to strengthen the export market for the

Hongkong firm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern is that such a firm is able to

get  the  same relief from income tax and the  same

benefit as a genuine Singapore-based industry  gets

under   the  relevant  legislation  governing   the

industrial development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other concern, which is very important to me,

is that the workers of Singapore receive a raw deal

under  the management of such a Singapore  factory.

First,  the  workers must comply with the  constant

reiteration by the Singapore Government of the need

not  to  press  for  higher wage claims  and  other

fringe  benefits  in  order to  allow  the  pioneer

industries  to  compete  effectively  in   overseas

markets.  Secondly, the workers are not assured  of

regular   employment  because  such  a  non-genuine

Singapore-based factory has no market  of  its  own

and   exists  only  as  a  factory  to   meet   the

fluctuating  marginal demands or  contingencies  of

the   Hongkong   industrial  concern.   It   is   a

regrettable state of affairs and I think it  is  of

utmost   importance   for  Singapore's   industrial

development to make a distinction between  the  two

types  of  pioneer industries in order to encourage

the   genuine  and  not  the  apparent   industrial

development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my only comment on this Bill, but it does

not  in any way detract from my support for  it.  I

only  wish  that the House will take notice  of  my

comments  and pay some attention to the  resolution

of   the   problem  of  encouraging   the   genuine

industrial development of Singapore.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Economic  Expansion  Incentives  (Relief  from

Income Tax) Bill seeks to provide additional relief

from  taxation  for enterprises whose  creation  or

expansion  of exports are in the economic interests

of the State. This Bill consolidates, re-enacts and

repeals the Pioneer Industries (Relief from Income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



Tax) Ordinance of 1959 and the Industrial Expansion

(Relief  from Income Tax) Ordinance, also of  1959.

As  such, any criticism of this Bill will, I think,

be  found in what it does not contain than what  it

does.   It   merely   consolidates   two   previous

Ordinances and grants additional tax relief, but it

does  not  nor is it designed to change  the  basic

character  of tax legislation. I believe that  what

is   urgently  required  is  a  comprehensive   re-examination  of  the fundamentals of  our  taxation

structure  and system. After all, this  Bill  seeks

only to supplement the income Tax Ordinance, and if

what  it seeks to supplement is not the best,  then

the  best  it can do cannot be the best.  In  other

words, it is circumscribed from the start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, a highly controversial matter

as  to  whether or not our present taxation  system

and  structure retards economic growth. There  does

not seem to be any controversy. Indeed, it seems to

be  taken for granted by almost everybody that  our

tax system is not conducive to economic growth.  If

this  is  the  situation, that is,  where  everyone

agrees  that  it  is  not good and  disagrees  only

whether  it  is bad, then I say that the  time  has

come  when serious thinking should be done  on  its

change.  There  will  be  the  traditionalists  who

regard  any  change with horror and who rest  their

case  on  custom  and  usage  -the  solid  base  of

inertia. On the other hand, there will be those who

believe  that a revision of our present tax  system

solves  all  problems  associated  with  industrial

expansion.  The  truth  probably  lies,  as   truth

usually does, somewhere in between. It is here that

I  think the Government can profitably explore. The

process will probably take at least a year  or  two

before  the  truth  is  found  and  implemented.  I

suggest   that   a   Commission   with   as    wide

representation  as possible be appointed  forthwith

to  review the principles and administration of our

present tax system and to make recommendations  for

changes. This Commission should set out to discover

ways  and means of simplifying and modernising  our

income tax structure. Indeed, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



the necessary men can be found - I have no reason to

believe that in our island of talents we have  this

shortage  - I  will even go further to suggest  that

another Commission be appointed to review our  laws

on  property  tax. In our need for  rapid  economic

development,  we should not ignore an aspect  which

plays  a  very important part in either stimulating

or  retarding economic growth. I think everyone  in

this  House will agree with those outside that  our

property  tax laws are rather archaic  and  require

modernisation. Property owners have been  heard  to

complain rather bitterly -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lim, I am afraid your

comments  on the Property Tax Ordinance are  rather

outside the scope of the Bill under discussion. You

will be in order if you can relate your remarks  to

income  tax  problems connected with  property  tax

paid  by industries or companies to which this Bill

will, when enacted, apply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, that is what I have in

mind.  Property owners have been heard to  complain

rather    bitterly    and    vociferously     about

discrepancies   and  differences   in   rates   and

valuations that cannot be justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill before the House can at least

supplement  if not correct our present  income  tax

system   by   offering  incentives  to  investments

through  reliefs  from income tax. Such  incentives

can  at  best  be stop-gap temporary  measures  and

should  be examined in the light of possibly better

things  to  come.  All  the  reliefs  proposed  for

pioneer     industries,    expanding    established

industries  and  export industries relate  directly

back  to  the rather old and cumbersome  method  of

income  taxation which asks incorporated  companies

to  act as tax collecting agents for the Government

in   the  case  of  distributed  profits,  and   as

taxpayers in the case of retained profits.  Such  a

system has little philosophy, less rationale and no

equity.  It  operates  this  way.  A  company  does

business for a year and makes a profit. It pays  40

per cent of that profit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



as  tax, if it distributes that profit as dividends

in  that  year, then its shareholders get  the  tax

credit  and adjust it against their personal  rates

in  the  third year. On the other hand, the company

may  not  distribute  the profit  until  ten  years

later.  In this case, the shareholders will  adjust

their tax credits in the twelfth year against their

personal rates. During this time, many shareholders

may   have   disposed  of  their  shares   to   new

shareholders  who  have taken them  over.  The  old

shareholder  would  have  sold  his  shares  at  an

enhanced  price  incorporating the  profit  of  the

company  and the tax credit. What is more is  that

the  profit  from the sale of the  shares  will  be

regarded  as non-taxable capital gain and  the  new

shareholder  in  reality  gets  back  part  of  his

capital   by  way  of  the  dividends  subsequently

declared on which he has to pay tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from this that our present tax

withholding system upon which is based the  further

reliefs proposed by this Bill before the House does

not   lend   itself  to  accurate  or  even   close

estimation of the effects of the reliefs either  in

quantum  or on the persons considered desirable  to

enjoy them. It is widely held that one of the  most

important  factors conducive to economic growth  is

the  presence  of large joint-stock companies  with

capital spread over a large number of shareholders.

Such   being   the  case,  it  is  important   that

shareholders   should  shoulder  their   true   tax

liabilities  or enjoy their true tax  reliefs.  Our

present tax structure does not provide this, and it

follows that the present Bill does not so provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not saying that we should

not  have the present Bill before us made into law.

What  I do say is that we should not stop with  it.

We  should  only  regard it as a  stop-gap  measure

while  we revise our present tax structure. I  say,

let  us try to make this Bill work in order to give

us time to work out a better one, which, apart from

ease, certainty and fairness to the taxpayers, will

at  least  enable  the Government to  estimate  its

revenue from.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



profits  made by the companies rather than  on  the

probable    time   and   quantity   of    dividends

distributed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can go on, Sir, for quite some time on the

merits  of a corporation tax instead of our present

withholding tax. But as we are not debating a  Bill

to  establish corporation tax, I should now like to

deal with the provisions of the present Bill, after

having  established the point that  we  should  not

expect too much from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (9) of clause 14 is held by many as

unduly  restrictive. This sub-clause restricts  the

carry-through    tax    exemption    benefits    to

shareholders  of  a holding company  to  one  which

holds throughout the tax relief period of a pioneer

company  either  all  the  issued  shares  or  such

portion  of the shares as the Finance Minister  may

require at the time when the pioneer certificate is

issued  to the pioneer company. I do not think  the

Minister  will  be  an  unreasonable  man  when  he

determines  the  portion  of  pioneer  shares   the

holding company should have. But the Bill does  not

allow  him  to change his mind should  the  holding

company,  for one reason or another, all  good  and

valid  reasons, wishes to change its shareholdings.

Unless the Minister can give cogent reasons  why  a

holding  company should not vary its  shareholdings

at  all,  I am of the view that he should at  least

arm  himself  with  the  powers  to  agree  to   a

variation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (5) of clause 19 does not appear to be

a  favourable incentive to expanding enterprises in

that  its terms are rather restrictive. It must  be

borne  in  mind  that we are a young industrialised

country  and  cannot  compare  with  those   highly

industrialised  countries in  other  parts  of  the

world.  Practically every country in this  part  of

the  world  is  competing against one  another  for

investment. In the face of such competition. I feel

we  should  give serious consideration to affording

relief  by way of investment allowances which  have

been   found  to  be  a  more  practical  form   of

inducement to investment. If it is found  advisable

to adopt the investment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



allowance method as an incentive, clause  17,

especially  sub-clause (1) (a) and (b) ,  will  need

revision either in principle or in quantum,  or  in

both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many manufacturers are apprehensive of the

possible administrative difficulties in the use  of

the words "established export market" contained  in

Part IV of the Bill. Such a fear may or may not  be

justified depending not on the legislation  but  on

the  attitude  of the tax authorities  implementing

the legislation. Not being a legal man, I am not in

a  position to propose the necessary amendments  to

the  Bill, but I should like the Minister to narrow

down  the  possibilities of lengthy  and  fruitless

arguments between taxpayer and tax collector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another dissatisfaction from manufacturers,

especially from the established ones, is  that  the

incentives  proposed give more to the new  exporter

and  discriminate against the old exporters.  Here,

we  are  dealing with a Bill which seeks to  induce

new  exporters,  and there is much to  justify  the

philosophy of not running after the bus when it  is

already  caught.  But the sour note  introduced  by

differential  treatment may either  cause  friction

amongst  manufacturers or induce old  manufacturers

to   create  subsidiary  companies  ostensibly   to

manufacture  those products that  are  exported  or

export  to new markets for the purpose of re-export

to  the  established markets. If the Minister  does

not wish to change his mind on not running after  a

caught  bus,  I  feel he should  examine  the  many

possible ways of tax avoidance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts V and VI of the Bill operate largely around

the key words "bona fides". Everyone knows that  it

is  extremely difficult to determine bona fides  in

the business world. There are so many forms and  so

many  disguises.  I  know  that  it  is  even  more

difficult  to  legislate on what  constitutes  bona

fides,  but  I should like the Minister  to  assist

manufacturing  exporters with some  general  guide-lines,  so  that  those wanting  foreign  loans  or

foreign  technical assistance are  better  able  to

proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these reservations, I

support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> I never said Hongkong

industrialists.  I only said, as  an  illustration,

Hongkong industrialists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nevertheless, he has given us

to  understand that these are the people. The point

is this: is he suggesting that if Hongkong or other

industrialists  want to establish a  subsidiary  in

Singapore  which can provide useful employment  for

our   unemployed,   we  should  turn   down   their

applications? Is that his proposition? I  doubt  if

he  means that. I think his main objection  is  the

manner  in  which  some  of these  enterprises  are

carried  on,  namely, that work is irregular,  that

workers  are  laid off from time  to  time.  May  I

suggest to him that this does not really depend  on

whether  the  local  plant is  a  subsidiary  of  a

foreign firm, or whether it is run by a local board

of  directors,  irregular demand is the  result  of

irregular market conditions, and whether  you  have

one  form  of enterprise as against the  other,  so

long  as  market  conditions  are  erratic,  it  is

unavoidable  that  you  get  irregular  periods  of

employment.  This is true not only in  the  textile

industry  but  also generally in  other  industries

subject  to  very wide fluctuations in  the  export

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought that one of the great merits

of  Hongkong industrialists is that they  not  only

bring   their   capital  and  their   know-how   to

Singapore, but they also bring their export market.

It  is  all  very  well to say that  the  Singapore

management  can  develop export markets  which  are

more  steady and more reliable. There are very  few

Singapore manufacturers with much experience in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



overseas export markets. And the great contribution

that Hongkong industrialists have made to Singapore

is  that  this  problem of marketing  is  virtually

solved  by them. Of course, I would agree  that  it

would  be a good thing if there could be a  greater

continuity  of  employment. No  one  would  dispute

that.  But, unfortunately, continuity of employment

sometimes depends on factors outside the control of

the enterprise in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Telok Blangah is confusing

the  early days of the textile business when it  is

true  that  Singapore firms were  using  quotas  or

unused quotas of their Hongkong main companies. But

this  was  very  soon settled when  countries  like

Britain  and  America  gave  separate  quotas   for

Singapore   manufacturers.   As   soon   as    this

arrangement  came  into effect, the  production  in

Singapore  plants was related to the quota  allowed

for the plants, and not related to the  quota

given to the Hongkong principals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the comments of the Member for

Havelock. I think he has made a study of this Bill.

He  says that it does not introduce any fundamental

change  in  the  tax system of the  Government.  Of

course, this is true - this Bill is not intended  to

introduce any basic changes. It only makes  certain

concessions in order to promote industrial  growth.

Whether   the  present  time  is  appropriate   for

commission of the tax system is a matter on which I

think  people can have different opinions.  It  has

been  urged  upon me that our tax system  needs  an

overhaul.  If so, this is a subject which  must  be

considered on its own merits and not in relation to

whether  a better tax system would promote economic

expansion.  I would have thought that  one  of  the

main  objectives of having a better  tax  structure

would be the more efficient collection of revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of export incentives, the Member

for  Havelock  makes the point, which  has  already

been put to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



me  by  other  people, that this Bill would  unduly

favour  the  new  industrialists  as  compared   to

established  firms  with a long  record  of  export

performance. He suggests that this might tempt  the

older  industries  to  create  subsidiaries  or  to

disguise  themselves as separate legal entities  in

order to obtain the benefits of tax exemption. I do

not  think this is possible because what determines

whether   a  particular  product  will  enjoy   tax

exemption is not whether the firm producing  it  is

new  or  old. It is whether in the past such  goods

have  been  exported  in continuing  amounts  to  a

certain  established market, and  if  that  is  the

case,  then  neither the old firm  nor,  if  it  is

disguised as a new firm, it will get this  benefit.

The  only people who will get this benefit are  the

old  firms  who  have improved  on  their  previous

performances,  and if it is a new firm,  then  they

will   have   to   improve  on   the   old   firm's

performances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the provision of bona fides in Part V

of  this Bill, I would have thought that this is  a

very  simple  matter. This is  to  ensure  that  no

fictitious  loans or transactions  are  created  to

enjoy  exemption  from tax and  bona  fides  really

means  that the transactions or the loans on  which

tax  exemption is being asked for represent genuine

business transactions, subject, of course,  to  the

minimum  limits  laid down in the  law.  I  do  not

expect that there would be much trouble about this.

But  if  this is a matter which still disturbs  the

Member,  I  would be very glad if he could  let  me

know exactly what is causing him anxiety. There may

be  a  real  point which is causing  anxiety  among

businessmen, in which case I would be very glad  to

give  any  further clarification on  this,  but  it

should  be  on rather concrete proposals.  I  think

these remarks would cover most of the points he has

raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Clause 14, Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member was speaking on

sub-clause (9) of clause14.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would have thought that sub-clause (9) prevents a pioneer certificate from

being  bought and sold between companies.  I  think

that  is  the  intention. It is certainly  not  the

intention  of  this  clause  to  place  unnecessary

limitations on legitimate business transactions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Act, 1966, which came into force on

1st January, 1967, provides that, in the case of  a

Singapore insurer who is registered under  the  Act

and  subsequently ceases to be so  registered,  the

Accountant-General   may   retain   the   insurer's

statutory  deposit until such time as the Insurance

Commissioner    is    satisfied    that    adequate

arrangements have been made by the said insurer  to

meet contingent liabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to give the Accountant-General the

same  powers in relation to existing insurers whose

applications  for registration under the  Act  have

been  refused. It is desirable that the Accountant-General  should  have such powers, as  an  existing

insurer who fails to obtain registration under  the

Act  is,  as  far  as  contingent  liabilities  are

concerned,  in  the same position as  a  registered

insurer who ceases to be registered.

<div align="center"><b>POLICY ON CULTURAL ACTIVITIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  time passes  very  quickly.  I

remember  on  this day last year I  spoke  in  this

Parliament  on  the  adjournment  on  "Culture   in

Singapore's  Nation-Building". It  is  exactly  one

year  since that occasion. I also remember that  in

the  course  of that speech I proposed a  ten-point

suggestion relating to the question of our cultural

construction,  including  the  formulation   of   a

national  cultural policy, the establishment  of  a

cultural  consultative committee, a  national  film

studio,  a national academy of arts and the holding

of  a  cultural  festival, etc.  These  suggestions

have,  in  fact,  largely been implemented  by  the

Ministry  of  Culture this year. This indeed  gives

much cause for pleasure and encouragement. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



Government's  efforts  in  promoting  cultural  and

artistic activities, the establishment of the  Arts

Council,  the  building of a  national  academy  of

arts,   and   the   holding  of  creative   singing

competitions  for the promotion  of  our  arts  and

culture   deserve  our  unanimous   praise.   These

achievements should be attributed to the  effective

planning  and  leadership of our able Minister  for

Culture and Social Affairs who is not here now, the

Minister   of   State   for   Culture,   and    the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Culture,  as well as to the full support  given  by

society. As for the humble opinion given by myself,

I  dare  not brag of its contributing merit in  any

way. I was doing my duty as a representative of the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me review the general

conditions and cultural activities in the past  one

year.  In  the past one year there have  been  more

cultural and artistic activities than in any period

previously. This surely is an encouraging sign.  Of

these activities, those on a larger scale were  the

cultural nights and recreational concerts organised

by   the   People's  Association;   dramas,   local

traditional  plays and concerts,  etc.,  staged  by

various  civic  organisations. Some of  our  P.A.P.

branches, including the Sembawang Branch, also  put

in some effort to promote local plays. In addition,

in  the fields of painting and photography, many of

our  young artists and photographers held  numerous

public exhibitions, presenting to the people  their

works on the description of the lives of the people

and  reflecting the social realities. At  the  same

time, many cultural and artistic organisations from

abroad  came  here to perform, such as the  Russian

dance  troupe, the Hongkong Sin Tian  Chye  Teochew

drama  company,  and the Hongkong  Thye  Loon  Hong

Cantonese drama company, etc., who brought  to  our

masses novel cultural recreations. According to the

statistics of the Ministry of Culture, from January

to  October  this  year  various  cultural  nights,

dramas, plays, concerts, choirs, carnivals, art and

photographic exhibitions, etc., were  held  at  the

National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



Theatre, Victoria Theatre and the Victoria Memorial

Hall,  on  217 occasions, some of which carried  on

for  one  or two weeks at a stretch. If these  were

added  together,  Sir, there  would  be  about  300

occasions  of such activities. In other  words,  in

our   country  there  are  different  cultural  and

artistic  activities held every day to  enrich  the

spiritual lives of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now follow up with the radio and

television  programmes. In the past one year  there

have  certainly been quite a lot of changes in  the

programmes. We now have such programmes as  "It  is

Happening in Singapore", the introduction  of  art,

music  for the home, etc. At the same time, through

the exchange of new films with other countries,  we

are  able to view the latest documentary news films

of  many  countries. For instance, recently  Russia

celebrated  her  50th anniversary  of  the  October

Revolution.  Our  people  were  able   to   see   a

documentary  film  on this quite  soon  thereafter.

Besides  these, Television Singapura also  arranged

forums on political and social topics to enable the

people   to  have  more  understanding   of   these

questions.    Such   programmes   certainly    have

educational value and I hope we will have  more  of

them hereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>6.23 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a programme on physical exercise,

teaching people how to get fit, but it has suddenly

disappeared.  In fact, this sort of  programmes  on

physical  and health education should not  only  be

preserved but also further developed. For  example,

the  pugilistic  art  is now very  popular  in  our

country.  Some of its basic movements should  prove

very  suitable  if made into films as instructional

material for broadcast to the viewers to help  them

learn  them.  Of  course,  in  the  beginning   the

reaction of the viewers may not be favourable,  but

if  Television Singapura persists and uses  various

methods to publicise the good points about learning

physical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



exercise for health, I believe there will gradually

be good results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Radio and Television Singapura has great

responsibilities   in   spreading   knowledge   and

promoting  culture  among the people.  At  present,

there are 67,000 sound receiver licence holders and

76,000   combined  sound  and  television  receiver

licence holders. From these figures we can see  the

popularity  of radio and television in our  country

and the extensive influence they wield.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to touch on Government's

policy  on  culture.  The  Minister  of  State  for

Culture,  Mr Lee Khoon Choy, on the 22nd  of  July

this  year, made a speech at a meeting of  the  Y's

Men's Club of Singapore on the topic "Search for  a

national culture in a multi-racial society". And on

the  12th of October he made another speech at  the

Rotary Club of Singapore West meeting on the  topic

"The  Role of the Singapore Arts Council". Each  of

these  two  speeches numbering  some  10,000  words

distinctively    and   comprehensively    expounded

Government's cultural policy. The Minister of State

has  demonstrated his resolute endeavour to promote

culture  and the arts of our country.  For  this  I

would  like to pay my heartfelt thanks to him.  But

following this praise, I must criticise what he has

already said. To show you what sort of criticism is

forthcoming, I wish to quote from his speech on the

"Search  for  a national culture in a  multi-racial

society". He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As democratic socialists, we do not believe that

the state should interfere with the private life of

the  individual or decide the taste for the  people

in the field of art and culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not tell the people what types of

clothing or hair-do they should put on. Would it be

proper for the state to say what is the right music

and   what  is  wrong  music  and  dictate  to  the

musicians   what  type  of  orchestral   theme   or

orchestration they must follow?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people get the impression that it is the

function  of the Ministry of Culture to  decide  on

the  pattern of clothings all Singaporeans have  to

wear or make music, dances and plays which must  be

followed  by  the  people.  This  may  be   so   in

totalitarian  countries  which  tend  to  put   the

writers,  artists, composers and generally cultural

workers into uniform.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of totalitarianism, call it "cultural

revolution" or any name you like, is to destroy the

autonomy  of every sphere of life and to bring  all

fields of thought under the control of the State.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in another passage the Minister of State

also said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The pluralist theory demands that science,

music,   literature  or  art  will  have  its   own

autonomy.  Autonomy  does not  mean  that  science,

music  and  other  forms  of  art  have  no  social

function and social responsibilities.'



<br><br>He continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We feel that it is up to musicians, artists,

scientists,  the cultural workers, the  people  and

the   representatives  of  the  Government  to  get

together to discover ways and means of raising  the

musical  level or generally the artistic  level  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ways and means will also have to be found for

enlisting  music, art, painting,  drama  and  other

forms  of  artistic  expressions  in  the  task  of

instilling  national consciousness, a common  sense

of  loyalty to the nation and generally  in  nation

building.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully appreciate that through these

passages the Minister of State for Culture has made

clear  the  enlightened attitude of the  Government

towards  the  problems  of art  and  culture.  This

attitude  advocates  free competition  amongst  the

development  of different kinds of art and  culture

in  our  country. At the same time,  this  attitude

also emphasises the social responsibility of art or

culture   in  imbuing  the  people  with   national

consciousness, undivided loyalty and the concept of

nation  building. This then is the positive  aspect

of the Government's attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in his talk on the "The Role of the

Singapore Arts Council", the Minister of State  for

Culture  again made clear his democratic  stand  on

the  question of having different arts and cultures

when he said -I quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The lighter entertainment programmes provided by

the  entertainment  industry have  an  overpowering

narcotic  effect on the mass audiences who  consume

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this background that the Arts

Council was formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democracy, the Arts Council or even the

Government has certain limitations in deciding what

is good or bad for the people. That is the price we

have to pay for democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been suggestions by some high-brow

intellectuals  and those who are more puritanically

minded that we should ban the twist, the a-go-go or

even the James Bond, pictures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others felt that the lowbrow entertainment

programmes should not be shown at all over the T.V.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democracy, particularly where the population

is  multi-racial,  multi-religious,  multi-cultural

and  multi-lingual, is it right for any section  of

the  community to impose its cultural taste  on  to

the others?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another passage, he also said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I do not believe that the passive methods of

banning this or that would solve problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires mental ruggedness to accept the

challenge to win over the minds of the young people

to  the  side  of disciplined appreciation  of  the

worthier things in life instead of allowing them to

be  won  over  by the sheer debasing, sub-artistic,

uncivilised entertainments.'



<br><br>The Minister of State continued, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The lop-sided entertainment type of mass culture

via  the mass media while useful in performing  its

function to dispel the boredom for the more elderly

tired  mind, may be harmful in corrupting the minds

of the youth and teenagers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obnoxious aspects of all of these mass

media and mass culture are those that destroy their

sense  of  value, and corrode their willingness  to

pay attention to serious thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the main functions of the Arts

Council  to see that our youths retain their  sense

of balance and mental ruggedness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to do so not by the passive way of

wanting  this  or that banned, but by  constructive

measures.'



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the two speeches delivered

by  the  Minister of State for Culture on  cultural

policies  of the Government, I can draw  two  major

conclusions.  One is to encourage and  support  the

development of the arts and cultures of the various

communities, and the other is to accept with strong

will-power  the  challenge from "narcotic"  culture

which it is not proposed to ban but with which  the

vigorous  development of healthy arts and  cultures

must compete



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



peacefully. While this enlightened attitude  is  to

be praised, there arises the question of whether we

can  overcome  the  culture with narcotic  effects.

This is precisely the question for the attention of

the Minister. Will this kind of culture, if allowed

to  go  on its way, impede our constructive efforts

in  the promotion of healthy culture and art?  Will

its  narcotic  effects poison  and  demoralise  our

younger generation? Does it have any adverse effect

on  the vigorous and rugged society that we seek to

build?  These  are  the problems  that  arouse  our

anxiety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some undergraduates of an institution

of  higher  learning  in one  of  our  neighbouring

countries  were reported to have openly  invited  a

strip-teaser  for a performance. This dishonourable

incident  caused  an  uproar  in  the  country   in

question  and is worthy of our vigilance. In  fact,

some West European countries are bedevilled with  a

serious   social  problem  arising   out   of   the

"hippies". These are the crazy boys and  girls  who

indulge in the beatnik and degenerated way of life.

What  a  pity  they  are!  In  some  other  Western

countries,  the teenagers also indulge  in  corrupt

pleasures.   These  young  people  are   desultory,

slovenly  and  unproductive, and have dragged  down

their  national economy. Tracing the cause of  this

serious social problem in the West, one finds  that

it  is  closely  associated with the  laissez-faire

cultural  policy which allows narcotic  and  erotic

culture   to  flourish  freely  and  the  lack   of

attention to ethical concepts. Therefore, in  order

to  ensure  that  our  society will  develop  along

healthy  lines  and succeed in bringing  up  a  new

generation  of vigorous and rugged people,  I  feel

that  we  should not adopt a laissez-faire attitude

towards  narcotic  and erotic  culture.  At  least,

restrictive measures should be taken to contain the

growth  of  such  culture. Far from being  passive,

this  is a positive step which is as proper as  the

surgical  operation required for the removal  of  a

malignant ulcer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ours is a democratic socialist

Government.  We know that democratic socialism  has

had a history



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



of more than a hundred years and that it is still a

vital  force  surging  forward.  In  the  field  of

politics,  we  advocate equal rights  for  men  and

women  and the right of all citizens to participate

in  politics  while  striving to  provide  a  sound

institutional framework for our State. In the field

of  economics,  we stand for industrialisation  and

the   utilisation   of  advanced   scientific   and

technological  know-how as a means  to  better  the

livelihood  of the broad masses of the  people.  In

the  realm  of  culture,  I  think  the  democratic

socialist  ideas  of  art  and  culture  should  be

patriotic,   not   traitorous,   progressive,   not

degenerative, positive, not negative, salutary, not

deleterious,   full  of  instructive   morals   and

glorifying   the   dignity  of   labour   and   its

creativeness,  not tending to corrupt  and  corrode

the  minds of our youths. It follows that in  order

to  promote  patriotic and progressive culture,  we

must get rid of all decadent cultures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say something about the

Arts   Council.  Ever  since  it  was  formed   and

registered as a body corporate in August this year,

it has lost no time in launching out into all kinds

of  cultural and artistic activities of  which  the

most  notable  one is the project  to  build  a  $3

million  National Art Gallery and  Academy  of  the

Arts.  When  news of the project became  known,  it

immediately gained the enthusiastic support of  the

public  who donated generously towards the building

fund  which now stands at over $700,000.  More  and

more  civic  organisations are  planning  to  raise

funds  for  the  project  through  the  staging  of

concerts  and variety shows. The Arts  Council  and

the   National  Theatre  Trust  will  also  jointly

organise  a  big  scale Trade  Fair  for  the  same

purpose. Meanwhile, the Press is also doing its bit

by lending its support to the project. For example,

in  its  editorial of 1st September entitled  "Give

generously  to  the building of the  Singapore  Art

so that the hope of having a sixth higher institute

of learning in Singapore can materialise sooner.'



<br><br>At  about the same time on 8th August, the  Nanyang

Siang  Pau also voiced its support for the building

of the National Art Gallery and Academy of the Arts

by writing editorially:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We earnestly hope that with the support of all

of  us  the  task undertaken by the Singapore  Arts

Council to build a National Art Gallery and Academy

of the Arts will be accomplished soon.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, it is my firm belief  That  with

the  support of the various communities and  people

in all walks of life and the Press, the building of

the  National Art Gallery and Academy of the  Arts,

which will have a great mission to perform, will be

completed according to schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been tremendous

development in our nation's culture and art in  the

past  one year - a milestone in the history  of  our

nation's  culture and art development. When  I  say

this,  I  am  not giving excessive  praise  to  the

Ministry of Culture, because the fact is that  1967

has  really  been a year of rapid  growth  of  our

nation's culture. However, we must not be contented

with  what we have done. On the contrary,  we  must

redouble  our  efforts to enable  our  multi-racial

culture to blossom into brilliant flowers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make three suggestions to the

Ministry  of Culture and three suggestions  to  the

Arts Council relating to the culture and art of our

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I believe that the Ministry of Culture

should   organise   an  annual  national   Cultural

Festival  to  provide  an opportunity  for  various

races   to   appreciate  and  enjoy  the  different

cultures  and  arts and to learn from one  another.

This  will not only enrich the spiritual  lives  of

the people but will also make it possible to select

talent from the various cultural groups and  train

them  to  form  .a  national  corps  of  performing

artistes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



Their  duty  will  be to show the rich  and  multi-coloured cultures of the Republic when they  go  on

performing  tours  abroad.  In  this  respect,  the

Ministry  of  Social Affairs has already  made  its

Festival  an  annual affair, while the Ministry  of

Education also holds its Youth Festival annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is the setting up of a

national  film  studio to produce films  which  are

educational  in nature or films which  portray  the

task   of  nation  building.  I  put  forward  this

suggestion last year, but the reply I received then

was that there was a lack of funds for the project.

In my opinion, I think our Republic with its highly

developed  economy  can  afford  to  set  aside   a

considerable  sum of money for such a purpose.  The

need  for such expenditure is more compelling  when

all  are agreed that investment in culture and art,

just  as  investment in education, is a  worthwhile

investment.  Therefore, I hope  that  the  Minister

will give serious consideration to my proposal.  At

the  same  time, I also hope that the Minister  for

Finance  will  be generous enough  to  approve  the

expenditure for such projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion is that in order to enable

the   labouring  class  to  enjoy  and   appreciate

performances  given  by foreign  artistes  who  are

sponsored  by  the National Theatre  Trust,  it  is

necessary for the Trust to adopt a moderate pricing

policy   with  regard  to  the  sale  of  admission

tickets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make three suggestions to the

Singapore Arts Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as to the national theatre for art and

culture,  the  Council should have a  comprehensive

policy  and a series of measures to carry out  this

policy  in  order  to better promote  cultural  and

artistic activities in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if it is possible, the Council should

take immediate steps to train the various kinds  of

artists and teachers who in turn will have to teach

their  students  to become artists in  the  various

fields. Moreover, it must accept the responsibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



of  launching  out  into  all  kinds   of

cultural activities in every nook and corner of our

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I understand that some of our artists are

living  in  wretched poverty.  To  enable  them  to

concentrate  on  their work, I  think  the  Council

should have plans to look after their livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I recite a poem to eulogise

the Ministry of Culture for its achievement:



<pre>

               `Blossoming are the flowers of culture

                      everywhere,



                Each vieing with one another in beauty and

                      colour,



                Great is the achievement of the Ministry of

                      Culture,



                And may your name be for ever remembered

                      in the annals of our nation.'

</pre>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I trust that the Member appreciates

that when he refers to "your name", he is referring

to  the Chair and not to any Member on the Floor of

the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for Sembawang spoke at length on the policy

of the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short space of time that I have been

attached  to  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  I   have

observed  the Ministry carrying out its  objectives

of  keeping  our  people informed and  successfully

bringing  about  cultural integration  quietly  and

without  fuss.  Considerable  changes  in  cultural

revolutions  take place in countries from  time  to

time   in  accordance  with  the  change  of  time,

conditions,  and  environment  which  transform   a

society  radically  into  the  new  trend  and  new

situation.  There are countries which  follow  `the

cultural  revolution with violence and strife,  and

there  are  countries  which  follow  the  cultural

changes with guided or no democracy at all. But  we

in  a democratic State can only explain, encourage,

and  prepare  the ground and provide the  necessary

incentives  for  a  revolution  and  growth  of   a

national concept of our own. But given our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



ability in innovation and change, I am sure that in

due   course   a   culture,  embodying   the   best

characteristics  of  our heritage  and  traditions,

will emerge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959 when the Ministry of Culture was first

set   up,  there  was  little  cultural  amity   in

Singapore.  The various cultural and racial  groups

tended  to  look inwards, being proud of their  own

traditions,  and  were isolated from  one  another.

Cultural integration seemed hardly a practical idea

then.  Now,  after  eight years,  it  can  be  said

without   fear  that  there  has  been  a  definite

breaking  down of these barriers that stem cultural

progress. There is acceptance of the fact that in a

multi-racial and multi-lingual society  the  people

must  co-operate along cultural lines  to  forge  a

national identity and the awareness of belonging to

our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the ages nations have been split

asunder as a result of cultural differences arising

from  differences in race, religion, language,  and

so  on.  Only a few days ago there was a threat  of

war  in an island in the West, and it is clear that

the  problems there became acute, partly from  `the

indifference to attempt to integrate the  two  main

racial  groups with the different cultures in  the'

island.  We cannot afford such a happening  in  our

island of Singapore, and hence we have to be  aware

of the need for a common culture to weld our people

together  into  a  tightly-knit  society.   It   is

important,  therefore, that we  should  not  become

complacent  and slacken our efforts to bring  about

cultural  co-operation and integration.  The  years

ahead,  therefore, call for an even more  intensive

pursuit   of  our  present  cultural  policy.   The

Ministry of Culture is making strenuous efforts  in

the  pursuit of these objectives despite shortages

of  staff and funds, but in the knowledge  that  we

are  racing against time. Therefore, in order  that

there  can  be  no  let-up in our  activities,  the

Ministry is doing everything it can in the  pursuit

of our national objectives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

first of all, I wish to thank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



the  Member for Sembawang for his kind words  about

me  and for his constructive criticisms. His  words

are  very  encouraging. But at the  same  time  his

praise is a little embarrassing, because if we  can

say  that cultural activities in Singapore  in  the

past   year   have   really   developed   and   are

flourishing,  then credit should be  given  to  the

civic  organisations of art, the  various  cultural

workers, and those of our people who love art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in a democracy, the Ministry of

Culture  is  not  a  Ministry  to  create  art  and

culture. Neither is it a controlling Ministry in so

far  as  culture is concerned. Art and culture  are

matters  which should come spontaneously  from  the

people,  from the art groups, and from the cultural

workers.  Art  and culture must come  up  from  the

ground to the top, and not imposed from the top  on

to  the ground. So if we only have to depend  on  a

government  agency like the Ministry of Culture  to

create a national culture, then in my view we  will

certainly  fail in our objectives,  because,  as  I

say,  the  Ministry of Culture is  not  a  creative

Ministry.  All that it can do is to give some  form

of  assistance  and encouragement.  So  it  is  the

people  themselves, the cultural workers,  who  are

responsible for the creation of a national culture.

And   if  the  flowers  of  culture  should   bloom

everywhere,  then  the  credit  should  go  to  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang said a few moments ago

that  in  the  establishment of the Singapore  Arts

Council, the setting up of the Academy of Arts, and

the  National Gallery, there might have  been  some

misunderstanding about the Singapore  Arts  Council

simply because he was under the impression that  it

was   set  up  by  the  Government.  In  fact,  the

Singapore  Arts  Council was  not  set  up  by  the

Government. It was set up by the joint  efforts  of

civic organisations active in the field of art.  In

fact,  both  the National Academy of Arts  and  the

National  Gallery will be set up through the  joint

efforts  of  civic  organisations.  So  since   the

response has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



come  from  the  people, the  Government  must,  of

course,  do its own share by co-operating with  the

people   in   order  to  bring  about  an   earlier

realisation of our objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Sembawang also

mentioned the song competition. This competition is

organised by the Singapore Arts Council and not  by

the  Ministry  of  Culture.  So  we  must  draw   a

distinction between the two bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang made a reference to the

sudden    disappearance   of   physical    exercise

programmes on television. I have an explanation  to

give  for  it. Initially, we telecast a  series  of

about 26 programmes on physical exercises. Then  we

had    "The   daily   dozen",   a   programme    on

callisthenics. All these programmes  were  produced

in  series,  and  they  have  all  been  completely

telecast.  So we are now faced with the problem  of

materials for a new programme. Through the Ministry

of Culture, the Broadcasting Department has written

a  letter to the National Sports Central Board  for

their co-operation in this matter. All along, these

programmes  on  physical exercises or callisthenics

involved   basketball,  table  tennis,  and   other

exercises  and  games, both indoors  and  outdoors.

Most of the viewers treated such programmes as  any

other  television programmes. There was  no  active

participation on the part of viewers.  So  we  hope

that  the National Sports Central Board can  assist

us  by  teaching people how to play,  for  example,

basketball, tennis, table tennis, football, or  any

other  game.  In other words, we require  programme

materials to teach the people the skills  in  these

games.  These programmes will be telecast,  and  we

hope  that we can get adequate assistance  and  co-operation. In this way, viewers will not just  view

for  the  sake of viewing but they will  have  some

form of active participation in the programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the National Pugilistic Arts

Council  has  just  been established,  and  we  are

preparing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



get  in touch with this Council for help by way  of

coaches and materials. We want them to help  us  by

getting someone to demonstrate on television how to

take  up the pugilistic art. This is a part of  our

future programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time T.V. Singapura is also making

headway not only in the field of sports but also in

art.  They  are planning together with the  various

organisations  a full programme for  the  whole  of

next  year.  This  programme will  emphasise  local

creations  of the arts, such as dances  and  music,

and  other  forms of artistic expression.  In  this

way,  we will have more local works of art for  the

consumption  of our people, and such artistic  work

will  reflect  the  aspirations and  lives  of  our

people,  so  that  they will see some  glimpses  of

themselves on television. In doing all this and  in

implementing this programme, we cannot satisfy  the

interests  and needs of each and every one  at  the

same  time  because  there  is  a  time  limit   in

televising programmes. For example, in one month we

allocate  a  certain  number  of  hours   for   the

pugilistic art. Other programmes will then have  to

wait; programmes such as table tennis, because  of

limitation  of funds and time. This,  I  hope,  the

people will appreciate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to deal with another aspect raised

by   the  Member  for  Sembawang.  He  has  quoted

extensively from the two speeches I gave  recently.

The  impression  I  get is that he  seems  to  have

misunderstood  what  I said. For  example,  he  has

alleged  that  I  do  not propose  to  ban  harmful

narcotic culture. This is a misunderstanding.  What

I  said was that I do not wish to ban this or that.

I  have  not said that I do not want to ban harmful

narcotic  culture.  So I have to  explain  that  by

"this  and that", I meant those forms which  appear

to  be  yellow  but are not actually  yellow.  Some

people  may  say  that a certain artistic  form  is

yellow,  others may not. So this is a  question  of

opinion.  It  is difficult for one to impose  one's

views on another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



person. It is also a matter of degree. For example,

in  the  field of art, if you go to Paris to  learn

art, the first lesson you may have could be to draw

a  model  in  the nude. So what yardstick  are  you

going  to  adopt? If you want to measure yellowness

by  the  weight of clothing, then I would say  that

ballet dancers have the lightest weight and the  A-Go-Go dancers have the heaviest weight. So how  can

you  say this is yellow and that is not yellow?  By

what  standard  do you judge? I  do  not  mean,  by

saying  all these things, that I appreciate A-Go-Go

more  than  ballet. In fact, it is  the  other  way

round.  What  I am trying to say is that  different

people   have   different  tastes  and   standards.

Further,  if  I  were  to ban  A-Go-Go,  then  some

youngsters might accuse me of being unfair, because

A-Go-Go dancers are fully clad. So how can  we  say

that A-Go-Go is yellow. Russia is a Communist and a

totalitarian  country.  It  is  the  motherland  of

Communism.  I  wish to draw the  attention  of  the

Member for Sembawang to the present issue of "Life"

magazine  which  has  devoted  some  space  to  the

celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the October

Revolution in Russia. There are some pictures which

depict  "hippies".  Even in a totalitarian  country

like  Russia, these hippies exist. They  appear  in

public,  but  it  does  not mean  that  Russia  has

adopted  a laissez-faire cultural policy  and  that

their control is not strict and therefore we should

be more strict. So this is a question worthy of our

discussion.  I  have been given to understand  that

the  young  people  in Russia call  themselves  the

fourth generation. The first generation was of  the

revolutionaries, the second generation of the World

War,  the  third  generation of  science,  and  the

fourth  generation is a rich generation. They  feel

that  those  in the fourth generation  should  have

some  freedom  in choosing their own private  life.

Does  it mean that a Communist country like  Russia

is very liberal and that we should outdo it in this

respect?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am in full agreement with the

contention of the Member for Sembawang that we must

not be too liberal and we must not adopt a laissez-faire policy on culture. In fact, the measures that

we  have  taken  have  already been  criticised  by

others as being too restrictive. I can give  you  a

few  examples. In the first instance, from  October

1966   to   September   1967  we   banned   various

periodicals.   We   have   banned    341    Chinese

publications.  Altogether there  were  some  30,000

copies.  We  have  banned records amounting  to  42

categories. Altogether such categories  of  records

amount to some 3,400 copies. In the case of English

periodicals, we have banned some 738 types. We have

banned  two types of Malay publications  and  eight

types   of  Indian  publications.  From  all  these

restrictive  measures we can say that we  have  not

adopted a laissez-faire policy on culture. Recently

some  importers  of yellow publications  have  been

prosecuted and fined. In fact, the officials of the

Ministry of Culture are always in close touch  with

the  police and they have conducted surprise  raids

on book-shops and confiscated yellow books and even

prosecuted the distributors in court. We  have  had

several  cases recently. Mr Speaker, Sir, what  is

the  nature of the publications banned? I can  give

you  a  few  examples. Recently we have banned  the

following  types of publications: for example,  the

"Sex Club", the "Paradise of Cupid", "Night Life in

Hong  Kong". All these books have been  banned.  So

you cannot say that we are very liberal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of films we have also been

criticised  for being too strict in our censorship.

We  have banned about 21 films this year, including

"The   Game  is  over";  "The  Young  World";  "The

Seducer";  "Blow  Up", etc. All  these  are  erotic

films.  So  again, we have shown that we  have  not

adopted  a  laissez-faire  policy.  We  have   been

accused of being too strict.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge to which I have referred in my

speeches  refers to the challenge of  things  which

appear to be yellow but are not actually yellow. We

have  to  direct the attention of our young  people

from  such  culture  to  a  more  serious  type  of

culture. I do not believe that we will fail in  our

efforts, because we must have confidence in our own

people. We are not escapists. We are not fatalists.

So long as the cultural workers are united and work

together,  I believe we can make Singapore  one  of

the most cultured countries in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the proposals put up by the

Member   for  Sembawang,  one  is  on  a   cultural

festival.  The  Ministry of Culture have  organised

cultural festivals in the past. In fact, we propose

to  organise one this year. But cultural  festivals

require  funds. We require a lot of money. All  the

programmes have to be paid for. The funds  allotted

for this year have already been exhausted. When you

organise art festivals, you must spend money. I  do

not  believe one can make money out of art.  It  is

very  difficult.  To  come  back,  next  year,   in

conjunction with our National Day celebration,  the

Arts  Council  will  organise  a  massive  cultural

festival. It will display 100 per cent local works.

This  is to encourage our own people to create more

works  of  art  and take part in the  National  Day

festival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the setting up of a National Film Studio.

This  again requires money. Our Government has many

priorities in other fields over the setting up of a

studio.  Because of these priorities,  we  have  to

place culture second. But within limits we can  ask

our  people  to  help solve our financial  problems

with their kind donations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the National Theatre Trust,

the  proposal from the Member concerned was  a  low

pricing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



policy.  In  order  to help others,  we  must  help

ourselves  first. Before you can help  others,  you

must  see that you are in a position to help  them.

The  position of the National Theatre Trust is that

it  is  autonomous and independent, and it  has  to

depend  on rents and hire charges for its survival.

Even  then  it  is very difficult for  it  to  find

enough  money  to  make  ends  meet.  The  National

Theatre  Trust has to get more foreign  troupes  to

perform here to raise more funds. And if we adopt a

low pricing policy, then we will be losing a lot of

business and money. This is the difficulty  of  the

National Theatre Trust. The problems are many.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's suggestion of an Arts Council, we

have  overall  planning for this project,  and  the

first  part  of  the planning is  to  raise  funds.

Without money we cannot do anything. We propose  to

build a National Academy of the Arts and a National

Art  Gallery costing about $3 million. So  we  must

have funds for the buildings first. We have set  up

sub-committees to carry out other programmes. These

sub-committees  will marshal all the  musicians  in

Singapore into one sub-committee on music. Likewise

for dancing, publications, drama and other artistic

forms  of  art. It is the hope of the Arts  Council

that all cultural workers and those engaged in  art

will  come together and launch a campaign to  raise

our cultural standards. The emphasis is on creative

work.  So  the  second proposal  is  to  set  up  a

national  training  centre for artistic  personnel.

This  is  already part of our plan. The Member  for

Sembawang may have heard that in 1968 we intend  to

hold  an  Exposition.  This  Exposition  is  to  be

organised  by  the  Arts Council and  the  National

Theatre  Trust. The proceeds will be divided  on  a

50/50 basis. This will give us about $250,000. This

will be of great help. Our aim is to reach $500,000

and  we  can raise $250,000 by the Exposition  next

year for the National Theatre Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty of the National Theatre Company,

which we propose to set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



up,  to put up various performances and plays.  The

Arts  Council  will encourage our local  people  to

write  their own plays, choreography and music  for

performance by the National Theatre Company. So  we

require  a  lot  of  directors  and  other  skilled

personnel. With money available, we can do all this

work. The life of artistes is very difficult and  I

think the Member for Sembawang cannot claim to know

more  than  I do, because, in my view, it  is  very

difficult to make a living by art. So to look after

the  artistes, we require plenty of money.  At  the

present  stage,  when the Arts Council  is  raising

funds for the setting up of the National Academy of

the Arts, perhaps the artistes themselves will have

to  appreciate the difficulties of the Arts Council

and redouble their efforts to ensure that our plans

will  succeed. Then and only then will we have  the

time  and energy to improve the livelihood  of  the

artistes. This we hope to do in future and we  will

encourage   the   artistes   in   their    creative

endeavours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is our hope that not only the

Member  for  Sembawang but also  other  Members  of

Parliament and the people at large will  take  more

interest in the promotion of culture and art. If we

have erred in any way, we hope to have constructive

criticisms, and if we have done well in some  other

fields,  perhaps we require words of encouragement.

By  encouragement,  I  do not  mean  singing  empty

praises.  I have already said that the Ministry  of

Culture is not a creative Ministry and that  it  is

the  people  who  deserve the  praise.  The  praise

should   go  to  the  artistes  themselves,   their

organisations and the people in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.
