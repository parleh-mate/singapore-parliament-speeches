<div align="center"><b>LOCAL INDUSTRIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government Policy)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Statement by the Minister for Commerce and Industry)



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members will

recall my promise made to this House at its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



September  sitting  to  inform  hon.  Members   of

Government's    plans    for    the     promotion,

encouragement and development of local industries.

In  accordance with that promise, I  now  wish  to

outline Government's policy in this respect:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Government will continue to encourage the

investment of foreign capital and to

create a suitable climate for investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Government has no intention of changing its

present policy with regard to the

repatriation of profits or of capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Government will give all reasonable

facilities for the entry into Singapore of

skilled  workers,  technicians and engineers,  if

not available locally, and of any senior

administrative personnel reasonably required  for

the development of industries and other

commercial  enterprises which are  considered  to

be for the economic benefit of  Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Government will continue to give

facilities    for   the   importation    from

competitive markets   of   raw   materials,   machinery   and

technical equipment necessary for industries

which it is desired to encourage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Government intends that a survey of the

colony's industrial potential and markets be

carried  out.  Inquiries are now  being  made  in

order to obtain the services of experts to

undertake this survey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Government intends to establish an Institute

of Scientific and Industrial Research for

the purpose  of  investigating and giving  advice

on the technological and economic

aspects  of industry. Arrangements have been made

to obtain the advice of an expert on

the setting up of this Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Government has decided to set up an

Industrial Promotion Board with a $1,000,000

revolving fund to give financial assistance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to small industries. Legislation is now being

drafted and a Bill will shortly be

introduced in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Government is investigating the question of

making tax concessions to industries

whose  expansion or establishment it  is  desired

to encourage. The outcome of this

investigation will be reported in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey of the colony's industrial potential

and  markets that Government intends to be carried

out   will,   for  the  first  time,  reveal   the

possibilities for industrial development that  are

at  present unknown. The findings will  act  as  a

basis for future industrial development and  be  a

useful  guide  to  prospective investors  who  are

desirous    of    ascertaining   the    industrial

possibilities of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of the extremely difficult and

complex  problem  of  tariff  protection  will  be

deferred   until  the  Industrial  Potential   and

Markets survey has been completed and studied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that the work of the Institute of

Scientific and Industrial Research should  include

investigations  into  industrial  uses  of   local

materials,  the  testing  and  standardisation  of

industrial products, the improvement of industrial

techniques   and   quality   of   products,    the

utilisation   of  by-products,  the  solution   of

specific   technical   difficulties,    and    the

estimation of costs and local market opportunities

for  particular industries whose establishment may

be  contemplated. The services of  this  Institute

will  be available not only to Government but also

to private firms on payment of a fee.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>APPROPRIATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>10.13 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His

Excellency the Governor's authority to move, "That the  Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to make provision for the public

service  in 1957 and should be considered  together

with  the volume of Draft Estimates which has  been

in the hands of hon. Members for some days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been usual, Sir, in the past to comment at

this time on the accounts for the previous year and

to  give some indication of the probable outcome of

the present year's working.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Statements for 1955 have now been

tabled  and comments on them have been made in  the

memorandum  which accompanied the  Draft  Estimates

[Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 61 of 1956]. I  will  not

waste the time of hon. Members by referring to them

further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probable outcome for 1956 has also been dealt

with   at  some  length  in  the  memorandum  which

accompanied  the Draft Estimates, and,  of  course,

further  details  are  given  in  the  Abstract  of

Expenditure which appears at pages 15 and 16 of the

volume of Draft Estimates. In the circumstances, it

will  perhaps  be sufficient if I  now  refer  only

briefly to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the collection of revenue has been

satisfactory.   The  yield  on  liquors,   tobacco,

entertainments and betting is likely to exceed  the

original estimate. The yield on petroleum will show

a  substantial  increase. Although  income  tax  is

unlikely to attain the original estimate, the yield

in 1956 will be substantially greater than in 1955.

In  this connection, I have now some reason to hope

that  the revised estimate may be exceeded. In all,

it  seems  likely  that  revenue  collections  will

amount  to  about  $217 million compared  with  the

estimate of $215 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also seems clear that ordinary expenditure

will  fall short of the original estimate  of  $231

million, despite the addition during the year of  a

considerable  number  of supplementary  votes.  The

revised  estimate is $214 million. As in the  past,

there   has   been  a  certain  amount  of   under-expenditure   on   personal   emoluments   due   to

difficulties   experienced  in   finding   suitable

candidates and making appointments to vacant posts.

Again, expenditure on grants-in-aid to schools  has

fallen  considerably  short of  the  estimate.  The

response to the offer of full aid has not  been  as

satisfactory as was originally hoped.  It  must  be

pointed  out,  however, that this under-expenditure

is  only  deferred expenditure. In the near future,

all  appointments will be filled and grants-in-aid

taken up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems probable, therefore, that the working

for 1956 will show a small surplus, possibly of the

order of $2 or $3 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears probable that expenditure on

development  will also fall short of the  estimate.

As  in  the  past, there have been difficulties  in

obtaining  sites  and  in clearing  them.  In  some

cases,  sites  have proved more unstable  than  was

originally   thought  and  extensive   piling   and

preparation  has  been  required.  In  some  cases,

changes in plan have caused delays. However, it  is

expected that over $40 million will be spent  under

the  Development Estimates and I am  happy  to  say

that  considerable progress has been made with  the

building  of  new  schools  and  the  expansion  of

hospital facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial position of the colony is sound.

The  Special Reserve Fund is likely to  total  $101

million by the end of the year as a result  of  the

addition of interest. There should be a balance  of

$11 million in the Development Reserve Fund and the

additional  net assets of the colony  should  total

$142   million.  Of  these  assets,  however,  $126

million  are bound up in illiquid long-term  loans.

The net liquid assets of the colony may be taken as

$138  million which represents a reasonably  strong

position.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to 1957. Here again, the details of

the  Draft Estimates are dealt with at some  length

in  the memorandum which has been circulated and in

an  appendix to the Draft Estimates themselves, and

I  will do no more than draw attention to the  main

points about them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue, on the basis of existing taxation, has

been  estimated  at close on $218 million  compared

with estimated collections of $217 million in 1956.

In  making this estimate, it has been assumed  that

the  level of trade and prosperity in Singapore  in

1957  will not be very different from what  it  has

been  in  1956,  and allowance has  been  made  for

growth   of   population  and  possible   temporary

fluctuations  in trade. Consequently,  the  returns

from    entertainments   duty,   totalisator    and

sweeptakes  duty, liquor and tobacco are  estimated

at  much  the  same level as collections  in  1956.

Allowance  has, however, been made for  a  probable

increase  in  the  consumption of petrol,  and  the

level   of  prosperity  of  companies  trading   in

Singapore  in  1955 and 1956 has  been  taken  into

account in estimating income tax at $5 million more

than the estimated 1956 collection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a tendency to estimate revenue

conservatively,   and,  given  a  continuation   of

present  trading conditions, it may  well  be  that

this  estimate of $218 million is exceeded  in  the

event.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Draft Estimates of Expenditure (including

revotes)  total  $254 million, an increase  of  $23

million on the 1956 total of $231 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase of $23 million is largely due to

increases of $11 million on Education, $2.7 million

on  Medical  and Health, $2.5 million on  Pensions,

and  $1.2 million in the contribution to the  Rural

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of expenditure between the main

services of Government follows closely the  pattern

of  previous  years. The social  services,  namely,

Education, Medical and Health, account



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



for  40 per cent of the total, Defence and Internal

Security including Prisons and Judicial take 16 per

cent,  and  Communications and Works  take  12  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some idea of the growth of the Government service

in sympathy with the expanding economy of Singapore

and  of  the great expansion of the social services

may  be  obtained from the Statement of Expenditure

incurred from 1947 to 1955 which appears  at  page

13  of the Draft Estimates. This, together with the

Statement of Revenue collected for the same period,

which appears at page 9 of the Draft Estimates,  is

a  new  feature of the Draft Estimates which merits

study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is once more a considerable increase in the

provision for personal emoluments, the estimate for

1957  being $113 million compared with $98  million

in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual increments account for a substantial

proportion  of this increase but there are  also  a

considerable number of new appointments, mainly  in

connection with the expanding Education and Medical

Services, which account for over 70 per cent of the

total.  Details of these, new appointments will  be

found on page 7 of the memorandum which accompanied

the Draft Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great care has been taken to ensure that only

posts   which  are  essential  for  the   efficient

discharge  of  the duties of Government  have  been

entered in the Draft Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as departments are concerned, Education

personal  emoluments  have  increased  by  over  $7

million,  Medical  and Health  by  $2  million  and

Defence Services by just under $2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Other Charges Annually

Recurrent  also shows a substantial  increase  from

$87 million in 1956 to $100 million in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, the main increases appear under the

Social  Services.  Education has  increased  by  $4

million,  Medical  and Health  by  $1  million  and

Social Welfare by $1.5 million. The contribution to

the  Rural Board has been increased by $1.2 million

in connection with the expansion of services in the

rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



The  provision for Pensions and Retiring allowances

has been increased by $2.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Special Expenditure is $40

million, including a contribution of $20 million to

Development  and  Re-votes  of  $1.8  million.  The

provision  for  new Special Expenditure  proper  is

limited  to $18 million. This, of course,  excludes

the  provision  made for special expenditure  of  a

developmental  character  which  is  made  in   the

Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contribution of $20 million is again made

towards   development.  We  have   very   ambitious

development plans which will cost over $310 million

over  the  next  six  years.  It  is  going  to  be

difficult  to  obtain all the  funds  necessary  to

finance  this development and it is essential  that

an  annual contribution should be made from revenue

and that it should be as substantial as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted that no provision is made for

the  cost of Malayanisation in the Draft Estimates.

A  compensation  scheme has not yet been  finalised

and  no  estimate of the possible cost  of  such  a

scheme,  or how much will fall to be met  in  1957,

has yet been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position therefore is that, against an

estimate  of revenue of $217 million,  we  have  an

estimate of expenditure of $254 million, and we are

faced with an estimated deficit of $37 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubtful if the position is quite as

serious as would appear from these figures. As hon.

Members  are  aware, even allowing  for  unforeseen

calls on public funds which have arisen during  the

course  of the year - some of them substantial - actual

expenditure has in the past invariably fallen short

of  the estimate. It is likely that this will occur

again in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, recruitment difficulties still

exist.   Sometimes  suitable  candidates  are   not

available.  Sometimes there are unavoidable  delays

in  selecting candidates and in making appointments

to  vacant  posts. All these difficulties  tend  to

reduce expenditure on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



personal emoluments, and it is not unreasonable  to

expect   considerable  under-expenditure  on   that

account  on  a total provision of $113  million  in 1957.  This  is  borne  out  by  the  figures   for

estimated   and  actual  expenditure  on   personal

emoluments  which  are quoted  on  page  7  of  the

memorandum which accompanied the Draft Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not so easy to foresee savings on Other

Charges  Annually Recurrent votes. These votes  are

always pared to the minimum. Experience in the past

has   generally   been   that  actual   expenditure

approximates  closely to the  estimate.  This  will

probably prove to be the case with the majority  of

departments  in 1957, despite the economy  campaign

which is now being waged. On the other hand, as  in

the  past,  there may be savings  on  some  of  the

larger  departments  like  Education,  Medical  and

Health   and  Defence  Services,  and  some  under-expenditure  on a total provision of  $100  million

can probably be expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be some under-expenditure in

Special Expenditure, resulting in revotes in  1958,

but this will not be substantial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to make any estimate of actual

expenditure  in  1957 which has any pretensions  to

accuracy.  Too  many unknown factors are  involved.

However, on the basis of past experience and having

regard  to  the  factors I have  mentioned,  it  is

possible   that   actual  expenditure   will   fall

considerably short of the estimate. With  increased

taxation  on the one hand and under-expenditure  on

the  other,  there  is  a  reasonable  prospect  of

revenue  and actual expenditure balancing in  1957.

If this should not prove to be the case, there will

be no alternative but to introduce further measures

of taxation in order to achieve a balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to the Development Estimates for 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before commenting on these estimates, I should

like  to draw attention to one important change  in

financial procedure which it is proposed to make in 1957.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, our development commitments

are such that it is going to be extremely difficult

to  find all the funds required to meet them. It is

therefore  necessary to make all funds, surplus  to

basic    reserve   requirements,   available    for

development. Again, as I said earlier, our  reserve

position  is strong. It is estimated that,  by  the

end  of  1956, our liquid resources will be of  the

order of $138 million. These are at present divided

up  amongst  the  Special Reserve Fund  created  by

resolution of the Legislative Council in 1954,  the

Development Reserve Fund created at the  same  time

and  in  the  same  way,  and  surplus  dollar  and

sterling securities. Experience elsewhere indicates

that it is desirable to keep something of the order

of  four  months' revenue as a basic reserve,  and

that any surpluses in excess of this amount can  be

utilised for other purposes. This basic reserve  is

the   sheet  anchor  of  a  colony's  finances  and

constitutes  a revenue and expenditure equalisation

fund from which unexpected shortfalls in revenue or

unexpected  increases in expenditure  can  be  met,

pending  recoupment either by savings or  increased

taxation. In view of our need for funds for capital

development,   it  is  now  suggested   that   this

practice,   which   has  been   thoroughly   tested

elsewhere, should be followed in  Singapore,  that

the  general revenue balance should be  reduced  to

$70  million (or rather more than 4 months' revenue

at  the present time), and that the balance of  our

liquid  resources  should  be  transferred   to   a

reconstituted Development Fund. Since  the  Special

Reserve  Fund  was  created by  resolution  of  the

Legislative Council, a resolution of this  Assembly

will  be  required  to  give  effect  to  this  new

proposal.  I  hope to move this resolution  on  the

20th of November. In the meantime, the Statement of

Assets  and Liabilities on page 8 of the  Estimates

and the Development Fund Account have been drawn up

on   the  assumption  that  the  proposal  will  be

approved.  The Statement of Assets and  Liabilities

has  been drawn up in duplicate. One copy, on pages

6  and 7, has been prepared in the old manner.  The

other  shows the position after the Special Reserve

Fund has been liquidated, the General Reserve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



Balance  reduced to $70 million and the balance  of

liquid assets transferred to the Development  Fund.

This  Development Fund is shown on page 367 of  the

Estimates. On the Income side, it shows the balance

of  the  liquid assets of the colony including  the

balance  of  the  Special and  Development  Reserve

Funds,   the  annual  contribution  from   revenue,

Colonial     Development    and    Welfare     Fund

contributions,  and  repayments  of  principal   of

existing  Singapore  Improvement  Trust  and  other

loans  which  should be credited to the Development

Fund  Account.  On the expenditure  side  is  shown

expenditure  on  general development,  on  Colonial

Development and Welfare projects, and loans to  the

Singapore   Improvement  Trust  and  other   quasi-government bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising also out of a consideration of the

Statement of Assets and Liabilities, is a  proposal

that  existing  long-term loans  to  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust  and  other  bodies  should   be

charged  to expenditure and not shown as assets  in

the   Statement.  This  proposal  is  made  at  the

suggestion of the Director of Audit on the  grounds

that it is established financial practice that  all

transactions, including loans, which  diminish  the

colony's free surplus of revenue should be recorded

as  expenditure  at the time payment  is  made.  In

Singapore, the practice of showing as assets  long-term  loans,  which in the case  of  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust are repaid over periods of up  to

60 years, has sprung up since the war. The position

has  now been reached where these assets, which are

in  no  sense of the term liquid, total about  $126

million  and,  by  being shown  as  assets  in  the

Statement  of  Assets  and  Liabilities,  paint  an

entirely  erroneous  picture of  the  strength  and

liquidity   of  the  colony's  finances.   It   has

therefore been decided to agree to the Director  of

Audit's  suggestion and to charge  these  long-term

loans   to  expenditure.  This  will  be  done   by

resolution of the Assembly as soon as the  accounts

for  1956  have  been closed and the  exact  totals

involved  are  known. It will  be  appreciated,  of

course, that this is purely a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



matter  of  book-keeping. No additional expenditure

is  involved. The result will be that the Statement

of  Assets  and Liabilities will give a  much  more

accurate idea of the strength and liquidity of  the

colony's financial position. A Statement of  Assets

and  Liabilities drawn up on this basis  is,  as  I

have said, shown on page 8 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates are shown on pages 367

to 405 of the Draft Estimates. The Development Fund

Account is shown on page 367. It envisages a  total

of $82 million being available for development and,

on  the  expenditure side, allows $63  million  for

general  development,  $2.3  million  for  Colonial

Development  and  Welfare  Fund  projects  and  $20

million  for  loans  to  the Singapore  Improvement

Trust and Singapore Telephone Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In compiling the estimates for general

development, emphasis has again been placed on  the

development  and expansion of the social  services,

and on the development of the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education once again takes a large share of the

funds  available,  a  total of  $17  million  being

provided  out  of  a  total of $65  million.  $12.8

million  is  provided for capital works,  including

$2.5  million  for secondary schools, $5.6  million

for  primary  schools,  $1  million  for  Teachers'

Training   Colleges,  and  $3   million   for   the

Polytechnic.  Grants to schools  on  a  dollar  for

dollar  basis  for  capital works  amount  to  $1.6

million.  $1  million is provided for  the  further

expansion  of  the  University,  and  $500,000   is

provided   for   equipment  for  the   Polytechnic.

Expenditure on educational development  amounts  to

26  per  cent  of  the  total  devoted  to  general

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$17 million is provided for Land and District

Offices.  This includes $8 million for the purchase

of  sites  for development projects and $4  million

for  the  acquisition and development of sites  for

resettlement.  $5.4 million has been  provided  for

development in the rural areas, making a  total  of

$12 million provided in three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical and Health is given $10 million or 15 per

cent   of   the   total   available   for   general

development. A start



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



is  to be made with the new District Hospital which

it  has  now  been decided to site at  Tanah  Merah

Kechil.  A start will also be made with a home  for

the  chronic sick which will relieve congestion  in

the  main hospitals. Roughly $7 million is provided

for the development of existing hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the money available for general

development has been allocated to other departments

to meet their more pressing needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, a sum of $15 million has been

earmarked  for  Public Housing and $5  million  for

Telephone Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not expected that all the money shown in

these  estimates  will be spent. As  in  the  past,

there  will  be  difficulties in  obtaining  sites,

clearing   them  of  squatters,  and   making   the

necessary  preparations for building. On the  other

hand,  no  provision has been made  for  unforeseen

contingencies. On balance, however, it  is  thought

that  actual  expenditure will fall  short  of  the

estimate  and that there will be a balance  in  the

Development Fund at the end of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, therefore, there seems a reasonable

prospect  that,  allowing for  increased  taxation,

revenue and expenditure will balance in 1957. There

will  probably  also  be a  small  balance  in  the

Development  Fund and the general  revenue  balance

will  be of the order of $70 million at the end  of

the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable, Sir, at this stage to give an

outline   of   Government's  future   capital   and

recurrent  requirements as  a  background  for  the

proposals  for  new taxation which I shall  shortly

introduce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the development needs

of  Singapore are very great, and it  will  cost  a

great  deal  in  terms  of  capital  and  recurrent

expenditure  to  meet  these  needs.  A  number  of

development  plans exist, but they  have  all  been

greatly  modified since they were drawn  up.  Ideas

and  needs  have changed. Experience has  suggested

new  approaches. Priorities have altered,  and,  of

course, costs have greatly increased. All the plans

are in need of revision and co-ordination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, no recent attempt has been made to assess

the  needs  of the colony as a whole or  to  relate

these needs to the funds likely to be available  or

to the capacity of the colony to meet the recurrent

expenditure arising from the plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for an early re-assessment of the

colony's  development requirements on  these  lines

was realised by the Chief Minister and he asked Sir

Sydney Caine to study the matter in his capacity as

Economic Adviser. Shortly before his departure, Sir

Sydney Caine incorporated the results of his  study

in a confidential memorandum to the Chief Minister.

I have the Chief Minister's permission to give hon.

Members  the  main  conclusions  reached   in   the

memorandum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the capital development requirements of

the  colony as a whole for the period 1958-1962 are

assessed  at  $750 million. Of these  requirements,

certain   projects  totalling  $570   million   are

regarded  as  essential and have been placed  in  a

priority  list.  This priority list  provides  $226

million for General Development by Government,  and

includes $51 million for Education, $40 million for

Medical  and  Health, $21 million for Commerce  and

Industry,  $20 million for Drainage and Irrigation,

$40  million  for  the Purchase  of  Land  and  $22

million   for  Communications.  $200   million   is

provided for the City Council, mainly in connection

with  the  development  of public  utilities,  $115

million for the Improvement Trust, $18 million  for

the   Harbour  Board,  and  $20  million  for   the

Telephone Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This constitutes a five-year plan for development

which, I think, is as ambitious, comprehensive  and

far-sighted as can be found in any country in  this

part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives expression to the feelings of the

Government in the matter of development  which  are

expressed  in  the  words  of  the  memorandum   as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore depends basically on its position as a

great  communications and trading centre. Secondly,

and  arising  from its trade and shipping  are  its

manufacturing activities, first, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



the  needs  of  its own population  and  then  for

export.   Third  are  other  activities   depending

originally upon, but also now adding to, its  value

as   a  communications  and  trading  centre;   its

position as a military and naval base, as a tourist

centre,  as  a  convenient place, for international

meetings or as a centre of higher education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain its position in all these fields

Singapore needs, first, good public services;  port

installations,  airport, roads and other  transport

facilities;  power  supply - electricity   and   gas;

drainage and so on. Secondly, its reputation as  a

port  of call requires maintenance of public health

measures. Thirdly, it requires the education of its

population; a high level of technical education  is

especially  important  for industrial  development.

And  fourthly, it needs investment in the plant and

equipment necessary for manufacturing industry. The

first  three are almost entirely within the  public

sector,  the fourth is mainly a matter for  private

finance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a formidable task to raise the funds

required  for  this  essential development  over  a

period of five years, particularly as not very much

assistance  can  be expected from outside  sources.

Sir Sydney Caine, however, considers that it can be

done provided that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Government revenue is increased by stages

over the next three years, including 1957,

to yield  at  least an additional $50  million  by      1959, thus allowing a more substantial

contribution from revenue to development than  is

made at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Other public bodies, but particularly the City Council, can continue to make substantial annual contributions from revenue to development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) An overseas agency can be persuaded to agree

to make a loan to the City Council for

electricity development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d )Local capital resources are mobilised to the

full, a suitable climate and opportunities

for investment   are  created,  and  the   general

public is made to realise the necessity of

saving  and  investment  in  Government  loans  in

order to obtain the services which it wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these conditions are not met, development

plans  will have to be prolonged, reduced  or  even

abandoned, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



people of Singapore will not get the services which

they   require,   and,  perhaps   worst   of   all,

Singapore's position as one of the main centres  of

world trade will be undermined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that none of us in this Assembly would

willingly allow this to happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards revenue and recurrent expenditure on

Government  account, it is envisaged that,  on  the

present  (1956)   basis  of  taxation  and  given  a

continuation of present trading conditions, revenue

will  increase slowly in sympathy with the  growing

population until it reaches a total of something of

the order of $235 million in 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, expenditure (excluding any

contribution  towards  development)  will  increase

much   more   rapidly  as  development  plans   are

implemented  and  as  interest  and  sinking   fund

charges  on new loans are added to the total  bill.

It  is  considered more than possible that it  will

reach  a total of over $260 million (excluding  any

contribution to development) by 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be a striking increase over a period

of  six years and hon. Members will no doubt wonder

how   it   can  come  about.  In  this  connection,

attention  is  once again invited to the  table  of

actual expenditure from 1947 to 1955 which is given

on  page 13 of the Draft Estimates. From this table

hon.  Members will see very clearly how expenditure

on  Education in particular is increasing by  leaps

and  bounds - $15  million in 1952,  $17  million  in

1953, $24 million in 1954, $30 million in 1955  and

$35  million estimated in 1956. It may well be  $60

million by 1962. Expenditure on Medical and  Health

Services  is mounting in a similar way - $15  million

in  1952,  $16.6  million in 1953, $20  million  in

1954, $22 million in 1955 and $27 million estimated

in  1956. As hospitals expand and new hospitals are

built,  so expenditure will increase. It  has  been

estimated  that, by 1962, expenditure on  Education

and Medical and Health combined will have increased

by  $50 million on present figures. Expenditure  on

Defence Services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



is only starting to mount and may reach $18 million

by  1962.  In  short,  the estimate  of  over  $260

million in l962 is not likely to be very far out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, revenue will have to be

increased  by taxation by $50 million in  the  next

three  years  if  this gap is to be  closed  and  a

substantial  contribution  made  to  the  cost   of

development in addition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this can be done. There is a very

considerable taxation potential as yet untapped  in

Singapore and which can be tapped without detriment

to  trade,  on  which our prosperity  depends,  and

without  causing undue hardship to any  section  of

the  community.  But it means that  every  possible

source  of  revenue will have to be  explored,  and

that  the people of Singapore will have to accustom

themselves  to a much higher incidence of  taxation

than they have hitherto experienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for the future is therefore somewhat

bleak.  We  all  wish to increase the  standard  of

living  of  the  vast bulk of  the  population  of

Singapore,  and  to make Singapore an  even  better

place  to live in than it is at present. If we  are

going to achieve these objectives, we are all going

to have to pull in our belts, make sacrifices, work

harder, save more, invest more in Government loans,

and  be  prepared  to  pay a  great  deal  more  in

taxation than we have ever had to pay before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now, Sir, to the measures of new and

increased   taxation  which  it  is proposed   to

introduce this year. As I have said, these must  be

regarded  as  the first instalment of a  three-year

programme which must produce at least $50 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, it is proposed to raise income tax,

increase  the customs duty on tobacco,  petrol  and

certain   liquors,   impose  an  additional   first

registration  fee on all motor cars, increase  fees

on driving licences, increase the duties on cheques

and   sweepstakes,  and  introduce  provisions  for

taxation of luxury goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to income tax, it is proposed to

reduce   the   personal  allowance   for   resident

individuals and Hindu Joint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



Families by $500, to make the allowance $2,500  for

a  single  individual and for Hindu Joint Families,

and  $4,500  for a married individual. It  is  also

proposed  to  increase the rate on  the  first  two

slabs  of chargeable income from 3 per cent  and  4

per cent to 5 per cent, making the first $1,500  of

chargeable  income  taxable  at  5  per  cent.   In

addition,  it is proposed to increase the graduated

rates  of  tax on chargeable incomes in excess  of

$35,000 progressively to make the maximum rate  40

per  cent instead of 30 per cent. The new  40  per

cent   rate  applies  to  chargeable  incomes  over

$55,000.  The  increased rates will apply  to  all

resident  persons with the exception of  companies,

trustees,  excluding the trustees of  incapacitated

persons, and executors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to bring these changes into effect

from 1st January, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed, Sir, to explain Government's

policy in relation to these proposals, I would  ask

hon.  Members  to bear in mind that income  tax  in

this country is administered on a pan-Malayan basis

in  the sense that the Income Tax Ordinance in  the

Federation  and that in Singapore are identical  in

all  except minor respects, and that each Ordinance

makes  provision, for a single return and a  single

assessment  in the case of persons having  combined

income, i.e., income in both territories. The  need

for  uniformity,  in  view of  the  close  economic

relations existing between the two territories, was

recognised when income tax was introduced in  1947,

and  was  stressed  repeatedly by  members  of  the

public,  as  well  as  by official  and  unofficial

Members  of  both  Governments.  I  think   it   is

generally  recognised  that the  operation  of  the

Ordinance  over  the  past  nine  years  has  amply

demonstrated   the   wisdom  of   the   pan-Malayan

conception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals which I have outlined have been

fully discussed with the Federation Government, and

the  Federation Government is today introducing  in

its   Legislative   Council  precisely   the   same

proposals to amend its Income Tax Ordinance  as  we

are here in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are no doubt aware, the tax

imposed by the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947,  is  the

only tax levied on income in Malaya. There are not,

as  in  a  number  of  other countries,  additional

levies of one kind or another described as, or akin

to,   supertax,  surtax,  surcharge,  profits  tax,

emergency  tax,  excess profits tax,  non-residents

tax,  or  any  other levies of a similar  character

additional to income tax. Income tax in  Malaya  is

the  one comprehensive tax on income and it has  no

supplements or appendages. Nowadays, virtually  all

developing countries include the taxation of income

on  a progressive basis as a major feature of their

fiscal  policy. By comparison with the  income  tax

systems  of other countries, the income tax charged

in  Malaya  may  be  regarded as a  reasonable  and

equitable  impost, the rates of tax being generally

lower, and the scales of relief higher, than  those

in operation elsewhere. As far as I am aware, in no

other  country,  the  income tax  system  of  which

includes a scheme for personal reliefs, is  such  a

low rate as 3 per cent charged at the bottom of the

scale. For example, the minimum rate of tax in  the

United  Kingdom at present is 11¼ per  cent,  and

over  the past thirty years the lowest rate of  tax

in  force in that country was 7½ per cent. The  7½

per  cent rate was, in fact, in operation  for  one

year  only. To carry the comparison a bit  further,

the  personal allowance for a single individual  in

the United Kingdom is $1,200. Here in Singapore  it

is  at present $3,000. A married individual in  the

United  Kingdom  receives a personal  allowance  of

approximately $2,000. The personal allowance  to  a

married individual in Malaya is $5,000. It  can  be

seen,  therefore, that Singapore  has  treated  its

income  taxpayers a good deal more generously  than

has  been found possible in the United Kingdom, but

I   do  not  consider  that  the  same  degree   of

generosity can be maintained indefinitely.  On  the

whole,  the original scheme of the Malayan  tax  as

contained in the 1947 Ordinance has remained stable

over the past nine years. Apart from changes in the

rate which have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



had  the effect of levelling the company rate,  the

rate  for non-resident individuals, and the maximum

individual  rate, at 30 per cent,  almost  all  the

amendments  have  been designed  either  to  remove

anomalies  or to afford further relief to taxpayers

in  general. However, faced as it is with an urgent

need to find additional revenue to meet the cost of

social  and  other  services provided  or  planned,

Government, after very careful consideration,  and,

as I have said, in consultation with the Government

of  the  Federation, has decided that the time  has

come  to  legislate for moderate increases  in  the

general rates of income tax, accompanied by a small

reduction in the individual personal allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally recognised that the situation

whereby  the  burden of income tax  on  individuals

residing in Singapore falls on only some 19,000  of

the  population  cannot continue  indefinitely.  We

have,  therefore,  decided to reduce  the  personal

allowance  by  $500, that is to say, the  allowance

for a single individual will be reduced from $3,000

to  $2,500 and for a married individual from $5,000

to  $4,500. The allowances for children will remain

as  at  present.  A married man with  two  children

will,  therefore,  obtain reliefs totalling  $5,750

plus  relief on any contributions he may make to  a

provident fund, and on any life assurance  premiums

he  may pay. A married man with nine children  will

obtain  reliefs totalling $7,650; if he contributes

to  a provident fund, his reliefs will probably  be

in excess of $8,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in the scale of personal reliefs is

accompanied by the abolition of the 3 per cent  and

4  per  cent  rates  at the bottom  of  the  scale.

Instead  of  the first $1,500 of chargeable  income

being charged in three slabs of $500 at 3 per cent,

4  per  cent and 5 per cent respectively, the whole

$1,500  will  be  charged at  5  per  cent.  It  is

doubtful whether charging tax at such a low rate as

3  per cent is economically justifiable, and it  is

possible  that  tax payable at this  level  is  not

sufficient, considered by itself, to meet the  cost

of assessing and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



collecting   it.   However,   apart    from    this

consideration,  it  is  most  unlikely   that   any

hardship  will be caused to the taxpayers who  will

be subjected to the proposed changes in rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the scale, it is proposed to

make   the  highest  rate  applicable  to  resident

individuals  40 per cent on chargeable  incomes  in

excess of $55,000 instead of, as at present, 30 per

cent on chargeable incomes in excess of $50,000.  I

might  mention,  in  passing, that  in  the  United

Kingdom  a  rate  of  42  per  cent  is  levied  on

chargeable   income  in  excess  of   approximately

$3,000, and much higher rates still where the total

income exceeds $17,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other changes in the rates applicable to the

larger chargeable incomes include the insertion  of

a  new  rate of 25 per cent which is applicable  to

the  $10,000  slab of chargeable income immediately

above  the  $35,000  point.  The  next  $5,000   is

chargeable  at 30 per cent, and the next succeeding

$5,000  at 35 per cent. This takes us up to $55,000

worth of chargeable income, above which point it is

proposed to levy a rate of 40 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected yield from these changes is

estimated at $5 million in 1957, most of which will

come from the wealthier taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contributions made by the new taxpayers, who

will  be brought in by the reduction in the  amount

of  the  personal allowance, will be  comparatively

small.  The maximum amount payable by an individual

who  was  not previously liable to income tax,  but

who is now made liable by the reduction of $500  in

the  personal  allowance,  will  be  $25,  and  the

average  amount payable by such an individual  will

be  $12.50  or approximately $1 per month.  On  the

other  hand,  the  changes made  will  secure  that

income tax is paid by a much larger section of  the

population, all of whom will be perfectly  able  to

pay the small sums involved. The principle on which

Government has worked is to broaden the base of the

taxation  pyramid so as to increase the  number  of

individuals who are required



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



to make some direct contribution, however small, to

the  general  revenue of the  country.  It  is  the

considered  view of Government that at present  the

base,  comprising as it does some 19,000 taxpayers,

is  much too narrow. Government's proposal for this

small reduction in the scale of personal reliefs is

estimated to increase the number of taxpayers quite

appreciably,  and is linked, as I  have  explained,

with the increase in the rate of tax applicable  to

the  wealthier  members of the community  up  to  a

maximum of 40 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  may  be  interested  to  have  some

sample  figures to show the impact of  the  revised

rates  and  personal  reliefs upon  taxpayers  with

incomes  at varying levels. For example,  a  single

man  with  an assessable income of $3,500 will  pay

$50 instead of $15 in tax. If his assessable income

is  $5,000, he will pay $140 instead of $90. If his

assessable  income  is $8,000,  he  will  pay  $385

instead  of  $320.  If  his  assessable  income  is

$12,000, he will pay $835 instead of $760.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, a married man without children with an

assessable  income of $5,000 will pay  $25  in  tax

instead  of  nothing. If his assessable  income  is

$8,000,  he will pay $215 instead of $160.  If  his

assessable  income  is $12,000  he  will  pay  $595

instead of $520.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet again, a married man with two dependent

children  with an assessable income of $8,000  will

pay  $122.50  instead  of $75.  If  his  assessable

income  is  $12,000, he will pay  $460  instead  of

$385. If his assessable income is $30,000, he will

pay $3,495 instead of $3,380.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these examples will serve to show that

the changes proposed are unlikely to cause hardship

to anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single individual with an income of $2,500 a

year,  or  a married individual with an  income  of

$4,500  a year, will not be required to pay  income

tax  at  all, so that the great majority of  manual

and  daily-paid  workers are still well  below  the

point at which income tax is payable. It must  also

be  remembered  that allowances for  children  will

still  be  deductable at present rates, i.e.,  $750

for the first child,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



$500  each for the next two children, and so on  up

to   a  maximum  of  $3,150,  plus  allowances  for

provident  fund  contributions and  life  assurance

premiums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  may wonder why Government  has  not

proposed  an increase in the rate of tax applicable

to companies, having regard to the fact that income

tax  payable  by companies represents a substantial

proportion of the total yield. The company rate  of

tax  is  a  matter  of primary importance  to  most

foreign   investors   since  large-scale   business

investment  is  usually  carried  out  through  the

medium  of limited liability companies rather  than

through  other  forms  of commercial  or  financial

organisations. The company rate charged  in  Malaya

has  been  30  per  cent  since  1951,  and  it  is

reasonably well in alignment with rates payable  by

companies  in comparable territories abroad.  There

is,  however, one important difference and that  is

the  difference between the company rate of tax  in

Malaya  and  the rate in the United  Kingdom.  This

difference has recently narrowed to 12½  per  cent,

i.e.  42½  per cent less 30 per cent,  and  in  the

Government's  view  it is worthwhile  retaining  an

appreciable margin between the Malayan company rate

and that of more highly developed countries such as

the United Kingdom. The margin is considered to  be

justifiable  as  an  inducement  not  only  to  the

investment  of capital in Malaya, but also  to  the

establishment of local directorates and managements

of the enterprises set up. There will, in short, be

a  differential  tax advantage in  incorporating  a

separate Malayan company rather than in setting  up

a  Malayan branch or unit of some large concern  in

the  investor's country of residence. The advantage

will,  of  course, endure only so long as  the  tax

differential  is a sizeable factor. The  effect  of

the  tax  inducement in securing local rather  than

overseas direction and management is important in a

consideration    of   industrial    and    business

development  in  Singapore, particularly  from  the

aspect   of  providing  technical,  executive   and

administrative   opportunities  in   industry   for

Malayans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Government  has,  therefore, in consultation  with

the Government of the Federation, decided for these

reasons  not  to  increase  the  rate  of  tax   on

companies in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to increase the duty on tobacco

and cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, duty on tobacco is a

most  important  source of revenue to  the  colony.

Only  income  tax  yields more. For the  past  three

years, the duty on tobacco has amounted to over  $33

million  a year. Approximately 97 per cent of  this

revenue  comes from cigarettes, the great  bulk  of

which pay duty at the preferential rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, there is a marked difference

between the rates of duty on tobacco and cigarettes

in  the  Federation and Singapore.  Originally  the

rates of duty were the same but since the war,  and

particularly  since the outbreak of  he  Emergency,

the  need  for  additional revenue has  forced  the

Federation to increase its rates. Now, there  is  a

wide  difference  in the rates of  duty,  which  has

persisted since 1953.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as cigarettes are concerned, the

Federation rates are $10.50 a pound full and $10  a

pound  preferential, whereas the rates in Singapore

are   $6.70  a  pound  full  and  $6.20   a   pound

preferential, a difference of $3.80 a pound in each

case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufactured tobacco (excluding cigars and

cigarettes) imported in containers of any kind  for

retail  sale  to the public - in other  words,  pipe

tobacco - is charged duty at $10.10 a pound full and

$10  a  pound  preferential in the Federation,  and

$6.90  a  pound full and $6.70 a pound preferential

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, unmanufactured tobacco - that is, leaf

tobacco - is charged duty at $7.60 a pound  full  and

$7.40  a pound preferential in the Federation,  and

at   $4.40   a  pound  full  and  $4.20   a   pound

preferential in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation, manufactured tobacco imported

for  use in the manufacture of cigarettes by power-driven  mechanical means is charged duty  at  $8  a

pound. In Singapore, it is charged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



at  the  rate of $2.50 a pound, as is shag  tobacco

imported from neighbouring territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable that, as far as possible, the

rates  of  duty  in  Singapore and  the  Federation

should  be the same. The only reason why the  rates

in the two territories are not now the same is that

the need for increased revenue has been greater  in

the  Federation than it has been in Singapore.  Now

that  the need for more revenue has become  urgent,

attention is once more directed to the question  of

increasing   the  Singapore  rates  to   Federation

levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be little reason why the rates

should not be the same. By and large, salaries  and

wages  are  much  the same in the two  territories.

Standards of living and the cost of living  in  the

towns,  where the bulk of imported tobacco  smokers

live,  are much the same. Income tax is charged  at

the  same rates. The only difference is that, while

the inhabitants of Singapore pay customs duties  on

only   liquors,   tobacco   and   petroleum,    the

inhabitants  of the Federation, in  addition  to  a

much higher rate of duty on cigarettes and tobacco,

pay  import  duties  on a wide  range  of  consumer

goods. In these circumstances it is hard to see any

real  reason why duty on cigarettes and tobacco  in

Singapore   cannot  be  increased,   without   much

hardship to the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not proposed, however, to proceed

immediately  to Federation levels of  duty.  It  is

considered  that  an increase of  these  dimensions

would  be  too  sudden  and  might  result   in   a

contraction in consumption or perhaps a  switch  to

cheaper  brands.  Instead, it  is  proposed  to  go

approximately half-way to Federation levels. It  is

considered  that this can be done without  hardship

to  the  individual smoker, without  any  permanent

effect  on  consumption, and with little danger  of

any material switch to cheaper brands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from this morning, therefore, the

rate of duty on cigarettes has been raised to $8.60

a pound full and $8.10 a pound preferential.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase means that the duty on packets of

ten cigarettes of the great majority of brands will

be increased by slightly under 5 cents and that the

retail  price  will be increased by  5  cents.  The

price of larger packs will, of course, be increased

correspondingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in the duty on cigarettes

necessitates corresponding increases in other types

of tobacco.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on pipe tobacco has been increased to

$8.30  a pound full and $8.10 a pound preferential.

Here  again, the great bulk of imports pay duty  at

the  preferential rate which is now the same as the

preferential rate for cigarettes. Hitherto  it  has

been  the practice to charge a slightly higher duty

on  pipe  tobacco  than  on  cigarettes,  it  being

considered that some allowance should be  made  for

paper,  cork  and filter tips in cigarettes.  There

appears,  however,  to be little justification  for

maintaining this differential and it has  now  been

abandoned.  The differential between the  full  and

preferential  rates must be maintained  because  of

the  terms  of the General Agreement on  Trade  and

Tariffs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on leaf tobacco will be increased to

$6.00  a  pound full and $5.80 a pound preferential

compared with the Federation rates of $7.60 a pound

full and $7.40 a pound preferential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on shag tobacco will remain as it is at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on manufactured tobacco imported for the

manufacture    of   cigarettes   by    power-driven

mechanical means has been raised to $4.50 a  pound,

an increase of $2 a pound. The differential between

this  rate  and the preferential rate on cigarettes

is  $3.60  a pound compared with a differential  of

$3.70  a  pound previously. In the Federation,  the

rate of duty is $8 a pound which is only $2 a pound

less  than  the  preferential duty  on  cigarettes.

There   will  doubtless  be  opposition  from   the

manufacturers of local cigarettes who  import  this

finely  cut  tobacco for the manufacture  of  local

brands.  It  is  clear, however, that  the  tobacco

revenue  might  be  jeopardised  if  too   wide   a

differential were allowed between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



rates  of  duty on imported cigarettes and imported

manufactured tobacco of this type. While Government

is  anxious to encourage local industry, it  cannot

afford  to  lose any part of the important  tobacco

revenue.  It  is  not thought,  however,  that  the

changes now proposed will have any material  effect

or  the  sale  of locally manufactured  cigarettes.

Indeed,  the  mere fact that duties generally  have

been  raised  to  a higher level, the  differential

remaining  the  same,  may  tend  to  increase  the

consumption of the cheaper local cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will doubtless be protests against these

increases in duty. Although we were criticized last

year  for not raising the duty on tobacco, we shall

no  doubt  be criticized this year for having  done

so. But these protests and criticisms will not,  in

my opinion, be justified. The increases in terms of

cost per packet of cigarettes are not great and are

unlikely  to cause any great hardship. If  they  do

cause  hardship in any particular case, the  remedy

is  either to cut down consumption or change  to  a

cheaper brand of cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the increases will yield

about   $9.5  million  in  1957.  They  have   been

effective  since midnight last night and  an  order

under section 11 of the Customs Ordinance has  been

gazetted and will be tabled in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to increase the duty on

petroleum  by  7 cents, raising the duty  from  the

present  level of 73 cents a gallon to 80  cents  a

gallon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumption of petroleum has mounted steadily

through the years. In 1952, 20 million gallons were

released for local consumption; in 1953, 21 million

gallons; in 1954, 23 million gallons; and in  1955,

26  million  gallons. In 1956, it is expected  that

releases  will  amount  to  28.5  million  gallons,

despite the increase in duty of 5 cents in November

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that petrol can take a further

increase  in duty without any effect on consumption

and  it is doubtful if the increase will cause  any

hardship to any section of the community.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase will have no effect on public

transport, which largely runs on diesel oil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that this increase in the rate of

duty will yield approximately $2 million in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to increase the duty on

rum and gin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rates of duty on other liquors were

raised  in  November of last year,  no  action  was

taken  in respect of rum and gin. There has been  a

tendency  for the consumption of gin in  particular

to  decrease  over the previous year  or  two.  The

taste  for  gin is fairly specialized. In Singapore

at  least  it  is  not a potential  substitute  for

whisky  or  brandy.  There appeared  to  be  little

danger  of any marked switch from whisky or  brandy

to  gin  as a result of the difference in rates  of

duty.  On  the  other hand, there  was  a  possible

danger - although  not  a  very  grave  one - that   an

increase in duty might result in a further decrease

in consumption of gin. In the circumstances, it was

decided not to make any change in the rate of  duty

at least for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has now been reviewed in the light

of  experience over the past year. The  consumption

of  rum remains unchanged at about 3,000 gallons  a

year.  There has been no marked switch from  whisky

and  brandy to gin. Consumption of gin in 1955  was

slightly  over  the 17,000-gallon mark.  Statistics

for  the  first  nine months of 1956  suggest  that

consumption will be slightly over the 18,000-gallon

mark,  an increase of about 1,000 gallons.  At  the

same   time,  further  examination  of  the  matter

suggests that consumption of gin has now stabilised

and  that  any tendency for it to drop,  which  was

noticed  immediately after the Korean War boom  and

which  suggested a possible change  in  taste,  has

stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, it is considered desirable

that  the  duty on gin and rum, which traditionally

go together in the tariff, should be increased from

$37.50  a gallon to $49.50 a gallon. Prior  to  the

changes  in  the  tariff  which  were  effected  in

November  last year, there was a duty  differential

of $11.50 a gallon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



between  whisky and brandy on the one hand and  gin

and  rum on the other. The new duty on gin and  rum

bears  much  the same relationship to  the  present

duty on whisky and brandy as the old duties bore to

each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of duty on gin and rum in bulk and

rectified  spirit  which are  also  linked  in  the

tariff  has  been raised in sympathy  to  $63.50  a

gallon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to increase the duty on

sparkling  wines from $40 a gallon full and  $30  a

gallon preferential to $44 a gallon full and $34  a

gallon preferential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield from these increased measures is

estimated at $220,000 in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that these increases will cause

any great hardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to impose a tax on motor cars

in  the  form of an additional initial registration

fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  recall  that  a  proposal  to

impose  a  tax  of this nature was considered  last

year  but  was  not proceeded with  because  common

action  with  the Federation was considered  to  be

desirable  and  because  the Federation  Government

could  not  at that time see its way  to  impose  a

similar  tax.  Now  I  am happy  to  say  that  the

Federation  Government sees its way clear  to  take

common action with the Singapore Government in this

matter  and  is  making a similar  announcement  at

today's Budget meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax proposed is an initial registration fee

of  10  per  cent of the c.i.f. value of all  motor

cars  registered  for the first time  in  Singapore

with effect from today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motor cars are defined in the regulations as

"motor  vehicles constructed or adapted  solely  or

mainly  for  the  carriage of passengers  or  which

have,  to  the  rear of the driver's  seat,  roofed

accommodation  fitted or capable  of  being  fitted

with side windows". In other words, all motor cars,

as  the  man  in the street understands  the  term,

estate  cars, station wagons and vans used for  the

carriage of passengers, but not motor omnibuses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fee will be paid in the same way as the

initial registration fee at present paid on cars of

non-Commonwealth origin, namely,  at  the  time  of

first registration to the Registrar of Vehicles who

will decide, after calling for such evidence as  he

may  think necessary, what is the c.i.f. value  of

any particular car.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as cars of non-Commonwealth origin are

concerned, the new fee will be in addition  to  the

fee of 15 per cent already charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars which have already paid the fee in the

Federation will, of course, not have to pay  a  fee

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the yield from this fee will

be of the order of $1.5 million in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will possibly be complaints about this tax

on  the  grounds  that motor cars are  a  necessary

means of conveyance in Singapore, that many members

of  the  public, particularly in the  lower  middle

income  groups,  rely on motor cars  to  take  them

about  their business and to get their children  to

school,  and  that  any increase  in  the  purchase

price,  even a modest 10 per cent of c.i.f. value,

will hit these people hardly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubtful if these are valid complaints.

However desirable they may be, motor cars cannot be

called necessities even in Singapore, and it  seems

reasonable that those who can afford to buy and run

them  should  contribute  a  little  more  to   the

revenues   of   Singapore   than   they    do    at

present - particularly those car owners  who  pay  no

income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, in case it should be thought

that  no  steps are taken to ascertain whether  car

owners are liable to income tax, I should say  that

the  Registrar of Vehicles informs the  Comptroller

of  Income Tax of the name and address of every new

vehicle  owner  and  the  Comptroller  then   makes

enquiries about his liability to tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to increase the fee on

driving licenses from $2 a year to $5 a year.  This

increase  will  be  applied  to  renewals  and   to

endorsement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, the fee in the Federation is

$5  and there appears to be no reason why Singapore

should not raise her fee to the same level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics for 1955 indicate that over 12,000 new

licenses  were  issued and that 60,000 licenses  were

renewed  during  the  year.  In  addition,   18,000

provisional  license were issued  and  over  13,000

provisional  license renewed. On these figures,  it

would  appear that, at the end of 1955,  about  one

person  in  every  twelve  of  the  population   of

Singapore  either  had  a driving  license  or  was

trying  to  qualify to obtain one.  Quite  clearly,

only a percentage of these people are car owners or

people  who  are required to drive  a  car  and  it

appears  that if they can afford to pay  $2  for  a

license,  they  can afford to  pay  $5  as  in  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will probably be argued in this connection

that,  in  the  case of people who are  drivers  by

occupation,  it is unfair to charge  them  $3  more

than  they  pay at present for the license  without

which they cannot pursue their livelihood. But  the

fact  of  the  matter is that $3 is not  a  serious

increase in cost. It amounts to precisely 25  cents

a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield from these increases is estimated at

$300,000 in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to increase the stamp duty on

cheques from 5 cents to 10 cents, which is the rate

in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the matter was last considered in 1952, it

was  argued  that any substantial increase  in  the

stamp duty on cheques would lead to a reduction  in

the  use  of  cheques and inhibit people  who  were

contemplating opening bank accounts from doing  so.

As  a result, when the Federation Government raised

the  rate  from  4  cents to  10  cents,  Singapore

increased to 5 cents only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the rate in the Federation

apparently  had  no marked effect  on  the  use  of

cheques  or  on  the number of bank accounts  which

were  subsequently  opened, and  it  is  more  than

doubtful  if the increase will have any  effect  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield in 1957 is estimated at $300,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed, Sir, to increase the tax on

sweepstakes from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.



A  substantial return is obtained from the  tax  on

sweepstakes each year. For example, the  return  in

1954 was $2.8 million, in 1955 $2.9 million and, on

the  present  basis of taxation,  $2.8  million  is

expected  in 1956. These figure indicate  the  very

considerable amounts which are spent by the  public

of   Singapore  on  this  form  of  gaming.  It  is

considered  that the Government is  entitled  to  a

greater  share  of the proceeds and it  is  thought

that  the rate of tax can be increased without  any

appreciable  effect on the amount of money  wagered

annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield in 1957 is estimated at $1.25 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield from all the measures of new and

increased   taxation  which  it  is   proposed   to

introduce is estimated at $20 million in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, also intends to introduce

luxury  taxes and a Bill on this subject  has  been

tabled today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is lengthy and complicated. I hope hon. Members will give it careful study so

that  any  anomalies  or  procedural  difficulties,

which   may  have  crept  in  and  which   can   be

eliminated,  can  be removed in  Committee  in  due

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Bill aims at imposing a tax based on

wholesale  price at wholesale level on  any  luxury

goods which it may be decided to tax in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the point at which the tax should

be imposed has been given much consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest point of imposition would, of course,

be  at  import  level. Luxury goods  which  it  was

desired to tax would merely be added to the customs

tariff and the Comptroller of Customs would collect

the tax at point and time of import in the same way

as  he  does  duty  on liquor and  tobacco  at  the

present  time. This, however, would  be  a  radical

departure  from past policy which, in the interests

of  the  free port status of Singapore, has limited

customs duties to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



the  traditional  revenue  earning  commodities  of

liquor,  tobacco  and  petroleum.  It  would  be  a

departure  which  might have  consequences  in  the

outside  world out of all proportion  to  what,  in

fact,  had taken place. Although it is a step which

may  well  come  in the end, it is  one  which  the

Government would not wish to take precipitously  or

without the most careful examination and thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most difficult point of imposition would be

at  retail level. When one considers the number  of

shopkeepers and small traders of all races who deal

in  luxury  goods  in Singapore, one  realise  that

adequate  control of any system of luxury taxes  at

retail level would be quite impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has therefore been decided, for the time being

at any rate, that luxury taxes will be collected at

wholesale level on the basis of wholesale prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders and regulations prescribing the method of

collection of tax and the methods of accounting  to

be  used  will  be  issued in  due  course.  It  is

intended  that the Comptroller of Customs  will  be

responsible for the collection of Luxury Tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I foresee that this tax will meet with

considerable  opposition,  particularly  from   the

trading  community. They will argue that  Singapore

depends   on  trade,  that  trade  is  at   present

difficult  enough in all conscience, and that  this

new tax will add yet another burden to a load which

is already reaching unmanageable proportions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that the difficulties which this tax

may   cause   to  traders,  particularly   entrepot

traders,  are  fully  appreciated,  and  everything

possible  will be done to minimise the difficulties

and  obstructions  in the way  of  forms,  returns,

drawbacks  of  duty  which  may  result  from   the

imposition of the tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard fact of the matter, however, is that we

need all the revenue we can get if we are going  to

provide  the  facilities  which  are  necessary  if

Singapore  is  not  only to  survive  but  grow  in

magnitude  and importance as a world port.  Traders

can  regard the extra efforts which they will  have

to put forth to overcome the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



difficulties inherent in a system of luxury  taxes,

as  part  of  their contribution to the  future  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the principle of the tax, the fact of

the matter is that vast sums are spent each year in

Singapore on commodities which can only be regarded

as  luxuries. One has merely to look at  the  trade

returns, at the shop windows, at the population  as

it   goes  about  its  business  and  pleasure   in

Singapore, to have this fact confirmed.  If  people

have  money to spend on these luxury articles - which

they   undoubtedly  have - it  is  only  right   that

Government should have a share of it. Even  if  the

imposition   of   luxury  taxes   were   to   limit

consumption of luxury goods, I should be  perfectly

happy since it would mean that the population saved

more and had more to invest in the Government loans

required  for the provision of services which  they

demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, is the taxation programme for 1957. It

covers  a  fairly  wide  field  and  will  yield  a

substantial amount. On the other hand, it will  not

bear hardly on the population as a whole, or on any

particular  section  of it. I  hope  that  it  will

commend itself to hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, Sir, I should like to take this

opportunity  of  paying  a tribute  to  Sir  Sydney

Caine.  He is an outstanding administrator  and  an

economist  of great renown. The services  which  he

rendered  to  the  Chief Minister as  his  Economic

Adviser were of the highest order and his departure

at this stage of the development of Singapore is  a

very  great loss. I am sure that hon. Members  will

wish him well as Principal of the London School  of

Economics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to pay tribute to the Treasury

officers   who  have  been  responsible   for   the

preparation  of  the  Estimates  for  1957.   Their

services  have been of a very high order.  This  is

the  first  occasion on which an Asian officer  has

been  entirely responsible for the preparation  of

the  Draft Estimates, and I think hon. Members will

agree  that the volume now before them is in itself

sufficient indication of his capacity to  undertake

this most important work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to take this opportunity to

pay  a  tribute to the Government Printer  and  his

staff  who, as always have met all the demands - some

of them outrageous by all normal standard - which have

been made upon them. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, seeks to provide for increase of

duty on cheques from five cents to ten cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make a

consequential amendment to section 44 by the removal

of  the  words  "chargeable with the duty  of  four

cents"  which was the duty at one time in force  on

bills of exchange and cheques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I mentioned in the course of my Budget

speech that I was anxious to take this Bill through

all its stages this morning. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I beg to second.

<br><br>11.29 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  did  not  know that this Bill  would  come

before me this morning, but as I am Chairman of the

Malayan  Exchange Banks Association I believe  some

of  my  colleagues will expect me to say  something

about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House heard the remarks that the Hon. the

Financial Secretary passed on it when the  question

of  increasing the stamp duty on cheques was raised

before and that there were protests from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



local  bankers.  Sir, there may  be  protests  from

certain bankers that the increased duty will reduce

the  number of accounts on their books. I shall not

join in such protests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as large companies using a great number of

cheques are concerned, the increase can scarcely be

of   much  importance  and  will  be  very   easily

absorbed. If the effect of the increased duty  will

be  for  small  holders  to reduce  the  number  of

cheques  issued, then many bankers would thoroughly

welcome  such a state of affairs, and the  Treasury

would  not suffer much from such reduction. Sir,  I

support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, seeks to raise the existing duty

on  sweepstakes from 20 per cent to  30  per  cent.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I second it.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not think that I am in a position to object  to

the  Bill, but I want to draw the attention of  the

Government to the fact that this increased duty  on

sweepstakes will be a definite hardship to  a  poor

wage-earner. I will explain why it is so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my experience, it is the poor man, the wage-earner, the worker, who invests more in

sweepstakes.  Sir,  I have been  a  member  of  the

Singapore  Turf Club for many, many  years.  It  is

usually  the  rich man who goes to the  race-course

for a cup of tea, takes a stroll and hardly invests

any  money in the sweepstakes; so he goes back home

with  his money. On the other hand, it is the  poor

man  who  invests in sweepstakes and this increased

duty is an indirect taxation on him.



<br><br>11.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must disagree

with the Member for Telok Ayer. The hardship on the

poor man is when he is lured into wasting his money

on  gambling instead of spending it on his  family,

as  he  should  do. Anything which  we  can  do  to

discourage him from, not "investing", but  throwing

away his money in this foolish way is a removal  of

hardship  from the poor man; and if this  tax  does

not  remove the hardship, at least it will  benefit

the exchequer.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.41 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I welcome the increase in duty on sweepstakes and I

personally   hope   that  this  will   prevent   or

discourage many people from investing in lotteries;

and  if  government  revenue  should  fall  because

people  are  going  to refrain  from  investing  in

lotteries, I think I will feel all the happier  for

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want Government to take note of one

point,  and  that is, if you increase the  duty  on

sweepstakes,   does  it  not  then   make   illegal

lotteries  even more attractive to the man  in  the

street? Will it not divert people who might  gamble

on  the  Turf  Club to other forms of  gambling?  I

would  like  Government to think of  it  seriously,

because  the idea is that we should prevent  people

from all forms of gambling.
