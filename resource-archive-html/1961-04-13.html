<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on

Question [12th April. 1961].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly, after careful deliberation

of  the  acute problems of unemployment  caused  by

Singapore's rapid population increase which is  not

accompanied  by corresponding increase in  economic

expansion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALERTS our people to the paramount need to expand

employment opportunities, and to this end



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPROVES the State Development Plan 1961-1964,

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CALLS on all sections of the people to unite in

their effort to fulfil the plan, and in particular



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXHORTS the workers and trade union movement and

the  businessmen  and  industriatrialists  to  play

their  part in maintaining a fair balance of  their

respective interests so essential to success."-(The

Minister for Finance).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  I was speaking towards the  end  of  the

sitting, and there wits one point in the speech  of

the Minister for Finance where he departed from the

main  subject  of  the  Development  Plan  and  the

Industrialisation Plan of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found it necessary to refute an allegation by

the   opposing  candidate  in  the  Hong  Lim

by-election - that the Development Plan was a propaganda

piece  of the P.A.P. because of the by-election.  I

agree with him, Sir, that this Development Plan  is

not  a  piece  of  propaganda for the  by-election,

because I know and I sincerely believe their  claim

that  they  are  a good, honest, clean  Government.

But,  Sir, the facts surrounding the timing of  the

issue of the Development Plan and the debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



which  took  place yesterday and  is  taking  place

today give the uncharitable feeling that there must

be  some  foundation  for the allegation  that  the

timing  of  the disclosure of the Development  Plan

has  something to do with the Hong Lim by-election.

They say that for the first time in the history  of

elections  in Singapore Polling Day was  set  seven

weeks after Nomination Day, and that the length  of

time  between Polling Day and Nomination Day is  to

give  the  Government a longer period  of  time  to

readjust  itself  in  the  eyes  of  the  Hong  Lim

electorate. We were told, Sir, that proof copies of

the  Plan were sent to the Printer early this year,

and  yet the Plan was made known to Members of this

Assembly and made known through the Press  only  at

the  end of March and early April. Therefore,  Sir,

the Government has found itself in the embarrassing

position  of having to explain away the  timing  of

the Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on the timing, Sir, in a report in the

Straits Times yesterday, the public were told  that

an  agreement had been reached with the T.U.C. over

their  co-operation regarding the Development  Plan

and  the  Industrialisation Plan of the Government.

We  were  told in the Press that there was  a

Sub-Committee,  and  that  the  Sub-Committee  met   in

December  and January. Yet report of the  agreement

reached  was  not  made known to the  public  until

yesterday. Here again there must be some foundation

for  the allegation that all this is timed for  the

Hong  Lim  by-election. I do not  say  that  it  is

wrong.  The Government can choose its own  strategy

in regard to any election, be it a by-election or a

general  election. But I have this one fear  in  my

mind,  Sir, that the timing may be a bad one in  so

far  as  the result of the Hong Lim by-election  is

concerned.  Suppose,  Sir, that  Ong  Eng  Guan  is

returned  by  the  electorate of Hong  Lim.  People

outside  this country and investors in this country

may  have  a feeling that the Government no  longer

has  the confidence of the people. And the Plan may

fail!   It  is  linked  up  with  the  by-election.

Ministers  and  leaders of the P.A.P. went  up  on

election



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



platforms  and said, "How good this Plan  is!  This

Plan  is  meant  for the welfare of the  people  of

Singapore." On that they hope to win. Suppose  they

are rejected, and maybe wrongly rejected, what will

be  the fate of the Plan? Investors again may  have

second thoughts - not only investors in Singapore but

also investors outside Singapore. We all know, Sir,

that  this by-election, although it is just  a

by-election,  is  getting publicity in most  important

countries  where  the  Government  hopes  to   seek

foreign  assistance. It is being  reported  in  the

United Kingdom. It is being reported in America and

in   other   countries.  So   if   the   Government

unfortunately loses the by-election - a  by-election,

after all, is just a by-election - but because it has

tried  to sell this Plan to the people in Hong  Lim

and  has  been  rejected - I am a bit dismayed,  Sir,

that there had been no proper thought given to  the

timing of publicity of this Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development side of the Plan is

dependent  on  loans  of a  very  big  figure  from

foreign  countries and also from  local  investors.

The  hope has been expressed that most of the money

would  come from local people, and whatever balance

is  necessary  to make up the full amount  of  $871

million  could be obtained through loans  from  the

United Kingdom and the World Bank. Sir, the P.A.P.,

when  they  came into power, have done many  things

which they have already begun to feel have not been

right.  In  this Assembly they have  admitted  that

certain  rectifications had taken  place,  and  the

most important rectification in the Government  and

in the Party was the expulsion of the then Minister

for  National Development. It was only  after  that

rectification  that the Minister for  Finance  went

overseas  to  have  discussions  with  the  British

Government and with the World Bank. I do  not  wish

to  suggest,  Sir,  that it  was  because  of  this

rectification that the British Government were keen

to  help and that the World Bank showed indications

of  a  desire to be co-operative. But if it is true

that because of this rectification, because of this

belief that the P.A.P. Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



has  cleansed  itself of a sore, and if  this  sore

were to defeat them at a by-election, when all  the

Ministers  of  the Government had  to  spend  their

time,  their energy and sleepless nights going  out

fighting  against a lone man - if, in  spite  of  all

that,  they  were to lose that fight - then  if  that

first  loan  had been granted as a result  of  that

rectification,   a   second   loan   may   not   be

forthcoming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Development Plan has our support. We

wish  it  every  success. But the prerequisite  for

that  success is the ability to raise the  $500-odd

million  that is necessary to carry out  the  Plan.

And in this regard, too, I wish them every success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government from this year 1961 is having

plans  of the magnitude of $871 million. Therefore,

I  think the continuance of the Work Brigade is not

necessary. The Work Brigade was brought into  being

just  to tide over the present difficulty, to  give

them  some form of employment - under-paid employment

at  that - and  to keep their spirits high.  But  now

that  these development plans will throw employment

open to so many thousands of workers, I suggest the

members of the Work Brigade should be absorbed into

working  for this Development Plan and  be  paid  a

decent wage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a lot of talk about the Work

Brigade. The Work Brigade, they say, is nothing but

a  P.A.P.  Brigade.  Its members  are  nothing  but

members  of the P.A.P., and they are used not  only

for  work  provided  by the  Government  but  as  a

propaganda arm of the Government. They point to the

fact  that  when  the Minister for Labour  and  Law

returned  from  Tokyo members of the  Work  Brigade

were  there  to  cheer  him.  Obviously  they   are

grateful  to the Government for having  given  them

the opportunity of earning only $2 a day and having

some shelter and some cultural activities. But then

that is not so bad as the suggestion which has been

going  around the Hong Lim by-election that members

of  the Work Brigade have been even asked to attend

election  rallies, and for their loyalty  they  are

let  off  one  day without work.  If  that  is  the

purpose of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



Work  Brigade, then I think the Work Brigade should

be  scrapped.  If  the  Government  is  sincere  in

wanting  the  confidence of investors in  Singapore

and outside Singapore, then investors are prepared,

I  am sure, if the call is a genuine call, that the

safety  of  Singapore and the security of Singapore

demand their full co-operation. But nobody is going

to  be led into helping the Government to build  up

propaganda  organs  for the  Party.  Let  the  Work

Brigade  be scrapped. Let the members of  the  Work

Brigade be given proper employment at proper rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has said quite

rightly that the Development Plan of the Government

is  just  the  first step. It does  not  solve  the

unemployment  problem. The solution lies  in  rapid

and  more rapid industrialisation of Singapore.  We

agree    with    him   that   unless    there    is

industrialisation, there is no hope of solving  the

ever  increasing unemployment problem.  But  I  say

this:   unless   we   can  get  agreement   on   an

industrialisation policy with the Government of the

Federation,   our  industrialisation   plans   will

receive a set-back. There was no whisper even  from

the Minister for Finance in his speech yesterday of

the   fate  of  the  discussions  between  the  two

Governments on the Common Commodity Market. I  hope

he  will rectify it. And if the news is good,  that

agreement  has  been reached on a Common  Commodity

Market,  then  I  am  sure  this  will  be  a  very

important  factor  in persuading investors  locally

and  overseas  to help in the industrialisation  of

Singapore. Not only is such an agreement  with  the

Federation  necessary, but the best of relationship

must  also  be  maintained with the  Federation  of

Malaya.  Everything  must  be  done  to  see   that

Singapore has the Federation friendly towards  her.

The Government of Singapore must see to it that the

Government of the Federation of Malaya is  friendly

towards  it.  But  how can one  hope  to  see  this

friendliness coming forth when at election  raffles

Political  Secretaries, being paid $1,100  a  month

out of public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



funds, go on platforms and try to explain away  the

continued   detention   of  detainees   under   the

P.P.S.O.?  The Political Secretary to the  Minister

for  Finance stood up at an election rally and said

that  the  continued detention of his  comrades  in

Changi was as a result of the deciding vote of  the

Government  of  the Federation of  Malaya?  Surely,

Sir,  we  have  not heard from the Government  that

they  wanted to release those detainees  under  the

P.P.S.O. They did say that if the Government  could

see  changes  in the detainees, they would  try  to

persuade  the Internal Security Council to  release

these  people.  But  they have not  said  that  the

Federation  Government, the deciding  vote  in  the

Internal  Security Council, is to be  blamed.  They

are  right. They should not. They cannot say  that.

But  then  to allow a Political Secretary,  who  is

paid  $1,100  a  month, to go  up  on  an  election

platform  and  blame the Federation Government  for

the   continued  detention  of  his   comrades   is

certainly  not helping the Government of  Singapore

to get on friendly terms with the Government of the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has brought in

certain factors that will guide the opening  up  of

factories in Singapore. He has explained  that  the

consumer  potentiality  in  Singapore  is  no  less

favourable  then the potentiality in the Federation

by  reason  of  the  higher earning  power  of  the

workers of Singapore. That may be so, Sir. But  for

a  factory  to  start in Singapore  with  only  the

consumer potentiality in Singapore at its disposal,

and  it is denied the consumer potentiality in  the

Federation,  although it may be  the  same,  is  at

least  to  deny one-half of the whole potentiality.

Therefore,  an  industrialist may, in  his  wisdom,

find  it better to start a factory just across  the

Causeway in Johore Bahru. If he does it, he has not

only  the market in the Federation but he has  also

the  market  in  Singapore. We  have  all  read  of

reports in the Press that the Federation Government

has plans to develop Johore Bahru as the next stage

after Petaling Jaya has been fully taken up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is a hope expressed by the Minister

for  Finance that there are the export markets. "We

in  Singapore  who have been in the entrepot  trade

and  have been serving the nearby islands  will  be

able   to   continue   this  service   with   goods

manufactured  in Singapore." But the  Minister  has

overlooked one very important factor, the  consumer

prejudice. You can start a new factory. Anyone  can

start a new factory. But the difficulty will be  to

get  the market. Even to sell a new product locally

is  going  to take much time, much energy and  much

advertising.  What  more  about  foreign   markets?

Therefore,  there is that initial difficulty  which

will  take  years to overcome, to  have  a  foreign

market  at  the  disposal of local  industrialists.

Just  to explain this consumer prejudice. Lux  soap

is  manufactured in Malaya, and yet there are  many

people who go to the shop and say, "I want Lux soap

manufactured in London." Although it  is  the  same

Lux  soap.  It  is unreasonable, I admit.  But  one

cannot  help  it  that there  is  such  a  consumer

prejudice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, take cigarettes for instance. People are

so  used  to  Players that they keep on wanting  to

smoke  Players. And if it is pointed  out  to  them

that other brands locally manufactured are just  as

good, if not better, in tobacco content, they  will

not even listen to such an argument.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> What type of cigarette do you smoke?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in the previous

Government,   we   thought  about   this   consumer

prejudice  and we therefore introduced the  Control

of  Manufacture  Ordinance  which  is  now  on  the

statute book. This Ordinance sees to it that  local

investors  have a chance to invest in an enterprise

originating  from foreign countries in  brands  and

goods  that have a ready market. Before the  P.A.P.

became  the Government, Singapore did not have,  at

that  time, a factory producing Players. The  local

cigarette manufacturers - 7 Diamonds, 7 Up,  6  Down,

or  whatever they are called - were doing their  best

to sell the local product.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



There  was difficulty in selling it because of  the

price differential. Because of that difficulty  and

because  of  the Government's desire  to  give  the

local  cigarette manufacturers a fair chance, there

was  a  differential in taxation. Local  cigarettes

are taxed less. Imported cigarettes are taxed more.

So  much  so  that the consumers in Singapore,  the

workers in Singapore, are forced in a way to  smoke 7  Diamonds

and all such other brands, because  of

the  price differential. And as I have pointed out,

the Control of Manufacture Ordinance was introduced

by the previous Government to prevent this

British-American  tobacco  company  operating  on  its  own

capital.   Because  of  this  law,  we   told   the

manufacturers of Players that they could not reopen

in   Singapore   unless  they  had  local   capital

participation. They agreed with the justness of our

stand.  They were prepared to allow a 51  per  cent

local  capital participation. But no.  The  P.A.P.,

when  they came into power, were so anxious to have

some factories going that they allowed this

British-American tobacco company to reopen their factory at

Tanjong  Pagar  on a one hundred per  cent  British

capital.  That  is what the P.A.P. Government  have

done.  And  now  Players.  Players  everywhere  has

knocked out all other local brands, because Players

can   now  be  sold,  because  it  is  manufactured

locally, at a price competitive enough to knock out

all other local brands with local capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has quite rightly said, Sir, that there must be a climate of confidence and

economic stability. The Government have, and  quite

rightly, persuaded the T.U.C., through discussions,

to  be  co-operative. But the Minister for  Finance

said in this Assembly yesterday that it was quite a

difficult task to get the leaders of the T.U.C. to

agree to co-operate. And yet most of the leaders of

the  T.U.C. are paid out of public funds.  Some  of

them   are   paid  $1,100  a  month  just   to   be

figureheads, as Political Secretaries, and some  of

them  are Members of this Legislature. Yet  we  are

told  that it has been uphill work. They could  not

persuade their own members and those who are under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



obligation   to  them  for  looking   after   their

livelihood. No one is to believe them.  Of  course,

it is not wrong for the Government to take steps to

ensure  that  there is economic stability  so  that

there  is  industrial peace. That is why they  went

out  of their way to try to capture and control the

T.U.C.  They  are there to do the  bidding  of  the

Government, and to that extent investors have  said

that  they at least have a measure of control  over

the  workers  of  Singapore. But unfortunately,  in

trying to get this measure of control, they have to

use  ways and means that are not in keeping with  a

government  that  boasts of being  a  good,  clean,

honest government, by paying $1,100 a month out  of

public  funds to some of the leaders of the  T.U.C.

Sir,  what is very important is the confidence that

must  be  engendered from now on in the Government,

in  the P.A.P., and in the P.A.P. controlled  trade

unions. And I am sure the Government is anxious  to

instil  this  confidence  into  the  minds  of  the

investors  and into the minds of all in  Singapore.

Therefore,  when  they  call  on  the   people   of

Singapore  to  work together for the  salvation  of

Singapore,  may  I ask them then,  Sir,  to  bestir

themselves  and  remember that  they  have  a  most

important  part  to  play in  the  success  of  the

Development Plan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister in his speech yesterday did touch on

a  lot of subjects, and he asked two very pertinent

questions. These are, I think: What must we  do  to

give  the  country a fair chance  of  creating  new

jobs?  He  has explained to this Assembly  what  we

must  do. But then, his next question is: What must

we  refrain from doing? He has not told us what  we

must  refrain from doing. May I, therefore, say  to

the Government, the P.A.P. and the T.U.C., which is

controlled by the P.A.P., that there are a  lot  of

things  that  they must refrain from doing?  First,

let  us  come to the Government. They must  refrain

from  continuing  to  show  their  arrogance.   The

arrogance  of  Ministers has been the  worst  thing

that  has  damaged  the reputation  of  the  P.A.P.

Wherever they go around, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



swank and in their speeches they show that they are

the  know-alls  and nobody else knows  better  than

they. That is not the way to get confidence. Forget

that  arrogance. They must refrain from  continuing

to  show  their  refusal  to understand  the  other

person's   point  of  view.  They   must   not   be

intolerant. In this House, for instance, Sir,  when

Members   of  the  Opposition  stand  up  and   say

something  that may be of value to  them,  what  do

they do? They behave as if they have no culture, in

spite  of  their  Ministry of  Culture.  They  must

refrain   from  uttering  unnecessary  threats   or

throwing their weight around, like the Minister for

Labour and Law telling the employers, "If you  will

not behave, I will use the P.P.S.O. on you!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You must never wear a mask!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They must refrain from doing

many  things in order to regain the confidence they

have  lost.  But the most decisive factor  in  this

issue   today,   unfortunately,   and   I   repeat,

unfortunately, is what is happening  in  Hong  Lim.

With  all their resources, with all their Ministers

and  their Assemblymen and Assemblywomen going

all-out  fighting the Hong Lim by-election, if they are

to  lose,  confidence  in  the  Government  may  be

shattered. The Back-benchers, Sir, if I may say so,

must  refrain  from trying to think that  they  are

speaking as the Government. When the Front-benchers

give  the cue that the debate is to be on such  and

such  a line, the Back-benchers feel that they  are

also   the  Government  and  that  they  must   say

something which is very much better than the speech

of  the Minister for Finance, who is so tame.  That

does   not   help.  If  the  Government  want   the

confidence  of the people of Singapore,  they  must

show  that they deserve that confidence.  And  what

better  way  of deserving that confidence  than  to

shine    out   confidence   and   thereby   attract

confidence?  If you have no confidence  in  others,

others will have no confidence in you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one very important point brought up by the

Minister  for  Finance in his speech yesterday  was

about shipbreaking. He explained to us that he  had

difficulty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



in  getting  a local company to go into  this  very

important  industry and thereby give employment  to

many  people. He had to go overseas.  And  there  I

agree  with him. He had to go overseas. He reported

that he was successful in getting a foreign concern

interested  and he was doing his best  to  persuade

them to come to Singapore, and the terms he offered

for a loan from the Development Board were going to

be  very  attractive. Sir, may I draw his attention

to  the Control of Manufacture Ordinance which  has

been  mentioned  in the blue book? Where  there  is

good  money  to be made, where there  is  no  great

difficulty, local capital must be given  the  first

opportunity. But where local capital does not  have

the  know-how, then foreign knowhow must be invited

to  come  in and participate with local capital  to

carry  on the job. And yet the Minister for Finance

is  going  to  throw this away, with aid  from  the

Development Board, to a purely foreign  concern  to

do  something which he himself admits is easy to do

and  where good money is to be made. This is  going

to be another instance of the cigarette factory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, I would say that I was touched

by  the Minister's speech when he moved the motion.

He called on all of us to observe a code of conduct

which amounts almost to a code of discipline. May I

end  here by asking the Government, the P.A.P. and

the  T.U.C. to  observe a code  of  conduct  which

amounts almost to a code of discipline?



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  yesterday  our  P.A.P.  Government

handed  to  the Legislative Assembly this Four-Year

Development  Plan. This shows that  the  Government

has a plan to solve the problems of Singapore. This

proves  that the P.A.P. Government is a responsible

government. This Development Plan has been  planned

for  more than a year. It is now tabled before this

Assembly  because this Development Plan is directly

connected with the future prosperity of the  State.

So  this  Development  Plan has  to  be  thoroughly

considered and planned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



From this we can see that this Development Plan  is

not  because  of the by-election in Hong  Lim.  Our

Development  Plan is for the future  prosperity  of

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning this Development Plan, we do not say

that  within  four  years  we  can  solve  all  the

problems of Singapore, especially unemployment.  It

is  impossible to solve the problem of unemployment

within  these four years especially in the  present

social environment of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first chapter of the Development Plan, it

is said that this Development Plan is an attempt to

solve some of the problems that face Singapore. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, let me repeat, "some of the problems

that   face  Singapore",  and  not  all.  The  main

contributing  factor is the rapid increase  in  the

population   of   Singapore  which  affects   their

livelihood.  There  are problems  of  unemployment,

education, health, housing, etc. During the last 22

months,  the P.A.P. has done a lot of good for  the

people:  for  example,  the  building  of  schools,

clinics, community centres, roads, and drains,  the

installation of standpipes, and the supply of water

and  electricity. In the matter of  employment,  we

have  promoted the industrialisation plan.  Use  is

made  of the young people in the Work Brigade. This

has  proved  that the P.A.P. Government is  working

for the welfare of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that in our small

island  State,  there are no natural resources.  In

order to solve the problem of unemployment, we have

to promote industrialisation. But industrialisation

cannot  be achieved in 22 months, because,  in  the

first  place,  we  have to  have  a  Plan  and  the

implementation of this Plan cannot be  carried  out

within one or two months. It will take a long  time

and  it  may need further consideration. A  certain

period of time has to elapse before the Plan  could

be  tabled. [he success of this Plan will  have  to

depend  on  the  stability of  the  State  so  that

investors  can be attracted. This proves  that  the

Development Plan is not just a "paper tiger". It is

like a new tractor, because a new tractor needs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



people  to  drive  it. If the  Government  and  the

people  do not drive this new tractor properly,  it

will not move for the benefit of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition Members have

said  that  this Development Plan has  been  tabled

with  an  eye  to the Hong Lim by-election.  But  I

would  like  to ask them this question. Before  the

P.A.P. came into power, did they have the  courage

to  put  up  such  a  Plan for  discussion  in  the

Assembly? They were not able to put up such a

Four-Year Plan. In this respect, they are not sincere in

their criticism of the Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a trading centre.

Our   economy  is  connected  with  that  of  other

countries.  That  is to say, our  Development  Plan

does  not  only  depend  on  the  people  and   the

Government of Singapore, but also on the economy of

other   countries,  the  political   and   economic

stability  of  South-East Asia and the co-operation

of  the  Federation of Malaya. With this  in  view,

this Plan has been put up.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan) (in Malay):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the

Development Plan as contained in the blue book  for

the  years 1961 to 1964, I feel that there are many

points  which  have already been explained  by  the

Government and that views have also been  expressed

by  the  Opposition. I do not wish to elaborate  on

the  details.  Neither do I wish to  submit  points

which have already been clarified; for example,  by

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

National Development on the subject of pigs, goats,

chickens, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the views of the Government on the

Development  Plan  in respect of seamen,  which  is

well and good. I hope the Plan will be expanded  to

help seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like clarification from

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

National  Development  on this  point.  During  the

debate on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on 20th  July,

1959  (Hansard,  Vol.  11 No.  5),  I  did  make  a

statement  in  this Assembly. It  may  be  that  my

English  is  not  so  good, and therefore  I  need

clarification.  The reason for my  submitting  this

point  is  that it concerns development  which,  in

turn, concerns money. I said in this Assembly

then - and  this  is  reported in English in Hansard,  6th

line from the bottom of column 235, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Utusan Melayu'-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has chosen to

speak  in  Malay. I think all he can do now  is  to

endeavour  to  paraphrase  what  appears   in   the

Official Report. He may, of course, translate it if

he wishes to do so.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It is difficult, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  This  is  an  extraordinary   case.

However,  the main point as reported in the  Utusan

Melayu  is that in the discussion with the Chairman

of  the Malay Chamber of Commerce, Inche Alwi,  the

Government promised economic aid to the sum of  $13

million  to the Malays. I got a satisfactory  reply

from  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for National Development which is at column 267  of

the  same Hansard. It is difficult to translate it,

Mr  Speaker. In short, the Parliamentary Secretary

gave an assurance that the Government's promise  of

$13  million would be more than enough, and he said

that  no  previous  Government  had  rendered  such

assistance. That was the gist of what he said.  But

in  this  blue  book, there is no mention  of  this

money  and  I fear that, by 1964, this $13  million

will  be  forgotten. I hope to receive  a  definite

reply  that this $13 million will be provided.  The

Parliamentary Secretary spoke firmly and  sincerely

in his first speech in this Assembly, and I hope he

will honour the pledge he gave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point concerning this.

Development  Plan.  There will  be  employment  for

40,000 people: 20,000 vacancies will be created  by

the  Government and the other 20,000 will come from

private  enterprise.  I do not  wish  to  dwell  at

length on this subject, but I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



to tackle this main issue. I regret to see that the

Member  for Kallang is not in this Chamber, for  he

replied  to me when we were debating the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's first speech in this Assembly  as

regards the assurance of employment for the

Malay-speaking people, particularly the Malays. The reply

of  the  Member for Kallang appears at columns  259

and  260  of the same Hansard - this also  cannot  be

translated - where he gave me that assurance on  20th

July,  1959. Mr Speaker, Sir, I only wish to quote

excerpts in the Malay language.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do appreciate that perhaps

it  is difficult for hon. Members to translate from

English  into Malay. It is difficult, I think,  for

some  people to translate from Malay into  English.

But  I think the hon. Member must realise that  the

Standing Orders are quite strict on the point: that

if the hon. Member has chosen to speak in Malay, he

must   continue   in  Malay,  and   therefore   his

quotations  must  also  be  in  Malay.   He   could

paraphrase  the quotations or, as I have indicated,

give a literal translation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): For that reason, Mr

Speaker,  I  am  not  fluent  enough  to  translate

English into Malay and vice versa. I refer to  col.

259. In this matter, Mr Speaker, I hope, since the

Member  for Kallang is absent, his colleagues  will

be  in  a position to say whether the matter  which

was   clarified  on  20th  July,  1959,  could   be

implemented  in  the interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point: Mr Speaker, which

concerns  employment. I wish to draw the  attention

of  the  Minister for Finance and the Minister  for

Home  Affairs  to  the fact that in  the  Four-Year

Development  Plan approximately 1,700 personnel  in

the   Police  Force  will  be  recruited.  So,  Mr

Speaker, on the basis of the assurance given by the

Member  for  Kallang, I believe that  opportunities

will  be thrown open with sympathetic consideration

to  people who I believe will be able to fill those

posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would also like to draw the attention of the Government to this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



I admit that the Government in its Development Plan

is  unbiased. It is a just Government. But  in  the

Utusan  Melayu  there was mention in bold  capitals

that  the  people in the P.A.P. are not Communists,

and  that  although the Party is  non-communal,  it

looks after the interests of the Malays. It is  not

necessary  for  me  to  read the  whole  news  item

because  that  will  take  up  the  time  of   this

Assembly.  Therefore,  I  only  wish  to  say,  Mr

Speaker,  that  I  appreciate the attitude  of  the

P.A.P. But let the P.A.P. not forget that it is not

the P.A.P. alone that looks after the interests  of

the  Malays, but all Members of this Assembly.  All

political parties represented in this Assembly have

agreed  to look after the interests of the  Malays.

Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  based  on  such   facts,

together  with  the  programmes  contained  in  the

Development Plan, the Plan is still vague to me.  I

hope  it  will  be made clear to me  what  are  the

methods  that will be implemented to safeguard  the

interests of the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, Mr Speaker, that I wish to raise

for   clarification  concerns  development  in  the

Government's  Development  Plan,  particularly   in

regard  to  the Ministry of Culture. I  am  of  the

opinion  that  the expenditure set  aside  for  the

Ministry  of Culture is reasonable. In the  chapter

on  the  Ministry of Culture, there is  mention  of

vacancies for teachers from year to year. I believe

a  great  majority of these posts will be  for  the

English  stream. If I am wrong, I hope the Minister

for Education will correct me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it is still a question mark to me as to

what  the intention of the Ministry of Culture  is.

Is  the Ministry confining its aims to attending to

grievances  submitted by members of the  public  in

the  form  of  queries,  comments,  and  criticisms

published  in  the  newspapers?  I  have  not  seen

anywhere in this Development Plan that the Ministry

could  make  Malay as the national language.  I  am

talking  not of the official language  but  of  the

national  language. The editorial in Utusan  Melayu

commented on the policy to make Malay the  national

language in Singapore, but no reply was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



received from the Ministry of Culture. Similarly, a

member   of   the   public  wrote  concerning   the

Government's policy on the national language.  This

also  received no reply from the Government.  So  I

hope,  Mr Speaker, if the Government could explain

firstly  to  me, because if I were  to  comment  on

every  remark  made  by the Malay  Members  in  the

Government, as contained in the Official Report  on

the debate held on 20th July, 1959, Vol. 11 No.  5,

it  is  obvious  that the questions of  employment,

language,  and  many other matters  which  are  not

relevant to the aims of my organisation, will  only

receive mere words from the Government. But I  hope

to receive positive answers on these matters and  I

expect the Government to honour its pledges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, coming back to the blue hook on culture, very little mention is made on page 120

relating to Dewan Bahasa and National culture.  The

Institute of National Language and Culture is to be

situated  in  the  National Library  adjoining  the

Museum.  I  say: do not freeze it or  allow  it  to

remain as an exhibit for the public to see,  but  I

hope  the  National  Institute  will  make  further

progress  in  the future, so that the  objects  and

aims,  particularly  those  of  the  P.A.P.,  whose

declared  policy  is  that Malay  will  become  the

national language, will materialise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to comment on the Ministry of

Health today because the Minister is ill. I hope he

will  recover soon and return to this  Assembly  so

that I can explain my views to him.



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, first let me, in sincere earnestness,

on  behalf  of  the  people of  Delta,  express  my

support for the Four-Year Development Plan proposed

by  the  Finance Minister. This motion is historic.

This   motion  not  only  speaks  for  the   P.A.P.

Government  but it shows that the P.A.P. Government

has  exerted  its  utmost for the  benefit  of  the

people. It also shows that we, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Government, want to achieve  a  more  ideal

society  through peaceful and socialistic measures.

Today, we feel proud because in the past there  has

never  been any government or party which was  like

the  People's Action Party as a Government. We have

been  courageous and resolute. Before  the  general

elections, we realised that under the limitation of

a self-governing Constitution, we could not realise

all  our  aims by just shouting empty  slogans  and

promises  to  the people. Therefore, the  Five-Year

Development  Plan  proposed  by  us  was  the  only

promise that we could make to the people. That  has

been the blueprint of our policy since we came into

power.  This blueprint before us today is based  on

our  policy  from the Five-Year Plan [The  Tasks  Ahead].  This also shows that the path we are taking

will, in the coming years, enable us to realise our

dream.   The  unprincipled  Parties  are  now   all

bankrupt, and we do not see their leaders any more.

During  this two-day debate, we have seen that  the

Members of the Opposition do not have the necessary

courage   to   face  or  criticise  the   proposals

contained in this Four-Year Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems confronting Singapore need our

present Plan for their solution. But the Members of

the   Opposition   are  afraid  that   the   P.A.P.

Government  will be successful in the execution  of

this  Development Plan. Then they will have nowhere

to go. Therefore, they unscrupulously criticise the

Government. They say the Government, during the  22

months  since  their coming into power,  have  made

some  minor  mistakes. They exaggerate these  minor

mistakes.  But  in  what way  do  these  criticisms

contribute  to the well-being of the people?  Their

only  purpose is to attack and hurt the P.A.P.,  so

that the people will lose their faith in them. This

will  make  the people lose faith in the democratic

parliamentary system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Opposition Members, in their lengthy

speeches,  have  also touched  upon  the  work  the

P.A.P. have done in the past. In these speeches  it

appears that they want to teach us, but then,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



judging   from   what  they   do   in   their   own

organisation, they are unable to teach themselves.

That  is why they are now in a mess. That  is  why

they  are now sitting opposite us. The P.A.P. is  a

well organised and responsible Party. The proposals

in  this Four-Year Development Plan clearly show us

as  a responsible Government in facing the economic

development of Singapore. It clearly shows that  we

are earnest, keen and very responsible, and we want

to  see  the  Plan  carried out so  that  it  will

achieve  its purpose and come to a very  successful

end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now quote from the editorial in the

Nanyang  Siang  Pau of 3rd April,  to  conclude  my

speech  to show whether the tabling of this  motion

is  for  the  purpose of meeting the Hong  Lim

by-election,  or whether this Plan is really  to  meet

the  needs of Singapore in order to solve  all  the

problems facing the people of Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During last May, it was announced by the

Treasury that the Government had formulated a  plan

to  encourage  economic development in  the  coming

five  years.  If  all the detailed  programmes  are

included, then the period for the plan will  be  at

least four years, from 1961 to 1964:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quotation clearly shows what the P.A.P.

really is. We, the P.A.P., are never opportunistic.

Only  reactionary cliques want to rob during a fire

and  fish  in troubled waters. It is just like  the

Lim  Yew  Hock Government in the past.  Before  the

general elections, they played many tricks. One day

they built roads in a few villages; and another day

they  installed  a few rubbish cans.  But  can  all

these actions win the confidence and support of the

people?  No  wonder  they are  now  so  lonely  and

pitiful!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore had been under colonial rule for many

years.  Therefore,  the  people  of  Singapore  are

suffering  in all ways. They are poor and  many  of

them  are  in  a very difficult position.  Speaking

from the point of view of geography, we are only  a

tiny  island.  We  do  not have natural  resources.

There   is,   in  addition,  a  rapidly  increasing

population.  According  to statistics,  the  babies

born  every  year total 65,000. This is a  prolific

increase in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



the  natural  birthrate.  From  all  this,  if  our

livelihood depends only on the entrepot  trade,  we

cannot maintain ourselves in this way forever.  The

only way out is to industrialise. That will help to

solve the problem of our livelihood. Therefore  our

Government  has  tabled this Four-Year  Development

Plan.  The  total investment sum is  $871  million.

This is a great sum. This will give a better future

for the people of Singapore and it will lay a sound

foundation for future industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Four-Year Development Plan has very much to

do  with the people of Singapore. It has also  very

much to do with the future generation of the people

of  Singapore. Therefore, it ought to have the full

support   of   all  the  people,  concertedly   and

unitedly. I hope this Development Plan will receive

the  full support of the people, and make them work

harder  in  order  to achieve  all  that  has  been

envisaged in the Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pointed out in this Plan that because of

the population increase and other problems, we must

extend  our social and health services and  so  on.

But  housing is also a very important item  in  our

Plan.  In this respect it takes up 40 per  cent  of

the  sum  allotted.  From this  great  sum  it  can

clearly  be  seen  that the P.A.P. Government  have

exerted  their  utmost  to  solve  the  problem  of

housing   for  the  people.  It  means   that   the

Government  have  to  build over  10,000  units  of

houses  per  year in order to alleviate  the

over-crowded situation prevailing at the present moment.

Therefore,  during  the  period  of  the  Four-Year

Development  Plan, we will build over 50,000  units

of houses. As the Plan is being put into execution,

the  better lands will be put to better use.  As  a

Systematic  development, we are  also  prepared  to

build new houses in the centre of the crowded areas

in  order  to solve the confused situation  and  to

improve  the present position. The areas  envisaged

for  future improvement are mainly Queenstown,  Toa

Payoh,  MacPherson Road, Kallang,  Mountbatten  and

Tanjong Rhu. The building of more houses is one  of

the  P.A.P.'s policies. At present there  are  many

types of houses being built to meet the needs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



of   people  of  different  family  background  and

economic  background, so that the poor  masses  can

afford to pay the rent. For instance, the types  of

houses include a one-room flat, a two-room flat and

a  three-room flat. We will allot all these  houses

according  to ration and the number of  members  in

the family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Plan it is envisaged that the

number  that  can be completed in  these  areas  in

every year is as follows: In 1961, we will build in

Kampong   Tiong   Bahru,  St.   Michael's   Estate,

MacPherson  Road  and Queenstown,  7,096  units  of

houses. In 1962, in the Queenstown, Farrer Road and

Geylang  areas, 9,735 units will be  completed.  In

1963,  in Toa Payoh there will he a satellite town.

Then there will be fiats totalling 9,690 units  for

the  ordinary  people. In 1964, in  the  MacPherson

Road,  Toa Payoh and Thomson Road areas there  will

be  12,150  units of houses. In 1965, in MacPherson

Road  and  Toa Payoh there will be 1,176  units  of

houses. Let us total up all the figures. By 1965 we

will  have  completed over 51,000 units of  houses,

entailing a sum of $200 million. This is  what  the

P.A.P. Government intend to carry out in respect of

their housing policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Development Board has already

completed  2,112 units of houses  in  the  past  22

months.  They are located at the Jalan Eunos  Malay

Settlement area, Kampong Koo Chye and Tiong  Bahru.

732  units  are now in the process of being  built.

They   will  be  completed  in  the  near   future.

Therefore, we are fully confident that by  1962  we

will   have   cleared   13,000   applications   for

allocation of houses. This will contribute  to  the

solution  of the housing problem. In this  respect

we  have justified some of the trust put in by  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, let me appeal to all the

people   of  Singapore.  Because  of  the  problems

Four-Year Development Plan will meet with success.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  yesterday  our  Minister  for

Finance proposed in this Assembly a detailed

Four-Year   Development   Plan  which   is   now   under

consideration.   This  Plan  illustrates   a   very

important  point,  i.e., that  only  a  responsible

Party  which resolutely wishes to do something  for

the  people  can  formulate a realistic  industrial

plan for the people of Singapore. This is historic.

This  Plan  itself is very wise and  is  absolutely

necessary in the present circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is only an island of 224 square miles.

We do not have enough natural resources to maintain

a  high living standard. Without the Plan, the high

living  standard  will  gradually  be  lowered.  My

friends  have  all  spoken about  the  increase  of

population.   They  say  that   the   increase   of

population  is  a very serious problem  facing  the

country. The population increase of this island is

very terrific and surprising. There is one birth on

this  island  every seven minutes. The increase  in

population, of course, will entail something  good.

But  it will also entail some serious problems  for

the  Government. The Government has to  face  these

problems  which  are  brought about  by  the  rapid

increase of population. The population in Singapore

has  increased from 1,500,000 to 1,600,000. At  the

moment,   Singapore's  standard   of'   living   is

considerably  high as compared with  that  of  many

other   neighbouring  countries,  such  as  Ceylon,

Burma, Hongkong, Thailand, Indonesia and India. Our

standard  of  living may be many times higher  than

their's.  Why do we have this high living standard?

How can Singapore maintain this prosperous state? I

think  this  is not accidental to this  island.  On

this  island there are many people, and yet it  is,

short  of natural resources. Our people have  posed

many  serious problems for the Government, but they

are  courageous and want to learn how  to  advance

themselves. We have good people in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



our  tiny island. Our island is the heart of

South-East  Asia  and  also  its  centre  of  trade.  Our

prosperity, in the main, depends on entrepot trade.

This  entrepot trade has become part and parcel  of

our people. Of course, we have some industries, and

we  are processing goods imported from outside. The

processing  and  manufacturing  of  these  imported

goods  has  given some jobs to the people.  But  we

cannot solve all the unemployment problems with the

little  factories that already exist. We cannot  be

sure that the entrepot trade will continue forever.

We   must   create  more  employment  opportunities

artificially.   If  we  cannot   merge   with   the

Federation  of  Malaya immediately, then  the  only

solution to our problems economically and in  other

respects  is  to  industrialise.  At  the   present

moment,  we have the entrepot trade. This  entrepot

trade  has  greatly helped the  people  to  earn  a

living.  But,  on  the  other hand,  our  increased

population   has  caused  many  serious   troubles.

According  to  the 1947 statistics, our  population

increase  averaged 4.3 per cent  every  year.  Thus

there  will  be  more people every year.  The  rate

increase  in  the  population of Singapore  is  the

highest  in the world. If this occurs in  countries

which  are  vast  in areas, then this  increase  in

population does not bring much trouble.  This  will

give  them  more labour hands. But  in  this  small

island of ours, this increase in population  is  so

frightening that it has caused many problems to the

Government. Therefore, the Government have to think

of  ways to meet this situation and the demands  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Four-Year Development Plan is brought out at

the time when there is a coming by-election in Hong

Lim.  Because  of  this timing,  some  unprincipled

people  have  criticized the Plan  as  having  been

brought out just for the purpose of winning  votes.

They  say  that  our Plan is only an empty  "show".

This  will  be  damaging  to the  industrialisation

plan. They disregard existing realities. This  Plan

consists of 134 pages. How can it be formulated  in

just one month and be printed and issued?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the P.A.P., are steady in our policy. We do

not cheat the people with empty slogans or by other

deceitful means. Our work in the past can stand the

test. I say that our Four-Year Development Plan  is

realistic. It is also a very steady plan. It is  an

attempt  to  solve some of the problems  that  face

Singapore. At the same time, a radical solution  of

Singapore's problems is not possible just  by  this

Plan  alone.  But this Plan can, in a  short  time,

resolve certain problems facing Singapore, such  as

the  increase  of  population and the  unemployment

problem.  If  the  entrepot trade can  create  more

employment opportunities for the people, then it is

quite  good.  But then it is not quite possible  in

the  long  run.  A  few days ago the  Minister  for

Finance  and  the Minister for National Development

at  various  mass  meetings said  that  out  of  10

persons,  there was one person unemployed.  Because

of the number of unemployed people, many people are

affected and the consequences are quite serious. If

we  do  not think of a way to resolve this  problem

but  merely resort to unreasonable means,  then  it

will be a very irresponsible act. Those people  who

resort  to  mean  tactics  will  show  their   true

colours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Plan will need the full-hearted support of

the  people  if it is to be executed  smoothly  and

meet  with  success. I fully support the speech  of

the  Finance Minister. That is to say, the  success

of  the  Plan  depends  on  the  support  of  three

sides - labour, the Government and capital. The

three sides  have already come to an agreement to support

this Plan. From this, we can imagine that when  the

Plan  is put into operation it will be carried  out

smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to answer some points in the speech of the

hon.  Member for Tanglin. He said that on a certain

occasion  he went to an amusement park  and  met  a

doorkeeper,  and  from his remarks  he  found  that

there  were  many  goods in  Singapore  which  were

without  buyers. But he is a very learned  scholar.

He cannot assess the opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



of  the  masses of poor people. He can only  assess

the  opinion of just one single person. It is  very

wrong  to  judge from the attitude  of  one  person

only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now deal with our hon. Member for

Cairnhill.  He has said that the P.A.P.  Government

have  driven the capitalists into the sea. But  who

has  done that? The real capitalists can understand

this. A government which has a Minister who owns  a

mine!  How  can  this  kind of  government  attract

capitalists to invest in Singapore? Capitalists are

all  realists. They will only invest if there is  a

stable,  social,  political and economic  situation

that   is  beneficial  to  them.  The  Member   for

Cairnhill  also  criticized that the  Minister  for

Labour and Law was always fond of resorting to  the

P.P.S.O. to threaten the capitalists. Now, this  is

really interesting. The Minister for Labour used it

only  in a certain situation when there was trouble

in the pineapple industry. It was concerned with  a

certain  factory  and there were very  unreasonable

circumstances. Therefore, the Minister for Labour's

attitude was quite right at that time when he  made

such  utterances. This shows that the  attitude  of

the  P.A.P. is correct. Any unreasonable  attitude

which  is  detrimental  to  the  workers  will  not

receive our support. Our attitude towards them will

be   resolute.   Capitalists  and  employers   must

understand  that. Industrial peace does not  depend

on  our workers kneeling down in front of them  and

seeking  it.  It  depends only on mutual  help  and

understanding. Only then we can achieve this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill further said that the

Industrialisation  Plan was prepared  by  the  past

Government.  Perhaps  the  past  Government  did

prepare something along the lines of this Plan, but

they then did not have the attitude as now shown by

the  P.A.P.  If  they did have  such  an  attitude,

perhaps they would not be in the pitiful and lonely

situation  in  which  they find  themselves  today.

Their  present  position is pitiful,  because  they

only know how to shout



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



and  quibble.  They  can only  admire  the  present

Government.  They  cannot  understand   their   own

mistakes.  They  can  only quibble  and  talk  some

nonsense   about   Bukit   Timah,   Johore   Bahru,

doorkeepers, the P.P.S.O., and so on. This  is  all

they can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Cairnhill and his

fellow-travellers  said that our industrialisation  policy

is  only  an empty show. This is only mean talk  on

their part.



<br><br>4.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   on   behalf  of  the  electorate  of   Upper

Serangoon, I unreservedly support the motion on the

1961-1964  Development Plan  of  the  Minister  for

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who has carefully read this Plan will

agree  that  it  is  not  a  wild  ambitious  Plan.

Although this Plan has received the full support of

all  the  people, we cannot solve all the  problems

caused  by  the  rapid increase in  population,  in

particular the serious unemployment problem, within

the space of four years. When the Plan is executed,

it  will  not  radically  change  the  position  of

Singapore which has always depended on the entrepot

trade  for  its livelihood. It will not weaken  the

position  of  the private investors,  but  it  will

strengthen their economic position in this country.

What  does  this  mean?  We believe  in  democratic

socialism,   but  we  are  seriously   limited   by

political and economic considerations in respect of

land,  raw materials and natural resources. At  the

present   stage,  the  gap  between  the  objective

realities and our socialistic aims is still  great.

I  hope,  what I  have said will  not  convey  the

impression  that we who believe in  socialism  have

had  our belief shakened. It does not mean that  we

bow  down our heads in the face of reality.  We  do

not  run away from reality. We will not change  our

attitude to build a socialist State because of  the

difficulties which lie ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan reflects the Party's policy to

improve the livelihood of the people as a long-term

objective.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



It  shows  our will and tactfulness. This Four-Year

Plan  fully  analyses  the  economic  situation  of

Singapore.  It not only points out what the  people

and the Government have to do, but it also sets out

in  great detail what the people will have to do in

the  different  stages of economic construction  in

order to benefit them socially. This Plan is not  a

socialist  plan,  but we are fully convinced  that,

given the present conditions, there will not  be  a

better  and a more realistic Plan than the  present

Plan. This Plan will preserve at least the existing

level of the people's health and will not lower the

existing  social and welfare standard. Furthermore,

the  standard  of building houses, public  highways

and   telecommunications   and   the   supply    of

electricity, water and gas will be highest in

South-East   Asia.   Therefore,  in  my   opinion,   this

Development Plan - no matter what quality it has - will

benefit  people  in all walks of life,  taking  the

long-term point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from what the Minister for

Finance  said  yesterday on the  Development  Plan,

everybody can see that the Government has  honestly

exerted  its  utmost. From now on,  the  Government

will  continue  to create favourable conditions  to

ensure  the  success of the Development  Plan.  The

Government  will  embark  on  recruiting  the  best

specialists and technical personnel There will be a

reorganisation  of the economic and  administrative

organisations.  Foreign  investors  will  be  given

favourable  conditions  to induce  them  to  invest

here.  Politically-conscious  trade  union  leaders

have  been  persuaded to weigh  soberly  the  whole

situation in Singapore. The Union representing  the

working  people  in Singapore, namely,  the  Trades

Union  Congress,  has  already  declared  its  full

support  for this Four-Year Development Plan  which

is  in  the  interest of the people. The union  has

said  that it will do its utmost to co-operate with

the  Government and the capitalists  to  solve  the

unemployment  problem.  We  must  congratulate  the

leaders of the workers in that they have the spirit

of  tolerance  and are wise. Here I would  like  to

quote a Chinese saying,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



`Everything is ready, but short of only  the  "east

wind".'



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "east wind" means the keen interest of the

capitalists  to open new factories.  On  the  other

hand,   it  is  the  responsibility  of  Government

officers,    administrative   experts,    technical

personnel and the workers to make everything ready.

But  without  the "east wind", the Plan  cannot  be

smoothly carried out and completed. We believe that

the local capitalists who are in the entrepot trade

have enough strength to blow up this east wind  and

not  allow foreign capitalists to go ahead of  them

in   future.   The   lack  of   manufacturing   and

entrepreneuring  experience  and  an  international

market  is  not important. We are like  many  other

countries  in  that we have clever and hard-working

people.  Difficulties  in  the  form  of  lack   of

experience  and technique can be overcome.  In  the

preliminary  stage,  a very  great  market  is  not

necessary  because of changes in the  international

situation.  In the past, the practice has  been  to

telephone and engage some transport workers to make

money.  This practice cannot be carried on forever.

Those   capitalists  who  are  conscious  of   this

situation must recognise these facts, and they must

in   time   utilise  the  unprecedented  favourable

conditions  provided by self-government  to  invest

locally,   to  build  factories,  and   to   change

themselves from the despised compradore class  into

a national industrialist class of the people.



<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to support the motion of the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Development Plan 1961-1964 presents a

very  clear  account  of  the  problems  that  face

Singapore in a very scientific and easily  readable

manner. In presenting the State Development Plan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



1961-1964  it  is  not  envisaged  that  a  total

solution of all our problems can be effected by the

implementation of this Plan alone. Firstly, whether

the  provisions of this Plan can be implemented  in

tow within the period 1961-1964 will depend on some

imponderable factors, but we are hopeful that  with

the   full  co-operation  of  all  the  people   of

Singapore,  particularly  the  workers,  the  trade

union    movement    and   the   businessmen    and

industrialists, we can jointly and in united effort

surmount  all insurmountable difficulties and  work

towards fulfilment of the Plan. Secondly, and  this

is  even more important, it must be understood that

the  full  implementation of this  Plan  will  give

employment to only some 40,000 of the 84,000 people

that  are expected to be in the unemployment market

in  1964. But the greater significance of this Plan

lies  in  the  fact that, in giving  employment  to

40,000 people it paves the way to industrialisation

and foreign investments by preparing the ground, so

to speak, for factories to come up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be presumptuous on my part to dwell in

further  detail  on the principles  underlying  the

Plan which has been so expertly presented. But I do

feel  justified  in emphasising the more  important

aspects   of  the  Plan.  Perhaps  it  is   because

industrialisation  has  been  mouthed  by  so  many

people as a vague concept that would solve all  the

ills  and  all the problems of all undeveloped  and

underdeveloped countries that we have accepted  the

proposition  without further examination  into  its

implications. But the question, Sir, surely is  how

to   industrialise,  and  this  has  stumped   more

politicians  than  many other problems.  The  great

significance   of   the  State  Development   Plan

1961-1964  lies in its concrete attempt in  dealing

with this pressing problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the great difficulty in

industrialisation  stems  from  the  reluctance  of

local  capitalists to invest in industry.  This  is

quite understandable. Owing to Singapore's position

as  an  international trading centre, local capital

is tied up in commerce. As far as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



commercial  capital is concerned, money is  readily

available   for   rapid  and   profitable   trading

transactions. Because of the lack of foresight  and

know-how, particularly industrial organisation  and

management,  local  money  is  not  available   for

industrial  capital.  But this  difficulty  is  not

insurmountable, for it is known that it is possible

to  accelerate  the  transformation  of  commercial

capital   into  industrial  capital  by  what   the

economists  call `demonstration effect'. Investment

in   industries   by   capital  from   industrially

developed  countries will create the  psychological

conditions for local capital to enter industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Development Plan aims at attracting

private  capital,  both  local  and  foreign,  into

Singapore. At this juncture, I may be permitted  to

quote  a  few operative sentences in the  Plan.  At

page 33, paragraph 3.6. it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Government's task in this plan is mainly to

create    the   conditions   which   would   induce

substantial private capital into industries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in paragraph 3.7 it recognises:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The only attraction that private capital has in

investments  is  the  profit  that  can  be   made.

Consequently, creating the conditions conducive  to

the  investment of private capital must mean  inter

alia  giving such services as would lower costs  of

production.  Some costs can be prohibitive  if  the

services  required have to be created by individual

entrepreneurs. On the other hand, if these services

are  created for the industry as a whole the  costs

to individual entrepreneurs may be low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.8. Consequently, the Government's contributions

to  industrial development, in the first  instance,

is  to  provide adequate supply of cheap power  and

water,  to lay out industrial estates, which  would

have   these   facilities  in  addition   to   good

communication  with the port and  to  provide  good

port facilities.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan lays great emphasis on the problem of

population growth which at a rate of 4.3  per  cent

is  the  highest  known  in the  world!  Even  more

significant than the absolute size and increase  of

our population is its structure. More than half  of

the population are under 21 years of age. The major

task of the Singapore Government is to channel  the

potential   energy  of  these  young  people   into

productive  employment.  Manpower  is  an  economic

resource, but it differs from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



national resources in that it is inseparably linked

with  men who are living personalities. It is  also

an  asset  which cannot be stored. Because  of  the

human   element,   unless  a   country's   manpower

resources,  which  in the final analysis  are  most

precious,  are  productively utilised,  social  and

political  ills must follow. It cannot,  therefore,

be   too   strongly  emphasised  that   the   State

Development  Plan  is  a concrete  example  of  the

P.A.P.  Government's  determination  to  solve  the

unemployment  problem. Whether the Government  will

succeed  or  not, much would depend  upon  the

co-operation   of   all  the  people   of   Singapore,

particularly  the  workers  and  the  trade   union

movement and the businessmen and industrialists. If

every  single  person is prepared to make  personal

sacrifices and work for the benefit of the State as

a  whole, then I say we cannot but succeed in  this

enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying the Plan purely from the point of view

of  the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Health,  it would appear that the need for  such  a

Plan  arose out of over-enthusiasm on the  part  of

the  Ministry of Health. Reading between the lines,

I  come  to a paradox. I am unable to tell  whether

praise  or  reproach is meant in the  implications.

However,   coming   back  from   my   light-hearted

deviation, the point I wish to drive home  is  that

our  population is expanding far too rapidly for  a

tiny city State such as Singapore. With our limited

terrestrial   dimensions  and   lack   of   natural

resources, even industrialisation may not solve the

problem  in  the long run unless man-made  barriers

are  removed. The long-term solution to our problem

would  appear to be found in population control.  A

birth rate of 65,000 per year, or one baby in every

7  minutes, is certainly a luxury which  our  State

can ill-afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high birth rate today not only presents

problems  of unemployment 20 years hence, but  also

drains Government resources heavily from the  point

of  view  of provision of social services.  If  the

tendency of population increase is not checked,  by

1982  the  total  cost  of  health,  education  and

welfare  services in Singapore would amount  to  the

fantastic sum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



of  $385  million  per annum. This would  certainly

embarrass  Government's industrialisation programme

in  that  money that could have been ploughed  into

industrialisation would have to be diverted to  the

provision of social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that while the implementation of

this  Plan  stands to benefit all and  sundry,  the

special efforts have to come and have to be made by

a  few  - the workers and the trade union  movement,

the   businessmen  and  industrialists,   who   are

directly  involved  in  the  industrialisation   of

Singapore. The other section of the population,  it

is   argued,  other  than  supporting  Government's

Development Plan and creating conditions  conducive

to  success for the Plan have no tangible  part  to

play. Here, I would like to crave the indulgence of

the Minister for Finance to allow me to introduce a

slightly personal bias in my interpretation of  his

motion  to suggest that all sections of the  people

of  Singapore can play their part in the fulfilment

of  this  Plan  in a tangible manner by  practising

family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal and national benefits of family

planning have been given wide publicity during  the

Family Planning Campaign, the first phase of  which

began  last  November  with  the  training  of  lay

workers   and   the   successful  family   planning

exhibition.  The  same exhibition  is  still  going

round  the various rural community centres and  the

campaign is at present directed at rural dwellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our policy in The Tasks Ahead, we stated at

page 20, "Our Health Policy" that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In a decent socialist society every person is

entitled, as of right, to access to all the medical

services  needed  to  maintain  himself  in   sound

health. Health should not be a luxury to be enjoyed

only  by the privileged rich while the great masses

live in disease and poverty. It will take some time

yet  for  us  in Singapore to achieve  a  socialist

society.  This  is  possible  only  in  the   wider

framework  of  a  union between the Federation  and

Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also stated in exact terms in this same

document  the nature of the improvements  necessary

for  the  provision  of  a  service  that  will  go

principally  to the broad masses of Singapore.  The

State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



Development   Plan   provides  for   the   complete

fulfilment of the P.A.P. election promises  to  the

people, as contained in this booklet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Programme for the Ministry of

Health  at page 103 of the Plan sets out in  detail

our   development  projects.  The  first   district

hospital at Thomson Road will be completed by 1962,

and  the second district hospital will be built  by

early  1964.  The completion of these two  district

hospitals  will  enable the  people  to  have  easy

access to hospital service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Hospital, which is situated within

convenient  distance  for  the  majority  of   town

dwellers,  will be enlarged and modernised  by  the

addition  of  a third medical unit of  100  to  120

beds.  The  Orthopedic Department and  Radiotherapy

Unit  will  be modernised with a view to  providing

better  services in consonance with modern  medical

practice. The Out-patient Services will be  greatly

enlarged  so as to provide out-patient services  to

the   people  almost  at  their  door-steps.   Nine

combined out-patient clinics and eight

out-door out-patient clinics will be built in the next four year

and  the  out-patient clinic at present at  Kallang

will be further developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovations and extensions to the Kandang Kerbau

Maternity Hospital will be effected during the next

four  years.  The  existing  Domiciliary  Midwifery

Service  was  found to be unpopular  by  the  urban

population  for  socio-economic  reasons.   Mothers

living in congested cubicles would always prefer to

go  to hospital for confinement on consideration of

space   alone,   not  to  speak   of   convenience.

Government  has  therefore  decided  to  build  two

maternity homes in crowded urban areas to serve the

needs  of the masses. The first Maternity  Home  at

Maxwell  Road  will  be  completed  and  ready  for

occupation  early  next year. The second  Maternity

Home will be built in 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevention being better than cure, Government has

laid  heavy emphasis on preventive health measures.

The Diphtheria Immunisation Bill was passed at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



the  last  sitting of the Assembly to  require  all

children  in Singapore to be effectively  immunised

against   diphtheria.   Similar   legislation   for

tuberculosis  will be introduced in the  very  near

future.  The  mass X-ray campaign at present  being

mounted  would pick out T.B. patients  who  act  as

reservoirs   of   infection   for   treatment   and

isolation. Better housing services provided for  by

the  Development Plan would help to eradicate  this

terrible disease. In 1962, it is envisaged that the

Thoracic  Unit  would  come up  in  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital so that better facilities for the surgical

treatment of tuberculosis can be offered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of personal health services, new

combined clinics for Maternal and Child Health  and

School  Health  Services  would  be  built.  It  is

envisaged that two such clinics would be  built  in

the  urban areas and eight large ones and 12  small

ones  built  in  rural areas within the  next  four

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in conclusion, it cannot be too strongly

stressed  that  the  State  Development   Plan   is

Government's answers to the problems enumerated  in

Chapter 1 of the Plan. Successful implementation of

this Plan alone may not solve all the problems, but

without  such  a  Plan  the future  may  indeed  be

disastrous,  as  one  out of  every  four  or  five

economically active persons will be unemployed.

<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me say that when  the

Opposition  Members  saw the Four-Year  Development

Plan  proposed  by our Minister for  Finance,  they

were  very  sour  in their hearts. The  Member  for

Cairnhill said that when he was the Chief Minister,

he also had this Plan. But we can now say here that

he  did not have the courage to produce such a Plan

in  the  past.  Today,  we, the  P.A.P.,  have  the

courage  and capability to produce this Plan.  When

he  saw  this, he said that this was what he wanted

to put forward before, as though he wanted to share

in the merits in introducing this Plan. If they are

responsible representatives of the people,  and  if

their  minds are not biased and influenced by party

politics and a partisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



spirit,   then   they   will   also   support   the

Government's  Development Plan,  because  it  was

formulated  to  take  into  consideration  all  the

circumstances prevailing in Singapore and with  due

regard to all the realities of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Plan is to improve the

economic  position of Singapore,  industralise  it,

expand  the  economy,  promote  the  export  trade,

facilitate   communications,  provide  social   and

health  services,  and alleviate  the  unemployment

problem. If this Plan can be successfully executed,

then  the  standard  of living  of  the  people  of

Singapore will be more or less raised. The  success

or  failure  of this Plan depends on the  concerted

and  united effort of all the people. They must all

work hard in order to realise all that is envisaged

in the Plan. This Four-Year Development Plan is not

merely a piece of paper for show. It does not build

castles in the air. Those people who are blinded by

doctrinarian  concepts and so on will,  of  course,

show a lot of dissatisfaction with this Development

Plan. It is a realistic and practical Plan to  meet

all the serious problems confronting Singapore.  It

is not an empty dream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We remember that in the past the Opposition

Members  said  that if the P.A.P. were  allowed  to

form  the  Government, then all the shops would  be

closed down and the rice-bowls of the people  would

be broken. It has now been clearly shown that their

past propaganda was only lies meant to deceive  the

people.  As  a  woman worker, and as  one  who  has

suffered in the old society, I am glad to see  that

in  the Plan it is envisaged that two creches  will

be built. They will be built where there is a dense

population. Two maternity hospitals and 22 maternal

and  child  clinics will be built. I am glad  about

this news. The Government is exerting its utmost to

take care of the welfare of women. I also hope that

the building of community centres will enable women

to  participate  in  social activities.  Women  can

participate in all this. This protection  given  to

the  people  will  encourage  and  promote  women's

activities  and  release them from  their  domestic

burdens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let us see the community centres built by

the  Government, their uses and their purposes.  At

the  present  moment,  there are  many  people  who

unreasonably attack the building of these community

centres.  That is why it is all the more  necessary

for me to clarify and stress the importance and the

use  of  these centres. Our present society is  now

undergoing  a  social revolution and  changes,  and

this  revolution and changes have to  be  supported

and strengthened by education. The P.A.P. wants  to

achieve  a  new  socialist society,  a  more  equal

society,   and   therefore,   under   the   present

circumstances,  Singapore has to create  favourable

conditions in order to merge with the Federation of

Malaya,  to  break  down the barrier  of  languages

among  the  people, and to instil  a  consciousness

among   them.  Therefore,  the  building  of  these

community centres is very important. Those who have

actively  taken part in the activities of community

centres  have all clearly seen this. In the evening

we  can  see many people, old and young and of  all

races,  mix together, enjoy themselves,  talk,  and

take  part  in  all  sorts of activities,  such  as

sports   or   attending   classes   and   receiving

vocational education, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. For instance, our

community centre is situated in a slum area.  There

is  a  team  of women. They can lend the  community

centre  for  the purpose of holding a tea-party  or

for   other   health  activities.  All  this   will

contribute  to  their  being  friendly   with   one

another.  This can contribute to the breaking  down

of the language barrier among all the races. On the

other  hand,  through  the community  centres,  the

Government  can  understand the  opinions  and  the

wants  of  the  people.  Their  criticisms  of  the

Government  can all be gathered and  assessed,  and

then  based on all these, the Government will  seek

ways  to  improve and to do things for the good  of

the  people, so that all the people can  be  united

together  and can participate in community  centres

activities. All these facts show clearly  that  the

people  are wholeheartedly supporting the community

centres.   Because   of  this  the   centres   will

contribute  very  much to their  livelihood.  These

centres  are  meeting the needs of the people.  The

people can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



carry out all kinds of activities by making use  of

these  centres.  In  future, they  will  definitely

become part and parcel of the lives of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from these community

centres we can see that they are very important  to

the unity of the people. Yet the Opposition Members

have  levelled  criticisms  at  them.  I  hope  the

Opposition  Members will co-operate in  every  way.

That  is  only right. If they persist  in  creating

rumours and trouble, that is not right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Kandasamy):</b> I think it  is

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion on the State

Development  Plan  calls for the  full  and

whole-hearted co-operation of the people of Singapore  in

all  walks  of life in order to make it a  success.

This  is  not only inevitable, but also  right  and

proper,  since it is a Plan that has to be  carried

out by the people for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter III of the Plan has broadly classified

the  development  projects into  three  categories,

namely, those contributing to economic development,

those contributing to social development, and those

concerned with public administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects for which the Ministry of National

Development is responsible belong to the first  two

categories, and I should like to make a  report  on

some  of the projects and, in particular, the  part

they will play in the Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I shall deal with Rural Development

Schemes.  Under  the  Plan a  total  of  about  $26

million will be spent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



over  the  next  four years on projects  that  will

include  roads, improvement to bridges,  and  water

and  electricity  supplies in the rural  areas.  Of

this total, a sum of $700,000 has been reserved for

special  schemes designed specifically  to  improve

the lot of our farmers, fishermen and other primary

producers.  These people are playing  an  important

part in our task of nation-building by producing or

otherwise  making  available  much  of  the   pork,

chicken,  fish, vegetables and fruit that  make  up

the daily food of our population. Our objective  is

to   improve  and  increase  their  production   by

teaching  them  the latest techniques  and  helping

them by various forms of State assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department under my

Ministry  has continued to improve and  expand  the

various  services  provided to  farmers  and  other

producers  in the rural areas. There  has  been  an

increase  in the number of free inoculations  given

to  protect pigs and poultry from disease, and  our

ploughing  service has proved extremely useful  and

popular. For fishermen who use power boats, we have

been  providing a repair service for engine  faults

and  breakdowns. We have also started  a  Fisheries

Training  School at Pasir Panjang for  rural  youth

interested  in the fishing industry.  At  the  same

time,   research  and  experimental  work  on   the

development  of better strains of pigs and  poultry

with  stronger resistance to disease and  a  higher

yield  of  meat  and  eggs have  been  making  good

progress at the Sembawang Animal Husbandry Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various new projects that we have planned over

the next four years will both expand and add to the

services  now being provided, and will include  the

establishment  of  four more  veterinary  extension

centres  to bring these services within easy  reach

of  the  people,  and a special  goat  distribution

scheme  that  wilt  help to  improve  the  economic

position  of  the Malay community in  the  Southern

Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking about the Development Plan for

Singapore,  with its long history of dependence  on

its   entrepot  trade  and  the  obvious  need   to

concentrate on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



industrialisation, it is very easy to overlook  the

importance  of  rural  development.  It  is  seldom

realised,  for  example, that quite a  considerable

section  of our population is engaged in  food  and

agricultural  production. According to  the  latest

survey,  we  have  about 25,000 farmers  and  about

6,000 fishermen, and if we take into account their

families and other people who are involved, we get

a   figure  of  something  like  2,000,000  people,

slightly above 1/10 of the population. It has  been

estimated  that their annual production is  in  the

region  of  some 750,000 pigs, 16,000,000 chickens,

200,000,000 eggs, 34,000 tons of vegetables,  1,700

tons  of fruits and 12,000 tons of fish. There  is,

of  course,  a  limit  to  rural  and  agricultural

development, largely as a result of the scarcity of

good  usable  land in Singapore,  and  the  various

competing  claims for what little land  there  is,

for example, for industrial development and housing

purposes. The Government, while it is aware of this

limitation, is resolved nevertheless to do what  it

can  to  improve this hitherto neglected sector  of

the  State  economy,  since  rural  development  if

properly planned and properly directed can play  an

important part in the Development Plan by providing

employment  for the rural population, reducing  the

State's  dependence on imports of  food,  improving

the  livelihood  of our farmers and fishermen,  and

generally  improving rural conditions,  helping  to

achieve  the  optimum use of  scarce  land  in  the

State.  In this connection, Sir, I should  like  to

mention the swamp reclamation and flood alleviation

projects  that  will be undertaken by  the  P.W.D.,

because  these  projects  will  facilitate   to   a

considerable extent the Government's plan for rural

development. The Development Plan provides for  the

expenditure   of  nearly  $12  million   on   flood

alleviation and $4 million on swamp reclamation.  I

need  hardly  remind the House of the frequent  and

disastrous  floods which in the past  brought  loss

and  suffering  to  our  farmers  and  other  rural

dwellers. The Government has already completed  two

schemes in Bedok and Geylang which have put an  end

to  the  floods  that used to plague  these  areas.

Further schemes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



which  have been planned for implementation in  the

next four years include an extension of the Geylang

scheme  and  new  schemes in Bukit  Timah  and  Ulu

Pandan,   two  of  the  worst  flooding  areas   in

Singapore. As for swamp reclamation, the Government

has  a  scheme for converting about 4,000 acres  of

useless  swamp land in various parts of  the  rural

areas  into  useful  assets.  When  completed,  the

scheme will provide 1,000 acres of much needed farm

land,  1,000 acres of prawn ponds, and 2,000  acres

of fish ponds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few words now about the part

to be played in the Development Plan by the housing

projects of the Housing and Development Board.  The

Plan  provides for the expenditure of  a  total  of

over $190 million on housing projects that will  be

undertaken  over the next four years to  provide  a

total  of  over 51,000 units. Even before  we  took

over  the  government in July  1959,  the  People's

Action  Party  had recognised as one  of  the  most

acute  problems in Singapore, the need  to  provide

good  and  cheap housing for the large and  rapidly

increasing population. It is true that the previous

Government  was also aware of the problem  and  did

take steps to wrestle with it. But I think it would

be fair to say that in wrestling with the problems,

they  failed  to  adopt a realistic  and  practical

approach, with the result that most of the  housing

units  put up by the former S.I.T. were of  a  type

not  designed  to  provide cheap  housing  for  the

people. In fact, some of the units constructed cost

so  much  to  put up that, in order to  bring  them

within  the means of the poorer classes, who  after

all  are the classes for whom the State must build,

it  is necessary to provide a considerable subsidy.

In Kallang, for example, low rentals were fixed for

the various housing units as follows: $25 per month

for  a  one-room flat, $35 per month for a two-room

flat,  $45 to $60 per month for a three-room  flat.

No  one  will  deny  that these  rentals  are  very

attractive for the types of accommodation provided.

But  if  you examine them, you will find  that  the

lowness  of the rentals is artificial. If  we  take

into  account the cost of building these flats  and

work out the rentals required to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



bring  in  an economic return, it will be necessary

to charge the following rents: $65 to $73 for a

one-room  flat, $82 to $90 for a two-room flat, $81  to

$96 for a three-room flat. It will be seen that the

artificially  low  rentals fixed  by  the  previous

Government work out in some cases to less than half

of  the economic rentals. What does this all  mean?

It means simply that to maintain these artificially

low  rents,  the Government will have to  expend  a

considerable  amount of public funds  to  subsidise

the  tenants of these flats. It has, in fact,  been

estimated  that the subsidy amounts  to  about  $1�

million  per year for Kallang Estate alone.  Is  it

justifiable  to  use  public funds  to  support  an

unrealistic rental policy in this way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But quite apart from the failure to work out a

realistic  rental  policy, the previous  Government

also  failed to build each year anything  near  the

required number of units to meet the ever worsening

housing  shortage.  Right from the  beginning,  the

People's  Action  Party Government  has  taken  the

stand  that its housing policy must be a  realistic

one, i.e., it must not only provide the houses  but

must  provide  houses  of the  right  type  and  in

sufficient numbers each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its establishment in February last year,

about  14  months,  the Housing Board  has  already

completed  a  total of 2,112 units at  Kampong  Koo

Chye,  the  Tiong Bahru fire site,  Queenstown  and

Jalan  Eunos.  This  figure, of  course,  does  not

include 794 units completed at St. Michael's Estate

and  Queenstown in 1959 by Mr Ong  Eng  Guan,  the

former  Member  for Hong Lim. The  figure  of  over

2,000   units  over  14  months  is  not   a   mean

achievement  when  we take into  consideration  the

fact  that the Housing Board needed some  money  to

get  down to the job, and compared with the average

annual production of only 1,700 units by the former

S.I.T. The Housing Board, however, is aiming to  do

much better than this over the next four years with

the following programme:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1961: 7,096 units



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a cost of ... $34.1 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1962: 9,735 units



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a cost of ... $40.7 million



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1963: 9,690 units



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a cost of ... $33.8 million



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1964: 12,710 units



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a cost of ... $44.5 million



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for the poorer classes of the

population,  the  programme will include  specially

designed one-room flats which can be rented out  at

$20  per  month; and of the 16,831 units  scheduled

for  completion in 1961 and 1962, at  least  10,000

units will be of the $20 type. This year, work  has

already  started on a number of projects that  will

provide  a  total of 7,852 units and more contracts

are in the process of being let out. Included among

these  projects  are 904 $20 units at  Tiong  Bahru

which  will be completed by August this  year,  and

814 $20 units at St. Michael's Estate which will

be completed by September this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above figures, the P.A.P.

Government cannot be accused of indulging  in  mere

talk  over  its  housing plans;  and  from  present

indications,  I  have  every  confidence  that  the

Housing Board will achieve its target of completing

a  total of over 7,000 units a year, an achievement

that  will  far surpass the highest achievement  of

3,841 units claimed by the former S.I.T. in 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister for Finance has

already said, the State Development Plan which  has

been  tabled  in  the Assembly has taken  some  six

months   of   careful  investigation  and   arduous

preparation and with both the immediate  and

long-term  welfare of the people very much in  mind.  On

the  publication  of the Plan, the  Government  has

already been assured of the co-operation of various

sections of the community, particularly the  unions

and the commercial interests, and I need hardly say

that  it  is  a  Plan that deserves  the  full  and

wholehearted co-operation not only of hon.  Members

on  the other side of the House but also of  every

citizen of our State.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the capital expenditure on

projects proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Ministry of Home Affairs is less than  $10

million  spread  over  four years.  The  amount  is

roughly divided into $7� million for the police and

just above $2 million for the prisons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the more important police projects is the

building  of  new  police stations  to  enable  the

police to maintain its efficiency and effectiveness

in protecting and safeguarding the interests of its

citizens   in  the  face  of  a  rapidly  expanding

population, the over-spilling into the rural areas,

the  building  of  new  housing  estates,  and  the

development of industrial areas. These new stations

are  the Queenstown Police Station, the new Geylang

Police  Station,  the  new station  at  Chong  Pang

Village  in Sembawang, and the new Divisional  Paya

Lebar Station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another item, which though small but nevertheless

is  in keeping with the ever-growing spirit of

co-operation  and friendliness between the people  and

the  police force, is the erection of a  number  of

village  constables' posts in various  villages  in

the   comparatively  sparse  west  coast  area   of

Singapore  Island and some of the smaller  Southern

Islands. These village constables' posts will bring

the  police another step closer to the people,  who

now  look  upon  the Force more  as  their

fellow-citizens, protecting them against evil doers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are extremely small items of expenditure

because  the  maintenance of law and  order  cannot

depend entirely on punitive measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go into the sociological reasons

for  crime.  Though  one  must  not  be  naive  and

attribute all causes of crime to the conditions  in

our    society,   we   must   never   forget   that

unemployment, poverty and housing all have  a  part

in  producing the criminals. Some criminal activity

also  arises  out  of  society  not  providing  the

machinery to channelise the energies of our youths,

by  not  having  opportunities  to  provide  useful

visions, and by not providing opportunities  for  a

life that is useful, exciting and meaningful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the important things, and the more

successful  we are in providing these  things,  the

less important would be the punitive measures.  The

more   successful   we  are  in  our   constructive

measures,  the less we have to spend on the  police

and  prisons.  This must be the  objective  of  any

civilised  society,  and  the  more  civilized  the

society,  the  more unobtrusive  can  the  punitive

machinery of the State be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I must commend to you as far as the

Plan is concerned. The Plan seeks to offer positive

solutions  to  the  problems that  often  lead  to

crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also not be out of place for me to draw

attention  to  the  fact that, as this  Development

Plan  points out, a total of nearly 84,000 new jobs

will  be  required  for full  employment,  but  the

employment opportunities of the Plan amount to only

40,000,  unless the rate of private  investment  in

new  industries can be stepped up to something like

$600  million in the Plan period. It will be  fully

appreciated,   therefore,   why   the    Government

maintains a restrictive immigration policy.  It  is

to  protect in the face of increasing unemployment.

Just  as with the Development Plan, our immigration

policy is a question of survival and the facing  of

practical realities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the targets of the Plan have been fulfilled,

25  per  cent of the population would be housed  in

public  housing, the spectre of unemployment  would

be  under control, public amenities would have been

improved significantly, and I am confident that the

punitive arms of the State can take an increasingly

minor role in maintaining law and order.



<br><br>5.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the

motion  in  the name of my colleague, the  Minister

for Finance, that the Government's Development Plan

for  the four years 1961 to 1964, as tabled, should

not  only  be  supported by all  sections  of  they

people but also be united in their efforts to  make

it a success.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall dwell upon the education aspect of the

Plan  which involves the sum of about $95  million,

or  11  per cent of the total cost of the Four-Year

Plan  of  $871  million. Education  comes  next  in

importance  to housing under the Social Development

of  the Plan, and, in fact, absorbs 27 per cent  of

the   money   allotted   for  social   development,

amounting to $350 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in advanced and well-developed countries,

education  takes a large slice not only of  revenue

but  also for future development. In fact, the more

highly  developed  the country  is  in  respect  of

education,  the  greater the advance  it  makes  in

industry, science and technology. Today, the  whole

world is excited over the great achievement of  the

Russian  space man in flight. Is this an over-night

success? Of course not. The fruits of education are

not to be seen now, tomorrow or the following year,

but  in  the next generation for the good of future

generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1930, the Russian universities had an

enrolment  of  under 300,000. In  1960,  3  decades

later,  the  number was stepped up to nearly  seven

times, to over two million. That is the reason  for

their success today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for new developing countries like

Singapore, we should have no hesitation in  setting

aside huge sums of money for education, because  we

shall be investing for the future. Our problems are

further  aggravated by the fact that our population

increase is at such a fantastic rate that we cannot

afford  to provide education for education's  sake,

but  for a set purpose. The pupils who come out  of

our  secondary schools should be trained to become

productive   and  not  passengers  and  hangers-on,

expecting to be fed and nourished by the hard  work

of one-third of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free six-year primary education is already an

accomplished  fact  in  Singapore  today.  When  we

assumed  office  two  years ago,  4,000  Primary  I

pupils   registered  in  1958   by   the   previous

Government for 1959 were not given a place



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



in schools. We saw to it that they did enter school

in  1960,  and 56,000 were admitted for that  year.

This  year  nearly  52,000 were admitted,  and  the

present  policy is that every registered child  for

Primary I must be offered a place in school. Having

admitted 108,000 Primary I children within the last

two  years, we find that the total school enrolment

had  increased by 65,000: from 305,000 in  1959  to

370,000   this   year.  Therefore,  the   increased

enrolment of 65,000 makes it that 43,000 had  since

left schools in the last two years. They are either

continuing their higher studies in the Polytechnic,

Universities,   or   in   employment   or   seeking

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education for a set purpose has many aspects - that

of  nation  building, common content of syllabuses,

gradual  integration of different language  streams

into  a national system of education, Malay as  the

National  Language and the future chief  medium  of

instruction, etc. I shall, however, confine  myself

today to the importance and emphasis we have placed

in   making   education  the   basis   for   future

industrialisation of Singapore - the emphasis on  the

study   of  Mathematics,  Science  and  Technology.

Having  achieved the huge base of six  years'  free

primary  education,  what we must  achieve  in  the

foreseeable future is the building-up of  secondary

education,  and that is the crux of  our  Four-Year

Education Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 30,000 pupils from the four streams of

education  took  the first Primary  School  Leaving

Examination. This year we expect 40,000 to  do  so,

and  also  hereafter. And we have decided that  all

Primary  school leavers aged 11 and over should  be

given secondary education. We have assumed that

one-half  or  20,000  will not make the  grade  at  the

Primary  School Leaving Examination,  and  will  be

given  a  minimum of two years' secondary education

with  a  vocational bias. Of the remaining  50  per

cent  who  are expected to pass the primary  School

Leaving Examination, they will be given a four-year

secondary education depending on their aptitude and

ability as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25 per cent or 10,000 will be given academic

secondary  education as we  now  know  today  in

secondary schools leading to the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 per cent or 8,000 will be given technical

education  leading  to the Polytechnic  and  the

Universities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 per cent or 2,000 will be given commercial

education   leading  to  the  Polytechnic,   the

Universities and Commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this proposed large switch of nearly

75   per   cent  of  the  future  secondary  school

enrolment  towards expensive vocational, commercial

and  technical  education, the  Government  decided

early  this year to set up a Commission of  Inquiry

into  Vocational and Technical Education  which  is

now in session, so that the millions that have been

set  aside  for  this  type of  education  will  be

planned  and  co-ordinated, and not  proceed  on  a

haphazard  basis. We do not propose to  follow  the

ineptitude of the previous Government by having two

Technical  Secondary  Schools  at  Queenstown  and

Tanjong  Katong without any equipment for  teaching

technical subjects, or having equipment worth  tens

of  thousands rotting and rusting away in Balestier

Trade School for years, not knowing what to do with

them. The Commission of Inquiry into Vocational and

Technical  Education  is  expected  to  submit  its

Report  about the middle of this year, and we  hope

to  be  able  to  consider its recommendations  and

implement the Report by 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the

Four-Year   Development  programme  envisaged   in   the

Polytechnic is nearly $10 million and together with

the  anticipated building of no less than 9 out  of

19  new schools to be built each year for secondary

vocational, commercial and technical education,  we

shall  be spending more than $36 million, that  is,

more  than  one-third of the $95 million  bill  for

Education  will  be  for vocational  and  technical

education  alone. Only with such  emphasis  can  we

effectively   support   the   massive    industrial

programme  which  we have in mind  to  ensure  that

thousands  of  job opportunities are being  created

for Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen from the figures, with an increase

of  65,000 enrolment in schools within the last two

years,  we  need  to  employ  no  less  than  1,000

teachers  each year, if only to keep  up  with  the

yearly   increase  of  pupils  and   maintain   the

staff/pupil  ratio at 1:33 as at present.  In  this

respect,   earlier  on  the  Member   for   Tanglin

expressed  great disappointment at the shortage  of

Science teachers. The explanation is clear: this is

due  to the dereliction of duty on the part of  the

past  Government  for doing nothing  about  it  and

which  we  are trying to remedy today. As  for  the

Member   for  Kampong  Kembangan - earlier  on   this

afternoon  he  hinted  that  of  the  thousands  of

teachers  to  be  appointed for education,  it  was

likely  that a great majority would be for  English

schools,  and  he sought clarification  if  he  was

wrong. Of course, he is quite wrong. We do not  now

talk  in  terms of what type of teachers we employ.

It  all  depends  on the school  enrolment.  For  a

particular  number of school children, there  shall

be  so  many  teachers.  At present  the  Teachers'

Training  College  trains teachers  for  the  three

large  streams  of  education, which  are  English,

Chinese  and  Malay.  In view of  this  large-scale

annual  recruitment of teachers,  the  decision  to

stop  two  years full-time training of teachers  at

the  Teachers' Training College and to  have  only

one system of in-service training had to be made as

early  as  1960  within six months  after  we  took

office. Like everything in Singapore, we meet  with

the   constant  problem  of  having  to  deal  with

quantity  and  yet  striving hard  to  ensure  that

quality  and  standards do not  fall.  The  present

facilities  of  the Teachers' Training  College  at

Paterson  Road  were not meant to  tackle  the  new

situation  now being posed, hence the necessity  to

provide for adequate expansion, and accordingly the

sum  of  $2.9  million has been  allotted  for  its

proper development during the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining items under the Plan are incidental

to  what  has been said just now and follow general

expansion. Suffice it to say that every cent of the

$95  million to be spent on education envisaged  in

this Plan will repay rich dividends for future



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



prosperity  and happiness on this island  State  of

ours,  and  I am confident everyone in  this  House

including hon. Members of the Opposition  will  not

only  support the Education Plan but the motion  of

the Minister for Finance as well.



<br><br>6.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the P.A.P. has been

the  Government,  whenever our policies  have  been

offered  to  the House for debate, whether  in  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's annual policy speech or in

the   present   State   of  Singapore's   Four-Year

Development Plan, the same anti-P.A.P. slogans have

been  uttered  by  Members of the  Opposition  with

monotonous regularity. As an Opposition, they claim

to speak for the people of Singapore, but they have

not  attempted to analyse our Four-Year Development

Plan  to show how, if at all, our Development  Plan

has fallen short of the expectations of our people,

and  what  developments  have  been  omitted  which

should  have  found place in our Development  Plan.

That  would,  Sir, in my mind be  the  role  of  an

intelligent,  informed and responsible  Opposition.

Instead,  they have taken to repeating their

anti-P.A.P. slogans: that with the advent of the P.A.P.

Government,  there has not been a  healthy  climate

for  investment  because of  bad  employer-employee

relations;   that   these   relations   have   been

deteriorating;  that  the  T.U.C. is

Government-controlled; that membership of the Work Brigade  is

open  only to P.A.P. members; and that capital  has

flown away from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Work Brigade, the Member for Cairnhill

mentioned  earlier  this  afternoon  that  when   I

returned  from Tokyo, members of the  Work  Brigade

were  at  the Airport to greet me. Does he find  it

uncongenial and irksome that when he returned  from

his  mission to Vietnam not so long ago,  he  could

not   muster  up  a  sufficient  number  of   Party

supporters to greet him on his return? Mr Speaker,

Sir, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



also said that the members of the Work Brigade were

being exploited by the Government, and now that  we

have the development projects we might as well wind

up  the Brigade and transfer the members to work in

these  projects. Mr Speaker, Sir, long before  the

details of this plan were worked out, we have  been

transferring members of the Brigade for service  in

various  Government departments and for service  in

quasi  Government bodies which have need  of  their

service.   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  these   completely

unfounded and unfair accusations have been and  are

being  repeated by the Opposition so often  and  so

regularly  in  the  hope  that  some  of  them  may

ultimately   be  believed.  Do  these   anti-P.A.P.

slogans  which  are indulged in by  the  Opposition

accord  with  the facts as they are  known  to  the

people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Member for Tanglin and the Member for

Cairnhill have stated as a matter of fact that  the

business   community   of   Singapore   have   lost

confidence in the Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for  Tanglin has the habit - I  do  not  know

whether  it  is  a  good habit or  a  bad  habit - of

cutting out newspaper reports and quoting from them

whenever  he  wants to pretend that the  people  of

Singapore, and particularly the business community,

have   a  very  poor  view  of  the  work  of  this

Government.  Mr Speaker, if I may be permitted  to

indulge  a  similar habit this afternoon.  I  would

like to produce, for the delectation of the Members

of  the  Opposition, a report that appeared in  the

Free Press of Tuesday, 11th April. It was just  two

days ago. It is a report that gives a record of the

business done in the last year by the Great Eastern

Life  Assurance Company, in which both  the  Member

for  Tanglin,  the Member for Farrer Park  and  the

Member  for  Cairnhill have large investments.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this is a report of  business  done

which   the   Chairman  of  this   well-established

insurance company wishes to place before a  general

meeting  of  this Company to be held  tomorrow,  so

that it can be said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



this  is  a  really  up-to-date report  of  present

conditions. This is what the report says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,`Against the stable political background in

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya,  a  record

business  involving $44,175,595  was  done  by  the

Great Eastern Life Assurance Company Limited.'



<br><br>This  is  a  company, Mr Speaker, Sir, which  does

business  with  the  provident  sections   of   our

statement  to  be  tabled  at  the  Annual  General

Meeting on 14th April, to be held at the registered

office of the company in Cecil Street:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The chairman's report states: "Against a stable

political   background   in   Singapore   and   the

Federation of Malaya, where the policies of the  two

Governments have created public confidence,  record

new  business with sums assured of $44,175,595  was

written while assets and premium income showed  the

largest increments achieved in one year, increasing

to $51,518,020 and $8,738,383 respectively."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairman added that the peoples of Singapore

and  the  Federation  of  Malaya  were  fast  being

educated to appreciate the necessity and benefit of

life assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said it had now been found possible after

transferring $1,500,000 to investments  reserve  to

increase  the  bonus  rate  to  policy  holders  in

Singapore,   Federation  of  Malaya,   and   Borneo

territories from 25 to 26 per thousand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, the undistributed surplus

carried  forward has been substantially  increased,

which  augurs  well  for  the  maintaining  of  the

increased  rate  of bonus, which is  unequalled  by

both local and overseas competitors," he added.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, who is in a better  position  to

judge   public  confidence  with  regard  to   this

Government  from the business point of  view?  Hard

headed  business enterprises like the Great Eastern

Life    Assurance    Company,   or    mealy-mouthed

politicians on the Opposition Front bench?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sure the Minister must

understand that the expression "mealy-mouthed" used

of    parliamentarians   in   this   Assembly    is

unparliamentary. Therefore, I ask the  Minister  to

withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, you have judged that the

expression "mealy-mouthed" is unparliamentary.  May

I withdraw it and substitute the word "misguided"?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The withdrawal, of course, must be

unqualified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, it will then be an unqualified

withdrawal.  Mr  Speaker,  Sit,  my   friend   and

colleague,  the Minister for Finance, has  given  a

sober  appreciation of the facts  of  our  economic

life,   and  has  detailed  the  steps  which   the

Government has taken since it has been in power  to

so  order  our  economic life that we  can,  as  an

integrated community of employers and workers, have

good grounds for hoping that there will be a chance

of  survival for our growing young population which

will   be  coming  on  to  the  labour  market   in

increasing  numbers in the immediate  years  ahead,

and  which  the  proceeds of our  entrep�t  economy

alone  will  not  be  able to  sustain  in  gainful

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a lot of effort and a lot of

thought   have   been  put  into   this   Four-Year

Development Plan. From the Opposition, all that the

Plan has evoked are rather churlish repetitions  of

anti-P.A.P. slogans  which  are  now  worn  rather

threadbare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member of Cairnhill

yesterday,  overwhelmed by the massive contents  of

our Four-Year Development Plan, and having seen the

possibilities that will be open for the  people  of

Singapore  when  this Plan materialises,  cast  his

mind  back  to the time when he was Chief Minister,

and  tried to explain to this House that the S.P.A.

Government was not able to produce any co-ordinated

Development  Plan of its own because he,  as  Chief

Minister,  was rather encumbered with the  presence

of   an  expatriate  Financial  Secretary  in   his

planning set-up. Is not this a flimsy excuse?  Does

a  bad  carpenter not always blame his  tools?  And

does he not always try to take it out on his tools?

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  in  step  with  his

character and his inclinations. He blames  his  own

short-comings  on  those  into  whose  company   he

adeptly wormed his way and who served him well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

further stated today that the P.A.P. Government was

not profiting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



out  of the S.P.A. Government's industrial planning

and  industrial  legislation, and was  granting  to

foreign  capital  such  terms  that  local   firms,

competing  in  the manufacture of the  same  goods,

were  finding  it  difficult to  compete.  In  this

Assembly not so long ago, when similar observations

were  made by the Opposition, I pointed out,  as  a

senior civil servant of the former Government, that

I  had  been associated in the preparation of Press

statements  announcing major investments  by  sugar

refineries, flour mills, tobacco factories,  cement

works  and  other such like industrial undertakings

which,   in  fact,  never  progressed  beyond   the

discussion stage with their respective promoters. I

was then reminded by the Member for Cairnhill that,

as a senior civil servant of the S.P.A. Government,

I had acted improperly in spilling the beans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why did the S.P.A. Government's

plans not pass beyond the discussion stage? It  was

because  the  promoters knew that with  the  S.P.A.

Government  any  industrialisation  proposals  were

hedged  in  with  a  lot  of unusual  "safeguards".

Foreign  concerns willing to invest  locally  under

the  S.P.A. regime  were required  to  find  local

capitalists  as associates. It is well  known  that

our  local businessmen are mostly traders and  have

not  got  anything like the experience of  industry

that  the  local  businessmen of Hongkong  and  the

Chinese businessmen of Indonesia have. We have  not

imposed  any  such  conditions on foreign  concerns

willing  to  invest  locally, because  we,  as  the

Government,   are  aware  of  the   hard   economic

realities  of  our position, and  also  because  we

intend to keep our hands clean. We have not imposed

unusual  "safeguards" merely  for  the  purpose  of

ensuring that our nominees are placed in the  midst

of undertakings which are capitalised from overseas

and  operated  for  the purpose of  increasing  the

employment  opportunities  of  our  growing   young

population. Sir, in management/employee  relations,

all  that we have done is to ensure that the worker

gets  his due. It is true, Sir, as claimed  by  the

Member for Cairnhill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



that we have not enacted any new labour legislation

since we have been the Government, and that we  are

still  operating the labour legislation enacted  by

the  former  S.P.A. Government. The  difference  is

that  we,  as  the  Government, are  determined  to

ensure  that legislation introduced for the benefit

of  the  worker is not placed in the  statute  book

merely   for   the   purpose   of   assuring    the

International Labour Organisation in Geneva,  which

the Member for Cairnhill used to visit regularly as

Minister   for   Labour  and  Chief   Minister   of

Singapore,  that our workers were  getting  a  fair

deal.  If this labour legislation had been properly

enforced  by  the  former  Government,  we  as  the

Government  would  not have found  it  possible  to

collect for our workers a sum of $1,600,000 in  the

form  not  of increases in wages but in arrears  of

overtime,  weekly  holiday pay  and  annual  leave.

These facts speak for themselves, and I would  have

no  occasion to refer to them were it not  for  the

fact that the Member for Cairnhill had the temerity

to claim in this House yesterday that all that the

workers had received from the present Government is

an increase in unemployment and that their lot was

infinitely   better   under   the   former   S.P.A.

Government. He even made the ludicrous remark  that

the  worker  had  a  better deal under  the  former

Ministry  of  Labour and Welfare than  he  has  now

under the Ministry of Labour and Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Sir, as the Government, want stability in the

commercial and industrial sections of our  economy,

because  without it there cannot be  the  expansion

which  we  need if we are to survive. To this  end,

the  Government  has obtained the  support  of  the

T.U.C. and  the  unions  for  a  policy  of   wage

restraint, especially in the sectors of our economy

which  are  concerned  with export  markets,  where

there  is  a  potential  for  expansion,  and  with

essential servicing enterprises which are vital  to

our  economy.  In  other sectors  where  wages  and

conditions are below par or where the prosperity of

the  enterprise is such as to warrant improvements,

we expect there will be demands for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



improvement,  and  we hope that  the  employers  in

these  sectors  will be disposed  to  take  a  more

reasonable  view  of  such demands  when  they  are

received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been, Sir, a far greater number of

wage agreements registered with the Registry of the

Industrial  Arbitration Court,  since  registration

began  on  the  15th September of last  year,  than

there  have been awards of the Court; and all these

agreements   are   regularly   published   in   the

Government   Gazette.   The  Industrial   Relations

Ordinance  has tended to produce agreements  rather

than  to provoke conflicts, and if these agreements

are carefully studied by Members of the Opposition,

they  will  see  that  these  agreements  have  not

expressed any extortionate demands on the  part  of

the   workers.   All  of  these   agreements   give

expression  to  moderate  increases  in  wages  and

improvements in working conditions which have  been

willingly accorded by employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin referred to recent Press

statements  by  the  retiring  President   of   the

Singapore  Chamber of Commerce and  by  the  Public

Relations  Officer  of  the  T.U.C. in  which   an

unprovoked  and  rather  foolish  attack   by   the

retiring  President  of the  Singapore  Chamber  of

Commerce  on the unions provoked a rejoinder  which

was   emotionally   charged  and   in   which   the

unfortunate  expression, "To hell  with  industrial

peace  with justice", was unfortunately  used.  The

complaint,  Sir, of the retiring President  of  the

Singapore Chamber of Commerce was that negotiations

with  unions  took  a  long  time  and  were

time-consuming  for the employers. He claimed  that  the

situation  demanded the institution of a Commission

of  Inquiry  and that there should be  a  procedure

whereby  an  agreement reached by a  union  with  a

certain   employer  could  be  applied   to   other

employers   as  well  to  reduce  the   number   of

negotiations  which would otherwise  be  necessary.

This  is  exactly  what  the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance  does not allow. It is clearly stated  in

that  legislation  that the  negotiations  must  be

between  the union and the employer concerned,  and

not  between  the union and a group  of  employers.

There is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



good  reason for these arrangements. It is  obvious

that  if  agreements could be applied  in  the  way

suggested, then a smaller enterprise would  not  be

able  to  afford  the improvements which  a  larger

enterprise would be able to offer, and it would  be

likely  to  be  put  out  of  business,  with   the

consequence that the worker would lose his job.  As

negotiations must take a good deal of time,  it  is

important, therefore, that employers should  employ

personnel and industrial officers to take charge of

this  side of the work on their behalf. If they  do

so,  there  will  be no need for the  directors  of

concerns to attend these negotiations personally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, after I had left this Assembly,

and  even  this afternoon, the Member for Cairnhill

took two good swipes at me and said that whereas my

friend and colleague, the Minister for Finance, was

trying  to stabilise relations, I, as the  Minister

for  Labour,  had  threatened  employers  with  the

P.P.S.O.  It is true, Sir, that when a bad employer

acted most improperly, I threatened that if he  did

not  change his attitude, then there would have  to

be  recourse  to  the P.P.S.O. to  stop  him  from

provoking industrial discord for political reasons.

In  the case in question, I chaired the meeting  to

try  and  resolve a dispute in which that  employer

was  involved. He promised to attend, but  did  not

turn up, stating that it was more important for him

to  act  as  the Master of Ceremonies to a  wedding

than to be present for a settlement of this dispute

in which his company was directly concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the days before we had the Industrial

Relations  Ordinance. This House has already  given

to  me  the  power  under the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance  to  summon  a recalcitrant  employer  to

attend  a conciliation meeting, and if he shows  an

unwillingness  to attend, then all  that  I  or  my

Parliamentary  Secretary has to do is  to  sign  an

order that he does so. If he does not appear,  then

he is liable to prosecution before a District Court

for  contempt of the order. I have had occasion  to

sign  such  orders  since the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance was enacted, and I am glad that  it  will

never again be necessary for me to threaten any bad

employer with the P.P.S.O.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to the welfare side

of the community recreation development projects of

the  Ministry of Labour and Law. These are set  out

in  some detail on pages 117 and 118 and pages  126

and  127 of our Four-Year Development Plan. On  the

welfare  side the Plan proposes the spending  of  a

sum  of $1,771,700 on such projects as an extension

of  the  Mount Emily Girls' Home; the establishment

of  a Girls' Approved School for the reception  and

rehabilitation of delinquent girls between the ages

of  10  and 14; for a Girls' Hostel; for  a  Junior

Approved    School    for   the    reception    and

rehabilitation of delinquent boys between the  ages

of  10  and  14;  for improvements  to  the  Muslim

Welfare Home and the People's Association; and  for

the  establishment of a resettlement scheme for the

old.  As has been mentioned in the Plan, Sir,  none

of    these   projects   represent   any   dramatic

introduction  of  new  services,  but  are   rather

extensions and improvements of existing services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been rightly pointed out in the Plan

that  on  the welfare side what is most significant

are  the  vast  improvements  which  are  possible,

without  this  being reflected  in  the  amount  of

capital expenditure required. The selection of  the

projects in themselves does not constitute all  the

development possible in this field. In the  Budgets

of  1959  and  1960  a sum of $1  million  and  $1�

million respectively were voted by the Assembly for

the   development  and  integration  of   community

associations. Out of this money we have  been  able

to  complete 18 new community centres in 1960.  For

this   year,  we  have  planned  24  new  community

centres. Five have been completed and opened,  nine

are  now under construction, and 10 more sites have

been  selected, the planning for which is now in  a

very  advanced stage of preparation.  Between  1948

and  the  time  we took over, the Government  built

four  community centres and five were built by  the

Rural  Board.  Besides this, the  Rural  Board  and

voluntary  associations established seven  village

halls. In addition to this, associations of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



residents    established   another   11   community

associations,   mostly  housed  in  Housing   Board

estates.  By  the  end of the  year,  the  People's

Association   will  have  under  its   control   51

community  centres,  seven  village  halls  and  11

resident  associations,  a  record  of  which   the

People's  Association  can  justly  be  proud.   In

addition, the People's Association have also  taken

control   of  39  youth  clubs.  In  the   People's

Association,   voluntary  bodies   concerned   with

welfare   and   youth  sports  and   other   useful

vocational and recreational pursuits have been

co-operating  with  the Government in  a  big  way  to

organise  and  direct  on a scale  never  attempted

before the leisure activities of our growing  young

population.  In  addition  to  building   community

centres  in  association with the voluntary  bodies

which   I   have   just  mentioned,  the   People's

Association  has had to undertake a  comprehensive,

well  co-ordinated and well planned training scheme

to  produce the trained personnel who are  required

for  the  purpose  of running these  centres  in  a

proper  and efficient manner. Holiday resorts  have

also  been built by the People's Association. These

are  at  Pulau  Ubin and Nicoll Drive,  and  a  new

holiday resort is at present being built at Tanjong

Irau  in  the Sembawang area. Other holiday resorts

are  being  planned at Serimbun and  other  vantage

points  along  the  coast and in  the  neighbouring

islands. This in itself, Sir, is indeed a very  big

project  and would not have been possible  but  for

the   enthusiasm   and  drive   which   have   been

demonstrated   by   these   voluntary   bodies   in

association  with  the officials  employed  on  the

community recreation side of the Ministry. We  hope

to  have  all community centres and holiday resorts

we need completed by the middle of next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor have we, Sir, neglected the provision of

creches  for working mothers in places  where  such

facilities   are  urgently  required.  The   S.P.A.

Government found it necessary to provide  only  one

creche for working mothers at Victoria Street.  The

P.A.P.  Government, in control of the City Council,

built four creches in Jalan Besar, Chinatown, Tiong

Bahru and Telok Ayer. Since taking over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  for all the creches,  the  Ministry

has  opened  a new creche at New Market  Road,  and

tenders for a seventh creche in the Kallang Airport

Estate  will be called shortly. In addition,  plans

are being made for the eighth creche in the Erskine

Road  area, where the Housing Board is to put up  a

low-rental  housing  estate for  the  poor  in  the

Chinatown area. In the existing creches  there  is

at present no pressure for increased accommodation,

except  for the creche in Banda Street.  Plans  for

the enlargement of this creche are now under active

consideration. In the rural areas there has not  so

far  been any pressing demand for the establishment

of creches, as working mothers there live in

attap-houses  where they are able to leave their children

in  the  charge of older folk when they go  out  to

work. The position is being carefully studied,  and

where  the need for creches in the rural  areas  is

shown, it will promptly be met by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Estimates a sum of $2,661,000

has  been provided for the development of community

services  in  the  city  areas  in  the   form   of

children's  playgrounds,  parks  and  open  spaces,

swimming  pools  and other such-like  amenities.  A

furthtr sum of $1,290,000 has been provided for the

establishment  of similar amenities  in  the  rural

areas. The projects have been detailed in the Plan.

These include the construction of swimming pools in

the  Queenstown,  Kallang and  Bukit  Batok  areas,

improvements to the Farrer Park Athletic Centre and

the  Jalan Besar Stadium, and the establishment  of

multi-purpose playgrounds in various areas  of  the

city  and  rural area. For the purpose of  detailed

planning  of  these  amenities, an  Amateur  Sports

Advisory Council has been formed in which  all  the

controlling   bodies   of  the   various   sporting

associations  in  Singapore have  been  associated.

This Amateur Sports Advisory Council will also have

Government officials of the Ministry of Labour  and

other  Ministries connected with public  recreation

on  it, and will meet under the chairmanship of the

Minister. The Chief Parks Officer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



will  be  in  attendance at  all  meetings  of  the

Council.  It  is  intended to bring  all  amenities

connected with public recreation which are  now  in

existence and which are planned for the future, and

which  hitherto were under the divided  control  of

the  City  Council and the Rural Board,  under  the

direct  control of the Ministry of Labour  assisted

by  the  advice  of this Council. By  these  means,

better  and  fuller  use  can  be  made  of   these

amenities and the work of this Council will be

co-ordinated as far as possible with the work  of  the

People's  Association. This Council  will  also  be

able  to  popularise sports which do not at present

enjoy  the same degree of popularity as those which

are more well established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Party policy statement, Sir, which the

Member  for  Tanglin referred  to  earlier  in  the

debate, we have stated that we are pledged to build

a  Trade Union House for our workers. The money for

this   project  has  not  been  included   in   the

Development  Plan.  We shall be entering  provision

for  this  project  in the next  year's  budget.  A

Planning  Committee  under  my  chairmanship,  with

T.U.C. representatives and with which the Board  of

Architects   has   been   associated,   has    been

constituted by Government and a competition open to

all  registered  architects in  Singapore  and  the

Federation will be announced in the near future  in

which  prizes will be offered for the  best  design

for our Trade Union House. This competition will be

in keeping with the regulations prescribed for such

competitions under the Architects Ordinance. It  is

proposed that this building will not only serve  as

a  meeting  place for the T.U.C. and its associated

unions, but will also be so built as to provide all

the   facilities   and   amenities   required   for

international    conferences.   The   multi-purpose

section  of  the building will be under the  direct

control of the Government and will be available for

use  by  both  the  T.U.C. and  for  international

conferences which are to be held in Singapore. As a

self-governing State and situated as we are at  the

very focal point in South-East Asia, it is fitting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Government should be in  a  position  to

offer  amenities  and facilities  to  international

organisations which wish to hold their meetings  in

our State.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I  get  to  the more serious  part  of  the

business,  will  you permit me to answer  just  one

point  raised by the Hon. the Minister  for  Labour

and  Law?  He was trying to prove a point  when  he

cited  the case of the Great Eastern Life Assurance

Co.  Ltd., but with respect to him, I do not  think

it  proves anything at all. He cited the fact  that

the  Great Eastern Life Assurance Co. Ltd, had  put

up a report that their previous year of trading was

an  exceptionally good one and, because of that, he

tried  to  make the point that Singapore was  doing

extremely  well.  But what the  Minister  does  not

appreciate is that this Company carries on business

not  only  in Singapore but also in the  Federation

and  in  the  territories surrounding this  island.

Therefore,  it could well be that any great  profit

derived   by  this  Company  does  not  come   from

Singapore  but from the Federation of Malaya  which

we now know has done extremely well during the last

two  years.  So I think the statement made  by  the

Minister   along   those  lines   without   exactly

specifying  the  sources of the  profits  for  that

particular year does not help his case one bit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come back to the Development Plan. The

Minister for Labour and Law has said that  none  of

the  Members of the Opposition has made any attempt

to analyse the Development Plan as presented by the Government. Sir, this book reached Members  of  the

Opposition sometime towards the end of last  month,

and  today is the 13th. Exactly 13 days after  this

book was presented to Members of the Opposition,  a

very  important  debate concerning  the  future  of

Singapore is being held. Does the Government really

seriously expect a detailed and thorough  study  to

enable the Opposition to offer some comments on the

Plan  which would help the Government to steer  the

course properly? The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



position might have been different if at, the  same

time when this book was submitted an indication had

been  given to Members of the Opposition that

this - Development Plan would be the subject matter  of  a

debate  in  the  Assembly. When this  book  reached

Members; of the Assembly, we knew, of course,  that

there  was going to be an Assembly sitting  on  the

12th of this month. Now instead of coming clean - if

I  may  use  the  expression of  this  very  clean,

Government - and telling the Opposition that it  was

the intention of Government to debate this Plan  at

this  sitting, they kept it a State secret and gave

Members  of the Opposition just the bare  statutory

notice  which  is two days or is it  one  day,  Mr

Speaker?  Is  it fair to Members of the Opposition?

Or  may I ask the Minister for Finance - is it  fair

to  the country at large that an important document

such as this should be debated at such short notice

and after Members of the Opposition and members  of

the  public have only had an opportunity of looking

at  it  for  .10  or 12 days? If  no  constructive

criticism  is forth-coming. I suggest to  you,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that the Government must  take  the

blame  for  it.  However,  with  the  time  at  our

disposal,  let us try and see what we can  make  of

this Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am going to suggest to the

Minister  for  Finance that this plan  is  not  the

magnum  opus that it has been cracked up to  be.  I

have  been associated with the City Council  for  a

number  of  years. I know a little about these

so-called  Development Plans. When I was in  the  City

Council, Sir, the City Council also wanted to  know

where  the Council was going for the period of  the

succeeding five years, because it wanted to have an

insight into the future in order that it might make

necessary   financial  provision.  Therefore,   the

Council  instructed  each  head  of  department  to

submit to it a list of the projects he had in mind.

The  result of that request was that every head  of

department put up everything he thought  he  should

do  during  the next five years without considering

whether  everything  that he  put  up  was  vitally

necessary for the period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



of  the five years in respect of which he was asked

to  put  up  the Plan. In other words,  what  I  am

saying to you. Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. In  those

circumstances, what usually happens  is  that  each

head  of  department prepares his  annual  budgets

five  years ahead, and these five-year budgets  are

prepared  by  each head of department  on  his  own

without  consulting the other heads of  departments

and  without  in  any way trying to  integrate  the

expenditure  of  all the departments  in  the  City

Council and finding out exactly what the net result

of  all  the  projects would be if the money  could

have been found. Having stated that, I am going  to

suggest  to  the Minister for Finance that  exactly

what  happened in the City Council has happened  in

this case. The Minister had written to his heads of

departments saying "Please tell me what you can  do

over the next five years. Not only what you want to

do  but  what you can do over the next five years."

And  I  am  telling him that the result is  that  a

number  of  requests went out  from  the  heads  of

departments and they were probably analysed by some

committee,  maybe by the Minister's own department.

And it was vetted on the basis of what the Minister

for  Finance thought he could raise in the  way  of

money. So that this Plan, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  not

a   Plan  in  the  sense  that  one  thinks  of   a

Development Plan drawn up by a young country  which

is  seeking to set itself a Plan in order that  the

national income of the country might be raised from

year  to year, and that the standard of the  living

of the people could be increased from year to year.

This  is just a slap-dash, haphazard Plan suggested

to  the Minister by heads of departments, which  he

vetted  on the basis of what he thought  he  could

raise  in the way of money. I am suggesting to  him

that that is the basis on which this Plan was born.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with some of the aspects of this

Plan, Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will turn to page 35

of  the  blue  book. This sets out the  Development

Plan  Capital Expenditure Estimates for the  period

concerned, 1961-1964,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



and  on  page  38  there  is  an  analysis  of  the

Development Plan Estimates classified according  to

repayment  potentialities - therefore,  setting  out

the    financial   aspects   and   the    financial

implications of such a Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a Development Plan must be

conceived  and given birth to against a  background

of the needs of the country in respect of which the

Plan  is being propounded. We have heard of several

Development  Plans  for India.  We  have  heard  of

several Development Plans for Russia. We have heard

of  several  Development  Plans  for  China.  Their

problems   are   not  the  same  as   ours.   Their

possibilities and their potentialities are not  the

same   as   ours.  Therefore,  their   Plans   must

necessarily be different from ours. The problems in

Singapore are quite different from the problems  in

India,  China  and Russia. We started  as  a  small

island,  and we continue as a small island  without

any  annexation to the mainland at the moment. This

place  grew  up as a trading centre for  the  areas

surrounding Singapore and Malaya. Up to the end  of

the  Second World War, we were completely a trading

centre.  Subsequent to the Second  World  War,  the

political   situation  around  us  was   different.

Territories around us got independence.  Therefore,

the  reasons which enabled Singapore to prosper  in

the  way that she did previous to the Second  World

War  were slowly being whittled away. Indonesia got

her  independence. Malaya became  independent.  And

the other territories like Burma and Siam began  to

assert  themselves. They were no longer willing  to

let  Singapore be the base from which their primary

produce was to be exported elsewhere, nor were they

prepared to let Singapore be the base through which

the  manufactured goods were to reach them from the

producing  countries. Therefore the happy  position

in  which Singapore was to get the primary  produce

and  export  it to other countries, and after  that

bring  back  the manufactured goods and  then  send

back to the original countries no longer existed in

the same way as it had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



before  the war. The inevitable conclusion is  that

Singapore  cannot survive by entrepot trade  alone.

Therefore,  we have to supplement our  living  with

some  other  means. Naturally we  have  no  primary

products  here. Therefore, the only  thing  we  can

turn our attention to is to manufacture. We want to

industrialise  ourselves. The Plan recognises  that

and says that the only thing we can do in order  to

provide  employment possibilities for  the  growing

generation,  and for the young boys and  girls  who

are   coming  out  from  schools,  is  to  try  and

industrialise as fast as possible. I think  we  all

accept  the position that Singapore must supplement

her   entrepot  trade  with  development   on   the

industrial   sector.   Against   that   background,

therefore, the Plan must be conceived in order that

the  entrepot position will be maintained,  if  not

strengthened further, and added to that, we  should

try  and strengthen our industrial sector in a  way

which  will  not  interfere with  or  diminish  our

entrepot  strength.  Against  that  background,  it

became the business of the Minister for Finance  to

formulate  the Development Plan which would  during

the  next  four years maintain, if not  strengthen,

the entrepot position and yet bring about some sort

of industrialisation which would provide employment

opportunities for the girls and boys who are now in

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on page 52 of the blue book,

paragraph 6.7 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Plan envisages investment in the public

sector within the Plan period of $871 million.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Plan - the break-up of which is set out

on  pages  35  and 38 - really concerns itself  with

investment by the Government in the public  sector,

and  that  investment is going to cost the  country

$871  million. The investment in the public  sector

will  be a complete and utter waste of money unless

the  private  sector  comes and  puts  to  use  the

investment by the Government in the public  sector.

I make that point, Mr Speaker, Sir, because if the

Government  invests the $871 million in the  public

sector hoping that such investment will attract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



private investment in the private sector, if I may

put  it that way, and if that does not happen, then

this Plan will be ineffective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us therefore analyse the Table on page 38. Mr Speaker, the first item is:

Land Purchases for  General  Development and Resettlement,  $11.31

million. That is an item which in no way helps  the

industrialisation of the country. It is  merely  an

item which supplements item No. 4 under "II. Social

Development" - Housing, $153.60 million.  The  $11.31

million merely supplements that and is not  in  any

way  going  to contribute towards industrialisation

of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we get to the next item: Swamp Reclamation

Schemes,  $4  million. Well, nobody  is  going  to

suggest  that the catching of prawns  is  going  to

help the industrialisation of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we get to the Rural Development Schemes,

$26.10  million. Mr Speaker, Sir, you will  get  a

complete  analysis of' that on page  66.  Now,  the

break-up there is:



<pre>

                                       Million

	   the Minister for

           National Development

	   has just told us that

	   that  merely  means

           helping the fishermen

	   and  the farmers)

                                        -----

                                        26.09

                                        -----

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody is going to suggest that this: $26.09

million is going to help the industrialisation of

this country over the next four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to Animal Husbandry and Agricultural

Station, Sembawang, $0.05 million. I think it is

self-evident, that, on the face of it, that is not

going to help industrialisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item, Mr Speaker, Sir, is Economic

Development  Board,  a  $100 million  contribution;

Kallang  Project, $40 million; Jurong Project,  $45

million. Quite definitely, these three items relate

themselves to industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the next item is Land Acquisition for

Industrialisation and other development  costs  for

industrialisation, $5.6 million. Quite clearly,  it

is   connected  with  the  three  preceding  items.

Electricity is $78.5 million; Water $54.23 million;

Gas  $14.03 million. These are not entirely matters

which  relate  themselves to industry,  because  we

must   have  electricity  in  respect  of   housing

projects;  we  must  have  water  for  our  housing

projects;  and possibly gas also is  a  split  item

between industry and housing. So those three  items

partially   relate  themselves  to   industry   and

partially to what is known as social development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item is the heading "3. Transport and

Communications":  East  Wharf  Development,   $12.7

million - I take it that that item relates itself  to

port facilities and more properly should come under

the   heading   of  Entrepot  trade,  or   Entrepot

Facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement of Singapore River $15.7 million - I

hardly think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that that is  going

to help industrialisation. It might make our City a

more  efficient  entrepot trading  centre,  but  it

certainly   is   not   going   to   help   in   the

industrialisation of this island in any way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marine, Meteorological Services, Civil Aviation,

Telecommunications,   Roads,   Drainage,   Bridges,

Posts,  Telephone  Board - none of these  items,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  can in any remote way  be  said  to

concern itself with industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, "Social Development". Health $35.8 million;

Education  $94.48 million - these  are  all  matters

which  do  not concern themselves immediately  with

industrialisation  in  the  next  four  years   and

similarly items under "Public Administration",  Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the four items which really concern

themselves with industrialising this island of ours

is the $100 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



grant  to  the  Economic  Development  Board,   the

Kallang Project $40 million, the Jurong Project $45

million,  and  the  items  concerning  Electricity,

Water  and  Gas.  Let us therefore,  examine  these

several projects in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with the Kallang Project first, Mr

Speaker, Sir. Mention of it is made on page 69:



<br><br><div align="center">`Kallang Swamp Project</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kallang Swamp is a group of contiguous

patches of tidal swamp spread out at the confluence

of the Kallang and Whampoa Rivers behind the narrow

estuary  of the Kallang River. Fringed by temporary

residential settlements,...'



<br><br>and it goes  on  to describe the area, Mr Speaker, Sir. Then at the end of paragraph 7.39:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In 1954, the Master Plan team realised its

potentialities  as  Kallang is the  biggest  single

stretch  of  unused  land that  could  be  properly

developed.'



<br><br>Paragraph  7.42 is very interesting,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The best fill material is available from

quarries  in Jalan Eunos and near the International

Airport. In fact, quarrying operations will produce

a  good  area  for  housing  development  and  make

suitable  an  old  quarry area as a  village  site.

Ample  material exists. An access road  from  these

sources will have to be constructed to link up with

the  fill area; heavy earth-moving machinery  which

constructed the airport are available and they  can

operate  economically at a rate  of  about  200,000

cubic yards a month. [This is the point]. These and

other  machinery  can undertake the  huge  fill  in

about 4 to 5 years.'



<br><br>So  you get this wonderful Kallang Project on which

we are going to industrialise, but on which nothing

can be done, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the next four to

five  years because it has to be filled first.  And

this  is  a tidal swamp; I do not know whether  the

Ministry  has  bothered to find  out  whether  this

area,  after  filling, is going to be suitable  for

industrial development, because when you have heavy

machinery   installed,  you  have  to   have   good

foundations. And you cannot have foundations  in  a

place  which is a tidal swamp filled up. I remember

this,  and I think the whole of Singapore remembers

this,  that the first thing which the Minister  for

Culture did was to announce that he would have  his

National Theatre at Kallang. If he had only stopped

to ask those who knew something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



about  that  place  at the old Kallang  Airport,  I

think  he would have been advised that such a place

was  not suitable, because such a project had  been

previously considered and had been rejected by  the

City  Council. But because the Minister was in such

a  hurry, he took our Yang di-Pertuan Negara  there

and   made   him   lay   a   foundation-stone.   He

subsequently found that the area was unsuitable. So

the  Government has now gone to the King  George  V

Park.  I  hope  the Minister for Finance  will  not

embark on any such foolish business on this Kallang

swamp  without getting any further advice from  his

experts  as  to  whether the land is  suitable  for

industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we come to the Jurong

Project,  $45 million, and something is said  about

it on page 71:



<br><br><div align="center">`Jurong Industrial Area</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a site of about 1,000 acres for the

Plant'.



<br><br>The  Plant here talked of, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

iron  and  Steel Plant which is very  famous  these

days  in  Singapore and about which  we  are  being

advised  by  United Nations experts who  themselves

are unable to make up their minds whether Singapore

can take this Iron and Steel Plant. But the greater

question is this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide a site of about 1,000 acres for the

Plant  [that is, this steel plant], it is necessary

to provide a large industrial estate of about 9,000

acres  in  the  initial stage on the south-west  of

Singapore Island in Jurong.'



<br><br>What  I  gather from that statement,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,   is  this:  that  the  focal  point  of  this

industrial development is going to be this Iron and

Steel Plant. Now, that being the focal point,  that

having been established as an iron and steel plant,

around  it  and surrounding it on the  other  9,000

acres, subsidiary industries will spring up, and so

utilise   to   the  fullest  extent   the   capital

investments that have been put in on this Iron  and

Steel Plant. Now, the money provided for the Jurong

Project  is,  I  take it, the money  that  will  be

required for the development of the site which will

enable  the  Iron and Steel Plant to be erected  on

it. This $45 million, I take it, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



not  the total cost of the Iron and Steel Plant.  I

take  it that the cost of the Iron and Steel  Plant

will  run  into hundreds of millions. So that,  Mr

Speaker,  we  get to the position where  these  two

star  projects which the Minister for  Finance  has

propounded  in  his Development Plan -  Kallang  and

Jurong - on close analysis are somewhat of  a  fiasco

in  relation  to  the  Four-Year  industrialisation

plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to Electricity, Water and Gas. Now,

Mr  Speaker,  if  I may speak about  Water  first,

because  water  is  life, so the City  Council  has

said.  The  water supply in Singapore is  in  great

danger. I am satisfied in my own mind that there is

a  shortage  of water in Singapore,  and  that  the

Government has not paid due attention to the  water

supply  in Singapore. It is by sheer good  fortune,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that during the course  of  last

year, we have not had the supply of water rationed,

because the reservoirs have been empty enough.  Had

it  not been for the timely rain, I think Singapore

would  have  been  faced with a shortage  of  water

supply.  I  congratulate the P.A.P.  Government  in

having called the elements to their support and got

themselves out of a very, very tight situation! But

you  know, Mr Speaker, the elements might  not  be

that  favourable  next year - this year  rather - and

then they will really be in a jam. And if we do not

have  enough water for domestic consumption, I  ask

the Minister for Finance how he is going to give it

to industry. Let him try - there will be a riot.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

What?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> There will be a riot if you cut off

the  water supply from domestic consumers and  give

it to industry - that is what I am saying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the Electricity question, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like the Minister for Finance to tell

this House what proposals he has for increasing the

amount of electricity which is being generated in

Singapore  today  and which is going  to  cost  him

$78.50  million. Or is it merely this: that he  has

asked the Electrical Engineer to submit what he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



thought  he  could do for the next five years,  and

that  officer has sent in these proposals,  "Oh,  I

could  do  with $78 million. Can you  give  me  $78

million?"? Or did he ask for $200,000 or  $20,000 - I

do not know. There is nothing stated as to what the

plans  of  the  Government are - whether  they  have

formulated  plans, whether they have  gone  out  to

contract - nothing like that is shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of Gas: whether it is

necessary  to have gas for industry is a  debatable

point.  But if the Government is advised  that  for

that particular industry gas is necessary, well,  I

am quite prepared to accept that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the question of the $100 million grant to

the  Economic Development Board, there  again,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, we do not know how this money  is  to

be  utilised.  Apparently it could be  utilised  to

help  existing  industries; on the other  hand,  it

might be used to help industries that are likely to

come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the whole, Mr Speaker, Sir, this brave

Plan which is going to create a brave new world, on

close analysis, does not seem to amount to much. If

we had been given longer time to study it, I wonder

if it might not amount to nothing at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the projects on that page merely

concern   themselves   with   normal   year-to-year

development which must inevitably take place.  This

Plan  is  cracked up to be a Plan which is intended

to  provide  for  the  future development  of  this

country.  By  that, I take it, the future  economic

development  of this country. From  that  point  of

view,  to  my  mind, it is a complete  failure.  It

cannot  achieve  the purpose for  which  Government

sets itself to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is another aspect of this upon which I

would  like to touch. The financial aspects of  the

Plan are set out on page 38. Under column 1 on page

38,  under "Self-funding" are set out items against

Electricity,  Water, Gas, East  Wharf  Development,

Telephone Board. It is very proper, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir, that any money borrowed should  have

sinking funds and interest payments accounted  for.

They  should  fund themselves and eventually  these

monies  will be recovered and Government will  have

it  all over again after a space of years. Then  we

come  to this very interesting proposition  by  the

Government: the money they are going to give to the

Housing Board is also a self-funding project. As  I

understand  it,  it  merely means  this.  That  the

Government  is going to lend money to  the  Housing

Board at a rate of interest. I take it that it will

be  an  economic  rate of interest.  If  it  is  an

economic rate of interest, it must be about  5  per

cent.  And  if that is the intention of Government,

that  the money which they will lend to the Housing

Board  is to be self-funding, then I challenge  the

Minister for National Development to let out  these

fiats at $20 per month without heavy subsidies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now under column 2 "Revenue Earning (but not

funding)". Apparently the Kallang project is  going

to earn revenue, Mr Speaker, Sir. But I cannot see

it  earning  any revenue over the next five  years.

Certainly not, because you are not going to fill it

in five years. It may be after the next five years,

but during the next five years, it is not going  to

earn  any  revenue at all. The suggestion  here  is

that  it  is going to earn revenue during the  plan

period.  If  it is not so, it has not been  stated.

Similarly  with  the Jurong project,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir.  The improvement of the Singapore River scheme

is  going to be a revenue - earning project. But I do

not   see,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  what  revenue  the

Government  hopes to collect, which  they  are  not

collecting at the moment on that river.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunications - yes. Posts - yes. Sewerage. Mr

Speaker, is going to produce revenue. I wonder  how

much  revenue. Culture - yes, I suppose.  Television,

commercial  radio and customs - yes. Then  the

"Non-revenue  earning  but  National  income-increasing"

projects  are  set  out  under  "Rural  Development

Schemes". It is an interesting proposition that  is

made there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



If you will examine that item again at page 66. The

total amount of that item there is $26,092 million.

Of  that,  $3.47  million is put down  as

revenue-earning  but  not funding; non-revenue earning  but

National  Income increasing is $21.33 million,  and

Charge on Revenue is $1.30 million. It adds  up  to

$26.10 million all right. But I really do not  know

which  are the items that go up to make those three

separate heads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I find it very difficult to

understand  how roads and improvement  to  bridges,

community  amenities, and drainage could  bring  in

revenue.  Possibly markets might bring in  revenue.

Electricity and water might bring in revenue. Other

rural development might bring in revenue. The Bedok

water  supply might bring in revenue. But I  cannot

see  roads  and  improvement to bridges,  community

amenities  and drainage bringing in any money,  nor

helping  the  Government to increase  the  national

income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the things which the Government

sets out on these pages, and I am suggesting to the

Minister   for   Finance  that   not   as   careful

consideration  has  been given to  these  items  as

should  have been, because this Plan has  been  put

together hurriedly and brought out hurriedly. We do

not  know  who the authors of the Plan are.  It  is

suggested  in the Press - and the Press may  well  be

wrong,  as  they usually are - that the Minister  for

Finance is one of them and Mr Puthucheary  is  the

other.  Whether that is correct or not  we  do  not

know.  The  Minister  might tell  us  who  are  the

authors of this Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is the position. Mr Speaker, Sir, as it

strikes  me.  Whether a closer study of  this  will

reveal  that I am wrong, or whether a closer  study

of it will reveal that I am right, and I might find

even  more defects in the Plan, I do not know.  But

the position, as I see it, after such a study as  I

have been able to give to this Plan is that even if

the  Government succeeds in the plans that it  sets

out  to  achieve, it is not going  in  any  way  to

increase  the  national income over the  next  four

years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>



<br><br>7.21 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the proceedings set down on the Order Paper

this  day  be  exempted  from  the  provisions   of

Standing   Order   No.   1"  - [The   Minister   for

Culture - Mr S. Rajaratnam].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT PLAN 1961-1964</b></div>



<br><br>7.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to

the  speeches  today and yesterday of  the  Members

opposite,  and,  in particular, of the  Member  for

Tanglin  and the Member for Cairnhill on the

Four-Year   Development  Plan,  one  got  the   distinct

impression that they were in a quandary. The

Four-Year  Development Plan has had them  stumped.  They

could  not refute the cold logic and practicability

of  the Plan because, in order to do so, they would

have  to produce facts and arguments to expose  its

inadequacies and shortcomings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they took the easy way out and at least the

Member for Cairnhill said that the Plan was a  good

one,  though his colleague, the Member  for  Farrer

Park,   is  of  the  opinion  that  the  Plan   has

practically  collapsed.  Perhaps  the  Member   for

Cairnhill,  when he said that the Plan was  a  good

one,  felt that perhaps he was conceding  too  much

and  so  he  qualified his approval by saying  that

though  the  Plan  was good, the P.A.P.  Government

which  put the Plan into shape was not as good  as

the Plan it fathered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin, in particular, excelled

himself in the art of running in all directions  at

the  same  time.  The  Plan was  all  right  simply

because it showed, according to his argument,  that

the P.A.P. Government in the 22 or 23 months it has

been  in power had rectified its errors. The  Plan,

so  hinted  by  the  Member for Tanglin,  was  good

simply  because it was a repudiation of the  P.A.P.

election programme as contained in The Tasks Ahead.

So I waited hopefully for the Member for Tanglin to

substantiate this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



startling   analysis  by  comparing  the  programme

outlined  in  The  Tasks Ahead with  the  Four-Year

Development Plan to show how and where both differ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, the Member's claim was startling

simply  because the Four-Year Plan is in  intention

and  in fact an elaboration, in economic terms,  of

the  broad principles outlined in The Tasks  Ahead.

This  being so, we on the Government side  expected

the Member for Tanglin to show in what way the

Four-Year Plan was a repudiation of the basic principles

and intentions stated in The Tasks Ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not always easy to follow the verbal

meanderings of the Member for Tanglin even at  the

best  of  moments - and yesterday certainly was  not

one  of  his  best moments. One got the  impression

that  he  was  trying very hard, like  the  pursued

octopus,   to  conceal  his  thoughts   behind   an

unusually inky cloud of confusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if I have missed out some telling piece of

confused  logic on his part, I hope the Member  for

Tanglin will realise that at least I did my best to

follow what he was trying to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember correctly, he remarked with a

triumphant  glint  in  his  eye  that  during   the

elections  the P.A.P. had promised to establish  an

Utopia,  but  now,  wiser with experience,  it  was

offering something less than an Utopia in the

Four-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would not like to suggest to the Member for

Tanglin that he is deliberately inventing something

which  is not true. I can only attribute it to  too

much  reliance on his somewhat playful memory which

deliberately  misleads  him into  believing  things

which  are not factually correct. People  who  have

reached retirement age should be a little bit  wary

of trusting their memory too much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegations that the P.A.P. Government has

departed  from  its  election  programme  has  been

repeated  so  often  not only  by  the  Member  for

Tanglin, but also by his S.P.A. colleagues  and  by

the former Member for Hong Lim,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



that  perhaps it would not be a waste  of  time  to

expose    the    falsity    of    his    calculated

misinformation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who make such allegations are perhaps

banking  on the fact that the public by  and  large

would  not  bother  to look up  our  political  and

economic  intentions  as proclaimed  in  The  Tasks

Ahead and find out for themselves whether, in fact,

there has been a radical departure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, yesterday the Member for Tanglin

expressed  satisfaction  that  the  P.A.P.,  having

promised  to set up an Utopia before the elections,

has now settled for something less glamorous in its

Four-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Member for Tanglin therefore quote

chapter  and  verse to justify his allegation  that

the  P.A.P. promised to set up an Utopia?  On  the

contrary, if he has read The Tasks Ahead carefully,

he would have discovered how careful we were not to

rouse false expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I refer to Part I of The Tasks

Ahead, page 6, paragraph 3, which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The plans we have laid down are not

over-ambitious ones. They are realistic and are based on

actual   existing  political  and  economic  social

conditions and circumstances. In drafting our plans

we  recognise  that  an  internally  self-governing

Singapore  is not an independent Singapore  because

control of our foreign affairs remains in the hands

of  the colonial office and so in this sense we are

a  semi-colony; we recognise the severe restriction

of  land  space, a mere 210 square miles, and  the

pressure  of a population now numbering 1�  million

and still growing at the rate of 65,000 a year.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again on page 7, we attempted to pitch our

objectives very low. We say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is obvious that existing conditions are not

favourable  to  the  immediate  attainment   of   a

socialist   society,  and  that  a  fully-developed

socialist  economy cannot be achieved  as  long  as

Singapore   is   separated  from   the   Federation

mainland.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly on pages 20 and 21 we outlined some of

the   difficulties  in  the  way  of  our  economic

development. All this judged by what we  stated  in

The  Tasks  Ahead is a clear indication that  there

was  no  promise of Utopia and there  has  been  no

retreat from Utopia simply because the P.A.P. never

promised an Utopia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument produced by the Opposition to

show  that the P.A.P. had retreated from the spirit

and  purpose of the The Tasks Ahead was  the  claim

that  there was now a changed attitude on the  part

of the P.A.P. towards private enterprise. There was

also  an  immodest hint that the Member for Tanglin

and   the  S.P.A. were  somehow  responsible   for

persuading  the  P.A.P to change  its  views  about

private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This again, I am afraid, is another bit of

self-induced  fantasy  on the part  of  the  Member  for

Tanglin.  The P.A.P. attitude is exactly as  stated

in  The Tasks Ahead and the Four-Year Plan reflects

the  same  attitude towards private  enterprise  as

contained in The Tasks Ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer the Members of the Opposition to Part I

of  The Tasks Ahead on page 8, paragraph 6. This is

what it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The planned industrial enterprises will be run

either by the Board [i.e., the Economic Development

Board]  or  in  co-operation with private  capital.

Purely   private  capital  enterprises  will   also

receive the co-operation of the Board. Although  we

disagree that the survival of Singapore depends  on

foreign    capital    and   foreign    capitalists,

nevertheless foreign capital business concerns that

wish  to  establish factories in Singapore will  be

given encouragement and assistance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the role allotted to private enterprise in

the  Four-Year Plan is neither more nor  less  than

what  was  stated in The Tasks Ahead. The Four-Year

Plan is essentially a description of the activities

the  State  will  take in order to foster  economic

development  arid  stimulate  activity  by  private

enterprise.  And the State's functions in  economic

development, if Members of the Opposition will read

the Plan carefully, are as great as, if not greater

than,  those  likely  to be undertaken  by  private

enterprise.



<br><br>7.36 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin appears to be suffering

from  the  delusion that the Four-Year  Plan  is  a

private enterprise Plan. It is not. It is a Plan of

what the Government is going to spend in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



public  sector, one of whose effects  would  be  to

stimulate investment by private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum that is to be invested in the public

sector is very substantial some $871 million during

the  next  four years. It may or may  not  be  that

investment  by private enterprise will  equal  this

figure.  For  example, private  investment  in  new

industries has to be in the region of $600  million

to provide 30,000 jobs. This will be a considerable

sum  for  private  enterprise  to  invest,  but  as

against this the State will invest $871 million and

will  increase employment opportunities by  40,000,

i.e.  20,000 in public construction and  Government

service  and another 20,000 arising as a result  of

this vast expenditure by the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to stress is that the Government is

not relying only on private enterprise to stimulate

economic development. The contrary is the case. The

Government is giving private enterprise a  lead  by

imaginative,  realistic and  coherent  and  planned

utilisation  of  resources.  Without  this  massive

intervention  of  the State in the economic  field,

there   will   be  no  opportunities  for   private

enterprise    to   undertake   rational    economic

development   and,   in   particular,    industrial

development.    Without    this    massive    State

intervention  and panning, private enterprise  will

embark  on  chaotic economic activities  which  may

profit  a few individuals while driving the country

as  a  whole to economic ruin and bankruptcy. Under

the P.A.P. type of planning, private enterprise  is

encouraged  to  play  a constructive  and  socially

desirable   function.  Economic  development   will

proceed not in terms of unfettered exploitation  of

the weak but also along lines that will be socially

beneficial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another piece of misinformation the Member for

Tanglin  uttered is the claim that the  P.A.P. has

now suddenly realised the need to encourage foreign

investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again let me quote relevant passages from

The  Tasks Ahead to show that the role allotted  to

foreign investments in the Four-Year Plan is not  a

new departure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part I, page 9 of The Tasks Ahead, this is

what we say of the role of foreign capital:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although we disagree that the survival of

Singapore  depends on foreign capital  and  foreign

capitalists, nevertheless foreign capital  business

concerns  that  wish  to  establish  factories   in

Singapore   will   be   given   encouragement   and

assistance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 25 we outlined the role of foreign

capital in economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reiterating our disbelief that the economic

survival  depended wholly or even substantially  on

foreign  capital,  we said that  we  would  welcome

foreign  capital  as  an addition  to  our  capital

resources. We said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Foreign business concerns which wish to

establish factories in Singapore will be given  all

the  encouragement and assistance they  needed.  We

shall give them guarantees in regard to security of

capital, remittance of dividends and other  matters

which  all  modern  governments  regard  as  normal

practice. But it would be foolish to imagine  that,

whatever we do, foreign capital will come in  on  a

scale  needed to solve our problems. Our  salvation

lies   in   our  hands.  There  are  no  benevolent

foreigners  knocking around the world,  anxious  to

discharge  these duties and responsibilities  which

are rightly our own.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Four-Year Plan has not in any way departed

from  this  view. If the Members of the  Opposition

will  look  at the simple table on page 49  of  the

report, they will realise that the bulk of the $871

million  for  the  Plan  will  come  from  our  own

resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as private investments are concerned, we

have  at  no time said that we would dispense  with

foreign   investments.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill

yesterday made great play of the warnings that were

issued during the elections to foreign firms.  Only

he  forgot  to  tell us the context  in  which  the

warning  was issued and the nature of the warning.

During  the  elections  and  before,  a  number  of

foreign firms decided to enter the political  arena

and  back the S.P.A. Government against the  P.A.P.

We had even obscure Archbishops contributing to the

election funds of Labour Front politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said then that while we welcomed foreign

capital and foreign enterprises which wished to  do

legitimate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



trade, we would not tolerate foreign capital  which

comes here as a prelude to political control.  That

was  the  context in which the warning  to  foreign

capital  and  firms was issued.  And  that  warning

still  stands.  If  foreign  investors  or  foreign

capitalists  involve themselves in local  politics,

then  they will be asking for trouble. But if  they

confine  themselves to legitimate trade, they  will

get all protection and encouragement. That is clear

from what was said in The Tasks Ahead, and that  is

implied in the Four-Year Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the S.P.A. Members will read The Tasks Ahead

and   the  Four-Year  Plan  carefully,  they   will

discover  that the Four-Year Plan is,  essentially,

an  attempt to give economic flesh and bones to the

broad principles outlined in The Tasks Ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, the Plan is not a completely

socialist Plan, but then even before the elections

we  said  that  a socialist society  could  not  be

realised  within  the confines  of  Singapore.  But

within  the  limitations of our  peculiar  economic

structure  we have attempted to introduce  some  of

the   elements  traditionally  associated  with   a

socialist economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these is the active and important role

played  by  the  State  in  the  direction  of  our

economy.  The Plan, as I said a little  while  ago,

shows the readiness of the State to intervene on  a

massive  scale  in the economic process  and  guide

private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other socialist element is the introduction

of  planning, though that planning is not as  total

as   under   a   completely   socialised   economy.

Nevertheless,  there  is a  significant  amount  of

planning.  In the past, planning was done,  by  and

large,  annually by means of an annual Budget.  For

the first time in the history of Singapore, we have

now  a  concrete  Plan to cover a  period  of  four

years. The Plan has made a systematic and realistic

survey  of the extent of resources available during

the  next four years and planned its objectives  in

terms of these available resources.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this context, we have said, as the motion

states, that we exhort capital and labour to play a

part  in  maintaining a fair balance between  their

respective  interests.  This  term  "fair  balance"

appears  to  have upset the Member for Tanglin  who

said  that  the  Government should have  laid  more

stress  on  increased  productivity  and  speed  in

economic   development.  We  believe  in  increased

productivity and economic development, but we  also

believe in a fair balance between interests. It may

be that the Member for Tanglin wants us to preserve

an  unfair  balance, that is, to  the  disadvantage

presumably of the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> I never said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Tanglin insisted

that the Government is placing undue stress on  the

need to preserve a fair balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You can have reference to an

arbitrator!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Both the Member for Tanglin and

the Member for Cairnhill complained yesterday that

the  Government  did not care two hoots  for  their

views. That all depends on the views expressed.  If

they  are  intelligent views, they  will  be  given

every  careful consideration. But if they are  not,

the  hon. Members must not expect us to treat  them

as anything more than silly views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill made a

speech  which struck me very much as though he  was

acting  as a propaganda agent for the former Member

for  Hong  Lim. He has brought in a  new  line.  In

fact, today, he was arguing very much that he hoped

that  the Government would not lose the by-election

in  Hong  Lim, because if it did so,  it  would  be

disastrous  not only for the country but  also  for

the  Development Plan. For the last three  or  four

hours,  I was wondering what reasons prompted  this

new  political  approach, because,  if  I  remember

correctly,  until then the line of the  S.P.A. was

that Mr Ong Eng Guan was fighting the Opposition's

battle in Hong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



Lim. But now the Member for Cairnhill has taken the

line that he would not want Mr Ong Eng Guan to win

the  Hong  Lim by-election. It strikes me that  Mr

Ong   has  been  rather  embarrassed  by  all  this

effusive  support for his cause and he has  perhaps

found  it  necessary to indicate that it  would  be

most   embarrassing  for   a   self-proclaimed

revolutionary to enjoy the support of the S.P.A. So

that  now the Member for Cairnhill takes a new line

by  saying that a victory for Mr Ong in  Hong  Lim

would  be a disaster. But having disavowed sympathy

for Mr Ong, the Member for Cairnhill then took  to

repeating in this Assembly the propaganda line  Mr

Ong  has  been  taking at his street  meetings  and

public  rallies. For example, Mr  Ong  has  always

maintained  that he was sacked from  the  Party  so

that  the  Government  would have  its  chances  of

getting  a loan better enhanced. Today, the  Member

for  Cairnhill  in  a  somewhat  different  fashion

congratulated  the  Government for  rectifying  its

errors  and  expelling Mr Ong from the Government.

But  he  went on to say that he would not  like  to

suggest  that the expulsion of Mr Ong had anything

to  do  with the Finance Minister's trip to London.

He said that he personally did not believe it to be

so,  but  he felt he could not help repeating  this

sort  of rumour that has been spreading, and though

he thought it highly improbable he felt that it was

necessary to say so, so that tomorrow's papers will

publish  the line that there are other  people  who

think  that perhaps Mr Ong was expelled and, since

his  expulsion,  the chances of  the  Minister  for

Finance and the P.A.P. Government of getting a loan

are far better enhanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Ong has always maintained that the

Work  Brigade  is a device for cheering  Ministers.

The  Member  for Cairnhill said that he  had  heard

that  the  Work Brigade was paid by Government  and

that  it was used to cheer the Minister for  Labour

and  Law  when he returned to Singapore. Of course,

the  Member  for  Cairnhill said that  he  did  not

believe  it  but  that was what  he  heard  and  he

repeats  it  here. He hopes that tomorrow's  papers

will  probably misquote the fact that he  does  not

believe in it himself but will quote the rest of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



the passage to the effect that the Work Brigade  is

being used to cheer Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Ong has suggested that Political

Secretaries  who  talk  on the  P.A.P. by-election

platform  did  so  because they are  being  paid  a

salary  out of public funds amounting to  $1,100  a

month  each.  The  Member for  Cairnhill  took  the

opportunity  to repeat here - in fact, he  repeatedly

stressed-that  we  are using Political  Secretaries

who  each  receive a salary of $1,100 a  month.  It

might  be  pure  coincidence that  the  Member  for

Cairnhill is echoing precisely the same thing  that

the  former  Member  for Hong Lim  is  saying.  The

Member  for Cairnhill says that he hopes the former

Member  for Hong Lim will not win the Hong Lim

by-election, but he feels that the propaganda  of  the

former  Member for Hong Lim is worth  repeating  in

this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There you are!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Again, Mr Ong has made play of

the  issue  of detainees. The Member for  Cairnhill

today brought up the question of detainees although

this motion has nothing to do with it. He saw  fit

to  bring up this issue again saying, "Here are the

Political  Secretaries pleading for their  comrades

in  Changi,"  and  therefore highlighting  for  the

benefit of Mr Ong the question of detainees.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You are putting the blame on

the Federation Government. It is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Ong claims that the Trade

Union Congress consists of Government stooges.  The

Member for Cairnhill dutifully repeats this in this

Chamber  today. Mr Ong has always maintained  that

the  Government back-benchers do not see eye to eye

with  the  Ministers, and the Member for  Cairnhill

spent  a  great  deal of time yesterday  and  today

saying, "Here is the Minister for Finance who is  a

very reasonable man. But the terrible Back-benchers

do  not  follow the Government line," in  the  hope

that  the Minister for Finance would be in the  bad

books of the Back-benchers, which is precisely  the

same  strategy that the former Member for Hong  Lim

had been following in this Chamber. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



former  Member for Hong Lim had said, "It  is  only

the  Ministers who are the wicked people. But there

are very good Assemblymen on the back benches."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You have spoiled the soup!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Cairnhill has

adopted  a  far  more  subtle,  clever  and  adroit

strategy  than the rather naive Member for Tanglin.

He  comes to say, "I do not believe that So and  So

is  a  crook. But then I heard he is a crook."  And

then  he  looks up and he hopes that  it  would  be

published.  He said, "No, the Minister for  Finance

is a very reasonable man. But the Back-benchers are

really  the ones who are really spoiling the  soup

for  the Minister for Finance." Sir, this is a  new

strategy.  Let  us  make one thing  clear.  If  the

Member for Cairnhill is expecting that, as a result

of  publicly stating that he hoped that the  P.A.P.

would   win  the  by-election,  he  is   going   to

administer  the  kiss of death  to  the  Government

Party,  he is very much mistaken, because  we  know

quite  clearly  that Mr Ong has  the  support  and

blessing  of  the Opposition. Let it remain  there.

Whatever  subterfuges  may  be  indulged  in   this

Assembly,  they  would  not  cut  very   much   ice

certainly  with  the Government and certainly  with

members of the public. Mr Speaker, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Some more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I fear that the Member for

Cairnhill  is a little bit anxious as to what  line

of  argument he has to follow to help  in  the

by-election,  in  view of the fact that this  Assembly

will  be  sitting on 26th April, a few days  before

Polling Day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Kandasamy):</b> Dr  Goh,  in

reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In reply, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,I wish to start my remarks by replying to  the

allegation made by the Member for Farrer Park  that

the  Opposition did not have sufficient  notice  to

make a proper and adequate study of the Development

Plan.  They claimed that the document itself  went

to  them  some 13 days ago with a notice of  debate

just three days ago and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



that  therefore until they received the  notice  of

debate  they  were  completely  unaware  that  this

matter   would  be  discussed  in  the  Legislative

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I remind them that

at  the last sitting of the Assembly on 22nd March.

I made it a point to state that at the next sitting

of  the  Assembly I would present this  Development

Plan  for  the approval of the Assembly? Therefore,

if the Opposition who were probably absent as usual

during  serious  sessions of the Assembly  did  not

take notice of what I stated, then all I can say is

that they have themselves to blame.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the arguments on the substantive

motion,  I  may start on a light tone by commenting

on the remarks of the Member for Tanglin, who never

ceases  to  astonish me by his progress as  a  most

assiduous student of political tracts published  by

the  People's Action Party. Sir, it is my hope that

the  time  and effort that he has spent in studying

the  publications  of  the  P.A.P. would  be  duly

rewarded  by  enlightenment and by  an  advance  in

political  understanding. Although I can  see  some

progress  in this direction, I cannot say  that  he

would   quite  make  the  grade  now  because,   as

understanding glimmers and dawns upon his mind,  he

does  not attribute that to an improvement  of  his

political  understanding but to  a  change  in  our

Party stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Very subtle!



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, you will remember that

during the general election, the Member for Tanglin

said at a mass meeting, and he was reported in  the

Straits Times - unfortunately I do not have a copy of

it  today,  not being systematic as the Member  for

Tanglin  is - as saying, "Your house is on fire.  It

has  been struck by lightning." I thought that this

was  just  a  figure of speech and that  maybe  the

Member  for Tanglin was just having a private  joke

by himself. But I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



am  now  convinced  that he  really  believed  that

statement - that the P.A.P., when it came into power,

would  be out to ruin the country, burn the  houses

down,  massacre  the people, and  God  knows  what.

Therefore,  when we came into power  and  had  done

none  of  these  things, and had never  acted  like

backwoodsmen  - on the contrary, we  are  the  most

reasonable of reasonable people - he said, "You  have

changed!" Where? What has happened is that  he  now

says,  "Yes. They are reasonable people. They  said

these  things.  It  was quite reasonable."  But  he

thought   that  there  is  not  quite  that   exact

correspondence  between our campaign  speeches  and

our performance today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister for Culture, has gone

into some detail on this subject, and I do not want

to  dwell  too much on it. But may I say  this:  he

said  that whereas this Development Plan  would  be

dependent on overseas capital and overseas know-how

to  give  us  the  impetus to our industrialisation

programme,  there  was no such  acceptance  in  the

Party's  Five-Year Plan when we met the electorate.

We said - and he quoted a section of the Party's

Five-Year  Plan -  that  "Singapore does  not  depend  on

foreign capitalists for its survival." We said that

in  1959, and we say it today. The Plan never  said

that  Singapore depends on foreign capitalists  for

its  survival.  If the Member for Tanglin  disputes

this  proposition, it is open to him to  quote  any

section. He quoted that part of the Plan which says

to the contrary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you must remember that in May

1959,  when  we were campaigning, we  were  in  the

situation   that   whenever   the   former   S.P.A.

Government made any public declaration of  economic

policy,  their  main emphasis was  this:  that  the

P.A.P. was  driving  away  foreign  capital   and

therefore Singapore would die. We then had to tell

the people, "Your main survival depends on your own

efforts,   and  not  on  what  outsiders   (foreign

capitalists) do for Singapore." And even  today  we

say that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



overseas   manufacturer   has   no   responsibility

whatsoever to come here. That remains true. And  if

you  stake your existence on this, then I say  that

you are living in a dreamworld. We have never said,

and  this  Plan  never claims to assert,  that  the

livelihood  of the people of Singapore  depends  on

foreign  capitalists. We say that we make the  main

effort;  and having developed the strength  of  the

economy, and having produced by our own efforts, by

our  own  self-discipline, the proper  climate  for

investment,  then  we will have a  good  chance  of

attracting   a  substantial  amount   of   overseas

investment  and technical know-how  with  which  to

give us that first impetus to our industrialisation

programme.  That is all we have said. What  we  say

now   in   the  Development  Plan  is  in  no   way

inconsistent with what we said in May  1959  before

the electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, time does not allow me to answer all the

statements made by Members of the Opposition, and I

wish  to  confine  my remarks to criticisms - carping

criticisms,  if  I may say so - put  forward  by  the

Member  for  Farrer  Park. I shall  deal  with  his

comments on the Development Plan point by point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he said that this Plan is not all that it

is  cracked  up to be, because, after all,  it  is

only  a rehash of what Government departments  want

to  do.  Based  on  his perhaps not  so  brief  but

certainly an inglorious experience in the  colonial

City Council, he presumes to pronounce judgment  on

the mechanics whereby we created this Plan, and  to

say  that  the  way  it  was done  was  inadequate.

Inadequate, because it is no more than a rehash  of

dribs  and drabs sent in by the departments of  the

Government. Sir, I will be the first to admit  that

in  certain fields of government activity, the  all

expansion  programme must depend on what the  civil

servants  in  the departments concerned  tell  you.

That  is the first approach. Take departments  like

the Post Office, Telecommunications, or Veterinary,

or  what  have you. These are technical departments

of  Government. And if the head of department is at

all worthy of his pay, he must think forward in his

normal routine work. Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



if  the department says, "Yes, this  is  the

way.  The  Post Office must always know where  they

are  going  to site the new post offices  over  the

next  five  years." And in respect of the programme

for  such technical departments, I should say  that

the  Member for Farrer Park is correct. But to  say

that the whole Plan has been conceived, worked  out

and developed in this way is absolutely monstrous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained, in the first instance, that

although there are plans of some sort available  in

departments,  it is necessary to develop  them,  to

reappraise them, and to get a certain assessment of

their  consequences or revenue and  expenditure  if

these projects are to be implemented. And this is a

time-consuming  effort  because  the   departments'

estimates  have  to  be  checked,  rechecked,   for

consistency,  for  possibility  of  other   factors

arising. Apart from the rather mechanical  work  of

assessing the implications and consequences of  the

Plan, it is necessary that the Government should be

guided  by  a scale of priorities, because  if  you

just  add  up  whatever is dished out  to  you  and

swallow the whole thing, you are likely to  end  up

with an awful tummy-ache, a completely indigestible

rehash  of  what  has  been put  into  the  sausage

machine  of  the  administrative  system.  And   in

setting out the scale of priorities - and this is the

determining  factor - we are not guided  by  the  pet

schemes of departments, because if you allow  every

department  to  do whatever it likes,  then  I  can

assure  you,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we shall  not  need

$871 million for the next four years, but something

nearer  $3,000 million. You must have  a  scale  of

priorities   and  that  scale  of   priorities   is

determined    by   your   political   programme - the

programme that you put before the electorate - which

gives you the direction in which you want to propel

the   economic  system,  taking  into  account  the

promises you have given to the electorate, the type

of   political  and  social  advance,   you   think

desirable and possible at this stage of Singapore's

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is here that we find the crucial element of

the  Plan. It is here that the Ministry of Finance,

as the central planning authority in this instance,

has to balance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



the   counter   claims  of  the  other   Ministries

competing  for a limited amount of resources.  That

was  the  initiative that was taken by the planning

organisation in consultation with Ministers in  the

different Ministries as regards priorities  between

social   and  economic  development,  and   between

different fields, different projects within each of

its major fields. We were at once struck by what is

sometimes   termed,   in   contemporary    economic

terminology,   "the   inadequacy   of   Singapore's

industrial  intra-structure", that is to  say,  the

basic  services  such  as roads,  port  facilities,

power,  water,  light,  telecommunications,   land,

industrial sites, and so forth which are

necessary-if  you  want rapid industrialisation-in  order  to

have  any  chance whatsoever of succeeding.  It  is

here that the initiative of the Government has been

revealed  in  the Plan before the Assembly.  I  can

assure  you  that  if you allow the  administrative

machine  to submit plans and projects and put  them

all  into  some  sort of shape,  you  will  have  a

completely  different Plan from the one before  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was necessary, while the preparation of this

Plan  took  place, to give as much  preparation  in

detail as was possible to projects such as Kallang,

Jurong,  the  Economic Development  Board,  and  so

forth.  As I have explained in my opening  address,

this Plan was first worked out in October 1959. The

first draft was completed six months after. At  the

time  when  we started work on the Plan, which  was

nearly a year and a half ago, the technical details

available  for  these  major  projects  which  were

intended  to  speed  up industrialisation  progress

were  in a very rudimentary form. They were no more

than vague ideas. Therefore, we had to spend a long

time  during the few months at our disposal to work

them   out   in  some  suitable  form.  Since   the

completion   of   the  first  draft,   considerable

progress has been made, and I will refer to  it  in

due  course. But it is in the nature of things that

you  must have a dead-line somewhere and say,  "All

right. Whatever is ready at that time goes."  After

the  first  half of 1960, although further  details

were available,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



we  decided not to incorporate them into this  Plan

because we were certain that there would be further

revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park also challenged the

adequacy  of  our  plans  for  the  development  of

electricity.  He asked whether they were  just  the

ideas  of the Electricity Engineer. The Electricity

Engineer  thought  that this  should  be  done  and

therefore  we  accepted it. In point of  fact,  the

problem  of  the  expansion of electric  power  was

posed  by  the planning authority and submitted  to

the Electricity Engineer for his consideration.  We

made  a number of projections of possible expansion

in   the   demand  of  electricity,  given  various

assumptions about the growth of industry.  Finally,

after discussions with him, we decided on a certain

projection  which  we  thought  to  be   the   most

probable.  Based  on that, it  was  up  to  him  to

produce  a  plan whereby this growth of electricity

could be achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park considers the Jurong

Scheme  to be an ill-conceived one and that  it  is

not  likely  to lead to any success. He thinks  the

details  of  this plan to be completely inadequate.

As   I   have  said,  the  details  of  the  Jurong

industrial site as entered in the Plan are the ones

that were available at the time when we decided  to

say,  "So  far and no farther." This  is  a  living

project.  After  the  closing  date  of  the   plan

revision, we have had a visit from a Japanese  team

of  industrial planners. Since then, the  Singapore

Government  has  established  a  team  of  its  own

technical experts, consisting of engineers from the

P.W.D.,  members  of the Singapore  Harbour  Board,

engineers   from   the   Water   Department,    the

Electricity  Department, the Town-planners  and  so

forth, to examine these factors in great detail. We

have completed a large-scale topographic mapping of

the  area.  The Marine Department has  completed  a

hydrographic  survey of the waters  around  Jurong.

Boring tests have been completed and technical data

are  in  the  process of being sent  to  Tokyo  for

evaluation by the Japanese industrial planners.  It

is  in the nature of things that, in working  on  a

substantial long-term project such as Jurong, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



not   possible  to  have  all  the  final   details

completed  in  the first six or ten months  of  our

office. That was the time when the main part of the

Plan was conceived and written. We have, therefore,

gone  out  of  our way to stress  that  this  is  a

flexible  Plan, in itself developing from  time  to

time  as we collect more technical data and  as  we

make a further appraisal of the economic situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park's remarks about the

Kallang  project, I think, can be dealt  with  very

briefly.  It  is obvious that if it takes  four  to

five  years to fill up the swamp, then you are  not

going  to  get  any revenue during that  period.  I

would  have  thought  that  to  be  a  self-evident

proposition. And indeed it is likely that  you  are

not  going to get any revenue for a long time after

that, because, having filled the swamp, you have to

allow  the land to settle down. But land being  one

of  the most scarce resources in Singapore, and the

Kallang  swamp  occupying such a central  area,  we

consider  this  project  is  worth  examining   and

proceeding with. If the Member for Farrer Park  had

read the latter part of this plan dealing in detail

with  the Kallang project, he would have known that

what  appeared  in the first half  was  really  the

recommendations  of some years ago  when  engineers

decided  that  we  could fill the swamp  by  moving

earth from Paya Lebar. Now we are having a new look

at the problem to find out whether or not we cannot

fill  up  the  swamp cheaper, such  as  by  suction

pumping of mud in the Singapore harbour. Here again

technical work is in progress, and I will  not  say

more about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park says, with a

considerable  amount of glee, that this  Plan  will

fail  if  there  is  no private investment.  Surely

nobody is going to dispute that. The whole emphasis

of  my opening address was to stress the hope  that

the  substantial amount of investment in the public

sector   would   have   the  effect   of   inducing

correspondingly large investments  in  the  private

sector. I am not quite sure what was the point  the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



for  Farrer Park was making. If his point was  that

the  Plan  should have contained some  targets  for

private   investment - and  in  the  plans  of   some

countries targets for private investments  are  set

out - then  I  say  it  is not possible  in  an  open

economy such as ours to say that there shall  be  X

million  dollars  of  private  investment  in   the

building  industry;  Y million  dollars'  worth  of

investment in the chemical industry, and so  forth.

Such planning targets of investment in industry are

possible only in two circumstances. One is when you

have a completely collectivised economy, where  the

Government  itself establishes its  industries.  In

fact,   the  Government  is  the  sole  source   of

industrial progress. That is possible. It  is  also

possible where you have a very substantial  economy

with  a  very large population and a closed market,

that  is  to say, in countries such as India  where

you  can  decide not to import electric fans.  Then

you  know that you have to produce so many hundreds

of  thousands  of electric fans that  will  require

private investment of so many lakhs of rupees,  and

you  decide that such investments would be left  to

the private sector. Then you can set up this target

and  so  arrange  a  system  of  licensing  of  new

industries that it means something. But in an  open

economy such as ours, planning along these lines is

not, at any rate at this stage, possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park goes to some length to

refer  to page 35. He says that many items  in  the

Plan  have  no  effect  on  industrialisation.  For

instance,  the  Animal Husbandry  and  Agricultural

Stations   at   Sembawang  are   not   related   to

industrialisation.  No one will  dispute  that.  He

says that the swamp reclamation scheme intended  to

produce prawn ponds and reclaim land for farms  has

no  direct  relevance to industry. Nobody  disputes

that.  But  surely he is not making the point  that

the  whole  Plan  should  be  concentrated  on  the

development  of  industry to the exclusion  of  all

other   activities.   That   is   an   unacceptable

proposition. Surely in a long-term development plan

you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



must so balance your resources that all sectors  of

the  economy  have  a  fair  share  of  development

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member enters on a discussion of page 38

of  the  Plan. He disputes that roads, bridges  and

drains  could  be  considered  as  increasing   the

national  income. How is it that roads, drains  and

bridges do not increase the national income? Surely

they  do.  You  find  that  as  an  axiom  in   all

development  plans. Take the Federation Development

Plan,  for instance. Substantial sums of money  are

spent  on building new roads so that new areas  can

be  opened  up for cultivation, thereby  increasing

the national income, so that transportation of your

agricultural produce can be made more easy, so that

farmers  could increase their income  and  increase

their  output.  If you have irrigation  drains  and

ditches to drain out flood water, you increase your

national income to the extent that you avoid losses

of crops through flood damage. I would have thought

that this proposition would have been self-evident.

Perhaps  the  Member for Farrer Park was  confusing

the  growth of national income with the  growth  of

Government revenue. I agree that these projects  do

not  directly contribute to the Government revenue.

But  they  do  encourage and induce  the  growth  of

output in trade, and in agriculture especially, and

to that extent can be considered as contributing to

the growth of the national income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, one last crack from the Member for

Farrer Park; a rather witty one, I thought, because

he  said that as a result of bad management by  the

P.A.P.  Government, we should really have  a  water

famine by now. But luckily the rain fell and  saved

us  from  this  calamity. Sir, is  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  aware that far from Providence  being

kind  to  the P.A.P. Government, it has  been  most

unkind  so far as the water supply goes? I am  told

that  last year the total annual rainfall was  just

over  60 inches as compared with the normal average

of 92 inches a year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



And  in  fact, last year's rainfall was one of  the

lowest  on  record. Sir, I am not going  to  be  so

presumptuous  as to say that it was the  result  of

good government that we weathered the drought.  All

I  can say is that in the matter of water supply we

did  at  least do a great deal to undo the horrible

mistake  made by the City Council when  they  built

this  famous  Murnane Reservoir at  a  cost  of  $5

million and found that that Reservoir leaked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The water supply has nothing to do

with it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I disagree absolutely, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, If  you  have  a  reservoir,   that

reservoir  holds  water and  is  available  in  any

emergency when you are short of water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only want to mention in passing, since the

Member for Farrer Park has raised the subject, that

we  are  checking on the development  plan  of  the

Water Engineer. An Israeli expert has come recently

to  have  a look at it and we have also applied  to

the World Bank for a revaluation of the development

proposals in regard to the water supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have perhaps ranged over a wide field and

taken  much of your patience at this late  hour  of

the  night.  If I have not been as logical  in  the

development of my field in this concluding  speech,

it  is  because I have to meet arguments on a large

number   of  disparate  points.  In  my  concluding

remarks,  I think I should not miss out the  Member

for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that one of the besetting sins of the

P.A.P. is its arrogance, particularly the arrogance

of  the  Ministers.  Sir, I have always  considered

myself  a humble person and my colleagues the  most

reasonable  of persons. I am unable  to  trace  any

tinge  of arrogance in them, nor have I heard  this

complaint  from  other  people.  Therefore,  I   am

wondering  what is the source - why does  the  Member

for Cairnhill-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It was the first time!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Not the first time. He has

been  repeating this for a long time. I cannot  see

any reason why he says so. Why does he think so? He

has  said  it  so  often that  I  am  convinced  he

believes that I am arrogant. Some months ago,  Sir,

I  went to see a film. It was the first film I  had

seen  for years. The film was entitled, "The School

for  Scoundrels". And it preached the  doctrine  of

"one-upmanship".  The  principal  actor  propounded

this theory: either you are one up, or you are  one

down.  And  he urged upon everybody to be  one  up.

Now, I rather suspect that the Member for Cairnhill

is  a believer of this proposition - that either  you

are  one  up, or you are one down. And he, being  a

Member  of  the Opposition and therefore one  down,

thinks  that  those  who  are  one  up  are  unduly

arrogant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quite frankly, I cannot accept the

allegations that we are a bunch of arrogant  twirps

because  we  have  gone out  of  our  way  in  this

Development  Plan to play down the  benefits  which

will  accrue to the people of Singapore as a result

of successful P.A.P. implementation-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was wondering whether the

Minister  for  Finance has used an  unparliamentary

word  about  his own Ministers. Did  he  call  them

"twirps"? If he did, it was unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that was, in fact, a

phrase which - I mean, that is the trouble with going

to  films! That was the word which I think I  heard

in  this  film,  and if it is unparliamentary,  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   I   withdraw   it   without   any

reservation,  because it has no bearing  whatsoever

on the conduct of the Government front bench.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after having throughout my opening address

played  down and minimised the importance  and  the

significance  of this Plan, if I may  be  permitted

for  one moment to give a word of praise about  the

Plan  and what we proposed to do about it,  we  can

say  that as the Government we have worked hard and

to  the  best  of  our  ability.  The  position  is

difficult and our resources are scarce. But we have

never  failed  for  want  of  trying,  and  in  the

implementation  of  this Development  Plan  we  can

assure  you, Mr Speaker, Sir, and Members  of  the

Assembly  that  we  shall  press  forward  in  this

spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, after careful deliberation of

the  acute  problems  of  unemployment  caused   by

Singapore's rapid population increase which is  not

accompanied  by corresponding increase in  economic

expansion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALERTS our people to the paramount need to expand

employment opportunities, and to this end



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPROVES the State Development Plan 1961-1964,

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CALLS on all sections of the people to unite in

their effort to fulfil the plan, and in particular



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXHORTS the workers and trade union movement and

the  businessmen and industrialists to play,  their

part   in  maintaining  a  fair  balance  of  their

respective interests so essential to success.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That this Assembly do now adjourn to

26th April."-[Mr Rajaratnam].
