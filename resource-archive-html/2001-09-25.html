<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST USA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact on Singapore economy)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether there will be an adverse  impact  from  the

unfortunate bombing incidents in the United States of America

on  Singapore's  economic prospects and, if so,  whether  the

Government  will  consider implementing further  measures  to

help  Singaporeans  and businesses cope  with  the  worsening

downturn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry, in view of the recent devastating terrorist attacks

against  the  United States of America, whether his  Ministry

can  (i)  provide  statistics regarding the extent  of  their

negative  impact on the Singapore economy; and (ii) introduce

further measures to help the Singapore economy should  it  be

badly affected by the events.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to

take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The recent terrorist attacks

against  the  US are bound to impact the global economy.   It

has already caused significant disruptions to the US economy.

The  financial,  insurance and airline industries  are  badly

hit,  although  the  interest rate cuts  by  the  US  Federal

Reserve  and the European Central Bank have helped to cushion

the shock to financial markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this event, there were some indications that

the  US  economy  might be close to bottoming  out,  but  the

September  11 attacks have diminished markedly the  prospects

of  an early recovery.  Consumer confidence and spending  are

expected to decline, increasing the risk of a US and a global

recession significantly.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>

Singapore economy will be adversely affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the immediate impact of the attacks was

felt  by our financial markets.  The Straits Times Industrial

Index  fell by 7.3% while the Singapore dollar rose  by  1.1%

against the US dollar on 12th September as investors sold off

the  US  dollar and stocks affected by the attacks.  Air  and

sea  transport was held up temporarily when the US closed its

airports  following the attack.  Our export-oriented  sectors

like  manufacturing, tourism and transport services will slow

further as a result of weaker US demand in the short-term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is still fluid and will depend on how

events unfold in the coming months.  The chain of events  set

off by the terrorist attacks has not yet fully played out, as

the  US  considers  its  response, and  as  terrorist  groups

undoubtedly  plan  further moves.  But the events  last  week

have  already  changed  the world.   There  will  be  greater

uncertainties,  and all economic forecasts will  have  to  be

reviewed.  What is clear is that an economic recovery in  the

short term is unlikely.  At this point, we expect our overall

economic  growth this year to become negative.   Singaporeans

must therefore be prepared for a more prolonged downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few months, the Government has been

working  on  a  second package of additional  measures  which

might  be  needed  to help ease the burden on  companies  and

Singaporeans.  The World Trade Centre attacks have  increased

the  urgency of the second package and the scale of  measures

required.  We are still finalising the package.  The  Finance

Minister  will  address the question on  the  timing  of  the

package in his reply.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to ask the Minister a supplementary question  in

terms  of  commenting  conceptually on  the  extent  of  pump

priming   that   the  Government  would   consider   in   the

circumstances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think we are ready yet to announce the details of the package

but  conceptually  there  will be a  modest  amount  of  pump

priming.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister  whether his Ministry has now revised  the  GDP

forecast  for the whole year?  I think the last forecast  was

minus 1.5%.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We expect the flash forecast

to  be  out on 7th October and when that forecast is out,  we

will also revise our GDP estimate for this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, in a worst case

scenario, how many jobs does the Minister expect to  be  lost

as companies are directly affected by the downturn?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the situation

is  still  fluid because the dust of the recent disaster  has

not yet settled.  The markets are still volatile.  I think it

is  too  early for us to be overly sure of what the  ultimate

impact  would be.  The war has not yet started.   We  do  not

know how long it will last and what all the consequences will

be.    We   are  on  the  pessimistic  side,  so  we   expect

unemployment this year and next year to be worse than what we

had earlier projected.  As to how much worse, it is premature

to say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as

in  the  US, which has announced a bail-out package  for  its

airline industry, would the Minister consider bailing out SIA

should  this become necessary, at least to save jobs  because

SIA has announced plans to retrench some workers?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> On the issue of insurance,

Government has already taken a quick decision yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On preserving jobs in the airline industry by Government

subsidy,  I think that would be a very bad principle.   I  do

not  see at this point in time any request for a bail-out  of

SIA.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I am not asking for a bail-out

package  but  I  want to ask the Minister  whether  he  would

target  specific  industries  that  would  be  more  affected

particularly by this impact of the terrorist attacks  on  the

US, for example, airline-related industry, tourism, insurance

and others that are more badly affected.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  we  should  be  reacting to what  might  be  transient

changes  because  of the terrorist attacks in  New  York  and

Washington.   There  is naturally an over-reaction  and  many

people  have reduced their travels.  Many meetings have  been

cancelled  and this has had an immediate impact on  airlines,

hotel  and  convention business.  The dust  will  settle  and

things  will assume a certain normality and we will  have  to

analyse  the  situation then and decide what our  appropriate

responses should be.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>OFF-BUDGET MEASURES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in

view  of  the deteriorating economy, when will the Government

announce and implement further off-Budget measures to  assist

Singaporeans  and local industries affected by  the  economic

downturn.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, when the $2.2 billion off-Budget  package  was

announced  in  July  this year, we said that  the  Government

would  do  more to assist Singaporeans if the global economic

situation worsened in the coming months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the intervening months, leading indicators suggest

that  the economy has worsened further and it is likely  that

the  third quarter results will be substantially weaker.  The

Minister  for  Trade  and Industry has also  noted  that  the

events  in  the United States due to terrorist attacks  would

depress the global economy further.  So the outlook is pretty

gloomy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has therefore been working on a second, more

substantial, off-Budget package, which will be finalised when

the third quarter results are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>

known  around mid-October.  At that time, the full impact  of

the terrorist attacks on the US and its impact on our economy

will be clearer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether

he  has  a  more  definite  date as to  when  the  off-Budget

measures would be announced and if the flash estimates can be

ready  earlier,  could the off-Budget measures  be  announced

earlier so as to help the industries and Singaporeans?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> As I said, the estimates will be

available around mid-October.  I do not think, at this  time,

I  want to give a specific date when the second package  will

be announced, but it will be done as soon as practicable.

<div align="center"><b>IN-PRINCIPLE AGREEMENT WITH MALAYSIA ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OUTSTANDING BILATERAL ISSUES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assessment)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Prime Minister whether

Singapore  got  a fair deal out of the recent agreement  with

Malaysia on the outstanding bilateral issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Prime Minister if

he  will  give  an  assessment  of  the  recent  in-principle

agreement with Malaysia, announced by the Senior Minister and

the Malaysian Prime Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Prime Minister when will

the  price  increase  to  45 sen per 1,000  gallons  for  the

purchase  of raw water from Malaysia take effect and  whether

it  will  significantly affect the retail price of  water  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your

permission to take the three questions by Mr Inderjit  Singh,

Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan and Mr Tay Beng Chuan together as they

are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, let me first sketch the

background  to  the  recent  positive  developments  in   our

discussions on the bilateral package. Senior Minister visited

Kuala  Lumpur last year in August, with Prime Minister  Goh's

agreement,  to  try  and  narrow  the  differences  over  the

outstanding bilateral issues. Following discussions  with  Dr

Mahathir,  Senior Minister had written to Tun Daim  regarding

Singapore's proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step came, in February this year, when

Malaysian  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Abdullah  Badawi  visited

Singapore  and discussed with Prime Minister Goh the  package

of  outstanding issues. At this meeting, Prime  Minister  Goh

agreed  in-principle to Malaysia's request to move their  KTM

railway station from Tanjong Pagar to Kranji, and to have the

KTM trains run in an underground tunnel from Johor to Kranji,

as  part of the larger package of issues. They both agreed on

the  need to resolve these outstanding issues on the  package

as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah

Badawi's  visit,  Senior Minister received a  reply  from  Dr

Mahathir  in  March  2001  regarding  Singapore's  proposals.

Members will recall that I told the House on 13th March  that

our  preliminary study showed that there were  variations  on

some points between Dr Mahathir's reply and Senior Minister's

understanding  with  Dr Mahathir during his  visit  to  Kuala

Lumpur last year. I added, however, that at first blush,  the

difference did not appear that great.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister's recent visit to KL was a follow-up to Dr Mahathir's reply. After consulting Prime Minister

Goh, Senior Minister visited KL again to continue discussions

on the package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the outcome of the most recent

discussions  between  Senior Minister  and  Dr  Mahathir.  As

Senior  Minister  has  made clear in his comprehensive  press

conferences in KL, there is now accord on the basic  skeletal

or framework agreement, which would form the basis to resolve

the outstanding issues.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This framework agreement, firstly, spells out the

elements of the package; secondly, indicates the areas  where

there is agreement on both sides; and thirdly, sets out areas

where further discussions are needed to close the gaps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recapitulate, the key elements of the broad agreement

are  the long-term supply of water to Singapore beyond  2061,

implementation of the POA, the proposal for a new  bridge  to

replace  the existing Causeway, use of Malaysian airspace  by

the  RSAF  and  the  early withdrawal of CPF  funds  by  West

Malaysians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On water, for the period 2011 to 2061, Malaysia has

offered  to provide Singapore with an additional 100  mgd  of

treated  water  to  replace the 1961 Water  Agreement,  which

expires  in 2011. While Singapore has agreed to the quantity,

Singapore  has proposed that this continue to be provided  in

raw form as Singapore has the necessary filtration capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2061 to 2161, Malaysia has offered to provide

350  mgd  of  water to Singapore - 100 mgd raw  and  250  mgd

treated water. Singapore has agreed to 350 mgd of water,  but

has  proposed  to draw 150 mgd of raw water and  200  mgd  of

treated water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the source, Singapore's position is that

the  source of additional water to be provided from 2011, and

from  2061-2161  must  be the Johor River.  Furthermore,  the

production of treated water to be supplied to Singapore after

2061 will be done jointly between Singapore and Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the price of water, for the existing supply of

350   mgd  of  raw  water  under  the  1961  and  1962  Water

Agreements, Singapore has agreed to a revision of  the  price

of  raw water purchased. Singapore has proposed to revise the

price from 3 sen to 45 sen per 1,000 gallons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the additional raw water to be supplied from 2011-2061, and from 2061-2161, Singapore has agreed to the price

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>

60 sen per 1,000 gallons, to be reviewed every five years for

inflation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan asked when will the price increase to

45 sen commence, and whether it will significantly affect the

retail  price of water in Singapore.  The answer to  that  is

the  proposed  price increase will commence only  after  full

agreement  on  the package has been finalised with  Malaysia,

and  only  after  it is signed by both Prime Ministers.   The

increase  from  3  sen to 45 sen is, of course,  significant.

However,  the  retail  price  of water  also  includes  other

components,   including   manpower   costs,   treatment   and

distribution   costs,   and  the  Water   Conservation   Tax.

Therefore, any increase in the overall retail price of water,

arising from the higher raw water price paid to Johor, should

be manageable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the POA, let me first stress that the new agreement

will  not supersede the 1990 Points of Agreement, unless they

are   explicitly  varied  as  part  of  the   wider   package

negotiations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, Singapore agreed for the

KTM  station  to be relocated from Tanjong Pagar  to  Kranji,

with  the  KTM trains running in an underground  tunnel  from

Johor  to the Kranji railway station.  Malaysia will pay  for

the cost of building the underground tunnel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ)

facilities  will  move from its current  location  to  Kranji

following  the completion of the railway tunnel. Pending  the

shift  to  Kranji,  we  have proposed that  the  KTM  railway

station will be located temporarily at Woodlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plot of land at Tanjong Pagar currently occupied by

KTM will be exchanged for a plot at Shenton Way of equivalent

value for joint development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Singapore has agreed to variations of the

POA  to  include  12  lots at Bukit Timah together  with  the

original three land parcels to be jointly developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the causeway and the bridge, Singapore has agreed to

Malaysia's proposal for a bridge to be built between

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>

Singapore and Malaysia.  However, Singapore proposed that the

demolition of the causeway take place after 2007,  when  both

the  bridge  and the tunnel have been completed and  provided

the  tolls  charged at the bridge do not exceed  the  present

toll rates at the causeway adjusted for inflation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will reclaim its side to the maximum and build

its  side  of  the bridge to meet the Malaysian side  at  the

boundary.   Singapore's toll rates at the bridge  will  match

that of Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards airspace, Malaysia will reinstate all the

arrangements  and  understandings for RSAF  aircraft  to  use

Malaysia's  airspace (including the South China Sea  Training

Areas) for transit and training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards CPF, Singapore will allow the early

withdrawal, on an individual basis phased over two years,  of

the  CPF  monies  of West Malaysians who have left  Singapore

permanently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as Members can see, there has been progress.

However,  many  details still have to be sorted  out  by  the

officials of both countries to be put in a form of words into

an Agreement which the respective Prime Ministers can agree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress two important points. Firstly, all the

items  are  to be considered as part of a package.  Secondly,

the  skeletal  or framework agreement has to be completed  by

settling the details that remain to be resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ang Mo Kio has asked whether Singapore

had  received  a  fair deal from the broad agreement  reached

between  Senior Minister and Dr Mahathir.  This question  has

also  been  raised in the media.  Senior Minister  had  dealt

with  this  issue during his press conference in  KL,  but  I

shall also touch on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first say, Sir, that, in the nature of

international  negotiations,  the  broad  agreement   reached

between Singapore and Malaysia was a compromise made by  both

sides  to  move  the long-standing bilateral issues  forward.

Having been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>

subjects  of  contention  for  so  long,  the  deal  marks  a

psychological breakthrough in our bilateral negotiations.  It

shows  that despite sporadic problems in our relations,  both

countries recognise the value of cooperation and each country

has  a  stake in the other's stability and growth.  I believe

this will place relations on a surer footing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed in that context, Singapore has decided to try to

reach an agreement with Malaysia.  Some of the items are  not

balanced  in  our favour like reducing our water request  for

some  750  mgd  to  350  mgd without  any  reduction  of  the

concessions we are making.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question Singaporeans should ask ourselves is

this:  Are  we better off concluding a deal, or  by  allowing

such  outstanding issues to fester?  I think both  sides  are

better  off with the outstanding issues resolved.  We decided

it was best to have a deal with Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have decided to reach a deal with Malaysia, let

me  assure  Members that we will continue with our plans  for

desalination,  as  well  as  water  reclamation  to   produce

NEWater,  a process which involves micro-filtration  followed

by  Reverse  Osmosis  based on membrane technology.   We  can

expect  advancements in membrane technology  to  continue  to

reduce the costs of these two alternative sources of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this package will put behind us the outstanding

issues  and  it can have positive effects for both  Singapore

and Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

three supplementary questions.  The first question is on  the

issue  of CPF withdrawal.  Is this a total withdrawal  by  an

individual, or is it going to be transferred to the Malaysian

EPF?    And  related  to  that,  would  not  this  create   a

disadvantage or unfair situation for Singaporeans who  cannot

withdraw their CPF until retirement?  What would be the rules

that would not create this disadvantaged position for us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on the 12 new plots of land that

have been released in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>

place  of  the relocation of the railway.  Does the  Minister

have the current market value of the 12 pieces of land?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is, while we have got the broad

strokes of agreement, when do we expect the agreement  to  be

finally  concluded, as we know the POA was something that  we

thought would have been implemented, but was not implemented?

Will  this  be  another example of something  that  has  been

discussed, but not implementable?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thank Mr Inderjit Singh for his

questions.   The first question concerns CPF, and the  answer

to the question is that it is a withdrawal by individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it will put Singaporeans at a disadvantage, let

me say that, as I mentioned in my main answer, the withdrawal

is for Malaysians who were working here and who have returned

to  Malaysia  permanently.  So that  would  be  an  important

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether I have with me the current

market  value of the 12 plots at Bukit Timah, I do  not  have

that particular detail with me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was, with regard to a general point,

whether  we  expect  any  new  agreement  to  be  implemented

considering our experience with the POA.  Let me say that, as

with  any international negotiation with any country, we must

approach the deal in good faith that both sides will keep  to

the  terms of the agreement when we do settle the details and

finalise the agreement, and it is signed.  The items  in  the

bilateral  package would have to form part of a  new  written

agreement which has to be formally concluded between the  two

countries.   And  the  two countries  would  be  bound  under

international law to comply with the terms of the  agreement.

Therefore, I would not want to speculate on a situation where

the  Malaysians choose not to abide by the terms, and so  on.

Let me also point out something which both the Prime Minister

and I have mentioned on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>

a  previous occasion when a similar question was raised  and,

that  is,  as  these agreements are major agreements  between

Malaysia  and Singapore, both the Prime Minister and  I  have

said  that  it  is  the  intention that  we  should  come  to

Parliament and place the agreements before the House after it

has been signed.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

is  there  a  specific timeframe within  which  the  detailed

negotiations are targeted to be concluded for the  agreements

to  be signed?  I ask this because experience has shown  that

our  negotiations  on  these matters  have  taken  unexpected

twists and turns leading to long delays.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I wish I could answer Mr Iswaran by

giving a clear date when it is expected to be concluded.  But

I  am unable to do so for the reason that there are very many

details  on important matters to be sorted out.  What  I  can

say  is that, certainly on our side and also on the Malaysian

side,  the  desire  is to resolve this as  soon  as  possible

because we really have to put this behind us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I have two

supplementary  questions.  The first concerns  the  price  of

water.   The Minister, in his main answer, has said that  any

price  increase in retail water, arising from  the  agreement

would  be manageable.  I would like to know from the Minister

what  does he mean by "manageable".  How much would he expect

the  retail price of water to increase and has the Government

studied  the impact before agreeing to pay Malaysian  45  sen

per  1,000  gallons  of raw water?  The second  question  is:

under  what  consideration did the Government  agree  to  the

additional 12 plots of land in Bukit Timah for Malaysia?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I do not have with me the

details.  My Ministry does not deal with the details of water

price  by PUB.  All I am able to say, at this stage, for  the

reasons  I  have given, is that whatever price  increase  may

take place, it will be manageable.  The details will be given

to  this  House at a later stage.  When we agreed to  various

increases, and when we put forward certain proposals, have we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>

made  our calculations?  I think the House must expect  that,

yes,  we  do not put forward proposals lightly.  We  have  to

take  into account what advances our interests, what  we  can

manage, and we will not put forward a proposal - particularly

on  the  price  of water - that we are unable to  justify  to

ourselves.  So, our national interests are always at the back

of our mind in such international negotiations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the KTM lands, let me say that this is really not

a new issue.  If Members cast their minds back to 1997, Prime

Minister  spoke to this House on the difficulties  about  the

POA  and  his approach to solving the problems with  Malaysia

within  the context of a framework of wider cooperation.   He

already  mentioned  that if there is  a  framework  of  wider

cooperation  and there can be a resolution of  a  package  of

items, he is prepared "notwithstanding the terms of the  POA,

to  agree  to the joint development of the KTM land in  Bukit

Timah,  in  addition  to  the agreed three  parcels  of  land

referred  to  in the POA."  In other words, as  part  of  the

overall  package  deal - we are not under  an  obligation  to

include  the additional land in Bukit Timah - but if we  want

to  advance  the  process and to solve  the  package,  he  is

prepared  to consider this as part of the package deal.   And

that is the approach we have taken.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I would like to

put  on  record  that the Opposition is very  happy  that  an

agreement has been reached between Singapore and Malaysia  on

the  outstanding  issues.  This is a great  progress  in  the

relationship  between Singapore and Malaysia.   I  hope  that

before  we  finally  sign the agreement,  that  there  is  an

assurance  from  Malaysia  that Malaysia  shall  continue  to

supply raw water to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not asking a question. I am putting on record what

the Opposition is going to say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister spoke about concessions Singapore has made.  But  it

appears  like surprises to me.  My question is: on the  issue

of land, bridge, etc, did the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>

Malaysian government inform us earlier that these are  to  be

part of the deal or did these matters surface just during the

discussions with the Senior Minister?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is, if that is the case, are there

enough consensus and provisions in the discussions to prevent

further surprises from cropping up?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, Foreign Ministers have some

abilities,  but one of the abilities is not  to  be  able  to

predict future events!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where we have reached after many years of

discussions.  The whole package has evolved.  At one time, it

was  electric train (fast train) - POA-water.  It evolved  to

water-and-loan.   Then it evolved to POA-water-bridge-tunnel.

I  think we have taken it as far as we can to this point.  It

is in our interest to try to wrap it up as early as possible.

The  Senior  Minister explained in his press  conference  why

that  is  so.   Both  countries face various  challenges  and

problems.  The region also faces problems.  So, as we  tackle

these problems, let us not be bedevilled by these outstanding

problems.  And when the Senior Minister said that,  that  was

before  11th September.  You have heard Minister  George  Yeo

and Minister for Finance talking about how the global economy

and  the  region  may  be affected by  the  recent  terrorist

attacks.   So  both  countries and the region  face  enormous

challenges and therefore it is good for both countries to try

to put these behind us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be more surprises and twists and turns? I

cannot  guarantee that but, certainly, I hope  that,  and  am

sure,  all Members of the House share my hope that  will  not

happen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, my question is about the

effective date of the new water price.  What I hear from  the

Minister  is that the effective date will be from  the  point

when  the  two  Prime Ministers sign the new agreement.   But

would  it  not  be  possible to actually  ask  that  the  old

agreement, which has the old price of about 3 sen, be allowed

to run its full

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>

term, before the new price is implemented at a later date?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If I understand Mr Leong Horn Kee,

what he is saying is that the new price should only apply  to

the  extension of agreements after 2011 and after  2061,  and

that the existing price be untouched.  We did assessments and

in  the negotiations, it was considered that this proposal to

adjust  the  existing price - which is not a legal obligation

on  our side - was a factor to advance the negotiations.   So

we  may  not be able to make any advance if that package  did

not have that element.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister about the issue of the CIQ.  I remember  a  few

years ago we debated on this and many Singaporeans were quite

emotional  about locating the CIQ within Singapore,  being  a

sovereign issue for us.  Is there a plan in the agreement  to

finally  locate  the CIQ back to Malaysian soil  rather  than

keeping it in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If we look back at the CIQ issue - what was the key issue in the CIQ? The key issue was that

wherever  the  CIQ is located, where sovereign functions  are

being  performed - such as immigration and customs - it  must

be  with the consent of Singapore.  That was the key issue on

the  controversy.   As  events developed  and  there  was  an

exchange  of  letters, it was not controverted by Malaysians.

If  the  CIQ  was  located here, it is with  the  consent  of

Singapore.   If that basic issue is not challenged,  then  we

can  discuss where else the CIQ can be located.  But that  is

the key principle.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, there is speculation outside

this  House  as  to  why the Senior Minister  was  tasked  to

negotiate  this agreement with Malaysia instead of the  Prime

Minister.  Would the Minister like to explain that?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thought that the Senior Minister had

answered  this question quite comprehensively  in  the  press

conference.  He had explained that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>

this matter had been discussed for some time.  There had been

some  difficulties.   He had discussed this  with  the  Prime

Minister  whether,  given  his  past  experience  of   having

discussed  with Dr Mahathir, he should take a  crack  at  it.

Senior  Minister got the agreement and approval of the  Prime

Minister  to proceed.  He explained this fully in  the  press

conference.  There ought not to be any speculation.  One more

point - the Senior Minister, in all the negotiations, made it

clear  that  the  agreements and discussions that  had  taken

place  will,  of course, be subject to the agreement  of  the

Prime Minister.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE EXCHANGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Suspension of trading of Links shares)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister, in

the  light  of  the  recent disquiet over the  suspension  of

trading  of  certain  shares, what steps  will  be  taken  to

reassure  the  investing public that the  Singapore  Exchange

will  adequately  explain  (i)  the  circumstances  for   any

suspension  of  the trading of shares; (ii) the justification

for  the  period of suspension, if resumption is not  readily

contemplated; and (iii) how it attempts to treat all affected

shareholders fairly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if

the  Singapore Exchange rules need to be reviewed to make  it

more equitable in the light of the Links Island case.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I will take Question Nos.

7 and 8 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Trading in the shares of a company

listed  on  the Singapore Exchange (SGX) may be suspended  at

the request of the company or of the exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company may request that trading in its shares be

temporarily suspended before announcing material information,

to  give time for the information to be disseminated  to  the

investing public.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX may suspend trading in the shares of a particular

company  where  it  is likely that trading of  the  company's

shares  will  not  be conducted in a fair or orderly  manner.

This  may  occur,  for instance, where  a  company  fails  to

disclose   or   ensure  proper  dissemination   of   material

information  to  the  investing public.   Alternatively,  the

company's shares could be the subject of market manipulation.

SGX's  power  to suspend trading is necessary to protect  the

integrity   of  the  marketplace  and  safeguard   investors'

interests.   All major international exchanges operate  under

similar rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX suspended trading in Links shares on 16th August

2000,  after  the exchange's preliminary review  showed  that

trading in these shares had been irregular during the  period

leading up to 16th August 2000.  On the same day, SGX  issued

a   public  announcement,  stating  that  it  was  conducting

inquiries into whether a corner situation had arisen  in  the

counter.   SGX  also stated that the exchange  considered  it

appropriate  to impose a trading suspension in  view  of  the

irregular  market in Links shares and pending the outcome  of

the inquiries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once imposed, any trading suspension should be as short

as  possible  in order not to deprive market participants  of

liquidity.  But whether trading should be allowed  to  resume

depends  on  whether the concerns that led to the  suspension

being  imposed  in  the first instance have  been  addressed,

thereby allowing an informed and orderly market to prevail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Links, it was only after a thorough

investigation lasting nearly one year that SGX  was  able  to

conclude,  on  26th  July 2001, that a corner  situation  had

arisen  in  Links  shares in the period  leading  up  to  the

trading suspension.  As mentioned in SGX's press statement of

26th July 2001, the investigation was complicated by the need

to   examine  the  trades  of  more  than  50  parties,   the

significance  of  the  commercial and personal  relationships

among  them, and the cash flows and trading patterns  of  the

individuals and institutions that traded in Links shares.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SGX had allowed trading to resume before establishing

whether  Links  shares were cornered, it could  have  further

exposed investors to an irregular market in those shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, given the duration of the inquiries, the

exchange could have updated the investing public periodically

that the investigation was still ongoing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established that a corner situation had arisen in

Links  shares, SGX decided that all outstanding market trades

in Links shares transacted during 14th to 16th August 2000 be

settled  by  way  of cash instead of delivery,  at  the  fair

settlement  price  of  $1.21.  The fair settlement  price  is

intended  to  settle all outstanding market trades  in  Links

shares  done during the 3-day period in a manner that  would,

on  balance,  be  most  equitable to  all  parties  to  those

transactions.  This is not an easy task.  To be fair  to  all

persons  who traded in Links shares during those three  days,

the  settlement  procedure had to treat all contracts  alike,

regardless of whether they were done by investors  with  long

or   short   positions.   After  considering  the  particular

circumstances   of   this  case,  the  Settlement   Committee

determined that the weighted average price of Links shares on

14th, 15th and 16th August 2000 would be the most appropriate

fair settlement price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various alternatives for dealing with the outstanding

transactions  in Links shares have been suggested.   SGX  has

considered these proposals, and found them no better or  more

equitable than SGX's decision.  MAS concurs with SGX.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, one suggestion was to allow those sellers

who  hold Links shares to settle by delivery instead of cash,

and  apply  the  fair  settlement  procedure  only  to  short

sellers.  However, under this alternative, CDP would  not  be

able  to  treat  all buyers equally.  The  CDP  acts  as  the

central counterparty to both sellers and buyers in all market

trades.   If  a  seller elects to deliver Links shares  under

this proposal, CDP would have to deliver those shares to  the

buyers who contracted to buy those same shares.  On the other

hand, if a buyer has contracted to buy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>

Links  shares  from a short seller, the buyer would  have  to

contend  with  cash settlement at the fair settlement  price,

even  if  he  may  have preferred receiving Links  shares  in

settlement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another proposal was to lift the trading suspension on

Links   temporarily  so  that  investors  could  unwind   any

outstanding   positions  they  may  hold  in  Links   shares.

Proponents  of  this alternative point to SGX's reinstatement

of  trading in Malaysian stocks on CLOB International for two

weeks  after  the initial trading suspension,  which  allowed

investors  to square their positions before trading  on  CLOB

International was ceased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation is different. In the CLOB

International case, the trading of Malaysian stocks continued

on  the KLSE and there was no suspicion of a false market  in

those  stocks.   But in the Links case, the company's  shares

had been cornered, and there could have been no assurance  of

a fair and orderly market in those shares if trading had been

resumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commercial Affairs Department is currently

investigating whether criminal offences had been committed in

relation  to trading in Links shares.  If any of the  persons

under  investigation is convicted, he will be liable  to  pay

compensation to those aggrieved investors in Links who traded

with  him.   The  affected  investors  can  seek  such  legal

recourse any time within six years of an offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This criminal prosecution regime will be complemented by

a  civil  penalty  and civil claim regime when  the  proposed

Securities and Futures Act (SFA) comes into force.   MAS  can

already  institute an action for civil penalties in  relation

to  insider trading.  This will be extended under the new Act

to  other  forms of market misconduct such as market rigging,

the employment of fraud or deceit in trading, and failure  to

make continuous disclosure of material information.  Further,

the  offender  will be liable for civil damages to  investors

who  suffer losses as a result of the market abuse.   Instead

of having to institute their own legal action, aggrieved

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>

investors  can  file within six years of the offence,  claims

for  compensation with the Court on the strength of  criminal

convictions or civil penalties imposed by MAS.  Under the new

regime,  MAS  will also have enhanced enforcement  powers  in

investigating suspected offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors should analyse information and understand the

fundamentals  before they invest.   Investors who  intend  to

trade  heavily in a counter which has doubled or  tripled  in

price  within a short period of time for no apparent  reason,

should  recognise the risks involved and consider whether  it

is  within  their means and risk appetite to do  so.   Market

intermediaries who extended credit to such investors must  be

prepared for the consequences if the counter is suspended and

later declared cornered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  DPM  whether the new Securities and Futures Act will  be

made retroactive in the Links case.  In other words, will the

civil penalties be made retroactive in the Links case?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

somewhere in the new Bill [indicating].  He will get  a  copy

later  after  the First Reading.  I think it depends  on  the

date on which the original criminal penalties are imposed and

on  the date on which the conviction takes place, if there is

a  conviction.  And if that is after the Act is enacted, then

the  civil  penalty can follow from there.   But  I  am  just

speaking from first principles.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT RESERVES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Target for optimum amount)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister whether

the  Government  has  any target for  an  optimum  amount  of

reserves and, if so, has it achieved the optimum.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this question has been asked several times  in

the past, but let me explain again the Government's policy on

reserves.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally accepted internationally that countries

should  have foreign hard currency reserves of between  three

to six months of imports.  Depending on a country's degree of

economic self-sufficiency, reserves at these levels should be

sufficient  to  support  a  temporary  dislocation   in   the

country's economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, with its high dependency on

imports, our level of reserves should clearly be in the upper

bound  of  the  three  to  six months'  range  and  more,  if

possible.   Our current official foreign reserves  of  around

US$75 billion is equivalent to about seven months of imports.

However,  as  a  country without natural resources,  our  aim

should  be to accumulate, over time, as much reserves  as  we

can  afford  to  do  so without over-taxing  our  people  and

without  denying  ourselves  the expenditures  necessary  for

economic  growth.  Over the years, Mr Chiam will have  noted,

Government has lowered personal, corporate and property taxes

substantially  in  order to stimulate growth.   At  the  same

time,  the  Government has spent many billions of dollars  to

build  up  world class infrastructures in health,  education,

housing and transportation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also point out that our reserves cannot be

allowed to remain static.  It must increase in line with  our

GDP  growth.   As  our population grows and our  standard  of

living  increases with economic growth, so will  our  imports

grow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can the Minister tell us

whether, other than the three to six months of imports, there

are any other reasons for having such high surpluses?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Other reasons have already been

said  in the past.  The Senior Minister had said, when  asked

questions  about  the assets managed by GIC,  that  Singapore

needs   large   reserves  to  defend  our  currency   against

speculative attacks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, are there other reasons than

defending our currency against speculative attacks?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not know specifically what

he  is  asking.   I think it is good to have  large  reserves

anyway.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, we have heard that the reserves

have been used for upgrading of HDB flats and because of  the

downturn,  there were not enough reserves, the  upgrading  of

HDB flats was held back.  Are these some of the reasons?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am afraid Mr Chiam is

mistaken.  The upgrading programme was funded from surpluses.

And when the surplus moves up and down, the programme will be

adjusted accordingly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Are reserves not actually from the

surpluses that we have?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Part of it, yes, of course,

those which we have not spent.  When we have surpluses beyond

what we need, during times of good economic growth, this will

be added to our reserves for a rainy day.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Therefore, the surpluses and

reserves are tied.  They are the same, are they not?  If  you

have got less surpluses, that means you have got less to  put

into the reserves?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Budget surpluses only account

for  part  of  it.   Our land sales are also  transferred  to

reserves. That is the other large component.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Minister for Finance

clarify  the Government's position on the reserves?   Is  the

Government saying that no matter under what circumstances, it

will  never  touch the reserves, or would it,  under  certain

circumstances, dig into the reserves?  If so, what  would  be

the circumstances?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The circumstances would probably

be  what  we are facing now.  The reserves would be available

for  use  if there should be a major economic dislocation  in

the world affecting us.  The size of that is not something we

can  pre-determine but it is a bulwark which we can fall back

on.  I can assure the Member that it is not the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>

intention  to lock up our reserves permanently but it  should

be used with discretion and care.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if I am not mistaken, our

reserve  is in S$139 billion now.  Is this not in  excess  of

six months' imports?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not know where you get such

a figure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It was published in the papers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Who publishes it? Singapore

dollars  probably.    Mr  Chiam  See  Tong:   Yes,  Singapore

dollars.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I was talking about US$75

billion.   This  is  probably equivalent to  your  figure  in

Singapore dollars.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, would you like to ask your next

Question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I ask one more question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, assuming that we exceed seven

months'  imports,  do we still continue to collect  money  to

increase the reserves?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I thought I had answered that

question.  I said that we should accumulate as much as we can

afford   above  the  seven  months,  because  of  our   great

dependency   on  imports.   We  have  no  natural   resources

whatsoever.  If there should be a prolonged downturn, then  I

think every cent we put aside would become very useful. There

is  no limit.  We are talking about putting aside as much  as

we can without affecting our ability to finance our needs and

without taxing the people unnecessarily.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I clarify with the Minister

that, in fact, seven months'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>

imports  is  only  a  guideline, and there  is  no  limit  to

collections for our reserves?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I have said that several times.

I do not know why he needs elaboration.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN CONSULTANTS TO GOVERNMENT AND/OR STATUTORY BOARDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number and fees paid)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister for the

period  from  1997 to the present date, (a) how many  foreign

consultants  have  the  Government  and/or  statutory  boards

consulted; and (b) what were the fees paid to them.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Government is constantly  grappling  with

new,  complex  issues  in  a  rapidly  changing  environment.

Ministries  and statutory boards engage external  consultants

when they lack internal expertise and experience in these new

issues,  or when an external view will be helpful.   External

consultants  can bring knowledge of best practices  from  all

over the world.  In some cases, such as the liberalisation of

the   telecommunications  and  power   industries,   external

consultants  have  acquired considerable  proprietary  expert

knowledge,  gained from having worked on similar projects  in

other  countries. They can therefore provide valuable  inputs

to Government agencies formulating policies to meet our needs

and conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government does not track how many external

consultants  Ministries or statutory boards  engage,  or  how

many  of  these consultants are foreign.  Government agencies

make  no  distinction  between local or foreign  consultants.

Consultancy contracts are awarded to the vendor who  is  best

qualified to do the job and offers the best value for  money,

usually  through an open tender.  Consulting firms  typically

work in teams which include both foreigners and Singaporeans,

based on their individual competencies and what is needed  to

deliver the job.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the key part of my Question has

not been answered.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since we do not

track all of the individual contracts for consultants,  I  do

not have a total tally.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does the Government have the same

problem as the recent problem in Thailand where the Ministers

over  there objected to the high fees to be paid to a foreign

consultant there?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure

whether  in  Thailand the Minister or the MP complained.   In

Singapore,  when we engage consultants or when we  spend  any

Government  money, it is a very careful decision.  There  are

tender procedures which have to be followed.  We must satisfy

ourselves that this is money spent on a good purpose which is

worthwhile   doing  and  furthermore,  that  the   price   is

reasonable.   There  are procedures for approving  all  these

Government expenditures.  If it is going to be very large  or

likely  to  be contentious, the Cabinet is aware of  it,  and

there  have not been cases where the Cabinet has argued  over

whether it is worth spending the money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can the Minister tell us whether or

not they have paid consultants up to $1.5 million at a time?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I do not have an off-hand answer,

but  I  would  not  be surprised if we have  had  consultancy

projects  which are worth more than that.  For example,  when

we  first designed the MRT system, we engaged several sets of

consultants  and  I  imagine we must have paid  them  several

million dollars.

<div align="center"><b>(Use for advertisement purposes)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister,

in  view  of  recent  changes  to  the  Banking  Act  and  of

consolidation  within the banking sector, whether  there  are

any restrictions on the use of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>

banks'   names  and  corporate  signages  on  buildings   for

advertisement purposes.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, up to now, MAS has

not allowed banks to exercise naming rights to buildings,  or

display  their corporate signages on buildings,  unless  they

own  at  least 50% of the building.  This is to minimise  the

risk of depositors misunderstanding that these buildings  are

assets  of  the  bank, and will be available to  meet  claims

should the bank encounter problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has reviewed this policy and decided that it is no

longer  necessary.    The  public should  not  associate  the

ownership of a building with a bank's financial strength.   A

bank's  strength lies in the size and quality of its  overall

operations. Buildings are likely to constitute only  a  small

percentage of a bank's total assets, especially in  the  case

of  foreign banks.  Bank supervisors in most other  countries

also do not impose any such restriction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks are henceforth free to negotiate with owners of

buildings  for naming rights, and to seek approval  from  URA

for  displaying  signages on buildings, just like  any  other

business.  They no longer need to consult MAS in either case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  research  on  stem  cells  from  human  embryos  has

proceeded in Singapore and, if so, whether there has been due

consideration of the moral and religious dimensions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

in  Singapore, the practice of human embryology and  in-vitro

fertilization  (IVF) is regulated under  the  "Guidelines  on

Human   Embryology   and   the   Practice   of   Reproductive

Technologies in Singapore" issued by the Ministry of Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All current embryonic stem cell research has been done

in accordance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>

with  these  guidelines  and  with  internationally  accepted

guidelines.  Ethical approval is required from the respective

institutional  ethics committees operating within  the  broad

Ethical  Policies and Guidelines set out by the  Ministry  of

Health  with  the  advice  of  the  National  Medical  Ethics

Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers at the National University of Singapore, in

collaboration with researchers in Australia and Israel,  were

able  to  develop 6 stem-cell lines which were  derived  from

excess  frozen embryos donated to medical research by couples

who  underwent  IVF  treatment.  These  excess  embryos  were

donated   voluntarily  with  the  patients'  signed  informed

consent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the process of reviewing our embryonic stem

cell  research  regulations.   In  November  last  year,  the

Bioethics  Advisory  Committee (BAC)  was  appointed  by  the

Government  to  address the ethical, legal and social  issues

arising from research on human biology and behaviour and  its

applications.  The  BAC  has  been  actively  addressing  and

deliberating  on  the  issue  of human  embryonic  stem  cell

research.  Among other things, it has received a report  from

an  Inter-Ministry  Committee set up to explore  the  ethical

issues  involved in cloning and stem cell research.  The  BAC

also  regularly  consults  with  an  International  Panel  of

Experts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BAC will finalise its views after consultations with

the  community,  including the general  public  and  interest

groups,  through  dialogue sessions and  forums  as  well  as

further international consultation.  The BAC will submit  its

recommendations to the Life Sciences Ministerial Committee by

the end of the year.

an  assessment of  the extent of the threat, if any, posed by

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  the recent tragic events in America underscore  the

threat posed by terrorism.  Singapore is an open society  and

must   remain  mindful  of  our  vulnerabilities  to  ethnic,

ideological and religious tensions and conflicts in our multi-racial  and multi-religious society.   Our national  security

and continued peaceful and harmonious way of life are exposed

to threats from domestic as well as external forces.  Members

will  recall  that  Singapore was  the  stage  for  terrorist

actions by foreign elements in the Laju incident of 1974 and,

more recently, the hijack of SQ 117 in 1991.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have not found any domestic group to be

involved  in politically motivated violence, we are conscious

of the possibility for local groups, even if only a minority,

to be influenced or misled into participating in an agenda of

violence purveyed by external extremist groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internal Security Department and the Singapore

Police Force monitor racial and religious extremism and other

security  threats closely.  Appropriate action will be  taken

against any group that threatens national security or law and

order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an increasingly inter-connected world, the scourge of

<div align="center"><b>RALLIES IN PUBLIC STADIUM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Employment of CISCO guards)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  why is there a need for organisers of public rallies

held in a public stadium to employ CISCO guards to be present

at such rallies where

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>

there is no imminent danger of a breach of the peace.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, Mr Chiam

is  probably  referring  to the condition  for  CISCO  guards

employed for the public rally the Singapore Democratic  Party

(SDP) held on 23rd September 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this condition is not new. Other organisers of

mass   public  events  have  complied  with  it.   Any  event

involving large crowds of people has the potential to lead to

law and order problems.  The safety of those attending is  of

paramount importance.  Hence, it is a standard condition that

Police  imposes  on  the organiser of any event  involving  a

large  crowd  of people to employ the necessary resources  to

maintain the orderly conduct of the event.  This condition is

imposed not only on events organised by all political parties

but  applies  also  to  other mass events  such  as  football

matches and rock concerts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in approving the application by SDP, the Police had

specified  a minimum number of CISCO officers to be  present.

These officers have the necessary police powers to deal  with

any  potential law and order problem.  The number of officers

required was determined after a ground recce Police conducted

with the organisers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a professional matter which the Police is

well equipped to handle.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can the Minister of State cite

one example of a rally where there was law and order problem?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the purpose of having

CISCO  guards  is  to  prevent law and order  problems.   The

presence  of  CISCO guards, for example, will deter  trouble-makers  from  coming to the stadium and, indeed if  they  are

there,  from creating trouble.  I am sure Mr Chiam must  know

that  political  rallies do elicit emotional responses.   You

get  all kinds of people who are attending.  You get speakers

making speeches which are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>

probably  critical and attacking policies and  so  forth.   I

think  we should be on the safe side.  Mr Chiam is a  veteran

of  many  political campaigns and of many general  elections.

I am sure he has seen political rallies where there have been

such  high  emotions.  Indeed in past elections,  there  have

been   rallies,  particularly  of  Opposition  parties,  that

attracted  thousands  of people, and some  people  have  been

unruly.  So I think we should be on the safe side.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I attended many rallies but I

think  there should be a distinction between election rallies

where  the  fever  runs  very high and non-election  rallies.

These  days,  it  is difficult even to get interest  in  such

rallies.  So how can there be law and order problems?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Chiam should not complain

that  it is difficult in getting people to be interested.   I

think  it all depends on the party that is holding the rally.

If  they have interesting speakers and they are able to  hold

the  participants' interest, there could be a high  interest.

It is the intrinsic nature of political rallies.  Like I have

said,  it  is the nature of the speeches being made  and  the

fact  that the audience can be a mixed audience  -  some  are

supporting you, some are not.  So I think it is better to  be

safe than sorry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would the Police impose the

same  condition  of requiring CISCO guards during  elections?

Secondly,  why  is  the  Police or  the  Government  treating

political  parties  the   same  as  any  other  organisation?

Basically,  political  parties hold  rallies  to  disseminate

certain  information  and  to institute  public  debate.   By

imposing  the  condition of requiring  the  hiring  of  CISCO

guards,  does  the Minister of State not think that  it  will

restrict   the  ability  of  political  parties  to  organise

rallies,  given  the fact that it costs a  lot  of  money  to

employ CISCO guards?  Is this one way to restrict and curtail

the  ability  of  the  Opposition in having  activities  like

rallies and dissemination of information?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first of all, the general

election  (GE)  is  a national event.  So  political  rallies

during GE do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>

require the hiring of CISCO guards.  The Police takes  charge

of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that Police takes a professional

attitude towards all these events, whether it is organised by

any political party or by any other organisers where there is

potential  law  and  order problem.   It  is  a  professional

judgment that must be made because, ultimately, law and order

must  be  maintained.  Like I have said, in  particular,  for

political  rallies,  given the nature  of  the  topics  being

raised  and  the  mixed crowd involved,  Police  professional

judgment is that there is potential for law and order problem

and  hence the need for CISCO guards.  Like I have said, this

is  not  just for political rallies but also for other events

as  well.  For the Singapore International Marathon  and  the

recent  football  international match between  Singapore  and

Liverpool, Police made the same judgment.  This is not to say

that  we  are trying to prevent the Opposition from  reaching

out  to their supporters and Singaporeans, because there  are

many  other ways of doing it.  And indeed Opposition  parties

are doing it through various means  -  Internet, publications

and  so  forth.    To  require  political  parties,  in  this

context,  the  SDP, to pay about $3,400 for 13 CISCO  guards,

which  works  out  to about $65 per hour per  officer  is,  I

think,  not  asking too much.  I am sure any  organiser  will

want to avert any problems, because that will also reflect on

the organisation.

<div align="center"><b>BUKIT PANJANG LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Service disruptions and accidents)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Communications

and Information Technology (a) why is the Bukit Panjang Light

Rail  Transit still encountering frequent service disruptions

and  accidents despite 20 months of rectification works since

its  opening; and (b) what are the measures taken  to  ensure

the safety and convenience of LRT commuters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the launch of

the   Bukit   Panjang  LRT  system  on  6th  November   1999,

improvements have been made to the hardware and  software  of

the  system  to improve service availability.  The  operator,

SLRT,  has  also  continued  to improve  its  operations  and

maintenance  procedures and processes over this period.   The

number  of  service disruptions lasting more than 20  minutes

reduced  sharply  from  35  in  the  first  eight  months  of

operation to 7 in the following six months. This year, up  to

now, 6 such service disruptions have occurred; unfortunately,

the  last 2 occurred within seven days of each other, on 29th

August   and  6th  September.   The  second  disruption   was

consequential to the first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system has, on the whole, stabilised, and the

service  availability target of 99.7%,  which  translates  to

service  disruption of not more than 4 minutes over a 20-hour

daily operation, has been achieved on most days over the past

12 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has completed its investigations into the cause of

the service disruption on 29th August and 6th September.  The

disruption  on  29th  August was due  to  a  minor  technical

problem.   A  permanent solution to prevent a recurrence  has

been  installed.   However, LTA is of the  opinion  that  the

disruption  on 6th September was a result of shortcomings  in

the repair work carried out by the operator to rectify damage

sustained  during the 29th August incident.  LTA  intends  to

impose  a  penalty  on  SLRT for the  6th  September  service

disruption.

.     The frequency of the recent service disruptions is  not

acceptable.   The  LRT  operator  is  required  to  meet  the

standards  for  service  quality,  safety,  maintenance   and

operation  prescribed  by LTA in its  Licence  and  Operating

Agreement.  Penalties are imposed when the operator fails  to

meet a standard.  I have asked LTA to review and tighten  the

penalty framework in order to spur the operator to devise the

necessary  preventive and corrective maintenance  regimes  to

avoid

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>

severe  delays.  I understand that SLRT is now  working  with

the  system supplier to see how its operation and maintenance

regimes can be further improved.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

of State what are the world-class performance standards which

the  Ministry has set for the LRT?  Also, since the  Ministry

is  not  happy  with  the  LRT's performance,  what  kind  of

deadline  has been given to the SLRT to improve  the  system?

Will  the  Ministry also consider setting up a  committee  to

conduct  a  safety audit of the system?  What is the  redress

available   to   LRT   commuters  who  have   suffered   much

inconvenience  and financial loss?  Many residents  in  Bukit

Panjang  have  to  take taxis to work  as  a  result  of  the

disruptions.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I have explained

earlier,  the  requirement for the  service  availability  to

attain  99.7% is a very high standard.  So this is of  world-class standards.  The safety and reliability aspects are  all

benchmarked  against world standards.  As for the time-frame,

LRT  has been improving since it begins operation.  It is not

unusual   for   train   operations  to  experience   problems

initially,  even for MRT.  When it first started, there  were

problems.   And  these  problems  will  get  less  and   less

frequent.  Even today, MRT also encounters problems from time

to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the audit, as a first step, we have SLRT to work

with the system supplier and, if need be, we will bring in  a

consultant  to do an audit.  I do not know whether  Mr  Chiam

will be happy about that.  But, if necessary, we will do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for redress, SLRT has provided free bus services

during  the  disruptions.   So if there  is  any  claim  from

residents, who were affected by the service disruptions, they

can claim back from the operator.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State

whether  the  Ministry  will also  consider  asking  SLRT  to

install railings on the track.  Because when the train stops,

the  commuters  will  have to walk along  the  track  to  the

respective stations, and it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>

quite dangerous to walk along the track.  So presently it  is

without railings on both sides.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> I will ask the operator to

consider that.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Can I ask the Minister of

State,  when  he  claims  that  the  LRT  is  of  world-class

standards,  but the Member for Sembawang is complaining  that

there  are  so  many  frequent breakdowns,  what  world-class

standard are we talking about?  Secondly, can I find out from

the  Minister  of  State,  besides the  penalty  that  he  is

imposing,  whether  it  would be  better  if  we  allow  some

competition  by other operators to the system, like  allowing

supplementary bus services, Scheme B buses, to  run  to  meet

with such contingency?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, obviously, the Member has

not listened to the answer that I have given earlier.  I told

him  that  the results of the last 20 months' operation  have

shown  quick  improvement.  We have attained  the  target  of

99.7%  service  reliability.   If  this  is  not  world-class

standard, what is it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as competition is concerned, this issue has

been  raised in the House and the Minister has said  that  we

are  reviewing  it  and we will make an announcement  in  due

course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

confirm what I have heard.  Did the Minister of State mention

that  commuters who were affected by the disruptions are free

to  go  to SLRT for monetary claims right now?  Can I confirm

that?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I am talking about the

fares  that they have incurred.  Yes, if they have paid,  for

instance, a dollar or 60 cents, they could approach SLRT.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I believe the question asked

was  whether they could claim the difference, the  taxi  fare

that they have incurred.  So I think it is better that it  be

clarified because it may be assumed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>

that they can claim the additional fare that they incurred on

taxi.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The fares I am talking about

are the fares they have paid to take the SLRT.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC BUS AND MRT/LRT COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Merger)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology  if  his  Ministry

will  work  towards the merger of all public bus and  MRT/LRT

companies  to  gain economies of scale and provide  commuters

with  a  more integrated and cost efficient public  transport

system.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as   our  public  transport  operators  are  publicly  listed

companies, they make their own commercial decisions  when  it

comes to issues of merger.  However, while the merger of  all

public   transport  operators  (PTOs)  may  provide   greater

economies  of  scale, it is in the interest  of  the  general

public  for sufficient competition to exist in the  industry.

Competition  ensures  that the PTOs will  strive  to  improve

their   service  and  provide  better  value  for  money   to

commuters.  The proposed merger of SMRT and TIBS will  result

in  a  multi-modal transport operator, while SBS will be  the

second multi-modal operator next year when it commissions and

operates   the  North  East  Line.   These  two   multi-modal

operators  will be well positioned to provide integrated  and

seamless travel to commuters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Can I ask the

Minister  whether  he  can consider  it  a  competition  when

commuters do not have a choice, whether they are being served

by  SBS  or  TIBS?   They have to live with whichever  public

transport  company runs the route along where  they  live  or

want to use?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> In our case, by competition, we

mean  to provide a benchmark for comparison.  So if you  have

only  one  operator, like what the Member is proposing,  then

really  we  do not have comparisons as to the efficiency  and

service levels, whether they have put in the best, and so on.

But  if we have two, then we can clearly compare, and I think

that is a good thing to have.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, can I ask the Minister of

State, when he is talking about world-class transport, are we

comparing internally or are we comparing with the rest of the

world to be the best in the world?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> When we say "world class", of

course, we compare ourselves with the best in the world.  But

how  do you achieve that?  If we have comparison between  two

operators  in  Singapore, that also gives us  assurance  that

they are doing the right thing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Would the Minister consider that

Singapore  being  very  small and if  there  is  one  company

sharing  resources, just like the banks are being  encouraged

to merge and share resources and skills, we will have an even

better  public transport system?  After all, many of the  big

cities  of  the world do not have too many bus  companies  or

transport companies operating in those cities.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member

that  there  is  economy  of scale if  you  have  got  a  big

operation.   But  there  are also the  disadvantages  of  the

operator being the only operator, ie, being complacent and so

on.   So  I  think our approach of managed competition  is  a

correct one.  I would not support a situation where you  have

numerous operators and that would also not be good.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister of State said that we

need  some  competition  in order to set  benchmark,  and  he

mentioned  two.   I  wonder  why  two  competitors  will   be

considered  as a benchmark.  Why not three or four?   And  he

mentioned about managed competition.  Would he explain to  us

what does he mean by "managed competition"?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> To have this comparison, you

must have at least two.  Whether three or four, depending  on

the  size of the market again, if you have too many, you  may

have the problem that Mr Thomas mentioned about, ie, lack  of

economy of scale.  As I have said, we are reviewing it and we

will make a decision in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why it is called managed competition as opposed to

free  competition, it is because we do not allow  players  to

just  freely  come  in.  So that is the meaning  of  "managed

competition".

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> One last question. Mr Thomas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want the

Minister to clarify, because I do not understand.  If  it  is

managed  competition  with two, why can  it  not  be  managed

competition with one?  Since we always say that we are  short

of  players, we have a concentration of players to give  even

better services.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, may I ask the Member: how

do you compete with only one player?

<div align="center"><b>HANDPHONES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Health risks)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Health (a)

whether  the use of handphones will pose any health risks  to

phone users; (b) how are handphones tested to ensure they are

safe  for  use in Singapore; and (c) will boosting  handphone

stations and antennae pose health risks to residents  staying

near such facilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Health Sciences

Authority  (HSA) had issued comprehensive Health  and  Safety

Guidelines  on  Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) on  16th  August

2001.  These guidelines are based on the latest status of the

World  Health  Organisation (WHO) EMF Project  which  is  the

international benchmark for research in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While noting that research is in progress, international

scientific committees that have evaluated the current

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>

body  of  evidence,  have reached the same  conclusion:  that

there  are  no established health effects from EMF  exposures

below these internationally set guideline limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to question (b), the Infocomm Development

Authority  of Singapore (IDA) gives type approval  of  mobile

phones.  Part of this type approval includes radiation safety

standards  and the requirement for manufacturers  to  provide

their Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value for mobile phones.

So   these   radiation   safety  standards   are   based   on

international safety standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to question (c), mobile cellular base stations

are  commonly installed in both indoor and outdoor locations.

They function to provide mobile cellular subscribers with the

required  mobile service coverage.  When the mobile operators

install   more  base  stations  to  improve  mobile  cellular

services   coverage  for  their  subscribers,  this  actually

reduces the transmitting power by which the mobile phones and

base stations operate at.  So the bottomline is the more base

stations  we  have,  the lower the power, and  therefore  the

safer it is.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I ask the Minister: why is the HSA

so  sure that handphone radiation will not cause cancer  when

WHO is actually still studying the issue?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The position is not different from

WHO.   We are saying that based on current studies, we follow

WHO's standards.  And WHO's standards say that while they are

still  studying the long-term effects, it is safe to use  the

handphone.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I ask the Minister on his view on

one  recent  report  in  the UK.  It  was  reported  on  21st

September  2001  by  Dr Alan Preece, Head  of  Biophysics  at

Bristol Oncology Centre, that mobile phones may cause  damage

to health by speeding up the brain's response times.  What is

his view on that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I will get the report and ask my

officers to study it.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, several

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the desire of individuals who wish to have

the  flexibility  to  use  their CPF  savings  for  part-time

allow  CPF  for local full-time tertiary education,  we  have

received many requests to liberalise the CPF Education Scheme

to  cover  overseas  education, part-time  courses,  distance

learning, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is meant for a member's retirement, housing and

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this year's National Day Rally, the Prime Minister

announced   that  the  Ministry  of  Health  will   introduce

Eldershield, an affordable severe disability

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>

insurance  scheme  to provide insurance coverage  to  elderly

Singaporeans who require long-term care.  The details of  the

Eldershield insurance scheme was released by the Ministry  of

Health on 24th August this year.  The Ministry of Health  had

decided  to  allow CPF members to use their Medisave  savings

for  the  Eldershield  premiums.  It had  also  designed  the

Eldershield insurance scheme to operate as an opt-out  scheme

to attain as wide a coverage as possible.  To provide for the

use  of Medisave for Eldershield premium, the CPF Act has  to

be amended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, the CPF Act allows the withdrawal of

Medisave savings to pay for the premiums of medical insurance

schemes  such  as Medishield, NTUC Income's Incomeshield  and

AIA's Healthshield.  Such schemes are defined as insurance to

reimburse  the  CPF members' hospitalisation  expenses.   The

Eldershield  is  a severe disability insurance  scheme  which

provides coverage for long-term care, including home care and

does  not  cover  hospitalisation expenses.  Hence,  the  CPF

(Amendment)  Bill  before the House today  introduces  a  new

provision to allow CPF members to use their Medisave  savings

to  pay  for  premiums  of  any healthcare  insurance  scheme

approved  by the Minister for Health.  For those who  do  not

have  enough  Medisave  savings, they can  use  the  Medisave

savings  of their spouse, children, parents or grandchildren.

This will give CPF members greater flexibility in using their

Medisave  savings  to pay for approved healthcare  insurance,

including  the  Eldershield.  Sir, this is in line  with  the

Ministry  of  Health's  objective of expanding  the  role  of

healthcare   insurance  to  meet  the  healthcare   cost   of

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Eldershield will operate as an opt-out scheme.

The  Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that the  opt-out

age  will be set at age 40 and the maximum entry age will  be

set  at 70.  A special one-off exercise will be conducted for

Singaporeans aged between 40 and 69 to decide whether to opt-out of Eldershield.  MOH has also announced that to encourage

greater private sector participation in the severe disability

insurance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>

market, they will tender out Eldershield to private insurers.

To  enable  private  insurers to  operate  opt-out  insurance

schemes,  the  CPF Board will need to provide these  insurers

with  certain  information.  Hence, the Bill  also  seeks  to

amend  the CPF Act to allow the CPF Board to release relevant

information  to  an  insurer administering  or  operating  an

approved insurance scheme, without the need for authorisation

by  the Medisave account holder.  In the case of Eldershield,

for  example,  MOH  would  require  the  CPF  Board  to  pass

information  such as the names, addresses and gender  of  CPF

members  aged between 40 and 69, to the approved insurers  to

facilitate the running of the scheme.  For those who did  not

opt out of Eldershield but have insufficient Medisave balance

to pay for the premiums, the insurance companies have to know

the  premium shortfall so that they could request  these  CPF

members to top up the outstanding balance by cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF members may ask what are the safeguards and

prevention of possible abuses of such information disclosure.

I  would  like  to  reassure hon. Members  that  CPF  account

details would be safeguarded.  For Eldershield, only the  CPF

member's name, address, gender and premium shortfall, if any,

will be released to the insurer.  Insurers will not have free

access to CPF members' account details. For the vast majority

of  members  who  have  enough  Medisave  to  pay  for  their

Eldershield  premium, information on their  Medisave  account

balance  will  not be released to the insurer.   The  insurer

will  know  only  when a CPF member does not have  sufficient

Medisave  for  the Eldershield premium to be deducted.   This

makes  it convenient for CPF members, as they do not need  to

separately  check whether they have sufficient  Medisave  for

Eldershield premium.  As Medisave savings can be used to  pay

for  hospitalisation  expenses and other  approved  insurance

premium  payments,  releasing  information  on  the  member's

Eldershield  premium  shortfall  is  not  indicative  of  the

savings  that  he  has  accumulated over  the  years  in  his

Medisave account.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments also stipulate that the

insurer  may  not use the information for any  other  purpose

other than for those connected with the administration of the

scheme.   The  insurance companies will  not  be  allowed  to

divulge  such  confidential information  to  their  insurance

agents  or other parties for any other purposes.  An  insurer

who   misuses   or   wrongfully   communicates   confidential

information  will  be  guilty  of  an  offence.   Under   the

Statutory  Bodies  and  Government Companies  (Protection  of

Secrecy) Act, the insurer shall be liable on conviction to  a

fine  not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term  not

exceeding  12  months,  or to both, and  under  the  Official

Secrets Act, the insurer shall be liable on conviction  to  a

fine not exceeding $2,000 and to imprisonment for a term  not

exceeding  two  years.  I would like to reiterate  that  only

information that is essential for the administration  of  the

approved  healthcare  insurance will be  passed  to  approved

private  insurance companies, and that the approved insurance

companies  will  be required to use the information  strictly

for  the  purpose of enrolling Singaporeans in  the  approved

healthcare insurance schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, this is a straightforward Bill

and  the  provisions are very good.  I would like to  support

it.  But I have a few questions for the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the CPF Board counsel those CPF members who

want  to opt out of the Eldershield scheme, considering  that

this  is  a good scheme for them?  On the supply and  use  of

information  on  any  member that  the  insurer  requires,  I

welcome  the  Minister's assurance that the  Government  will

take  very  seriously any misuse of information.  But  it  is

very  important to every account holder that the  information

about him is not divulged to third parties.  So I would  like

to ask the Minister how would the Government ensure that such

information on the account holders is not divulged  to  third

parties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there plans by the Government to widen further the

use  of  CPF  savings  by account holders  to  buy  insurance

policies  and any other schemes that would help  workers  and

benefit  their elderly parents to make full use of their  CPF

savings?   Would the Minister inform the House of the  number

of  active CPF account holders who use their CPF savings  for

monthly premiums for insurance schemes other than the schemes

approved  or  administered  by the  Ministry  of  Health  and

related  agencies?   Would  the CPF  Board  advise  both  the

account  holders as well as the insurers, if  the  Board  has

reasons to believe that, in some other insurance scheme,  the

CPF  member  may  not have the means to pay,  using  his  CPF

balance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very important to ensure that CPF members do

not  overuse their CPF balances which could result  in  their

not  having  the full benefits of the insurance schemes  that

they  have  signed  up  for, if they have  to  terminate  the

service  only  on  account  of their  inability  to  pay  the

premium.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, when I read the Bill, my

concern was the loss of confidentiality of the CPF member  in

regard  to  his CPF account.  I have just heard the  Minister

say that there are good preventive measures against insurance

companies  abusing  their  ability  to  have  access  to  CPF

accounts.  But from what I read here, the insurance companies

do not only have access to the main account of the CPF member

but   also  including  information  relating  to  the  amount

standing  to  his credit in his Medisave account.   In  other

words, they not only have access to the Medisave account, but

also  to  the  other accounts.  So maybe the  Minister  could

clarify on that point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister has thought of any other

schemes  whereby  CPF  members could approach  the  insurance

company  and it could tell them whether or not they  qualify,

rather  than for the insurance company to be given a  blanket

right  to look into CPF accounts.  Sir, I know the CPF  Board

is  very strict on this point.  Even we, as lawyers, have  no

access to our clients' CPF accounts.  If we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>

want  to know what is in our CPF accounts, sometimes when  we

need  to  know  that,  we have to get  the  member's  written

consent  or  authority  before we can  have  a  look  at  his

account.  So perhaps the Minister could assure the House that

this  access to CPF accounts is definitely not likely  to  be

abused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard the Minister saying that insurance

companies  wanting to participate in this scheme are  subject

to  tenders.   I hope that the Government shall  be  fair  in

approving insurance companies which wish to run this  scheme,

and  not  only  to  give  a  few select  preferred  insurance

companies to have the monopoly of the business.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members

who support the Bill.  I will now answer the questions raised

by both Mr Hawazi and Mr Chiam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked whether the CPF Board will help to

counsel  members so that they do not opt out of  the  scheme.

Certainly, when the Ministry of Health launches this  one-off

exercise to ask those aged above 40 and up to age 69  whether

they are going to opt out or not, we will participate in  the

process of educating and informing our CPF members.  We  will

urge  them  not  to  opt  out recklessly.   This  is  a  good

insurance scheme.  Eldershield will help to provide for their

old  age.  About 8% of the elderly population will be in need

of such assistance.  So it will be good for these people.  It

will  be  good for us.  We do not know when we may be  struck

down by a disease or an ailment that requires long-term care.

So  it  is  a  very affordable insurance scheme  and  members

should   not   just   opt  out  without  making   a   careful

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked whether the CPF Board would ensure

that  the  information would not be used for other  purposes,

just   like   Mr  Chiam  also  raised  the  same   point   on

confidentiality.   In  my  Second  Reading  speech,  I   have

addressed this point.  The Board is very concerned  and  well

aware  of  its responsibility as trustees to the CPF  members

for  their  CPF savings.  We do not unnecessarily reveal  any

information concerning members' accounts.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to access to members' particulars provided

for  in  this Amendment Bill, we are only limiting it to  the

Medisave  account,  because it  is  related  to  the  use  of

Medisave to pay for the premiums for Eldershield.  So we will

not allow the insurance companies to have direct access to  a

member's  CPF  account in toto.  For instance, the  insurance

companies will not have access to the balance in his Ordinary

account.  Also, to further safeguard confidentiality, we will

not  be  conveying  to  the insurance  company  the  member's

balance position in his Medisave.  As I have explained in  my

Second  Reading  Bill,  our  intention  is  to  expedite  the

operation  of this Eldershield insurance scheme  to  make  it

easy.  If we have too many requirements, the cost of managing

the  insurance will go up, and premiums will, therefore, have

to go up.  We want to make it affordable by designing it as a

simple, workable and pragmatic insurance scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are going to do is only to inform the insurance

company when the member's account balance falls below what is

required  for  him  to  pay  the premium.   So,  knowing  the

anniversary date of his Eldershield policy, that we will have

to  deduct  a  certain  amount of money for  the  Eldershield

premium, and knowing from our records that he does not have a

sufficient  balance in his account, we will then  inform  the

insurance company that so-and-so does not have enough to  pay

the  full premium and that it will have to collect from  him,

say,  "X" dollars in cash, to make up for the premium so that

the  policy  does  not  lapse.  In that  sense,  we  are  not

revealing all the information concerning the Medisave account

to the insurance company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my Second Reading speech, the fact that he

may  not  have  a sufficient balance in his Medisave  account

does not reflect on his financial position at all, because he

may  well  have somebody in the family who fell ill  recently

and was hospitalised and his Medisave account was used to pay

those  hospitalisation expenses.  If he continues to  have  a

job,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>

he  continues to be able to service his mortgage, he  has  no

financial  difficulty at all.  That is, in fact, a very  poor

reflection of the state of his financial affairs.  So members

should  not worry that this Eldershield insurance will result

in  the  confidentiality of their CPF account  details  being

breached.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked whether we intend to widen the use

of  CPF  savings  for  the  purchase of  insurance  policies.

Today,  under the CPF Investment Scheme, we do allow  members

to use their CPF savings, both in their Ordinary and in their

Special  accounts,  to  purchase investment-linked  products.

These are insurance policies with an investment component.  I

do  not  think  we  have allowed the use of  CPF  savings  to

purchase  an  ordinary  life  insurance  policy  without   an

investment component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there plans to widen the use of CPF savings for

insurance policies?  Under this Amendment Bill, I would  like

to  point  out  to  Members that this is only  pertaining  to

health insurance.  Hon. Members will notice that clause 3  of

the  Bill  amends section 77(1)(ja) of the CPF Act, and  that

the  section  refers to "the withdrawal  of  money  from  the

Medisave account of a member for payment of premiums  payable

by the member or his dependant who is assured under a medical

insurance  scheme approved by the Minister charged  with  the

responsibility  for  health."  So it is  strictly  a  health-related insurance scheme.  And the answer then would be, yes,

I  believe the Ministry of Health is looking at other  health

insurance schemes which will meet their requirements, and  we

would  be  encouraging  CPF members to  consider  alternative

forms of health insurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked for the number of CPF members who have

used  their CPF savings to purchase insurance schemes.  I  am

afraid  I  do not have the numbers with me, but if  the  hon.

Member has an interest in that, he can either file a Question

or I can convey the answer to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked whether the CPF Board would advise

CPF  members and insurers if the Board has reason to  believe

that a member is buying a policy that may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>

well  exceed  his means to service.  This is, of  course,  an

area  of  some concern to us, especially in investment-linked

products.   That is why last year we stopped the use  of  CPF

savings  for the purchase of annual premium investment-linked

products, because there is a chance that the member  may  not

be  able  to  service a future premium and  the  policy  will

lapse,  and  he stands to lose quite a large sum of  his  CPF

savings.   We  will  continue to advise and  to  educate  CPF

members on making prudent decisions with regard to the use of

their CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chiam urged that the Government should be

fair  in approving companies to be named as the insurers  for

the  Eldershield  insurance scheme.  Let me assure  Mr  Chiam

that the Government is always fair and always above-board  in

its  choice  of  service providers, whether it  is  just  for

ordinary  service  or  for  a  special  scheme  such  as   an

Eldershield  insurance  premium.   I  understand   that   the

Ministry of Health will invite insurance companies to  submit

their tenders to participate in the scheme, and the merits of

each  tender will be studied carefully, and only  those  that

meet  the requirements imposed by the Ministry of Health will

be  selected.   We are looking at, potentially,  up  to  four

insurance  companies  to  be selected  to  run  the  national

scheme.   I  hope this will reassure Mr Chiam  that  we  will

continue, as always, to be fair and above-board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3(1) of

the  Local  Treasury  Bills Act (Chapter  167,  1988  Revised

Edition),   resolves  that  the  Minister  for   Finance   be

authorised  to  borrow, by the issue  of  Treasury  bills  in

Singapore,  a  revolving  sum not exceeding  twenty  thousand

million Singapore dollars (S$20,000,000,000).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 4th May 1999, Parliament resolved, in accordance

with  section  3(1) of the Local Treasury Bills Act  (Chapter

167),  that the Minister for Finance be authorised to borrow,

by  the issue of Treasury bills in Singapore, a revolving sum

not  exceeding  S$15  billion.  This  limit  applies  to  the

outstanding amount of Treasury bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for Treasury bills has grown rapidly in the

past  two  years  due  to an expansion of banks'  liabilities

base.  The outstanding amount of Treasury bills issued as  at

end-July  2001  amounted  to  S$14.6  billion.   The   banks'

liabilities base is expected to continue to expand  over  the

next  few  years, thus increasing their demand  for  Treasury

bills  as  liquid  assets.   In  addition,  MAS'  efforts  to

increase  the  issuance of Treasury bills to support  capital

market  development  have also contributed  to  the  need  to

increase the borrowing limit for Treasury bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed, therefore, that the current ceiling for

borrowing  by  Treasury bills of S$15 billion, be  raised  by

another S$5 billion to a total of S$20 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to enable the Government to

issue  the  Treasury bills up to a total amount not exceeding

S$20 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3(1) of

the  Local  Treasury  Bills Act (Chapter  167,  1988  Revised

Edition),   resolves  that  the  Minister  for   Finance   be

authorised  to  borrow, by the issue  of  Treasury  bills  in

Singapore,  a  revolving  sum not exceeding  twenty  thousand

million Singapore dollars (S$20,000,000,000).

<div align="center"><b>SUPPORT FOR AND CONCERNS OVER ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS WITH CHINA</b></div>



<br>2.31 pm



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): An article appearing on the 20th of August issue

of  the  Yazhou  Zhoukan (Chinese version of Asiaweek)  ended

with  this  conclusion: "The fast and  continuing  growth  of

China's  economy will change the economic structure of  Asia,

and  end  the era dominated by the four dragons and  conclude

the leadership roles played by America and Japan in directing

the  economy of Asia."  In other words, China has now  become

the  new  leader in the economic fast train in Asia and  will

affect  the  growth and prosperity of the region in  definite

ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these trends, our top leadership, including

Ministers, senior civil servants and business leaders had led

many  delegations to China to explore new opportunities.  The

Minister  for Trade and Industry, BG George Yeo also  made  a

call  to  Singaporeans to hurry up and join the ride on  this

fast-tracked economic train to China. This call has generated

a  lot  of discussions.  But to take the ride, you must first

buy  the  tickets for the train.  Can you secure the tickets?

Can  you  afford  it?   From where  could  you  purchase  the

tickets?   Where is the embarkation point and  where  is  the

destination point?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the small and medium enterprises, do we

have  the  economic robustness and potential to be aggressive

players  in  the  Chinese market?  As the Chinese  market  is

dynamic  and  complex, are our Singaporeans savvy  enough  to

identify  the way to go? Even if they have the guts  to  give

China a try, many do not know how to adopt the next step.  We

all  know  that  this kind of venture into China  is  a  very

difficult and arduous one and many give up half-way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our forefathers migrated to Singapore from

China,  the  generations after them have  changed.   The  new

generation of Singaporeans are not familiar with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>

the  background, culture, history,  law and systems of China.

At  the  operation  level,  China first  entered  a  business

relationship  on the basis of human sentiments,  followed  by

reason,  then  secured by laws. Singaporeans  are  the  exact

opposite.    Recently,  a young reader was  reported  in  the

newspaper  to  have openly expressed  contempt of  China  and

denied  his own cultural identity.  This shows that a segment

of  our young people are short-sighted in perspective.   This

incident  led  to  another question  which  was  subsequently

raised by many: Will the following generations of Chinese  in

Singapore   become  culturally  "rootless"  in  their   total

acceptance of western influence?  If this might have been the

result  of coping with political, economic and ethnic  forces

beyond  the control of the government  and any racial  group,

then how can this destiny help us now to identify a group  of

entrepreneurs  willing and daring to  break  into  the  China

market?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been promoting bilingualism in Singapore. Yet,

our  standard of Chinese is way below that in Malaysia,  Hong

Kong  and  Taiwan.  This is evident from the poor performance

of  our  students  in  the inter-varsity debates  and  essay-writing  contests  held recently. Under our present education

system, Chinese is only a second language and it has not been

given adequate emphasis.  Our students study Chinese just  to

pass  the examination, and once the examination is over, they

simply discard the little Chinese that they have studied.  As

a  result,  our students are not able to read newspapers  and

magazines and  it explains why the standard of Chinese  among

our students is low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though language is not an absolute barrier against

investment  opportunity  in  China,  it  is  nevertheless  an

important bridging factor in relationship- building.  Because

Chinese  is one of the five official languages of the  United

Nations,     it  is incumbent on us to make it  a  policy  to

improve   our   standard  and  ability   to   speak   Chinese

internationally so that we can compete internationally.   For

example, when Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee went to China,  he

was able to cite Chinese poems from the Tang Dynasty,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>

and it left an excellent impression on the officials and

people of China. We should be able to establish better

understanding and communication with the Chinese using the

Chinese language which is our mother tongue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are clear about this need, is it time now to

revitalise  our  search for cultural roots, seriously  review

and  reform  our bilingual strategy, and have a comprehensive

overhaul of our bilingual policy?  There is a famous  Chinese

saying to the effect that for a workman to do his work  well,

he  must first sharpen his tools. In the last few years,  the

political,  business  and  worker  sectors  had   worked   in

partnership to search for new economic measures. I would like

to  propose five measures, which are not strictly economic in

nature, which in the short-run are immediately implementable,

and  in  the  long-run, form the foundation prerequisites  in

coping with the continuing Chinese economic challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge our Ministers and senior civil servants to

speak  in  Mandarin  when interviewed by the  Chinese  media,

particularly  when  it is to be telecast  over  the  Chinese-language  television channels. All along,  the  promotion  of

Mandarin in the Speak Mandarin campaigns has been focused  on

the   private sector.  It is time for the Ministers  to  take

the lead through various activities such as singing, speaking

and  other activities.  I notice that in this House, the vast

majority  of  speeches  are made in  English.   Outside  this

House,  we  are talking about bilingualism. Why  is  it  that

inside  this  House, we are not practising bilingualism?   We

must  have  people  on the top take the  lead  in  practising

bilingualism in this House. As the Chinese saying  goes,  "if

people  in  power  champion  a  cause,  there  will  be  many

followers indeed."  I am not playing up Chinese chauvinism by

stressing  the  importance of the  Chinese  language.   I  am

English-educated.  But since young, I have not  abandoned  my

interest in reading and studying Chinese and have never found

it  to  have  in any way diluted my sense of being  a  multi-cultural  Singaporean,  or  my relationship  with  the  other

ethnic groups.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are facing the economic reality of a huge

market  of  1.3 billion people in China, we have to  come  to

grips  with  the  destiny  and work  harder  at  the  Chinese

language.  When  addressing the gathering  of  World  Chinese

entrepreneurs  in Nanjing recently, the Chinese  Premier  Zhu

Rong  Zi said, "To help develop the Chinese economy, we  need

professionals  in  all  sectors, specialists  who  thoroughly

understand the working of the international market,  and  who

also  understand  the traditional culture of China."  (Lianhe

Zaobao,  September  20).  His pronouncements  are  worth  our

serious scrutiny and reflection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I propose that we set up a professional

translation  bureau  to provide batches  of  translators  and

interpreters equipped with the different language  competence

to  assist  the  business community in successfully  managing

business  discussions.  I was told that many Singaporeans  in

China  are incapable of reading Chinese documents and reports

or taking notes in Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I propose that we create a pro-Chinese economic

strategy  by starting first with our young persons.   I  hope

the  future  generations of our students would be given  more

opportunities  to  take  part  in  exchange  programmes  with

foreign  countries,  including China.  We must send  students

and  teachers at all levels to visit China so that we  should

not  be seen as being arrogant and harbouring the mindset  of

"we  are  better than you".  I hope that in our  Budget  next

year,  we  should have more funds allocated  to  enable  more

students  and teachers to visit China.  At the same  time,  I

hope  more  resources can be poured into setting up  Chinese-language  Internet  stations,  to  encourage  those  who  are

Internet  users to also use the Chinese Internet stations  to

access the enormous virtual and real marketplace dominated by

the Chinese language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should form a special information resource

department to enhance our understanding on doing business  in

China  and assist Singapore businessmen overcome the  initial

anxiety in their venture into the Chinese market.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should compile case studies of earlier

pioneers  and investors in the Chinese market and hear  their

experiences and observations. As a Chinese saying goes, after

we  have  done  our  homework, we are prepared  and  fear  no

consequences.  By knowing the differences between  China  and

ourselves, we are more able to win the battles. Upon  knowing

the  differences, we have to learn the ways to manage them  - this  becomes  a required lesson that must be  learnt  before

anyone marches on to China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, I wrote Stepping Out, stories of our

pioneers who came from China to seek for their livelihood  in

Singapore. This time round, we should be talking about  Going

Back. Our pioneers once said, "By stepping out, we will  find

a  livelihood.  Today, we must say, "Let's go back  and  find

new ways."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my brother learnt that I was moving this motion in

Parliament,  he wrote me a letter and urged me to  share  his

experience  with this House. He said that when he first  went

to  mainland China in 1989, he came across many difficulties,

experienced many setbacks, and witnessed a lot of  irrational

happenings. However,  he insisted on doing things the  proper

way,  rather than going through the "backdoor".  As a result,

he commanded the respect of the local government and relevant

authorities  and  received strong support from  them.   After

many   years   of   perseverance  and  hard   work,   through

communication  and  understanding with the various  quarters,

everything seems to be smooth and ready for him now,  and  he

has  attained certain achievements in his endeavour. As such,

he feels the best opportunity for our local SMEs is in China.

They  can  use  mainland China as the  production  base,  and

develop  their  products  and receive  orders  in  Singapore.

However,  he reminds would-be investors to China  that  China

would  not  roll out its red carpet to receive the investors,

but it would provide all kinds of facilities to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many foreign investors go into China but are unable to

adapt to the Chinese

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>

environment and they often go in with prejudices.  They  also

come  to  the  wrong  conclusion  that  they  are  just   not

compatible with the Chinese environment.  He also  said  that

many people, Singaporeans included, feel that the Chinese are

lazy  and incapable.  I think this is all a misunderstanding.

Now  the  Chinese,  especially the young ones,  are  full  of

drive.  They are responsible, they are hardworking  and  they

can  think  and  adapt to changes. They all  want  to  change

themselves, change their environment. With the liberalisation

of  the media, ideological changes are taking place in  China

and  the  young people in China are able to accept new  ideas

from outside China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I have mentioned just now should not be

confined to the Chinese Singaporeans.  As far as possible, we

should  also  bring  up our Indian and Malay  compatriots  as

well,  so  that together we can go into the China market  and

take a ride together, so that we can do our best in the China

market. With cooperation among the various ethnic groups,  we

can also achieve higher level objectives in other non-Chinese

speaking  territories, like the west, the Indian  and  Muslim

worlds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event on September 11 brought to us a traumatic

turning  point, reminding us once again of the importance  of

political stability and multi-ethnic harmony. This moment  we

must specially cherish in gratitude the prosperity which this

government has provided for us in the last 36 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 36 years of arduous nation-building effort behind

us,  the  Singapore  national identity is beginning  to  take

root.  We can stand firm on our multi-cultural legacies,  and

by  integrating  the  wisdom of the Asian  cultures  and  the

creativity  of the western culture, we can shape the  winners

for  this  millennium. This process does not need  to  depend

only  on  the  State.   Community  agencies,  including   the

business   groups   and  organisations  as   well   as   clan

associations, can all play a part in building the bridges  in

promoting  Singapore  and  Chinese business  development  and

cultural understanding.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am anxious to move this motion on the Chinese

challenge in this House because I feel that we cannot dismiss

China  any  longer.   If we can hurry up  and  ride  on  this

economic  train to China, we are closer to taking that  small

little  bite  in  the  huge economic pie  and  find  the  new

pathways  of  livelihood and business route for Singaporeans.

If  we do not hurry now and embark on this exploration,  then

we  shall  soon become irrelevant and by the time we  realise

our destiny, I think it will be too late.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In facing this uncertain and economic landscape, we

should  all  work  together to have a  single  heartbeat  and

achieve our prosperity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mdm Chiang for raising

some very pertinent issues about China and her urgent call.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we need to raise awareness among

Singaporean business leaders, the younger generation and also

the  students about the many opportunities and the importance

of  China, and also provide avenues for information  exchange

and  networking  to  facilitate our  companies'  ventures  in

China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is emerging as a major economic power. In the

last  20 years, its GDP grew 9.7% per annum and in the  1990s

alone,  at  10% per annum.  Few other countries in the  world

have achieved such impressive growth over this period.  While

there  are potential risks that may slow down China's growth,

analysts forecast that China's real GDP will continue to grow

at about 8% for the next 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore already enjoys strong and growing bilateral

economic  relations with China.  Bilateral trade  grew  at  a

robust rate of 15% per annum in the last decade, and China is

currently  Singapore's seventh largest trading  partner.   In

1997, China became Singapore's top investment destination  in

cumulative  terms.   Today, Singapore is also  China's  fifth

largest foreign investor.  But let me add, however, that  the

experiences of our businessmen in China have been mixed.   In

the early

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>

days,  not  a  few  were  cheated.  Even  now,  not  everyone

actually  makes  money.   It  is  therefore  important   that

Singapore investors go into the China market with their  eyes

wide   open  and  learn  both  from  the  happy  and  unhappy

experiences of others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board (TDB) is the lead agency

promoting   external   trade   and   investments,   including

companies'  market  expansion efforts into  China.   However,

recognising that our engagement of China requires a concerted

effort by many different Government agencies, MTI will set up

an  International Business Division (IBD) next month.  For  a

start,  IBD will focus on China alone, and play the important

role  of  coordinating efforts and reviewing progress  across

the  various  agencies.  It is important for our  businessmen

operating in China to do so on the basis of deep knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address Mdm Chiang's suggestions, which can be

broadly  classified into two categories: first, disseminating

of  information and, second, facilitating companies'  efforts

to  tap  on  the many opportunities in China.  On  the  first

point,  Singapore needs to be aware of the tremendous changes

that  have taken place, and continue to take place in  China.

It  is important for us to deepen our knowledge of  China and

understand the opportunities and also the pitfalls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the sharing of good and bad experiences

among  Singapore businesses, TDB will set up  Network  China.

As  the  name  implies, this will serve  as  a  platform  for

networking  among  businessmen.   The  aim  is  to  encourage

businessmen  to  share  their experiences  and  knowledge  on

China,  and  shorten the learning curve for  other  Singapore

companies.   In  addition,  this platform  will  also  create

opportunities  for collaboration among Singapore  businessmen

entering  China  as well as for partnering Chinese  companies

for  other markets.  Apart from Singapore companies,  Network

China  will  also  involve MNCs and the various  Chambers  of

Commerce  and  Industries, including  the  Malay  and  Indian

Chambers.  Mdm Chiang's point is well taken.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China

will be set up by our businessmen who are now in China by the

end of this year.  Headquartered in Beijing, the Chamber will

also   have  extensions  in  key  cities  such  as  Shanghai,

Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian later on.  I am confident  that

this  private  sector  driven effort will  provide  a  useful

platform  to  sieve  on-the-ground  market  intelligence  for

dissemination back to Singapore through Network China.   Such

a   grouping   also  creates  opportunities   for   Singapore

businessmen  based in China to network with one another.   In

this  way,  they  can learn from one another, and  assimilate

more easily into the new environment, both business-wise  and

socially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help raise Singaporeans' awareness about business

opportunities  in  China, TDB will set up  a  China  Business

Information Centre (CBIC) in Singapore.  Besides serving as a

first-stop   centre  to  handle  China  business  information

inquiry  services,  the Centre will conduct  market  studies,

collect market information and disseminate the information to

Singapore companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang made a very good suggestion of providing

information  on the web.  TDB will follow up on this  and  to

add depth to its existing portal to reach a large audience in

a  timely fashion.  But information by itself is not  enough.

Converting   it  into  knowledge  is  much  more   difficult.

Singaporeans have a reputation in China as straight  dealers,

but that also means that we get taken advantage of sometimes.

In  a different way, some too may have lost a little of their

innocence.   We  must  make  sure that  our  good  reputation

translates into an asset, and not a liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note Mdm Chiang's suggestion that we have to create a

conducive  environment  for  Singapore  students   to   learn

Chinese,  and also to improve the facility for the  language.

The  Ministry  of Education strongly encourages  students  to

study  their mother tongue for as long as possible and to  as

high a level as they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>

capable  of.   We  currently have 10 Special Assistance  Plan

(SAP)  schools offering Higher Chinese at the secondary level

and  three  Junior  Colleges offering  the  Chinese  language

elective  programme.  At the university level,  NUS  and  NTU

will  introduce  a  bonus  points  scheme  for  admission  to

selected courses of the Chinese language and Chinese  Studies

Course from academic year 2002/2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education also offers teaching

scholarships  tenable  in China, and our  local  universities

already  have exchange programmes for Singaporeans  to  spend

some  time  in  a Chinese university.  Besides,  Singaporeans

have  the  opportunity to interact with many Chinese students

pursuing their MBAs here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond a better grasp of the Chinese language, as has

been   emphasised  repeatedly,  it  is  also   necessary   to

understand  China better.  For a start, seven  officers  from

the  economic  agencies under the Firefly programme  will  be

sent   to  Tsinghua  University  and  Fudan  University  this

October.   They  will  pursue  an  International   MBA.    An

immersion  into  China  and  in  understanding  the  business

culture will equip our economic officials to better formulate

policies  to  deepen economic linkages with  China.   In  due

course,  we  hope we can also create a corps of officers  who

are steeped in both the language and culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond knowing China better, we also need to facilitate

Singapore companies' entry into, and subsequent expansion  in

the  Chinese market.  To do so, TDB is looking into expanding

its network of offices in China.  TDB is also looking at ways

to  provide  more  and better services to help  companies  in

their  initial  foray  and  subsequent  expansion  in  China.

Details will be announced at a later stage when finalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, TDB led 10 missions to China to explore trade

and  investment  opportunities,  and  TDB  will  continue  to

spearhead  business  missions to China.  These  missions  are

useful  for  SMEs  that are less likely to  explore  overseas

markets by themselves.  To achieve greater synergy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>

and  results,  the missions will take on a stronger  industry

focus  leveraging  on  Singapore's  strengths,  or  a  market

exploration  focus  to help Singapore companies  explore  new

emerging  areas in China.  Some of these have been, and  will

continue  to be, jointly organised with Chambers of  Commerce

and  Industry associations.  It is good that in most business

delegations,  there  is  now  a  good  mix  of  veterans  and

freshies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is growing by leaps and bounds. Singapore needs

to  focus  on industry clusters where we have strengths,  and

penetrate  regions  where these strengths  are  valued.   Our

companies will need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>

constantly upgrade their technology and management skills, or

risk  being  left  behind  by  the  Chinese,  or  by  foreign

competitors  in China.  However, we must also recognise  that

China   is  a  difficult  market  with  a  complex  operating

environment  and,  unless one understands this  fact,  it  is

easier to lose money there than to make money.

<div align="center"><b>(Use of CPF balances for degree courses)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

he  will,  in  line with the national objective of  promoting

lifelong  learning,  allow  Central  Provident  Fund  account

holders  to  use their balances to pay for degree courses  at

the  Singapore  Open  University and  for  distance  learning

courses from reputable overseas universities.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members of Parliament have in the past raised

the  issue  of allowing CPF for part-time courses,  including

those  offered by the Singapore Open University and  distance

learning degree courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the desire of individuals who wish to have

the  flexibility  to  use  their CPF  savings  for  part-time

courses.   Since the special exception was made  in  1989  to

allow  CPF  for local full-time tertiary education,  we  have

received many requests to liberalise the CPF Education Scheme

to  cover  overseas  education, part-time  courses,  distance

learning, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is meant for a member's retirement, housing and

medical needs.  We have allowed CPF to be used for local full-time  tertiary education as a concession to help  low  income

families  support  their  children  through  local  full-time

tertiary   education.    To  ensure  that   the   fundamental

objectives of the CPF in meeting the retirement, housing  and

medical  needs  of  its members will not be  undermined,  the

scheme  was  confined  to  full-time  tertiary  education  at

approved local institutions, because such courses are heavily

subsidised by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF members who are working adults and wish to pursue

further education at the Singapore Open University or take up

distance learning courses are advised to plan in advance  for

their studies, and set aside sufficient cash savings to  meet

their  education expenses. Those who intend to  pursue  part-time  distance learning courses should plan ahead  to  ensure

that they can meet the course fees and the time to devote  to

such courses before embarking on the course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that the dropout rates for part-time

students in our institutes of higher learning are much higher

than  that for full-time students.  Allowing CPF savings  for

part-time  courses could therefore result in erosion  of  the

old age savings. In view of the above, CPF savings should not

be   used  for  part-time  studies  at  the  Singapore   Open

University and distance learning degree courses.

<div align="center"><b>ENROLMENT FOR PRIMARY ONE CLASSES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan</b> asked the Minister for Education if

he  will consider allowing children, who were born a few days

after  the  cut-off  date but who are ready  to  start  their

primary education, to enrol early for Primary One.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the policy of the Ministry of Education to

admit  children to Primary One who are age 6 and above as  on

1st  January in the year of admission. This policy has served

us  well,  and  is  well  understood  by  Singaporeans.   The

Ministry does not intend to make adjustments to this policy.

<div align="center"><b>(Closure of Department of Building)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether his Ministry has any plan to close the Department  of

Building  at  the  National University of  Singapore  as  the

Building  and Construction Authority will not be  recognising

the  Bachelor  of Science (Building) degree in  the  proposed

contractor registration system in 2003.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building and Construction Authority (BCA)'s new

Contractor Registration System requires various categories of

sizable building and civil engineering contractors to  employ

specified  numbers  of professional and technical  staff,  of

which one-third should have qualifications recognised by  the

Professional Engineers Board or the Board of Architects.  The

other two-thirds of the professional and technical staff  can

hold other industry-relevant qualifications not accredited by

the  2  Boards.  These would include the Bachelor of  Science

(Building) degree from NUS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closure of NUS's Department of Building therefore

does  not  arise.   NUS's Building graduates  have  played  a

useful  role  in the industry as quantity surveyors,  project

managers  and  building  performance  specialists,  and  will

continue to do so.

residents of Sengkang and Punggol New Towns.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health plans to build a polyclinic to

serve  Sengkang and Punggol residents. The polyclinic  should

be  ready  by  2004.  In the meantime, we have  extended  the

Primary  Care  Partnership Scheme to Sengkang so  that  needy

elderly  residents  have the added convenience  of  receiving

subsidised care at private General Practitioner (GP)  clinics

near their homes instead of travelling to a polyclinic.

<div align="center"><b>BICYCLE LANES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology  if  his  Ministry

intends  to  improve  the roads in Singapore,  especially  in

newer  housing estates, to cater for bicycle lanes,  so  that

more  residents  can adopt the healthy lifestyle  of  cycling

when  they  need  to  travel  short  distances  within  their

estates, instead of relying on cars or feeder buses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land scarce Singapore, road space is limited and

should  be  used for the efficient movement of people,  goods

and  services.  Thus  far, we have only set  aside  dedicated

lanes  on our roads for public buses.  This is because  buses

provide  an efficient form of mass transportation.  Bicycles,

on  the  other hand, do not offer such efficiencies. We  must

also  recognise  that  our hot and  humid  weather  makes  it

unlikely   for   cycling  to  become   a   major   means   of

transportation. Hence, to provide dedicated bicycle lanes  on

public roads will not be an efficient use of our limited road

space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do recognise that cycling is a good form of

exercise, and in this regard, we have been providing  cycling

tracks  and facilities for our residents. The Park  Connector

Network  being developed by the National Parks Board  is  one

such  example.    This  is a network of jogging  cum  cycling

tracks that links our major parks and nature sites.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>

also  link  urban and residential areas, providing convenient

routes to places such as MRT stations, bus stops and markets.

In  addition,  we have also provided bicycle  stands  at  MRT

stations  to  cater to commuters who want  to  cycle  between

their homes and transport nodes such as MRT stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Councils may provide cycling tracks within their

HDB  estates.  The Pasir Ris Town Council, for  instance,  is

providing for cycling tracks within its estate.

<div align="center"><b>BUS AND MRT FARES FOR STUDENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology  why  is  it  that

students  from the polytechnics pay adult fares for rides  on

buses and on the MRT whereas those from junior colleges  only

pay student's concession rates, when both are of the same age

and are students.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport operators grant concessionary

travel  to  various groups of individuals, such as pre-school

children,  students and senior citizens, to help lower  their

cost  of  travelling. The privileges and types of  concession

offered differ from group to group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport operators have a different

concessionary   travel  scheme  for  students   in   tertiary

institutions  compared to those in schools. The  polytechnics

are considered as tertiary institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tertiary students, the operators offer two types of

concession  schemes. The first is the monthly bus  concession

stamp,  which allows the holder to take unlimited  number  of

trips  on  buses for the month that he or she holds  a  valid

stamp.  The other is the monthly MRT concession ticket, which

entitles  the holder of a valid ticket to travel on  the  MRT

and LRT systems up to 4 trips a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, a tertiary student who makes extensive use of the

public  transport  system can cut down his or  her  transport

expenditure  by  making  use  of  the  available   concession

schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public transport operators are listed companies and need

to  earn a profit for their operations.  At the urging of the

public,  they have granted concessions to various  groups  of

people.  However  the more concessions that are  granted,  it

would  mean  that other commuters would have  to  pay  higher

fares to make up the difference.
