<div align="center"><h4>YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA'S SPEECH</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in moving the Motion of Thanks to the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara for his Address, I am faced with the

unusual duty of recounting to the House, first, the

unusual circumstances in which we have found

ourselves as a sovereign and independent Legislature,

and, next, the problems that arise, in order to

ensure that our sovereign status shall always be

safe-guarded



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



and respected by our neighbours. It is  not

often  that a people achieve independence in the  way

we  have.  There  were a number of  unusual  features

about  Singapore  and  its geographic,  economic  and

demographic nexus with Malaya. There have been  cases

in  history  where  nations have  fallen  apart  into

independent  halves, like Syria and Egypt.  But  then

Syria  was  already an independent nation before  she

went into voluntary federation with Egypt. There have

been  federations like the Central African Federation

or  the West Indian Federation which did not succeed;

and  component  parts  of the  federated  whole  then

became  sovereign, as in the case of Zambia,  Malawi,

Jamaica,  Trinidad and Tobago. But in the  annals  of

nation-making, I think Singapore must occupy a unique

place,  for one of the most strategic islands in  the

whole  world  acquired sovereignty over  the  Western

European  bases without violent revolution.  This  is

not  to  say that I altogether disapprove of  violent

revolution, but however violent we could have  become -   and  the  Cypriots  in  their  revolution   were

extremely  violent  -  we would never  have  achieved

sovereignty   over   important  base   installations,

important not just to Britain but to a whole host  of

other  countries,  for  security  and  survival   are

intimately linked with certain checks and balances of

power  in the region. When eventually Cyprus  emerged

as   an  independent  Republic,  her  bases  remained

British and sovereignty remained with the British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the price of about $70 million in loss of

revenue  over  two  years, which  my  colleague,  the

Minister for Finance, recounted yesterday, an  excess

of   payment  over  actual  Federal  expenditure   in

Singapore   of   $25   million  per   annum,   making

approximately $50 million for two years, and loss  of

two  years of currency profits at $10 million a year,

we have acquired sovereignty without bloodshed. If we

could  put  things in pecuniary terms, that  was  the

price  we  paid  in place of blood  -  not  that  the

British would have taken that price for I think  they

knew the value of this real estate in Singapore.  But

be that as it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



may,  perhaps  it was our good fortune  that  someone

with  an  antique gold sovereign exchanged it  for  a

bagful of sweets; and who are we to complain when  we

have  found  ourselves  the  proud  possessor  of  an

antique gold piece?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was another price which we paid besides

the  $70 million. Two years in which we came face  to

face  very  rapidly  with  the  stark  realities   of

conflict  -  conflict over race, over language,  over

religion.  Very  quickly all the  cliches  of

inter-communal  co-operation were shorn  off  as  we  found

ourselves  confronted  with  a  somewhat  crude   and

blatant  attempt to subdue us as a submissive  member

of  a federation, the inner workings of which we were

not  so  conversant with before Malaysia.  Whilst  we

laid the emphasis on the constitutional framework and

good  faith,  intending to bring the territories  and

the  peoples closer together as they operated  within

one   national  unit,  sharing  one  economic  system

irrevocably  wedded  together  by  ties   of   common

experience and the fact that their destinies had been

so  closely  interwoven in the past,  we  found  that

there  were certain inarticulate major premises  upon

which  others had based their calculations,  and  the

constitution, which was written and the  inarticulate

major  premises of race, language and religion  which

were unwritten were irreconciliable. All that is over

for  us for the time being. The problem has not  been

solved,  but  for us the problem does not immediately

arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we wish to do now is to get into a new working

relationship  with our former partners  in  Malaysia.

This  working  relationship is likely to  come  about

only  if we approach it on a matter of fact basis  of

what  is the common benefit to be derived in any  act

of  economic  or  other co-operation.  For  the  time

being,  our problem is that it is difficult  for  us,

without  being  accused  of intransigence,  to  bring

about  that  spirit of co-operation as long  as  some

people  believe that Singapore out of Malaysia  means

the  relationship which existed between Singapore and

the old Malaya. Then, for many years,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



wanting merger, wanting reunification, and seeking  a

more  enduring basis for our future, Singapore -  not

just the Government but the people - was prepared  to

tolerate  a  relationship which  was  not  altogether

mutual.  Certain advantages accrued to Malaya without

corresponding advantages to Singapore. Their products

found  markets in Singapore whilst our  products  did

not  find markets in Malaya. So it was in fact  in  a

large  number of fields of economics and finance.  It

is  not  possible  to  go back to this  relationship.

Before a new working relationship is established,  we

must first dispel the illusion that because we wanted

merger  in  Malaysia,  therefore  we  are  vulnerable

without  merger.  Whilst politically  an  independent

Singapore  holds hazards in the long-term,  not  just

for  overselves  but  for  all  in  South-East  Asia,

economically it does not follow that it is within the

dispensation of our neighbours to decide our economic

destiny. Two years of confrontation have given us  an

opportunity  to demonstrate that we did not  live  on

the  bounty of our neighbours. We did them a service,

and  if  that  service is not required, it  could  be

extended  elsewhere for other returns.  It  may  take

some  time and no little effort before the same axiom

is   demonstrated   with  other  neighbours.   I   am

reasonably confident that eventually we can  reach  a

rational  relationship, not one in which  the  bigger

assumes  automatically that he must get  the  greater

benefit,  but a relationship in which each and  every

step  is weighed in accordance with whether it is  of

value   to  them  and  to  us.  In  other  words,   a

relationship based on a quid pro quo. If we  are  not

to  get something out of it, naturally it is not  our

intention that we should give up something  which  is

valuable.  Similarly we ask nothing of our neighbours

unless we give them something in return. In this  way

we hope to establish in the course of next year a new

balance which has now become necessary as a result of

our  emergence as a sovereign State, living with  the

Government  of Malaysia not as a State Government  to

Central   Authority,  but  as  two  independent   and

sovereign regimes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go into the programmes

for  this Session of Parliament, I would like to  put

forward  the  difficulties  with  which  we  will  be

confronted  as  a  result  of  the  decision  of  the

Opposition to boycott this Parliament. I do not  know

for  how  long they intend to absent themselves  from

this  Chamber. I would like to be able  to  say  that

despite their absence we shall attempt to put forward

every  act of legislation, every decision of  policy,

fairly and squarely before this House, and before the

people  to  whom  we are ultimately  responsible.  It

means, in other words, an added responsibility of not

only putting forward our point of view hut of all the

conceivable  opposing points of view  which  we  have

considered before we have decided to over-rule  them.

There  must  be  a  scrupulous  presentation  of  the

reasons for and against legislation and policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, I would like to remind the House why

the  Opposition has decided to absent itself. On  the

day  on  which  we  assembled, the  Barisan  Sosialis

issued  a  special  edition of its Party  publication

called  Shih Chen Pao. On page 4, it sets out why  it

was not to participate in this Legislature.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could the Prime Minister give the date

of the publication?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is on the 8th of December,

1965, the day when His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara addressed this Assembly. It is in Chinese, and

if  I  may  just read the relevant extracts before  I

give  an interpretation of what I think it means.  It

says  here: [The Prime Minister read the extracts  in

Mandarin  which  he then translated into  English  as

follows]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have attributed three reasons why we have

convened this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First, to give legal seal to our departure from

Malaysia  which was a neo-colonialist plot to  divide

and rule. Second, to get legal cover for our abuse of

public   funds.  Third,  to  use  this   Session   of

Parliament as a platform for propaganda to cheat  the

people and confuse them.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



They, therefore, came to these conclusions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Under these circumstances, to attend Parliament

and  to  lend  support and credence  to  the  mockery

enacted   by   the  PAP.,  either  intentionally   or

otherwise,  we are helping the P.A.P, to  cheat  the

people    with    regard   to    Singapore's    false

independence.'



<br><br>And the final conclusion is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, if we are to oppose them, we must

resolutely  expose the PAP., the falseness  of  their

parliamentary  democracy, and their anti-the-people's

views. Also we must go a step further and expose  the

falseness  of Singapore's independence. And  in  this

way we can raise up the level of consciousness of the

people. Therefore, we must oppose the debate in  this

Assembly and it is something which must he done.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I think it is important that we

should   understand  how  they  have  come  to   this

conclusion.  It is pretty dreary reading,  to  follow

the tortuous paths that they have followed since they

started off with "phoney merger" ending up in "phoney

Malaysia",  and  now  finding  themselves  denouncing

Singapore  as  a  phoney independent country.  But  I

would  ask  Members to hear with me when I  read  out

certain  extracts  which they have  published,  their

Party  philosophy, their analysis since  the  9th  of

August.  I would like to start off with this  -  this

was their latest publication, on the 8th of December,

and   the   one   before  that,   of   relevance   in

understanding  their mind, is that published  by  the

Malayan Monitor, which is a publication by Mr H.  B.

Lim, a member of the Malayan Communist Party, who has

been  in  London  for many years and  who  runs  this

particular  publication.  He  carried   in   full   a

statement by Dr Lee Siew Choh, who styles himself in

this  statement  as Chairman of the Malayan  People's

Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee. This is of the  30th

November, 1965. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We met Asst. Secretary, Comrade Murshi Said El Din

recently in Singapore, [he is the Assistant

Secretary-General   of   the  Afro-Asian  People's   Solidarity

Organisation] and he asked us our views on the recent

political  developments in `Malaysia' and  especially

on   the  so-called  separation  of  Singapore   from

`Malaysia',   and   the  phoney   `independence'   of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our views on this matter have been made abundantly

clear  in the various press statements issued by  the

Malayan People's Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee  and

jointly  by the Party Rakyat and the Barisan Sosialis

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have repeatedly pointed out that the separation

of   Singapore   from  `Malaysia'  is   yet   another

imperialist  plot, designed to save  `Malaysia'.  The

`independence' of Singapore is phoney,  and  this  is

clearly   seen  in  the  `Agreement  of   Separation'

released  on  9.8.65  the  day  of  proclamation   of

`Independence'    of   Singapore.   This    Agreement

stipulates   that  British  troops  and  bases   will

continue  to  remain  in Singapore;  that  `Malaysia'

troops and bases will also occupy Singapore; and that

the Singapore `Govt.' cannot establish diplomatic  or

trade   relations   with  foreign  countries   unless

approved  by the `Malaysian' Government. Further  the

British  and  `Malaysian' govts, can  send  Singapore

troops  to suppress the national liberation  struggle

in Kalimantan Utara, and this is being done."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it ends up in this flamboyant fashion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are Malayan patriots.'



<br><br>So  much  so,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that they  refer  to

Sabah and Sarawak as "Kalimantan Utara".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We cannot, and must not, accept the British-US

imperialist manipulated constitutional separation  of

Singapore from the rest of Malaya. Neither can we  in

our  thinking,  and  in  our  struggle  for  national

liberation, accept the new imperialist plot of

divide-and-rule. The withdrawal of Singapore has not brought

any  drastic change to `Malaysia'. There  is  only  a

change  in form, but no change in content. As far  as

Malayan  internal politics is concerned  the  present

constitutional  arrangements are merely  intended  to

isolate  and confine the Lee Kuan Yew clique  to  the

island  of  Singapore and prevent them from competing

for status in the wider arena of `Malaysia'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our struggle is a most difficult one."



<br><br>This  is  about  the sanest of all the comments  that

they have made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But with the solidarity support of the peoples of

Afro-Asia,  we  are  absolutely  confident  that  our

struggle for a genuinely democratic Malaya (including

Singapore) free of foreign troops and free of foreign

control, will be crowned with success.'



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Prime Minister give the date

of the publication?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> 30th of November, 1965. Mr

Speaker, Sir, they started off with a special edition

of the Plebeian Express of August 1965 with the title

Singapore `independent'? I will just read



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



out  phrases  from it; I think they will  convey  the

kind  of  reason and logic which they have mesmerised

themselves into believing, that white is black;  that

black is white; that independence means phoney;  that

Malaysia does not exist; that Malaya includes  Malaya

the peninsula and Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So-called independence of Singapore. Phoney

independence, a humbug, intended to confuse, hoodwink

&  side-track. Change of form. No change in  content.

Singapore  has limited powers and in fact  is  little

better  than a City Council. The British imperialists

(supported  by US) still rule over the  Federation  &

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special clauses which stipulate that Singapore

cannot  enter  into any separate treaty or  agreement

with  other  countries without  the  consent  of  the

Federation govt.; that Singapore has to enter into  a

treaty for external defence & mutual assistance  with

the  Federation govt.; and that Britain can  continue

to  maintain the bases in S'pore and use  them  as  &

when  they  like, without even the usual pretence  of

"consultation" with the Singapore govt.! -  all  show

that Singapore is not truly independent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a private arrangement between the British

agents  on  the one side and British puppets  on  the

other,  with  active encouragement & support  of  the

British imperialists.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not quite sure who are agents and who are the

puppets.   But   obviously  both  are   viewed   with

considerable disfavour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It will be noted that the few countries that have

recognised  Singapore's so-called "independence"  are

mostly US-puppets & pro-western countries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the editors of the Barisan

Express really understand what this is all about. But

I think they derive a great deal of their inspiration

from  a  group  of revolutionaries who  believe  that

revolutionary  thinking  consists  of  the   emphatic

repetition of dogmatic slogans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the September issue of the Plebeian Express,

they  carried an analysis of Singapore  by  Mr  John

Eber,  whom  they have very modestly described  as  a

Malayan  now  staying  in Britain.  He  is  also  the

Secretary-General  of  the M.C.F.,  which  means  the

Movement  for  Colonial Freedom. He  is  many  things

besides just being Secretary-General of the M.C.F.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heading, Who Decides on S'pore's "Eviction"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Federation was phoney.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was primarily a British one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British decision to evict was based on the

necessity to preserve "Malaysia", and it is important

to  realise that Singapore is today still a  part  of

"Malaysia"  in  all  but  name.  This  fact  is  very

pointedly underlined by the continuing presence under

the  "secession" agreement of "Malaysian"  troops  in

Singapore - together,  of  course;  with  the  massive

British  force there. All that has happened  is  that

Lee  Kuan  Yew  and  his  colleagues  have  now  been

excluded  from the struggle for status in  the  wider

federation. One speaks of "status" and not of  power,

for no man or party can have power in Malaya while it

remains under the shadow of 55,000 British troops.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malaysia was a fake. So is independent Singapore."

That  is  conclusive authority for our  revolutionary

heroes in the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The date of that document?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That document is the Barisan

Express  of  September  1965. Having  read  Mr  John

Eber's  erudite  analysis, an editorial  appeared  in

another edition of 21st September --- another edition

of the month of September of the Plebeian Express.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Controversial Question Concerning The Present

Situation",  says  the editor. There  are  two  views

about the independence of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The first view holds that this is a purely

Alliance-PAP  affair, that the British  knew  nothing

about  it  before  hand, and that  the  British  have

merely  accepted  the Alliance-PAP fait  accompli  in

good  grace.  The second view holds that  this  is  a

British  plot, that the British knew about this  from

the  very  beginning and have jointly initiated  this

new  arrangement  with  the  full  agreement  of  the

Alliance & the PAP govts.'



<br><br>Needless to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, they came  to  the

second conclusion. They said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From all this we can confidently come to the

conclusion therefore that though the timing could  be

a  surprise, the separation of S'pore from "Malaysia"

was  not a Tunku-LKY affair, but was British inspired.

The  leaders  in  the Alliance & the PAP  are  merely

actors who play different roles.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



And under the heading "Why Do the British Want this

New Arrangement?":-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Hence the new arrangement which in essence is

still the same old thing. There are no drastic

changes. It is a change only in form with no change

in content. What was once a federation now becomes a

confederation...'.



<br><br>But  there again the plaintive note at the end, which

is the only note of sanity:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All this would create immense difficulties for the

Left in Malaya (i.e. S'pore & the Federation).'



<br><br>And  so  they  went  on to October this  year,  again

talking on the Algiers Conference which was abortive.

They wrote in the editorial, "Phoney Independence  of

Singapore":-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The question of the Lee Kuan Yew "govt." must also

be  considered  in the same category  as  the

above-mentioned.   The   "separation"  of  Singapore   from

"Malaysia",  carried out by the British imperialists,

is a trick."'



<br><br>And so they recite all the arguments.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the date of that publication?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> October 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think more important for our purposes than

just understanding how they arrived at the conclusion

that  this independence is phoney, that in fact  this

is  the  old  Malaysia dressed up anew  in  order  to

preserve  British interests -I think  more  important

than   that   is   their  approach  to  parliamentary

democracy,  because in this bigger problem,  on  this

wider  issue, we have a glimpse of their  real  Party

ideology.  In  November and December  they  published

three  instalments  of  an article  which  bears  the

title,  "British  Parliamentary  Democracy  -What  it

means"  -No.  1,  No.  2,  No.  3  for  November  and

December. At a subsequent date I will be able to tell

the  House  about No. 4 because the series  is  still

running. The gist is a simple Marxist-Leninist

line - it  is  their hard-line, and none of this revisionism

of   Khrushchev,   of  wishing  to   win   power   by

constitutional   means,  the  musical   chairs,   the

bourgeois  parliamentary democracy. What is important

is  this:  here  is  a denial of  the  value  of  any

democratic institution, not of this House, not of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



Singapore's  "phoney" Parliament, but the  denial  of

the worthwhileness of the constitutional struggle  of

winning power via popular elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November 1965 "British Parliamentary Democracy -

What it Means" (No. 1):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A brief survey of the British State Machine in

relation to Democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with this issue, the PLEBEIAN Express is

publishing   a   brief   survey   of   the    British

constitutional institutions & state machine in  order

to  give  our  readers an insight  into  the  British

system   of  government  which  is  being  so  loudly

acclaimed by the propagandists of the western  powers

&  their  local stooges. We feel an understanding  of

the  workings of the British system of government  is

useful  and  so many of our so called "leaders"  have

made it an object of imitation.'



<br><br>"Leaders" in inverted commas. Therefore, it does  not

include Barisan Sosialis leaders because they are not

going to make this the object of any imitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The following is the 1st instalment of the

article.  Further instalments will  be  published  in

future issues of the PLEBEIAN Express. -- Ed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not say who the author is, hut obviously he

is  no  revisionist. Now, I will just  read  out  the

pertinent  extracts  so that  Members  will  get  the

flavour  of  their approach to this  House,  what  it

implies,  the  folly and the futility  of  the  whole

parliamentary machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The same brand of democracy is being sold to our

people  in Singapore and Malaya and we have seen  how

this  crude  imitation  of the British  Parliamentary

system has worked in our country.'



<br><br>It goes on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...it is necessary for us to discover and

understand  the  true  nature  of  this   so   called

"democracy"  which  is being peddled  to  us  by  the

stooges   of   the   Anglo-American  imperialists   &

colonialists.'



<br><br>They  always  seem  to find stress in  repetition  of

tautologous  phrases. If you just  say,  "You  are  a

stooge  of  the imperialists," it does not carry  the

same conviction as if you said, `You are a stooge  of

the  imperialists arid the colonialists."  Presumably

there  must be imperialists who are not colonialists,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went on, at the end of the first article, to

recite this fact:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This ownership of the means of production allows

the  monopoly  capitalist class to maintain  a  tight

grip  over the state machinery and over the lives  of

millions of wage-earners & salary-earners who have no

choice  but  to  work for them and constantly  enrich

them. It is in this context that the issue of freedom

& democracy in Britain must he seen and judged.'



<br><br>Second  instalment - mid-November 1965  "Parliamentary

Democracy - What It Means!":



<br><br><b>'A BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</b>



<br><br>...Even  the  apparent continuity is deceptive.  While

the  old  feudal institutions have retained something

of   their   original  forms,  they  have   undergone

tremendous changes in the past 600 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the institutions have this appearance of

continuity.  Some of the organs of the British  State

(such  as  the  armed forces, the civil service,  the police

and   the  secret  police)  are  essentially

products of the modern industrial capitalism  of  the

past 150 years, or even less.'



<br><br>Next  heading,  "THE STATE SERVES MONOPOLY  CAPITAL", "MONOPOLY CAPITAL USES COERCION AGAINST THE PEOPLE". And  it  ends  up,  "CAPITALIST RULING  CLASS FEARS DEMOCRACY".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The attitude of the capitalist class towards

democracy has always been clear. They fought  for  an

extension of democratic rights in the last century in

order  to dislodge the landed aristocracy from  their

exclusive  control  of all the key  position  in  the

State  apparatus;  but they have become  increasingly

hostile  to  these  very rights &  liberties  in  the

course  of  the present century owing to the  growing

strength   of   the  working  class  movement   which

threatens in turn to dislodge them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They so fear democracy now that it has led them to

be  oppressive  in  a variety of  indirect  forms  in

Britain, and in direct & brutal forms in the colonies

against   the  national  liberation  movements.   The

striving of the Peoples of Malaya (including S'pore),

N.  Borneo.  Kenya. British Guiana and more  recently

Aden  for  national independence, were met  with  the

most savage repressions which completely unmasked the

bitter  anti-democratic nature of the British  ruling

class.'



<br><br>Article (3) , December 1965, "What It Means!"



<div align="center"><br><br>`POWER REMAINS IN HANDS OF CAPITALIST CLASS</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the whole state machine and other institutions

under  the  control of the monopoly capitalists  have

manoeuvred the voting rights of the people in such  a

way  that  in  a  general  election  the  people  are

compelled  to choose between two parties, both  ready

to serve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



their  interests. For the labour Party too has proved

itself during office willing to subordinate itself to

the monopolies



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is made possible by the nature of the two main

political parties. The common feature of both parties

is  that their leaders have accepted without question

the   capitalist   foundation   of   society,   Their

Parliamentary  leaders  have always  been  free  from

control  by the rank and file of their party. However

much  they  may  have paid homage in  public  to  the

principles  of  democracy, they have never  tolerated

the  application of these principles to the relations

between themselves and their followers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the official top leadership of the

Labour  Party  has the control of the Party  and  are

prepared  to  serve  the  interest  of  the  monopoly

capitalist  class,  they will be tolerated  and  even

welcomed  by this class. But in case the attitude  of

the  Labour Party changes, the capitalist  class  has

built-in  safeguards within the State  machine  which

will he discussed later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we see that the 2-party system places serious

limitations on the democratic rights of,  the  people

which   they  achieved  in  the  form  of   universal

suffrage.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall he looking forward with interest to

the  continuing  article because I hope,  from  them,

ultimately to know just how far the Barisan  Sosialis

are  prepared to go. This is not a negation  of  this

Chamber or Singapore's phoney independent Parliament.

This   is   a  challenge  to  the  whole  system   of

government. Thev consider that system to  be  -  to

put  it  in  orthodox Marxist-Leninist  verse  -  the

handmaid  of capitalist monopoly. Whether it  is  the

Parliament  of  Singapore  or  whether  it   is   the

Parliament  of Westminister, it is the instrument  of

repression  of the revolutionary working class  which

the Communists say they represent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logically, arising from those attitudes, not only

must they boycott formal sessions of this House since

this  is  a ruse and a guise to confuse the  populace

with the false independence that we have acquired, to

get  legal sanctions and respectability for votes  on

public expenditure which we are seeking hut they also

have  to  carry the battle one step further to  wreck

it. The question is how? And for all these years,  we

strenuously  sought to prove that in fact  they  were

operating on the twin premises of (1) work the system

and shake it and rock



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



it; (2) undermine it altogether. In other words, use

constitutional forms of struggle which the  bourgeois

enemy is foolish enough to afford the Communists, use

the  public  forum,  not to work it  better,  hut  to

denounce  the  system  and  break  it - shake   public

confidence   in   it.  And  the  other,   the   armed

revolution,  where State power is  wrested  from  the

hands  of the monopoly capitalists and vested in  the

hands  of  the  vanguard of the  proletarist  -  the

Communist Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not quite sure whether the present leaders of

the  Barisan  Sosialis intend to pursue this  to  its

logical conclusion, or whether they intend to go hack

to  the  much  more subtle line which  they  used  to

follow,  of  pretending to he a constitutional  Party

whilst  at  the  same  tune operating  on  directives

issued   by  illegal  and  unconstitutional   parties

seeking  to usurp power by violent means. But  it  is

useful  for  us to remember this, that  whatever  the

shifts  and turns of policy or tactics, as they  call

it, from time to time, their objective never changes.

Fortunately  for  us this time,  a  series  of  false

premises  have led them into so blinkered a situation

that  they have come to a series of repeated  defeats

and   into   mare  illogical,  absurd  and  untenable

propositions.  They  have  mesmerised  themselves  by

repeating words like "phoney" ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> An American word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And from one false premise,

they  have gone to the next spurious conclusion.  The

plum  fact  of  the matter is, right at this  moment,

they   are   so   confused  by  defeat  and,   worse,

demoralised by the prospect of further defeats,  that

the leadership is now questioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when an army goes into battle, generals are

never questioned when battles are being won. But when

a  general  leads  his army into one  disaster  after

another, the younger officers and eventually even the

privates  begin  to  question  the  wisdom  and   the

authority  of  the  general. And in  this  case,  the

generals  in  apparent authority were  only  recently

privates  and corporals. So with-out the prestige  of

long years in positions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



of  leadership, it is only natural that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  should face these problems of challenge  to

the  Party leadership. If it were just a question  of

the  Party  leaders being in constant  conflict  with

their  ground because they have failed to bring about

confidence  in  the  wisdom  and  success  of   their

policies, it would not matter so much for us.  But  I

make  it  my  duty, Mr Speaker, Sir, to  read  these

dreary  tracts,  because, behind it all,  whether  we

like  it or not, there are people in higher authority

than  the  apparent leaders of the Barisan  Sosialis.

There  is  a  consistency of  line  of  policy  which

dovetails  with broadcasts of policy statements  made

by  the  Malayan National Liberation League  recently

formed  in Jakarta, consisting of a number  of  quite

well-known  Malayans  closely  associated  with   the

Malayan  Communist  Party in pre-Emergency  days  who

disappeared  during the days of the  Emergency.  They

have formed themselves into a group before the recent

coup  in  Jakarta on 30th September. If one  were  to

compare  what comes out in the Plebeian and the  Shih

Chen  Pao with the words and phrases which have  come

out from the M.N.L.L, in Jakarta and from other radio

stations which broadcast the policy statements of the

Malayan   People's  Liberation  Army,  one  finds   a

consistent pattern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem that has arisen for them in this

case,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is the unexpected separation

of  Singapore from Malaysia which entails  a  serious

reassessment of the policies which they were about to

initiate  in order to succeed in armed conflict.  Had

there  been  no  separation, then the policies  which

they  were  espousing  just  before  separation,   if

continued to its logical conclusion, were designed to

lead,  and  would inevitably have led, to a situation

in  which armed revolution was not only feasible  but

was  most  probable, and success was  not  altogether

that  remote. Unable to win by the open argument,  it

was  their  intention to seek discord principally  by

changing  their  policy on language and,  via  racial

conflict  over language issues, to create a situation

in which armed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



force  would be used and the Malayan Communist  Party

as  the instrument and the holder of that armed force

would emerge triumphant. In 1955 at Baling when  they

last  pronounced their programmes and  policies,  the

M.C.P. accepted  Malay  as  the  national  language.

Recently  we  had information, which was corroborated

by  the statements made by the M.N.L.L., that certain

members   of   the   united  Communist   open   front

organisations  who  journeyed to  Algiers  and  other

conferences  had  received  instructions  that   they

should  withdraw  support for  any  language  as  the

national language and that they should insist, on the

other  hand,  that  there  should  be  four  official

languages.  The distinction between their policy  and

ours  is a very subtle one, but a very important one.

They  say  that  there shall be no national  language - there  is  no need for a national common language  - and  that there shall be four official languages. And

if,  on  the one hand, the Language Action  Committee

who  represent  the  ultras in the  linguistic  field

espouse  one language to the exclusion of all others,

here  was  the  M.C.P. fanning  the  desire,  a  very

natural  desire of everybody, to preserve  their  own

linguistic and cultural heritage - a situation  which

must  have  led  to conflict. In that  situation,  of

course,  both the Parliament in Kuala Lumpur and  the

Assembly  in  Singapore  were  valueless.   And   the

policies and the statements they have made would have

made very good sense if in fact separation never came

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure how long it will be before the

Communist  Party come out with their new policy,  new

tactics, in view of the different circumstances  they

are  faced  with as a result of Singapore's emergence

as  a  separate,  distinct  and  independent  nation.

Undoubtedly,  they will pursue the same  cliches  for

some length of time, but I would not be surprised  if

in  the  end  their  top leaders  did  not  make  the

necessary  adjustments which are inevitable  to  meet

this  new situation. But for our part, whatever their

policies  may  be in the Peninsula, or in  what  they

call  Kalimantan Utara, we have given them  all  fair

notice that any exploitation of issues of language or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



culture,  any  divisive policies designed  to  create

racial  discord and conflict will have  to  be  dealt

with swiftly and effectively. By way of illustration,

I will just refer to the kind of difficulties which I

anticipate will occur from time to time, the kind  of

mischief which they are hound to peddle. This was the

Plebeian of the 16th of October, heading on page 8:



<br><br><div align="center">'DEMAND TO MAKE CHINESE AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IS CORRECT AND JUST!</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in putting forward a just demand someone has

said  that Singapore has 80 per cent Chinese  instead

of  75 per cent, is this such a monumental error?  If

so,  then  this  is  also  an  error  which  the  PAP

ministers themselves have frequently committed in the

past. So why the fuss about the 5 per cent error?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the English text, Mr Speaker, Sir,In

the  Chinese  text,  it has got subtle  overtones  of

chauvinism which the interpreter will find difficulty

in  bringing  out. But this was the same  publication

which  joined  with the Communists in denouncing  our

analysis that in Malaysia, with Singapore a  part  of

Malaysia, it is not possible for any one racial group

to dominate  the  others to the exclusion  of  their

languages  and  cultures.  You  will  remember,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, that the Barisan Sosialis joined in the

condemnation  of  the  analysis  40:  40:  20,  as  a

communal  provocation, because  it  was  designed  to

arouse chauvinistic feelings in the various component

parts.  But 40: 40: 20, is communal, but exaggerating

75 to 80 is not a monumental error!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask you, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

course  of this Session, and until such time as  they

either decide to reappear in this Chamber, or if they

do  not,  then until such time as elections are  held

either  generally  or  to fill up  the  vacant  seats

caused  by  continual absence of Members who  are  at

full   liberty  to  represent  the  views  of   their

constituents  in  this  House, to  give  considerable

latitude to Members on this side. My colleagues and I

will try as scrupulously as we can to put forward all

the  pros and cons of every piece of legislation  and

every  policy in the hope thereby of discharging  the

duties of the Opposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



But  more  so,  I  hope you will  allow  considerable

latitude  amongst the Backbenchers on the  Government

side  to  take up more of their time in  playing  the

role  of the constructive critic. It is part  of  the

technique  of  the open society that  the  wisdom  of

certain  policies, of certain programmes, are  tested

in  the  open  argument. It is difficult  for  us  to

propound  the  kind  of criticism which  the  Barisan

Sosialis, if they were here, would propound,  because

I  do not think they would want to go into the merits

or  demerits  of  the legislative programme  we  have

placed before this House. But, nevertheless, I  think

there  are  certain valuable points  which  could  be

brought out by Members on the Government side if they

were given considerable latitude in appearing, so  to

say,  to speak against the Government; not that  they

are  against the Government but that they are thereby

in  a  position to bring out the underlying  problems

which  led to certain policies being decided the  way

they were.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I would like to draw the attention of

the  House  to the Five-Year programme that  we  have

outlined in the Address of His Excellency the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara. You will recall that His  Excellency

mentioned  the  land reclamation projects  which  are

going  on - 620 acres in Toa Payoh, excess land  from

which  is  used to reclaim 400 acres in  the  Kallang

Basin ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister is running

into difficulties with Standing Order No. 43 (8) . But

possibly in view of the exceptional circumstances, is

it  the  general  wish  of  Members  that  the  Prime

Minister  continues his speech without being affected

by that particular Standing Order? Is there a general

assent of the House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Next, the reclamation of land

from  Bedok  to  Tanjong Rhu of  about  1,000  acres,

giving  in  turn another 600 acres of available  land

from  sites where excavations are now being made  for

the filling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



Then  the  Housing and Development  Board  plans  for

60,000  units in the next five years. I do not  think

there  is  much  doubt  that these  targets  will  he

achieved.  But I would like, if I may,  in  the  next

twenty  minutes before I close the argument  for  the

objectives  which  have been set out,  the  long-term

objective  which  has  been set  out  in  the  policy

statements,  to  explain first the  interim  measures

which we have had to take to stabilise and limit  our

liability; and, second, our long-term attitude on the

future  of  Singapore  and  of  the  people  that  we

consider one with Singapore the people in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short-term, we have had to introduce certain

new  measures in order that we can take stock of what

our  liabilities are, our immediate liability to give

jobs  to  our  own people, our own citizens,  provide

schools for their children, hospitals and social  and

community  services, housing and so on. To this  end,

identity  cards and work permits will be implemented.

The problem becomes particularly acute because it has

been  said,  since the 9th of August this  year,  the

flow  of  migrants,  the flow of  people  across  the

Causeway,  has ended up with considerable credits  on

our  side. The rate has increased to twice the normal

rate prevailing before the 9th of August. I have  not

got  the complete figures for November and December.,

but  the rough gross turn-over of people crossing the

Causeway on both sides since the 9th of August  shows

an increase or a credit or plus on the Singapore side

of  about  nearly  50,000. It is true  that  quite  a

number of these people may have come to Singapore  in

order to take ship or aircraft to go abroad. But I do

not  think it is feasible to explain this away on the

basis  that  more  than  perhaps  5,000  could   have

travelled  in  this way. Assuming  that  10,000  went

abroad  by ship and aircraft, we would still be  left

with a net credit of about 40,000 people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasise this point, that

this  is  not designed to exclude Malaysians.  It  is

designed  to  limit our liabilities so that  we  know

what  it is we have to cater for. For only by  making

our problems finite will we be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



able  to  know what it is that we must o in order  to

ensure the economic viability of Singapore. And  only

then  will we be able to define the problems and  the

solutions  to these problems which we hope will  come

by  way of new markets being made available to us.  I

would  like  to  emphasise that  so  far  as  we  are

concerned,  we  are one people in two countries.  All

that separation has done is to divide the one society

into two not altogether dissimilar parts. But whereas

before  we  would  have sought one solution  for  the

whole,  now  there are two experiments being  carried

out  in these two halves. And the experiments on  how

to   find  a  solution  to  the  problems  of

multi-racialism,  multi-lingualism and  a  multiplicity  of

religion,  and the policies pursued in any  one  half

are  bound to have repercussions on the attitudes and

assessments  on  the other side; and the  side  which

produces  a  successful solution is  the  side  whose

views will ultimately prevail. This is one people now

divided into two arenas. But in the last resort  they

are  one people, and work permits and everything else

notwithstanding,  in extremis, in  an  emergency,  it

would  be inhuman to believe, and unrealistic on  our

part  to  believe, that we could maintain a  separate

and  a  disinterested posture if a major  catastrophe

were to take place in South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this brings me to my last theme. The danger of

a  major catastrophe which we can precipitate  if  we

are  not conscious of the problems of finding  a  new

balance  in  South-East Asia to take the place  of  a

balance  which was maintained by the European empires

before the war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the multi-racial character of

the  population  of  Singapore  and  the  States   of

Malaysia  creates the probabilities of two  different

trends.  As  long as British rule kept  everybody  in

place,  multi-racialism or the problems of  having  a

multiplicity  of  communities  of  different   races,

languages, religions, never gave rise to any problems

of law and order, for in the ordered nature of former

colonial society, the British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



Raj  decided who should do what and who should fulfil

what  roles  in  their system. The  disappearance  of

direct  political  control  has  brought  about   the

necessity of finding an authority indigenous  to  the

peoples who now reside in these territories, and with

imperfection, a compromise was found in certain forms

of   elected  representation  weighted  to  hold  the

balance between people who were supposed to have been

here  longer,  the indigenous people, and  those  who

were supposed to be more recent migrants. As long  as

we  were  one, Singapore and Malaysia, the danger  of

the  multi-racial  communities going  their  separate

ways was less than it is now. If we are not conscious

of  this  and we each play only to our own  immediate

electorate, then having two halves of one whole - and

not very equal halves of one whole - one in which the

accent  is inevitably that in Singapore, in  numbers,

the migrant community or people of migrant stock and,

on  the  other hand, in Malaya peoples of  indigenous

stock, a polarisation of policies and attitudes would

take  place  which  in the end may well  bring  major

calamity   for   all   in   South-East   Asia,   with

repercussions throughout the whole of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem is popularly

presented  to the Western world as the Problem  of  a

Third  China, which is the title of a fairly readable

dissertation by a scholar in the Australian  National

University,  and in historical terms he  puts  it  in

this  way. This is a recent publication called  Third

China  by P. C. Fitzgerald, Professor of Far  Eastern

History in the Institute of Advanced Studies  in  the

Australian National University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said - talking about the Second World War and

its aftermath - on page 50:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the latter part of the war the Japanese decided

that  for  both  military and political  reasons,  it

would  be  desirable  to grant  a  measure  of

self-government  to the peoples of the occupied  countries

of  South-East Asia. They did not see any  reason  to

respect  the arbitrary boundaries which the  play  of

European  political parties had imposed  upon

South-East Asia. They perhaps remembered that in the Middle

Ages before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



the  rise of the colonial powers or the intrusion  of

the  Europeans,  there  had  been  a  powerful  State

comprising both Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula,  Sri

Vijaya.  The proposed to revive this State under  the

name of Maha Malaya or Greater Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Terauchi, Commander-in-Chief of the

Japanese  Army  in South-East Asia, summoned  various

Malay   and  Indonesian,  Sumatran  leaders  to   his

headquarters  in Saigon for consultations.  On  other

occasions he flew to Ipoh in Malaya and held  similar

meetings  there.  These  were  attended  by,  amongst

others,  Hatta, the Indonesian nationalist leader  in

Sumatra, and Dato Onn bin Jaffar. There is nothing in

the  record to show that the Japanese proposals  were

unwelcome to these leaders and the project  began  to

take shape. The end of the war made it abortive. Maha

Malaya was never proclaimed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wartime incident revealed the fact that among

the  Malay leadership there had already arisen a  new

nationalism which looked for a political order should

the  British and the Dutch never return, which  would

secure Malay majority rule, This was agreeable to the

Japanese  who knew well that they would never  obtain

the  allegiance or loyalty of the Chinese  community.

Singapore  under this plan was to remain  a  Japanese

naval base and colony excluded from Maha Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will thus be seen that the separation of

Singapore from Malaya devised by the British  project

of   the  Malayan  Union  agreed  with  the  abortive

Japanese  plan of Maha Malaya, a fact which certainly

did  not  escape  the notice of the Chinese.  On  the

other  hand, the Malayan Union offered the  Malays  a

great  deal  less than Maha Malaya would  have  given

them,  for  under that plan they would  have  been  a

large majority in the new State with Sumatra added to

Malaya, and Sumatra is the ancestral home of a  great

part of the present Malay population of Malaya.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to quote another

extract from Prof. Fitzgerald's short treatise:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore has always resented and deplored the

policy,  first  conceived by the Japanese  and  later

implemented by the British, by which the City on  its

relatively small island was separated from  the  rest

of  the  Malay Peninsula and treated as  a  different

community   with   lesser  political   rights.   This

separation  was  the  one  feature  of  the  abortive

Malayan Union which survived the demise of that

ill-fated  scheme.  It was also the one  feature  of  the

Malayan Union which the Chinese thoroughly detested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British could not deny their responsibility for

this  development,  but  the  reason  why  they   had

originally  separated Singapore  was  still  present.

Singapore  added  to the Federation  would  give  the

Chinese community a clear majority of the population,

and thus ultimately of the voters.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



That was pages 88 and 89. And on page 101:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Internal changes in the political representation

of  the States giving more equitable distribution  of

seats  would do something to effect such a change  of

attitude,  but  it may well be that  more  than  this

would  be  required  before  the  allegiance  of  the

younger  generation  of Chinese  is  won,  They  will

require some positive evidence that Malaysia is to be

a  progressive and increasingly democratic community;

not continue as aristocratic society dominated by the

Malay  feudal  families.  If  these  changes  do  not

materialise,  the  opposition  of  the  Chinese  will

continue  and  probably  be  intensified,  ultimately

veering  more  and more towards the  support  of  the

Communist movement.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I quote these extracts to show

the  dangers  into which we are inevitably  going  to

slide  if  we  begin to think in terms of  race  arid

racial  hegemony. Hence the recurring theme of

multi-racialism,   of   tolerance,  of  understanding   and

sympathy,  and forbearance of other people's  habits,

customs, susceptibilities. If, on the Singapore half,

account is taken only of the Singapore sector of this

one  people, then the solution that will  be  derived

out  of  that one sector will be very different  from

the  solution which will be derived `if we take  into

account  the  whole. And the very different  solution

attempted here, based on the demographic features  of

Singapore,  will  in turn act as a spur  to  contrary

measures  being taken on the other side;  and  so  it

could  go on until inevitable conflict. Conflict  not

only  between two independent and sovereign  nations,

but  between  two  independent and sovereign  nations

both with plural societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are no longer in a position to decide or in any

way  to  influence directly the course  of  political

events in Malaysia. That is the price of independence

for Singapore. But we would be dishonest to ourselves

if  we  did  not express a profound interest  in  the

policies  and the consequences of such policies  upon

the relationship between the communities in Malaysia,

which would, in turn, help to influence attitudes and

relationships  between communities in Singapore.  The

future  is  more  fraught  with  danger  than  before

separation -- the long-term future -- for if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



there  is a failure to understand this nexus  between

us,  then  it is extremely easy for one to  embarrass

and to influence attitudes and policies in the other,

which,   as  I  have  said,  must  end  up   in   the

polarisation of two opposing attitudes based  on  two

opposing   assumptions   of  superiority   of   race,

language, and culture, which can only spell  disaster

for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whilst we have no control over events there,

independence  has  given us a unique  opportunity  to

order  our  way of life, and I would like to  believe

that  the  two years we spent in Malaysia  are  years

which  will not be easily forgotten, years  in  which

the  people of migrant stock here who are a  majority

learnt  of  the  terrors  and  the  follies  and  the

bitterness which is generated when one group tries to

assert  its dominance over the other on the basis  of

one  race, one language, one religion. It is  because

of  this that my colleagues and I were determined, as

from  the moment of separation, that this lesson will

never   be   forgotten.  So  it  is  that  into   the

Constitution  of  the Republic of Singapore  will  be

built  safeguards, in so far as the  human  mind  can

devise  means whereby the conglomeration of  numbers,

of  likeness, as a result of affinities  of  race  or

language  or  culture,  shall  never  work   to   the

detriment  of those who, by the accident of  history,

find  themselves  in  minority groups  in  Singapore.

There  will  be this Commission which will  hear  the

views of all the minority communities. It may well be

that their recommendations would be sufficiently wide

to  ensure  not only that individuals  shall  not  be

penalised  or  discriminated against  by  reasons  of

race,  language or culture, but also that their views

should  always  be  taken  into  consideration   when

formulating  policies which affect  their  collective

interest.  It is more than just an idealistic  desire

to create a just new world that has motivated us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a vested interest in

multi-racialism  and  a  secular   State,   for   the

antithesis  of multi-racialism and the antithesis  of

secularism hold perils of enormous magnitude not just

for the people living in South-East Asia,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



but  dangers of involvement by bigger  powers  who

see   in  such  a  conflict  fertile  ground   for

exploitation of either ideological or other  power

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future is not ours to see, Mr Speaker, Sir,

but  we  can  safely conclude that there  are  two

possible   trends  in  which  events  can   unfold

themselves. One, the emergence in one half helping

the  emergence  in the other half  of  a  tolerant

society not based on the concepts of exclusiveness

of   race,  language,  religion,  which  means  an

ultimate    re-association,   a   political

re-association,  of  the parts  which  form  the  one

larger federation of which we were a member  until

so  recently; and the other a trend towards a bias

and  emphasis on exclusiveness of race,  language,

religion,  which  must  have fissiparous  effects,

divisive  effects,  on  the  other.  There  is  an

element of urgency in this and we are reassured to

see  an  air  of more confidence in  dealing  with

problems of language and culture now that  we  are

out  of  Malaysia. This in turn helps  us  in  our

solution of the problems on this side. For  us  we

can  only  hope that ultimately our policies  will

also  be  able to help our neighbours in  reaching

similar rational adjustments in their own domestic

arrangements.  In the meantime,  the  business  of

life and administration has to go on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to go into the figures given by my

colleague,  the  Minister for Finance,  yesterday,

but I would like to add this comment, that however

important  statistics are in giving weight  to  an

argument or to demonstrate the validity of certain

premises,  they  are never able in  themselves  to

give a complete picture of what the performance is

going  to  be,  for they fail to bring  forth  one

important  quality  --- the effectiveness  of  the

digits  of the units that the statistics comprise.

Sir,  we  are  nearly two million  people  ---  1.9

million --- in an island of 224 square miles  with

a few adjacent islands. The statistics do not tell

the   world   the   factor  that  really   decides

performance, the quality of each individual digit,

the  intensity of the effort that the  digits  are

capable of,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



and  the  efficacy of the framework  within  which

they  can  be  marshalled and organised  for  high

performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, survival has always been hazardous. We

sought  to  make  it  less so by seeking  the  larger

framework  of  Malaysia, but it was  not  to  be.  We

are  on  our  own,  not unfriendless,  not  helpless,

but  nevertheless  in  the  centre  of  an  extremely

tumultuous  arena  of conflict. Our survival  depends

upon   our  capacity  first  to  discern  where   the

dangers  are  for  us  as  a  distinct  and  separate

community  in  South-East  Asia;  and,  second,   our

ability  to  convince  the bigger  powers  interested

in  this  region  that it is in  their  interests  to

ensure  our  separate  survival,  and  in  the   end,

whatever   happens,  to  ensure  that  we  have   got

enough  will  and capacity to see that  no  policies,

no  solutions, are attempted which will  destroy  our

right  to  be ourselves in this corner of  South-East

Asia.  Whilst  we  are  unable to  say,  having  gone

through  so  many changes in a matter of  two  years,

what  will happen in the next two years, I  think  we

can  safely  predict  that  in  two  decades,  either

there    is    a   tolerant   multi-racial    society

comprising  us  in this region, or this  will  be  an

area  of  constant strife, very much  like  what  the

Balkan  States  were  before  and  after  the   First

World  War.  We  are  here  in  South-East  Asia  for

better  or  for worse, and we are here to  stay.  Our

policies  are  designed  to  ensure  that   we   stay

peacefully  in  South-East Asia in accord  and  amity

with  our  neighbours, but with  a  right  to  decide

how  we  order our own lives in our own  home.  Every

action,  every  policy,  must  be  decided  by   this

yardstick.  Any  policy  which  endangers  our

long-term   interests   as   a   separate   and   distinct

community  in  this  region  must  be  eschewed.  Any

act,  any  programme, any decision  which  will  help

to  secure  a more enduring future for ourselves  and

our   progeny   in  this  region  must   be   pursued

whatever  the  sacrifice. We  have  not  sought  this

particular  formula of survival, but it  is  now  the

basis   on   which   we   move  forward;   and   with

independence  comes  an  independence  of  action  in

policy and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



planning which can help establish that enduring basis

for   ourselves  in  South-East  Asia.  It  is   with

confidence  -  a  confidence born  out  of  the  past

performance  of  our people - that  we  feel  we  can

overcome  problems of economic development,  problems

of  unemployment. But in the other  wider  fields  of

inter-racial harmony and tolerance, there are so many

other factors that even though we are independent, we

have  not got an exclusive prerogative to decide what

is  to  be  that  relationship even between  our  own

citizens. For as I have said, Mr Speaker, Sir, there

are  other factors, factors outside our dispensation,

which  can affect our own position. But whatever  the

result will be, we would like those who come after us

to  believe, and to have grounds for believing,  that

we  did not leave a stone unturned in seeking a  just

and  enduring future for all the people who  made  up

the  society  - those who were here when the  British

came,  those  who  came  when  the  British  were  in

control, and those who are willy-nilly now rooted  in

this  corner  of South-East Asia and whose  destinies

are interwoven - whatever we would have wished it  to

be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion*

standing in my name.



<hr size="2" noshade>



*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That the following Address in reply to the speech of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of Singapore, express our

thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which

he delivered on behalf of the Government at the opening

of the present Session of this Assembly.".'



<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, in support of the Address of Thanks  to

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech, I wish to say  a

few words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 9th August, 1965, Singapore has become an

independent  and  sovereign  State,  separated   from

Malaysia. As an independent State, Singapore  has  to

be  very  careful henceforth in seeking  defence  aid

from  our neighbouring countries. I believe that  the

people of Singapore do not wish to see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



history  repeated  as  regards  the  incidents  which

occurred in July and September 1964 during which time

the  multi-racial people of Singapore lived in  fear.

This  was because there were ultras and communalistic

elements. When Singapore was in Malaysia, the  Police

were  unable to give their co-operation to Singapore.

I  am sure that Singapore can safeguard its integrity

and  Singapore's  armed forces must  be  expanded  by

accepting  more volunteers comprising the  people  of

Singapore.  Singapore  is a  young,  independent  and

sovereign  State and it has the capacity to  maintain

peace and security. Since the separation of Singapore

from  Malaysia, conditions in Singapore have improved

and the people are living in peace and harmony on the

best  of  terms  among  themselves.  The  communalist

elements have begun to fear this fact since Singapore

became  an  independent  and  sovereign  State.  They

realise  that  their safety cannot be  guaranteed  as

internal  security  is  now  in  the  hands  of   the

Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing development in Singapore has won the

praise  of  the world. Also the achievements  of  the

Government  for  the people. Only recently,  U.M.N.O.

has  organised a Housing Trust to buy flats built  by

the Singapore Housing Board. But previously, U.M.N.O.

leaders did say that the flats built by the people of

Singapore  were  fit for birds and  that  the  Malays

could not adapt themselves to live in them. But today

we are thankful that they have changed their attitude

and  that  they,  especially those in Geylang  Serai,

including,  of course, U.M.N.O. Malays, are  rushing

to live in flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, Tun Razak, the Deputy Prime

Minister  of Malaysia, condemned the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's Speech in the Utusan Melayu. He said that it

was an old film. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



they  will  realise  that with the  victory  achieved

recently in the by-election in Rahang ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, It is not part of His

Excellency's Speech to the Assembly. Will the  Member

please   confine  his  remarks  to  His  Excellency's

Speech?



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): This proves

that  the people of Malaysia are aware that what  the

people  of Singapore have achieved will be  good  for

them.  For the people of Singapore are aware now  and

they  do not want the people to suffer any longer.  I

support the motion in the name of the Prime Minister.



<br><br>4.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  do hope that all hon. Members on this side of  the

House  will  express their sincere gratitude  to  His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his  Speech

delivered  at  the opening of the first parliamentary

session  of independent Singapore on the 8th of  this

month.  I  think our presence here today  harhours  a

similar  if  not the same degree of appreciation  for

His  Excellency who has painstakingly endeavoured  to

present,  not only to us in this Parliament here  but

also  to  the people outside this House, the  present

circumstances of Singapore in its actual  perspective

arising  from its secession from Malaysia on the  9th

of  August this year. Mr Speaker, Sir, we are  proud

to  be  Members of our Assembly which has now  become

our   Parliament as a consequence of recent

constitutional changes, an Assembly which has  passed

effective  laws  and improved on existing  ones.  Our

Government has emerged in Asia as one which has  been

most  effective, farsighted, impartial  and  able  to

withstand  the  strains of the  socialist  democratic

process in the past few years, during which period no

other  Government could have achieved greater results

in  the  field of housing, social welfare or even  in

fostering  diverse cultural activities  in  a

multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-lingual society. As

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



is  now  a newly independent and sovereign State,  no

doubt we have to encounter many more difficulties and

problems.  We  can  overcome these difficulties  with

tolerance,  courage, intelligence and  tact.  In  the

past  six  years, the people of Singapore  have  gone

through  many  adversities and  withstood  a  lot  of

hardships.  We  have  had in our midst  anti-national

elements creating subversive activities. We have  had

Indonesian   confrontation,   racial   agitation   by

communalists,  political pressures and  now  we  have

economic pressures from Malaysia. For years  we  have

shown  that we are a determined people and are  ready

to  stand  up  and fight for our rights to  live  and

survive. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that  we

will  ultimately survive if we pool all our resources

together.  The  people  of  Singapore  have  courage,

strength,  tolerance and ability to work hard  for  a

better future for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the normal practice in this Parliament for

Government Members, particularly the Backbenchers, to

praise  the  Government  for  its  policies.  But   a

deviation   from  this  may  seem  proper   for   the

Government  Backbenchers to criticise the  Government

on its shortcomings as has just been mentioned by our

Prime  Minister earlier. I have therefore taken  this

opportunity to say a few humble lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I wish to dwell on the subject of

local  infant industries. With the Common  Market  in

Malaysia   not  successfully  obtained   because   of

separation, our Government has seen fit to  establish

good  relationships with Afro-Asian countries  in  an

attempt  to  gain their friendship and, at  the  same

time, establish trade links for our export trade.  To

he  self-sufficient in our industries is no  good  to

the  economic growth of our country. A nation thrives

well  on its abilities of exports over imports. There

will be no difficulty in exporting local products  to

countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia,  New

Zealand or Afro-Asian countries. In order to share  a

fraction  of their domestic markets for our products,

the  quality  and price of our export goods  must  be

competitive  if  not superior. In this  respect,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the establishment of an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



Export  Quality  Control similar to that  set  up  by

advanced  countries  like  Japan,  the  U.S.A.,   the

People's  Republic of China, etc., is  essential  and

necessary so as to lay down the standards of  quality

of  local  products and to regulate the qualities  of

goods  before exporting to foreign countries. As  far

as  I know, the Singapore Institute of Management, in

co-operation with the Economic Development Board,  is

imparting  knowledge in quality control to managerial

executives of local factories and firms. There should

be  an extension towards setting up a Quality Control

Board  for  export goods. It must be competitive  and

not  just  a party dependent on the favour  of  other

countries  for their share of markets. That  is  more

practical and permanent in nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps our Government may wish to reconsider the

encouragement of cottage industries which thrive well

in  Hongkong  and  Japan. Goods are first  made  with

materials by machines to become component parts,  and

are  then subsequently assembled at home on a

piece-rate  basis  manually. This type of industries  would

benefit more persons instead of being confined  to  a

few persons at work in the factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social amenities, it is the desire of the

people who live in flats to see more playgrounds  for

their  children. There are many vacant grounds around

Housing   and  Development  Board  flats  in  various

housing   estates,  but  very  few  have   playground

outfits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic circles can be turned into beautiful spots

if  fountains are built on them. Improvements to  the

existing  parks should also be considered.  In  fact,

there  is  plenty more that the Parks and  Recreation

Division of the Ministry of Social Affairs can do  to

make  our  country  beautiful  and  attractive,   for

tourism  to  prosper alongside with other trades  and

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Welfare aids are aimed at assisting

unemployed families to subsist in their living.  They

are  not meant to encourage recipients to be lazy and

idle  and  rely  on  Government  for  subsistence  of

living. The amounts in grant are considerably low and

it is not an uncommon thing that some recipients take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



home  some  crafts  from light  industries,  such  as

assembling paper bags, boxes, etc. Although the extra

incomes  are  always low, it is more often  than  not

that  their social welfare aids are cut or terminated

upon  their  being discovered by the  Social  Welfare

Department. This being the case, it is hoped that the

Social Welfare aid schemes could be amended so as  to

allow  these  recipients to earn such meagre  incomes

without affecting their public assistance. Apart from

the  above suggestions, Mr Speaker, Sir, it  is  the

duty  of  every Government Backbencher to render  his

full  support  to  the policy of  the  Government.  I

hereby  pledge  my  support to our Right  Hon.  Prime

Minister's  motion of thanks to the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's policy speech with full sincerity.



<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let

me  at  the  very  outset express my  deep  sense  of

gratitude   to   the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara   for

delivering a most illuminating policy speech in  this

House  which,  apart from demonstrating the  strength

and resilience of Singapore's economy, also holds out

hopes  for a bright and prosperous future. I can  see

empty  rows  facing  me  which perhaps  furnish  some

indication  of  the  mental  confusion  and   vacuity

besetting certain Members who are thereby  not  in  a

position  to  make an analysis of the speech  of  the

Head  of State. But I do not rule out the possibility

that  the silence of the Opposition may signify  full

agreement  with  the  policy  of  the  Government  as

propounded in the policy speech of the Head of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While perusing in detail the highly imaginative and

constructive approach of the Government  towards  the

economic ills of the nation, I appreciate more  fully

the  fact that the policy speech is well set  against

the  backdrop  of  reality and the  determination  to

survive.  I  hope that this spirit will be maintained

throughout the coming year and by this time next year

the  Government  in  all probability  will  be  in  a

position to state in categorical terms that they have

made considerable progress and achieved the target in

record time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the ejection of Singapore and the

economic  boycott  of  this island  by  our  powerful

neighbour  has done immense injury to the economy  in

addition   to   that  resulting  from  the   economic

confrontation  and blockade on total  entrepot  trade

imposed by Indonesia. But I am indeed pleased to note

that  during  the  past  few months  the  Government,

instead  of adopting a defeatist attitude,  continues

to  implement  its programme of industrialisation  in

keeping with its avowed objective of achieving a more

just and equal society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in this "pilgrimage towards progress"

is  bound to bring about favourable repercussions  in

neighbouring areas which in turn will accelerate  the

pace  of  a social and political revolution in  those

States   for   the  establishment  of  a   democratic

socialist society. In this way, the policy speech  of

the   Head  of  State  has  to  be  viewed  in   this

perspective  and it is my intention  to  put  forward

constructive suggestions which might perhaps make  it

more  convenient and comparatively easier  to  attain

our objective of a welfare State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, the Head of State has reiterated

the  Government's policy to promote  a  healthy

non-Communist   trade  union  movement  as  an  essential

element in our economic life. I must congratulate the

Government on not only being consistent in  promoting

healthy  trade  unionism but also in providing  every

possible  assistance  to us in our  struggle  against

unscrupulous employers who are out to exploit labour.

Further,  as  a  result  of the  progressive  measure

adopted  by the Government, the oft-quoted expression

"industrial peace with justice" has received of  late

an  additional significant meaning. The establishment

of  the State Economic Consultative Council with full

representation  from  labour,  management   and   the

Government, has further enhanced the prestige of this

nation,  apart from providing the necessary machinery

at  the highest level to minimise industrial friction

at its very source. We hope frequent meetings of this

Council  will be held so that general policy  matters

pertaining  to labour-management which are  bound  to

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



repercussions  in  the  industrial  front  would   be

thrashed  out  in  order to reach a common  basis  of

understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the trade union movement will continue to be

the  watchdogs in preventing subversive  forces  from

disrupting  our solidarity or slashing  the  existing

wages.  In this connection, I would like to bring  to

the  notice  of the Prime Minister that his  advocacy

for  wage  restraint  has been mis-interpreted  by  a

number of bosses of established firms. These business

houses  which continue to declare high dividends  are

nowadays reluctant to entertain either the reasonable

wage  claims of the workers or their demands  for  an

enhanced bonus in order to bring it in line with  the

general industrial pattern in Singapore. In the  case

of  such firms, I cannot understand why there  should

be any restraint on the part of the workers. I should

he  very  much  obliged if the Prime  Minister  would

qualify  his  statement  and express  in  categorical

terms  that  he  did not mean such interpretation  as

certain  employers have placed on his speech, it  is

most  unfair  that  the employers should  double  and

treble   their  profit  margin,  while  denying   the

legitimate  rights  of the working  class  and  their

standard wages and fringe benefits. An explanation by

the  Prime  Minister to this effect will  dispel  the

fears  of  the  working class and  also  prevent  the

employers  from capitalising on the Prime  Minister's

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would also like to remind the

Government  of  its  promise to  utilise  the  entire

amount  collected as payroll tax for the  benefit  of

the  workers. I would suggest the introduction of  an

insurance scheme for the workers with the payroll tax

forming   a  common  pool  together  with  an   equal

contribution  from the workers and the Government  to

match  the employer's contribution. Such an insurance

scheme is bound to be beneficial to the working class

in  Singapore  and likely to serve  as  a  model  for

others to follow. I hope the Minister for Labour will

give  due  consideration and come  out  with  a  plan

sooner  or later incorporating these ideas. When  the

workers  are told to make sacrifices for  the  larger

interest  of the nation, it is the responsibility  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



pro-labour  Government not to neglect the welfare  of

labour.  Only under such condition where the  welfare

of  labour is safeguarded through securing employment

for  workers and maintaining wage increases  in  line

with  the  rising  cost of living can  we  expect  or

demand an increase in productivity from labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has

also   touched  on  the  education  policy   of   the

Government which should naturally be consistent  with

the  promotion  of  education in  all  four  language

streams. Of course, as usual the Communists  will  be

there  to  advocate a chauvinist approach and  incite

racial  feelings  under one pretext or  another.  The

Nanyang episode and the unfortunate incidents in  the

campus  exploited  by the Barisan Sosialis  are  well

known  to the Members of this House. Nevertheless,  I

would  like to make a number of references to  Nantah

since  it  appears  to  be  a  corner-stone  of   our

education policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some two months ago, we witnessed the sad and sorry

spectacle  of innocent teenagers at Nantah being  led

astray  by unscrupulous political elements  who  were

out  to destroy this citadel of Chinese language  and

culture  in  South-East Asia, under  the  pretext  of

preserving and consolidating Chinese culture. It  was

obvious  that the hidden hand behind this hooliganism

and   mob   violence   was  that   of   the   Barisan

opportunists, who had amply demonstrated in the  past

that they desire to convert Nanyang University into a

stronghold  for  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   with   the

intention  of  perpetuating a system  by  which  more

cadres  to the Communist cause would be recruited  at

this "Temple of learning".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all began with the capture of the student body

within  the  campus and the continual terrorising  of

the  academic  staff by a clique of unruly  elements,

who  claimed  themselves to be  students  or  student

leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government naturally could not permit such a

situation to develop whereby the Government continues

to  dump  millions of taxpayers' dollars in order  to

produce  elements with a crude mixture of  chauvinism

and Communism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



When  the  Government began their  spring-cleaning  a

couple  of  years  ago,  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  who

realised perhaps that their base or foundation  would

be  subjected  to  a  thorough shake-up,  decided  to

encourage  the innocent undergraduates to  resort  to

arson   and  plunder  with  a  view  to  making   the

Government kow-tow to their subversive ends. But  the

Government   was   determined  to   checkmate   these

adventurers,  and to maintain law and order,  thereby

preserving the democratic way of life in this  island

State.  Sir, the swift and immediate response of  the

Government  and the lukewarm support of  the  general

student  body caught the Barisan Sosialis by surprise

and  they were forced by circumstances including, not

the least of all, the hostility from the general body

at Nantah, to make a most unceremonious exit from the

precincts of the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communists and communalists are noted for their

perseverance   and  the  Barisan  Sosialis   are   no

exception  to  this rule. After  a  lapse  of  a  few

months,  the  clique  began  to  operate  within  the

campus, and under their instigation a second round of

violence took place in Nantah which resulted  in  the

arrest of the Barisan ring leaders within the campus.

Peace prevailed once again at Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the people of Singapore and those who are aware

of  the  modus operandi of the Barisan Sosialis  were

convinced  that  the last word was not  said  on  the

entire  episode. Educationists and political  pundits

were predicting a final round with the Barisan before

political  opportunists can be completely  eliminated

from  this institute of higher learning so  that  the

undergrads can continue with their academic  pursuits

without  being subjected to relentless and systematic

persecution  at  the hands of those  who  follow  and

believe in operations essentially geared to Communism

and communalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it was not a surprise that last month the

Barisan   struck  again  at  Nantah  and  this   time

ostensibly  to preserve Chinese language and  culture

which,  according to them, was ignored  in  the  Wang

Gung-Wu Report. Under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



the  leadership  of  the  Barisan,  we  witnessed   a

microscopic  minority  of so-called  student  leaders

giving  instructions to the professors and the

Vice-Chancellor  on  how  they  should  reorientate  their

thinking  and  revise the syllabus in tune  with  the

coloured   views  and  muddled  thinking   of   these

teenagers.  In other words, educationists should  not

be   the   people   to  take  a  decision   or   make

recommendations  on  syllabus  or  curriculum  hut  a

handful   of   immature  individuals,  who   in   all

probability  take their instructions  from  political

elements who continue to play "ducks and drakes" with

the interests of the student population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the P.A.P. have demonstrated in the past

and  will  continue to demonstrate in the future  too

that  we are always willing to meet any challenge  on

the political plane from any opposition either by the

communalists  or by the Communists. But  the  Barisan

Sosialis, after being mauled in the political  arena,

has  turned  out to he so naive as to  stoop  to  the

level  of enlisting the support of the teenage  group

to fight the P.A.P. Perhaps they can no longer expect

any  support from the adults of Singapore  that  they

have  to  pick on the universities, secondary schools

and  perhaps  kindergartens too in  order  to  ensure

their  own  political existence.  They  can  be  rest

assured  that  the  P.A.P. is  unlikely  to   permit

chauvinism and Communism to pollute the atmosphere of

the  higher institutes of learning in the  State  and

that  sooner  or  later appropriate remedial  actions

will  he taken to eliminate this cancer from the body

politic  of  Singapore.  The  Barisan  infection  can

continue  to do damage until such time, hut  we  hope

the suffering will not be long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that quite a few Nanyang undergrads

who  could  have become useful citizens  have  fallen

prey  to  the  evil designs of the Barisan.  Recently

three of them who had been in detention were released

and their statements after their release should serve

as  an  eye-opener to those who continue to be swayed

by  the Barisan propaganda. These three persons  have

categorically stated the folly of resorting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



to  Communist  and violent methods  with  a  view  to

establishing  the  dictatorship of  the  proletariat.

They now subscribe to the principle of democracy, and

it  is earnestly hoped that they will turn out to  be

responsible  and useful citizens, contributing  their

respective shares towards the prosperity and progress

of  this  nation. I hope that some of  the  misguided

youths,  who  are  led  by the nose  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  would  also  take time  off  to  read  the

statements and other pronouncements made by those who

have  passed through the stage of Communism and  come

out of it with repentance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan is there not to preserve Chinese

culture but to destroy it. It might not be a surprise

to  me if the recent incidents at Nantah had given an

impression  to the outside world that chauvinism  had

got  the upper hand in Singapore. In other words,  if

at  all any group, political Party or clique had done

any  irreparable  damage to the Chinese  race,  their

language and culture, it is the Barisan Sosialis  and

their  henchmen  in  Nantah.  Their  persistence  and

continued efforts definitely give an impression  that

they  are  determined to strike at the very roots  of

our concept of a multi-racial society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is claimed by this motley crowd who demonstrated

both  at  Nantah and the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce

recently  that  the  introduction  of  English  would

destroy   this  Chinese  language  university.   They

conveniently  forgot for a moment that  Chinese  will

continue  to be the medium of instruction at  Nantah,

and  English  takes  only  a secondary  position.  In

short,  while preserving Chinese culture and language

the  implementation and recommendation  of  the  Wang

Gung-Wu  Report would only enhance Nantah and provide

the  graduates with a better opportunity,  especially

when  they become bilingual, by being fully  equipped

with  the  knowledge of English in  this  multiracial

society  in addition to their mother tongue (Chinese)

so  that they can compete successfully in both public

and  private sectors along with the graduates of  the

University of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a limit to which the public sector can

encourage and absorb Nanyang graduates, and  if  they

are  not well-versed in either English or Malay,  the

private   sector  is  unlikely  to  employ  them   in

preference   to   the   graduates   of   the    other

universities. Thus, at this juncture the Nanyang boys

are placed at a most disadvantageous position, and we

feel  that  the Wang Gung-Wu Report would  provide  a

solution,  thereby enabling Nantah to cope  with  the

present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Barisan follow a policy of suicide. We know

why  they  advocate the continuance of  the  existing

policy  of  Nantah, since it would fit in with  their

general  pattern  to  recruit frustrated,  unemployed

intellectuals and, as far as possible, cadres for the

cause  of Communism and the violent overthrow of  the

popular  democratic regime. And we  can  assure  them

that  we  are  determined to  foil  this  attempt  to

establish  a  dictatorship  in  this  island   State.

Nanyang must prosper and it will continue to do so in

spite of interference from political opportunists and

communalistic Communist elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese language and culture are not the property

of  a  clique  or a group. It can exist and  it  will

continue to be encouraged by this Government  at  all

costs,  Barisan or no Barisan. I wish the  Opposition

will  find  new  pastures  for  agitation  and  leave

Chinese language and culture alone. There are men  of

eminence,  educationists, men of letters and  others,

who  can take care of Chinese culture. We do not need

any assistance from the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while touching on the education policy of the

Government, I take this opportunity to refer  to  the

English language stream which continues to be unhappy

about the delay in the implementation of many of  the

assurances  given  by the Minister for  Education  as

well  as  officials  of the Education  Ministry.  The

anomalies  in  the salary structure of  the  teaching

service  are  not  conducive  to  the  promotion   of

goodwill and understanding among the teaching  staff,

and  if  the Government feels that the Report of  the

Salaries Commission is unlikely to come out in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



the   near  future,  it  should  take  immediate  and

appropriate measures to redress the grievances of the

teaching staff. Dissatisfied teachers cannot give  of

their   best.  In  the  end,  the  victims   of   the

Government's  procrastination would  be  the  younger

generations of this country. Hence, I would  like  to

request the Minister for Education to look into these

matters and do the needful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a casual glance at the policy

speech  enables  us  to appreciate  the  Government's

point of view in introducing workers' permits with  a

view to preventing non-Singapore citizens from across

the  Causeway  from  depriving our  citizens  of  the

opportunity in the employment field and other  social

benefits.  Nevertheless, I would like to request  the

Government to direct the officials concerned  not  to

be  too strict in the application of this rule  since

Singapore  citizens  might have  dependants  who  are

Malaysians. Thus, I hope every case will  be  treated

on  the basis of individual merit since our intention

is  not  to  antagonise any group or section  of  the

population,   but  to  promote  mutual  understanding

between  Malaysia  and Singapore so  that  sooner  or

later  we  will  be in a position to share  a  common

destiny.  Of course, we have to protect our interests

at  all costs, and to this extent the Government must

carry  out  its  responsibility to our citizens.  But

sufficient  room should be given to the officials  to

manoeuvre so that, while not neglecting the  interest

of  our  citizens, we would be able to win  over  the

people living across the Causeway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this speech it is not physically possible for me

to  analyse  all the salient features in  the  policy

speech. I have only touched on certain problems which

I   feel   should   be  tackled  with   caution   and

understanding so that we will not fall or falter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that by next year the Head

of  State  will be able to inform this House  of  our

achievements during the course of the year. I hope it

will further indicate a completion of the first phase

of our struggle for survival.

<br><br>5.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as our country is holding  its  first

parliamentary  sitting today, we  are  going  through

various feelings - the same feelings which we had  on

the  9th of August when Singapore became independent.

We are filled with a sense of pride, confidence,

self-reliance  and courage. We have confidence because  we

have the support of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



the  people. This is not something that only  happens

today,  but is something that has a historical  basis

of 11 years. We must have courage, because we are not

working in a no-man's-land in facing various kinds of

enemies, including the racialists and the Communists.

We must not kow-tow to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has

given  us  great  encouragement. In the  four  months

since   Singapore  achieved  independence,  we   have

experienced   the  initial  stages   of   trials   in

independence  and  nation-building.  In  these   four

months  we have not met with troubles such as  racial

disputes.  This  fully goes to show that  our  people

have   accepted   the  leadership   of'   our   Party

government,  and have at the same time  manifested  a

high degree of co-operation. I believe the growth  in

the strength of patriotism is a trend that cannot  be

stopped.  We all know that the opposite of patriotism

is  treason,  just as the one Party that opposes  the

P.A.P, is   the  Barisan  Sosialis.  The  Barisan's

sabotage  action  against  our  national  defence  is

something  that cannot he pardoned. They  oppose  the

setting up of British bases in Singapore. Their  main

purpose is to disarm Singapore. They are also opposed

to  the setting up of a volunteer force in Singapore.

This  is  another  manifestation of their  intrigues.

When  lunatics  know only how to  put  forth  lunatic

slogans,  we  must  in addition be on  guard  against

their destructive acts and sabotage. We must also  go

a  step  further to crush their intrigues.  Let  them

find out that they are only the children of Satan. We

want  to  brandish our sword of justice and cut  them

down, root and all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our feelings can be said to be the continuation of

the  feelings which we had on the 9th of  August.  In

the  four months past we have been prepared  to  face

them.  We  are  ready  for the  battle  to  meet  the

traitors to this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

shows  our determination. At the same time,  it  also

shows  that  we  are  fully prepared  to  accept  the

onerous  task  put  on  us by the  people.  We  fully

believe that such a tiny thing,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



like  the  Barisan Sosialis, however it may struggle,

cannot withstand the collective attack by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech by His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara merits our highest respect and

gratitude.  We want to show our determination  to  go

according  to this policy speech and advance  forward

firmly  in  order to bring to fruition the future  we

have  in  mind, which will be a golden, shining  era.

The  record of the P.A.P.'s achievements has been one

of  victory  to  victory  -  from  one  glorious  era

marching towards another more glorious era.  But  the

record  of  the Barisan Sosialis is one of  going  to

hell,  from  the 16th floor onto the  17th  floor  of

hell,  and further from the 17th floor onto the  18th

floor of hell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, here I would like to express my

support to the Motion by the Prime Minister.



<br><br>5.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am here to speak  only  on  a  few

selected items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically our State has achieved praiseworthy

progress.  Apart  from that, I have  nothing  to  say

regarding Economics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Foreign Affairs, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has

not mentioned anything in detail and I think there is

a   good  reason  for  that  too.  Our  State,  after

achieving   independence,  is   going   to   function

independently for the first time in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fighting colonialism successfully, the Afro-Asian countries are struggling hard to establish a

new  society, and we should co-operate with them.  At

the  same  time, we should also respect the countries

which  like to establish friendly relations with  us.

We  have a non-aligned policy and our status here  is

very  important. We are in a very strategic position;

so  if  we get involved with the big powers, it  will

bring ruin not only to us but to the whole world. Our

Government,  which has already announced  its  policy

very   clearly,  will,  I  hope,  establish   foreign

missions in friendly countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next I wish to touch upon

Security  and  Defence. We have already overcome  the

pro-Communist elements and the anti-national elements

internally, but this alone is not enough. We have  to

fight  against  the  external enemies.  In  order  to

facilitate this, the Government has already tabled an

Army Bill. I know this is going to cause a burden  to

our citizens, but as an independent State we have  to

bear  this burden since it is our duty to defend  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to speak about the duties of our

Government.  In  Housing we have achieved  very  much

success,  and we are among the advanced countries  in

this  respect. Foreign visitors who come to our State

are praising our housing programmes. Even our hostile

neighbours  do  not  hesitate to praise  our  efforts

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government which has increased the housing

facilities should also look into other fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now talking about agricultural land. We have

limited   agricultural   land   in   Singapore.   The

Government, which is encouraging the building of more

factories   to  give  employment  to  the  increasing

population,  should also concentrate its  efforts  on

reclamation  of land for agriculture.  We  cannot  be

looking for favours from other countries to supply us

food.  We  should be self-sufficient in this respect.

So I hope the Government will concentrate its efforts

in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Mr Speaker, I wish to touch on

rural development. The Yang di-Pertuan Negara in  his

Opening  Speech has stated that the Sungei Poyan  and

Sungei   Pandan   areas   will   be   reclaimed   for

agriculture. I think this will not satisfy our needs.

We   should   reclaim  more  land  for   agricultural

purposes.  If  we  go  on  concentrating   on   other

programmes without concentrating on this problem, the

other problems will become less and less, whereas our

food  problem will become bigger and bigger. We  have

to raise the living standard of our rural population.

I  know  that  our Government has not forgotten  them

completely.  What I wish to state here  is  that  the

facilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



or  the  privileges  that the  urban  population  are

getting  from  the  Government should  also  be  made

available  to  the  kampong  people,  who  should  be

supplied  with  more  water and electricity.  Farmers

should  be  in a position to bring their products  to

the  markets, and lot this, agricultural roads should

be  made  for them. The Veterinary Department  should

serve all corners of the State. The Government should

be very careful in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to touch on Health now. There are very few

Asian countries which have good health facilities and

our  Singapore  is one of the very few countries.  We

have  more  and more clinics now, but the crowds  are

getting  equally  big in number.  `To  overcome  this

difficulty,  I hope the Government will increase  the

number of doctors working in the clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Social Welfare is concerned, our

Government  is  competing  with  the  more   advanced

countries. Destitute and disabled persons  are  given

aid  by  the  Government. This is not found  in  most

countries. We have welfare homes for aged persons and

boys  and girls. This is one of the duties which  the

Government has to perform for the people, and it  has

shown  that  it  does not forget the people  and  its

duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Community Centres, I wish to state that

these  are  good  in  bringing people  of  all  races

together. They have facilities to exchange  views  at

these  places. I wish that the Government will extend

these good facilities to all the constituencies.  And

with this remark, I conclude my speech.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, today is the debate on the Motion of  Thanks

to  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his Speech on  8th

December. Since then until today, we have not seen  a

single  Barisan Sosialis Member present.  The  reason

why  the Opposition Barisan Sosialis could not attend

since the 8th of December is that they have nothing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



to  debate  in  this  Assembly for  the  benefit  and

welfare  of the people in Singapore. We have read  in

the  papers that the Barisan Sosialis say  they  have

boycotted  the Assembly today. In my view,  they  are

neglecting  their responsibilities  of  giving  their

views  as  representatives of  their  constituencies.

Their  constituents  had hoped that  they  could  put

forward  their views and difficulties. The people  of

Singapore  are now aware that they are being  cheated

by  the Barisan Sosialis. As we know, it is the  same

as  the  Member  for Hong Lim who had  neglected  his

responsibilities. Therefore, in the by-election,  the

voters chose a Government Member. We are prepared  at

any  time - when we face the Communists,  communalists

and  colonialists - to come here to give our opinions

and  views  for  the benefit of the  people  of  this

country.  We have fought them since 1961. We  opposed

them  when they said that we had sold out the  people

of  Singapore  and that merger was not  right.  As  a

result  of  these  actions,  they  co-operated   with

outsiders to crush what we had done from 1961 to  9th

August, 1965. However, Singapore has been pushed  out

of  Malaysia  and the Barisan Sosialis say  that  the

independence  of Singapore is not true  independence.

We  do not understand their intentions. We have  said

before,  in  our campaigns for merger, Malaysia,  the

1963  elections and the by-election at Hong Lim, that

the  Barisan  Sosialis have foreign masters.  Perhaps

one of the reasons why the Barisan Sosialis have been

absent  since 8th December, is that they  still  fear

what will happen to their friends and our neighbours.

They will join together sometime later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us see what are our responsibilities

to  this  country. No matter who our enemies are  and

what their parties are, so long as we are ready to do

our  duty  to  our people in achieving a multi-racial

society,  we can live happily. I say so, Mr Speaker,

because  every community, not only in Singapore,  but

also  in the world, must co-operate with one another,

co-operation  between  one country  and  another.  In

other words, if our country wants to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



survive, the people must co-operate with one  another

so  that the country can progress. So is our relation

with  other  countries. We are not like  the  Barisan

Sosialis  who  are by themselves.  "If  we  rule  the

country, we can prosper." That is the wrong view.  We

have reckoned that if we want to live, we should

co-operate with one another. Until today, we believe and

hope  that our neighbouring countries will give their

services to the people of Singapore and we will  also

give  our services to the neighbouring countries.  It

is  so  because, as I have said, countries must  have

relations with one another. There are leaders who  do

not  believe that a multi-racial society can survive.

They   think   that  just  because   a   country   is

independent,  it  can  live in peace  and  prosperity

without co-operating with other countries. We believe

that  world opinion will not agree with that. By such

stupid  actions, the result would be that the  people

of   Singapore,  including  myself,  who  come   from

neighbouring countries, would become the victims.  We

as  leaders of the State should not be afraid of  any

political Party. We should be courageous. We  believe

they  are not fighting for the people of the country.

They  are fighting for their own self-interests. They

are different from the leaders of Singapore. We fight

for  the  people of this country, no matter where  we

are from or what we get. We do not have the intention

of becoming representatives of the people in order to

increase our prestige and self-interest. This is  far

from  it.  I  do  not  know.  Because  of  this,  the

Government  of  Singapore has regrettably  introduced

the  work  permit scheme, which will be  carried  out

soon.  This was not our original desire, but  it  has

been  introduced because of those people who  do  not

have  the  best  interest of  the  people  at  heart.

Because   Singapore  wishes  to  survive,  and   must

survive,  it  must  see that the  people  from  other

States who are offered jobs here must give their best

services  to  this country. Although we  are  only  a

small  island, we are prepared to work hard  for  the

prosperity of the State. For that reason, people from

other  countries  come to this place  to  earn  their

living which is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



better  than in their own countries. We do not grudge

them that provided they do useful service. But we are

not  prepared to shoulder the responsibilities  which

should  rightly  be borne by neighbouring  countries.

Because  of this, we have to find ways and  means  by

which   the   livelihood  of  our   people   can   be

safeguarded.  Every  effort is being  made  to  bring

about a Common Market, but unfortunately no agreement

has been reached in the interest of the people of the

respective  countries.  Although  these  neighbouring

countries  pay no attention to the welfare  of  their

citizens, we on our part have not given up  hope;  we

hope that something good may turn up for the good  of

all.  We hope they will realise that our efforts  are

for the benefit of us all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of nation-building, while we were keen

to co-operate with them, and facing confrontation, we

were  prepared to give our services in the  interests

of  the people, not only of our country, but also  of

our  neighbouring countries. However that may be, the

people are not aware of this and should know what has

been done by the leaders of the State. I do hope that

when  this work permit scheme is carried out, no step

would be taken to close the Causeway. I say that  the

work  permit  scheme  is for a definite  purpose.  We

should  not stop the entry of people from across  the

Causeway.  We  would like to see  prosperity  in  our

neighbouring  countries, because then the  people  in

these  countries will be able to come and  enjoy  the

sight of tall buildings and other pleasant sights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is to be such a check, we should

reconsider the matter, so that these benefits are not

lost  to  the  people of the neighbouring  countries.

Because of this, our Government finds it necessary to

have  the  work permit scheme. It has also to  impose

certain  restriction on students who are not citizens

of   Singapore.   We  know  that  the   citizens   of

neighbouring  countries come  to  Singapore  to  earn

their  living. Then they go back home to get  married

and  bring  their  wives back to  our  country.  This

places  an extra burden on our country. The  children

of such parents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



become a burden to our country. If the leaders of the

country will bear this matter in mind, then I believe

such  a scheme will not be necessary. But because  it

is not so, such a scheme becomes necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been done by both countries is inter-related and is directly connected. That is what I

have stated just now. We cannot survive in isolation.

As human beings, we must have all the necessary limbs

and  parts  of  the body. We cannot exist  merely  by

drinking  water. There must be food as well.  Without

them, we cannot live healthily. That is the way  with

life. The leaders of the countries must bear all this

in  mind  and attend to the welfare and wellbeing  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have not appeared since the

opening  of the present Session. I believe they  have

nothing to contribute to this Assembly other than  to

say  that  we are stooges of the West, and  such-like

terms.  This  is  what  they  are  good  at  in  this

Assembly.   We,   as  responsible   leaders,   debate

everything  that  is  useful and  important  for  the

welfare    of    the    people.    The    responsible

representatives of the people are here to  point  out

any   weaknesses  that  arc  to  be  found   in   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what has happened lately in the Hong

Lim  constituency. The people of Singapore have, from

time to time, proved sound in their calculations. The

welfare  of the people of this country must be  based

on sound calculations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara touched upon housing in

his Speech. We are still endeavouring to make further

progress  and to offer our services to the people  by

constructing  more  flats. We are  finding  ways  and

means  whereby  we  will be in a position  to  charge

reasonable  rates which the people of  Singapore  can

afford  to pay. It does not mean that we should  rest

on  our  laurels. But we are determined  to  progress

economically  and  if possible to  provide  "free  of

charge" flats to the people of Singapore, because we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



administer  the  funds on their behalf.  We  are  not

winning lottery stakes when we build our flats. As we

are  responsible  for public funds,  we  have  to  be

careful with our expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier on, if our economy permits,

we  will  not only build low-cost flats, but we  will

provide'  "free-of-charge"  flats  for  the   people.

Originally,   the  building  of  these   flats, was

vehemently  opposed by communalists. When we  started

to  build  them  in  areas which were  not  in  their

constituencies, they had nothing to say. But we  were

opposed  by  the  Barisan Sosialis  when  we  had  to

demolish houses occupied by Chinese farmers in  order

to  make way for flats for the welfare of the people.

When  we  built  flats  in  the  Geylang  area,   the

communalist  parties  made a fuss  because  the  land

acquired  belonged  to a group  of'  political  Party

leaders  who tried to mislead the people  by  telling

them  that these flats were fit only for pigeons,  as

has  been  said by the Member for Geylang Serai.  Now

that  the  flats  have  been built,  the  Malays  who

believe  in  a multi-racial society are  seizing  the

opportunity   to  live  in  them,  and   these   same

communalists  have  now formed a housing  society  to

purchase  flats  built by the Singapore  Government..

Originally,  they  said  that  the  Malays  were  not

accustomed  to Jive in flats because they  could  not

rear poultry and so on, and they further alleged that

such  flats  were  fit  only  for  pigeons.  But   we

maintained  that in the interests of  the  people  of

Singapore, the building of flats must be increased so

that  people  who  live in cubicles, which  adversely

affect  their  health, can live in  such  flats.  The

response from such people has been so tremendous that

the   communalist  leaders  began  to  change   their

attitude,  and  they are now buying  flats  from  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this subject, I cannot say whether the Minister

for  National Development has made a slip by  selling

houses built by the Singapore Government to the Malay

housing  society.  If  this society  wants  to  build

flats, let it first acquire land, and then build them

after which they may be sold to their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



members. They criticise the flats, but at  the  same

time  they contact the Housing Board for the  purpose

of  buying  flats!  As  the Singapore  Government  is

desirous  of assisting the Malay housing society,  it

does  not  object to the flats being bought  by  this

society. I feel this is out of place, and I hope  the

Housing  Board will be very careful in future because

in   such  matters  we  have  been  fooled   by   the

communalist  leaders. Furthermore, they  mislead  the

people   by  provoking  and  agitating  them.   Since

Singapore  was  separated from  Malaysia,  they  have

changed their stand and they no longer pose a  threat

to  our  security. In the course of  discharging  our

responsibilities  to  a  multi-racial  society   like

Singapore,  we  must  be  on the  lookout  for  these

communalists who are out to break up the unity of the

people.  Although they have formed  a  united  front,

their  main design is to create dissension among  the

various races, .and if we smack them down, the

multi-racial  society in Singapore can live  in  peace  and

happiness. In the small island of Singapore, we  must

realise  the  extent  to  which  communalism  can  be

practised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. I would like to speak on trade unions. It was stated in the policy Speech of the Yang di- Pertuan Negara that the Government will promote democratic and non-Communist trade unions to ensure the success of the non-Communist democratic trade union movement. In 1961, there was a break in the

N.T.U.C.  The  N.T.U.C. believe  that  the   workers

comprising  the various races will succeed  in  their

fight against the communalists and Communists. In our

struggle, the N.T.U.C. is the backbone. It has worked

very  hard  in order to bring about understanding  in

the  ranks  of the workers so that they  may  not  be

misled  by the communalists. During the time  of  the

referendum, we worked very hard. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



been successful in improving the lot of the people of

this country. They understand well the efforts of the

Government  to bring about a better understanding  of

the  labour  movement  in this  country.  The  Labour

Movement   has  worked  very  hard  to  improve   the

livelihood  of  the workers of this  country.  It  is

conscious  of  its  responsibility  to  help  in  the

progress and prosperity of this country. It wants  to

create a progressive society, and not a backward  one

in  the future. If we do not carry our fight into the

strongholds  of  the Opposition,  then  it  would  be

difficult for us to penetrate them. We would not know

the  stand held by Members of the Opposition. We  are

conscious of the fact that we are living in  a  multi

racial  society. Workers in the working movement  are

continually fighting against the communalists who are

opposed to the politics pursued by the P.A.P. Because

of our good intentions, we believe we will be able to

live  happily  together,  and  the  people  who   are

democratic and non-Communist will see to it that  the

country will progress and that they are not misled by

the  other Parties. I sincerely hope that the Barisan

Sosialis,  who claim that they work for the interests

of  the  people, will come forward and  really  fight

their battle in the interests of the people and bring

forth  whatever points they think they can debate  in

this  Chamber so as to benefit the people. The people

in  this country can judge for themselves which Party

is  working  for the interests of the working  class.

Any  attempt  to mislead the people would  meet  with

defeat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, I wish to say with regard to

the  Speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  that  our

task  for  the future is based on policies  that  are

workable,  as has been clearly set out in the  Speech

of the Yang di-Pertuan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



Negara.  I believe irresponsible elements would  like

to  find ways and means to mislead the people  as  to

the  true intent of the Speech of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara. Every Ministry will be able to carry out  its

policy  so  that  the corruption, and  so  on,  which

happened  years  before will not be repeated  in  the

future. Each Ministry should carry out its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



work more actively in order to achieve' the desired

end, which is for the benefit of the people.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. It is now 6.30 p.m. and
