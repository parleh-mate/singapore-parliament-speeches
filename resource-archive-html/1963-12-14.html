<div align="center"><b>RESETTLEMENT OF FARMERS LIVING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN CHOA CHU KANG ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether he is aware that the farmers living in  the

area  between 14½ milestone and 17 milestone,  Choa

Chu  Kang  Road,  have  been given  notice  by  the

Government to vacate the land they occupy; for what

purpose  is the vacated land intended to  be  used;

where  will  these farmers be resettled;  and  what

compensation,  if  any,  will  they  get  from  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj) (for the Prime Minister)</b> <i>(In Malay)</i>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the  Member

for  Choa Chu Kang is presumably referring  to  the

land  situated between 14¾  and 15¼ mile, Choa  Chu

Kang Road, which forms part of some 1,500 acres  of

State  land  set aside for use as a  public  burial

ground  and  burial reserve. Fifteen  families  - of

whom only six are families of farmers - on this site

were  served notices to quit in October. They  were

warned as early as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



May this year that they would be required to vacate

the land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land is urgently required, as all available

burial  plots in Bidadari are expected to be  taken

up by the middle of next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers have been offered land in the

resettlement  areas at 19½ mile Lim Chu  Kang  Road

and  17½  mile Lim Chu Kang Road. Both these  areas

are well suited for cultivation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation which will be awarded to these

farmers  will  vary  according  to  the  size   and

construction of the houses which they  now  occupy.

The  total  amount which will be paid to  them  has

been assessed at approximately $22,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary did not give his answer in detail ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the hon. Member should not make  any

comment  on  the answer. All he can do  is  to  ask

further questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang cannot

make  comments on the answer or lead to  a  debate.

What  he  can do is to ask a supplementary question

to  elucidate any information on which  he  is  not

clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like

to ask, to what use will the vacated land be put?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That answer has been given. It is in

the main question: "for what purpose is the vacated

land  intended  to be used;". And  I  believe  that

question  has  been answered. We  will  proceed  to

Question No. 2 - Mr Ong Lian Teng.

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE FOR SEAMEN FROM SEAFARERS' WELFARE BOARD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  what  was  the  total  number  of  seamen

receiving assistance from the Seafarers' Welfare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



Board  on  30th November, 1963, and  what  was  the

amount of assistance received by each seaman.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The number of seamen and their

dependants receiving assistance from the Seafarers'

Welfare Board on 30th November, 1963, was 641.  The

total  amount of assistance for November  1963  was

$24,043. The rates of relief are as follows:



<pre>

                                                       per month

A  seaman on relief and suffering from tuberculosis

is  given  in addition a tuberculosis allowance  of

$15  per month or a disability allowance of $10 per

month. The maximum allowance payable per family  is

$100 per month.

<div align="center"><b>VALUE OF TRADE WITH INDONESIA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what  was  the total  value  of  trade  of

Singapore with Indonesia from 1st January, 1963, to

15th  September, 1963; and what was the total value

of  trade  of  Singapore with Indonesia  from  16th

September, 1963, to 30th November, 1963.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

asked  for  details of trade between Singapore  and

Indonesia    before   confrontation    and    after

confrontation. The 1963 classified trade statistics

of  Singapore are only available up to the month of

June.  I  am therefore unable to provide  the  hon.

Member  with the details he sought. It  is  not  my

intention  to  publish in future trade  statistics,

any  details whatsoever in respect of trade between

Singapore  and  Indonesia after the 15th  September

this year. Information of this kind will be of  the

utmost  value  to  the  Indonesian  Government   in

carrying  out  its policy of economic confrontation

in the hope of bringing Malaysia down to its knees.

In  the  economic  war which  is  now  being  waged

between the two countries, this kind of information

constitutes  valuable  economic  intelligence.  The

question of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



hon.  Member is another example of how the  Barisan

Sosialis  are attempting to give aid to the  enemy.

This time they want us to provide them with ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister did not

give  us the figures we wanted. On the other  hand,

he  was  accusing the Barisan Sosialis of  abetting

enemies. Was he in order?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister was in order. A

question has been asked, and the Minister  is  free

to answer it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have to explain not only why

it  is  not  in  the public interest to  give  this

information   even   if   this   information   were

available,  I was going to point out that  this  is

just another way in which the Barisan Sosialis  are

attempting to give aid to the enemy. This time they

want  us  to  provide them with  valuable  economic

intelligence. I have not the slightest intention of

obliging  either  the  Barisan  Sosialis  or  their

Indonesian masters.

<div align="center"><b>PIONEER INDUSTRIES IN JURONG AND RED HILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number of persons newly employed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what  is  the  number  of  persons   newly

employed in pioneer industries set up in the Jurong

and Red Hill industrial sites.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member asks about the

number   of  workers  newly  employed  in   pioneer

industries set up in Jurong and Red Hill industrial

sites.  There  are  now  31 pioneer  industries  in

operation in the whole of Singapore, and the  total

employment   provided  is  3,186.   Of   these   31

industries,  seven  are sited  in  Jurong  with  an

employment  of  495,  four  in  Red  Hill  with  an

employment  of  142. The total  number  of  persons

employed in Jurong and Red Hill both in pioneer and

non-pioneer industries comes to 1,135. I  may  add,

Sir, that while the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



have  succeeded  in  creating  3,186  new  jobs  in

pioneer industries alone, the pro-Communist unions,

as  a result of political strikes or ill-considered

industrial  strikes, have caused 1,253  persons  to

lose  their jobs. In addition, another 632  persons

lost  their  jobs  in the People's Association  and

Work Brigade. You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that when I raised this point two days ago, it  was

greeted with some scepticism, and I now wish,  with

your  permission, to table detailed lists*  of  the

number  of workers who have lost their jobs because

of  strikes  by pro-Communist trade unions  in  the

former strike-happy days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents handed in to the Clerk and distributed

to hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the total number of persons who lost their

jobs  comes  to  1,885 as against  3,186  new  jobs

created in pioneer industries. The hon. Member will

doubtless  be  happy to learn that the constructive

efforts of the P.A.P. Government have been able  to

keep  ahead of the destruction caused by  the  pro-Communist unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I

am  not quite clear about the Minister's answer. He

said  the number of workers employed. Is it in  the

planning stage or are they already being employed?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> These are already working.

According  to  plans for industrial expansion,  the

number that will be working by June next year  will

be  more  than 4,600 directly employed and  another

2,000 indirectly employed, making a total of 6,600.

If  the  Member for Jalan Kayu is in some doubt,  I

would  like  to table a list of industries+ where

they are sited and the number of workers employed.

Sir,  about  the workers indirectly employed -  does

the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



mean  workers  employed  in  building  construction

work, building factories?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The figure includes workers in

factories.  It  does not include  workers  building

roads in Jurong or working in rubber estates.  That

would  be  another  few thousand,  but  you  cannot

consider them as working in the factories.

It  is  expected  that these figures  will  show  a

slight increase when schools reopen in January 1964

when  those  who did not register in 1963  will  be

registered for admission into schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from partially-aided purely religious

schools,  there are no aided schools in  the  Malay

medium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education does not register

children for admission to private schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, on

the question of aided schools in the Chinese, Malay

and  Tamil media. Can the numbers of admissions for

this year be less than those for next year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case

of  the  Malay medium, I think there is an increase

in  the  figure  for  next year  over  this  year's

figure.  The total for January 1964 will  be  4,970

and the total in 1963 is 4,640.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Chinese medium, there is a

very slight decrease. For January 1964 the total on

the  register is 17,309, whereas in 1963 the figure

is 18,836.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Tamil medium, there is also a

slight  decrease.  In  January  1964  the  expected

figure  will  be 129, whereas in 1963  it  is  274.

However,  as  I  have  said  just  now,  these  are

registered figures, they are not actual figures  of

admissions,  and  it is likely  that  when  schools

reopen  in  January 1964 there  will  be  a  slight

increase.

comment on the Tamil medium because I have not  got

the  facts with me. But in the case of the  Chinese

medium,  the  reason  for the  slight  decrease  is

because  of the Barisan Sosialis Members - like  the

Member  for  Jalan  Kayu - it is  because  of  their

ceaseless  agitation  in the Chinese  schools,  and

because of the unrest that

they have caused in the Chinese schools, so much so

that the parents of the pupils there are fed up and

many   of   them  have  decided,  although  perhaps

wrongly,  to  send  their children  to  some  other

schools.  If  the  Member  for  Jalan  Kayu  is  so

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 32 be reduced by $100.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, yesterday I quoted from the testimony

of  three  gentlemen  closely  connected  with  the

S.A.T.U. in  answer to the Barisan's challenge  to

show  that  the  Government  allegation  that   the

S.A.T.U. is Communist controlled is false or  true.

We  have  the evidence from three S.A.T.U. leaders

who  are  far  more  knowledgeable  about  S.A.T.U.

unions than any of these eight gentlemen here.  So,

I  hope,  Sir,  after this they will  at  least  be

clever enough not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



to  be  provoked by our allegation  that  they  are

Communists. The best thing is to keep quiet,  which

the  former gentlemen did, and not try to challenge

us  to try to prove they are Communists. Again  our

allegation  that  S.A.T.U. unions  are   Communist

controlled is not a bogey. It is a fact. Mr  James

Puthucheary,  Mr Woodhull and Mr  Lim  Shee  Ping

said so. If that is so and if there is evidence  to

prove    that   S.A.T.U. unions   are   Communist

controlled, then it is quite clear that in  banning

the  S.A.T.U. unions, we are not banning  ordinary

trade  unions,  but  we are banning  the  Communist

controlled outfit out to damage our economy and our

country.  Probably, Sir, they will keep on  denying

that  they  are  Communists. And  that  is  a  good

Communist. Because, Sir, in the Communist  book  of

manual, they are expected and ordered that "if  you

are  a good Communist you must deny that you are  a

Communist".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a different connotation in a debate in

the  Legislative Assembly, Vol. 16,  25th  January,

1962,  col.  707, there was a debate on  the  trade

union  issue.  I had occasion then, Sir,  to  quote

from Lenin's advice to Communists. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is necessary [for a good Communist] to agree

to any and every sacrifice and even, if need be, to

resort to all sorts of strategems, manoeuvres,  and

illegal methods, to evasions and subterfuges...'



<br><br>"Subterfuges" means lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`in order to penetrate the trade unions, to

remain  in them, and to carry on Communist work  in

them at all costs.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when hon. Members keep on denying that

S.A.T.U. trade union Communists are Communist, they

are  being good Communists. Lenin said so. You must

deny that you are a Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I hope they will be intelligent

enough  not  to deny that the S.A.T.U. unions  are

Communist controlled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having shown the S.A.T.U. unions are

Communist controlled, then it is quite obvious  why

we have to take action against them and closed them

down; not because of their trade union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



struggle.  In  so  far as trade  unions  fight  for

genuine economic issues, the Government have always

supported  them. But in so far as trade unions  are

misused  for  political and  Communist  ends,  then

those  leaders  and  those  unions  will  get  into

trouble with the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a book called Lenin on Trade

Unions  and  Revolution. The Communist unions  must

follow  the  advice and strategy of  the  Communist

leaders. They make it quite clear, once a Communist

gets into a trade union, what he should do with the

trade  union.  That  is  what  the  Communists   in

Singapore are doing. Lenin makes it quite clear and

I quote from this book, Lenin on Trade Unions, what

a  Communist should do in a trade union; not  fight

for the welfare of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. He must use it for armed violence, violent

uprising. And it says. Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Armed uprising is the highest method of

political struggle for a Communist. For its success

a  broad  development of all sides  of  the  labour

movement is necessary.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, if Communists get into trade unions,

they  must  use trade unions for an armed  uprising

which  is  the highest form of political  struggle.

Therefore, is the Government wrong in taking action

against  the Communists in trade unions?  They  are

openly  committed by their own strategy,  by  their

own  theory,  by  their own ideology,  to  misusing

trade unions for the purposes of Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. This is most important and relevant in

Singapore.  The Communists are advised  that  there

are  times when trade unions should be used to make

life  more miserable for the workers. It is  stated

so quite clearly. Here, Sir, is another quotation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot and will not in every way promote the

improvement  of the situation of the workers  under

existing conditions. We struggle only for  such  an

improvement of the situation of the workers as will

increase   their   ability  to   lead   the   class

struggle.'.



<br><br>Which  means you only fight for the workers if  the

fight can increase the prospects for Communists  to

succeed and for Communism to win.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There were times when Lenin declared that the

worsening  of  the condition of the  workers  under

capitalism helps the revolutionary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



movement and there were also times when  he

said the improvement of the workers' lot hurts  the

revolutionary movement.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now understand why during the last one

year,   the  S.A.T.U. union  leaders  deliberately

worked  for a situation where nearly 1,800  workers

were   out   of  job.  Why  did  they  deliberately

frustrate our industrial development plan?  Because

they must increase the misery of the workers. These

are  Lenin's  words. And these gentlemen,  Woodhull

and Puthucheary, have said so. These are controlled

by Communists ---

people  are not Communists, I am prepared  to  give

them time over Radio Singapore to come and say  why

they are not Communists ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Are you a Communist?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, when we saw the Minister for Culture stand up,

we  know  he is going to recite his bible.  Because

apart from shouting Communism, he will not be  able

to say other things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, whenever the Minister for Culture

stands up to speak, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



always  talks of Communism because he  has  nothing

else  to  say. He has time and again  said  he  has

evidence   to  show  that  S.A.T.U. is   Communist

inspired.  Why  have the P.A.P. arrested  people?

They have arrested hundreds of people and they have

banned  all sorts of organisations. But  have  they

produced  these people in court to prove that  they

are Communists? Since you say that our country is a

country  of the rule of law, why do they  not  take

them  to  court and try them? Because there  is  no

evidence. That is the crux of the question. They do

not  have  the evidence. Therefore, they  dare  not

take  them  to court for an open trial. That  shows

they  cannot solve this question. I am not prepared

to rebut the rubbish talk ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Woodhull, rubbish?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): --- by the

Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this question involves labour. What I want to point out is that the P.A.P., after their five-year term of office, are now in their second term of office. In words they say they are for the interests of the workers. But are they really for the interests of the workers? The P.A.P.

say  they  want to induce foreign capital  to  come

here.  Now what is the basis of attracting  foreign

capital?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis is to ask the people to starve; they

cannot   strike.  And  the  inducement  to  foreign

capital would have to be based on the starvation of

the  workers.  This was spoken by the Minister  for

Finance;  it  is not rubbish. In 1960 the  Minister

for Finance said that the P.A.P. did not agree that

Singapore  should rely only on foreign  capital  or

help  the foreign capitalists; we do not depend  on

them. Is this rubbish? If so, then the Minister for

Finance was talking rubbish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they blame the workers for the absence of

foreign  capitalists,  this  is  not  a  pro-labour

attitude because they ask the workers not to resist

the    exploitation    of   foreign    capitalists.

[Interruption] You are talking rubbish.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the P.A.P. said that we have a lot of

money invested abroad. Why do we not withdraw  this

money  to  build more factories in our country  for

improving  the livelihood of our people? They  said

this  was because of the past colonial regime.  But

when  they came to power, what happened?  Did  they

withdraw our capital from abroad in order to  build

factories here? What are the facts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point them out. In 1958-59 our investments

abroad amounted to $135 million. This was increased

to  $320  million in 1961, and it  has  since  been

increasing.  These figures were given by  them,  as

they  had  invested our money abroad. On the  other

hand,  they  are  begging for  money,  like  a  son

begging  from his father. They are begging  foreign

investors to invest in Singapore. At the same time,

they  want to suppress the workers, without wanting

to  improve their living conditions. They  have  to

mortgage our property to the World Bank for  loans,

payable   with  interest  which  comes   from   the

taxpayers.  Is  this  the  way  to  safeguard   the

interests   of  the  workers  and  the  people   of

Singapore?  The people of Singapore  will  one  day

realise whether the P.A.P. do really look after the

interests of the workers. Likewise, under its  pro-labour policy, the P.A.P. made a lot of promises to

the  workers. They said that once they  formed  the

government   they  would  unify  the  trade   union

movement. But five years after coming to power, has

the trade union movement been unified?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the Trade Union Congress, the Prime

Minister   himself  reorganised  the   T.U.C. and

established   a   Secretariat.   But   after    the

reorganisation,  the P.A.P. did not  recognise  the

legal  status  of this Secretariat  of  the  T.U.C.

After the Trade Unions Bill was passed, it was  not

assented to by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. This  is

unprecedented  in  the history  of  legislation  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> There is a microphone in front of

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang. Could he please tone

down his voice a bit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This Trade

Unions  Bill  was not assented to by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara. It shows that the  P.A.P. has  no

real  intention to look after the interests of  the

workers. In the past the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has

never withheld his assent to a Bill except upon the

request of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking on another point. The P.A.P. said that

they wanted to set up an Arbitration Court to solve

trade  disputes. In the past the P.A.P. guaranteed

that  only P.A.P. unions had the right to  refer  a

dispute  to  the Arbitration Court. But  after  the

P.A.P. came to power, what happened? An Arbitration

Court was actually set up, but for what purpose? It

was   made  into  an  instrument  to  promote   the

interests of P.A.P. unions, because the Court  only

agreed  to  arbitrate  in  disputes  that  had  the

consent of both the management and the workers. But

the  P.A.P.  Minister for Labour had the  right  to

refer  any  dispute  to the Arbitration  Court.  In

other  words,  the P.A.P. Minister can  negate  the

right  of  the workers to strike and to  refer  the

dispute  to the Arbitration Court. The Chairman  of

the  Arbitration Court was appointed by the  P.A.P.

Minister.  All  these facts prove that  the  P.A.P.

cannot look after the interests of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two years the disputes that were

resolved by the Arbitration Court only led  to  the

expansion of P.A.P.-controlled unions. It also  led

to   the   strengthening  of  the   management   in

exploiting   the   workers.   [Interruption]   This

Arbitration Court of yours is intended  to  control

the  trade  unions,  and  you  are  acting  as  the

N.T.U.C. boss.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the P.A.P.'s term of office, they likewise

banned four confederations of trade unions. This is

a fact, which goes to show that the P.A.P. are anti-worker.   [Interruption]   You   can   only    talk

"Communist". You cannot talk anything  else.  I  do

not  know what type of mouth you have. Whenever  it

opens it can only call out "Communist, Communist".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how the P.A.P. handled the trade

unions and how they suppressed them. Since the mass

arrests  on  2nd February, workers in this  country

can  see  clearly that the P.A.P. are more keen  in

pursuing  an  anti-labour reactionary policy.  They

talk of not putting on the dirty gloves of the  Lim

Yew  Hock  regime and of wanting an open  argument.

Facts have proved that the P.A.P. dare not have  an

open argument. They have put on the dirty gloves of

the  Lim  Yew Hock regime. Why should they ban  the

trade  unions? Why should they arrest trade  union

leaders?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radio, television, and the Press are under

the  control  of the P.A.P. On the 8th  of  October

they   also   arrested  trade  union  leaders   and

Assemblymen.   Civic  organisations   under   false

democracy  have been undermined by the  P.A.P.,  on

the  pretext  that these organisations  have  taken

part  in  Communist  united  front  activities.  If

united front activities are illegal, how is it that

the  P.A.P. also carry out such activities with the

imperialists  and  the Federation Government?  The

P.A.P.    Government   banned    these    resisting

organisations  and  cancelled the  registration  of

seven trade unions just to satisfy their desire  to

retaliate when the people booed the Prime Minister.

All  these facts are well known to the people.  But

the  leaders and the organisations themselves  were

not  banned  for  taking part in  Communist  united

front  activities.  At  the time  the  seven  trade

unions participated in the mass rally sponsored  by

the Chinese Chamber of Commerce on the question  of

the  blood  debt, was there any riot in Singapore?

No,  there  was  not. The police announced  to  the

people  that  the mass rally was orderly,  and  the

P.A.P. cannot deny that. Since there was no riot or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



any  disorder  of  any sort, why  then  should  the

P.A.P.  Government give them a bad name by  banning

these unions and arresting their leaders?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the facts are as follows. These trade unions did not want to be led by the P.A.P. by the nose. They would not support the P.A.P. in their Malaysia intrigue. As a result, the P.A.P. banned them and arrested the leaders. But in banning these trade unions, the P.A.P. never

considered the consequences that the workers  would

suffer.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They completely disregarded the question of the

livelihood of the workers. In actual fact, they are

trying  to  create  more favourable  conditions  to

enable  foreign capitalists to exploit our workers.

The  Siong  Hoe  Biscuit Factory and  the  Wiremesh

Factory industrial disputes are clear examples.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  according to the Schedule, the debate on  the

Ministry of Labour ends at 3.40 p.m. So far neither

the  Minister nor I have had a chance to  reply  to

the criticisms made against our Ministry. Can we be

given the opportunity to reply to the criticisms in

the  time left? After all, whatever the Member  is

speaking now has been repeated last night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> I will give the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang two more minutes  to  end

his  speech  so that we can allow the Minister  for

Labour and his Parliamentary Secretary to reply  to

the points raised by the Opposition side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

just   now   I  said  that  the  Wiremesh   Factory

industrial dispute has not been solved for the last

one year. The Government do not care to do anything

about  it. Only their trade unions and those  trade

unions  controlled  by the P.A.P. are  allowed  to

solve   their   industrial  disputes  through   the

Government.  Is  that the way  to  look  after  the

welfare and interest of the general masses  of  the

workers?  For  the  sake of  preserving  their  own

rights and looking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



after  their own interests, the workers took strike

action  on  8th  and 9th October,  but  the  P.A.P.

Government which claimed that they would  not  want

to put their hands into the dirty gloves of Lim Yew

Hock,  took action to ban the unions. Where is  the

pro-labour policy of the Government? Because of the

time  limit, I end by asking the P.A.P.  Government

whether there is autonomy in labour in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Barisan  Sosialis  and their pro-Communist  stooges

are  adept at making malicious allegations  against

any  government that does not toe their line or  is

not  amenable  to  their  pressures.  They  portray

themselves  as  the champions of  the  workers  and

repeatedly allege that the Government has not  only

done  nothing for the workers but that it has  also

denied them the opportunity to organise themselves,

that police are used to intervene in strikes and to

assault   and  maim  the  workers,  and  that   the

Government  sides  with  the  employers  to   break

strikes.  The charges, repeated as they  have  been

time  and again, have become nothing more than  the

repetitive  beating of a drum on  one  single  note

and,  as  such,  they have become meaningless.  The

main intention is, of course, nothing more than  to

malign  the  Government, because  the  Barisan  and

their  Communist friends are denied the opportunity

at  every  turn  to  propagate  their  ideology  of

destruction.  They echo the call of  their  foreign

masters  for  anti-national activities  - activities

which  are meant to destroy the very foundation  of

the  happiness and prosperity of the  people.  They

have  the audacity to ask us what we have done  for

the   workers  other  than  using  the  police   to

intervene in strikes and side employers in breaking

up  strikes.  I hope that the Barisan realise  that

constitutionally  the police  force  is  under  the

control of the Central Government. If they have not

found  out that, I suggest that they brush up their

knowledge.  Whatever  the position  might  be,  the

police  force  in  any  State (including  Communist

States)  is  to  maintain law and  order.  In  this

country, they cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



stand  by  in  the interest of the  Communists  and

watch  impotently the destruction of  property  and

the  beating up of workers by their henchmen.  They

incite the strikers to violence but prudently  keep

themselves  out of it so that the workers  who  are

misguided  into  violence take the rap.  They  then

turn  round  and  accuse  the  police  of  violence

against the workers to give the impression that the

workers  are repressed. They, however, conveniently

forget  that  innocent fishermen on the  high  seas

have  been  assaulted and maimed by  their  foreign

friends  but not a single voice has been raised  by

the  pro-Communist unions purporting  to  represent

them ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b>

Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> --- the Singapore Marine Product

Workers  Union. Further, they have been responsible

for  killing  certain business  establishments  and

throwing workers into the unemployment slush. I ask

them, what have they done to the workers other than

bringing hardships to them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> I say that what they have done

has  not  been in the interests of the workers.  On

the  contrary, they have exploited the workers  and

the  unions  to  further  their  own  anti-national

interests  and those of their foreign  masters.  On

the   other  hand,  the  Government's  achievements

concretely  show that the malicious allegations  by

the Barisan have no foundation. The achievements of

the  Government since June 1959 will  clearly  bear

this  out. This could only have been brought  about

by our enlightened labour policy and our open stand

on the side of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following facts will show how the workers of

Singapore have benefited considerably in  the  form

of   monetary   wages  and  fringe  benefits.   The

energetic enforcement of the labour laws brought in

a   sum   of   $450,288.21   from   employers   for

distribution to the workers in the form of  arrears

of  wages  for overtime, holiday pay, rest-day  pay

and   annual  leave  pay.  The  Labour  Court,   in

addition,  recovered a total sum of $483,065.89  in

respect of legal claims



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



by  workers  and  a further $50,000  on  behalf  of

domestic servants by way of conciliatory action. In

the  field of conciliation, out of a total of 4,393

disputes,  3,390  were amicably settled,  402  were

referred  to  other authorities, and 476  were  not

pursued  further by the complainants.  Out  of  326

strikes  and  lockouts, only 7 were outstanding  at

the  end of November 1963. The conciliation service

was  also  responsible for the  conclusion  of  237

collective agreements. The Arbitration Courts  have

made   106  awards  and  certified  647  collective

agreements  involving a total of  103,300  workers.

These  agreements and awards have certainly brought

enhanced terms and conditions of employment to  the

workers.  They say that we have denied the  workers

the opportunity to organise themselves. In May 1959

before  the  P.A.P.  Government  took  office,  the

number  of  unions  in existence  was  226  with  a

membership of only 134,650. The number of unions at

the end of November 1963 was 111 but the number  of

members was 147,188 as against 134,650 in May  1959

- an  increase of 13,000. What more convincing proof

does the Barisan require? Their allegations founder

on  these  facts.  They  further  allege  that  the

Government attempts to control the unions but  they

cannot substantiate their statement. What have they

to say about the unions catering for the workers in

the armed services - the Singapore General Printing

Workers  Union and a few others? These  unions  are

not affiliated to the N.T.U.C. but yet they form an

important component ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Yet those unions form an

important component of the trade union movement  in

the State. The deregistration of S.A.T.U. and seven

other  pro-Communist unions was not  aimed  against

the  workers but against the anti-national elements

who   were   using   these  unions   for   purposes

inconsistent with the objects and rules ---

agreements made previously.

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 34 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that since the Minister for Culture

has  not successfully shouldered his responsibility

to  the people and if the Assembly approves such  a

big  sum for the Ministry of Culture, then it  will

help  to  bring more sorrow and depression  to  the

people.  The next year's Estimates for the Ministry

of  Culture  consist of a lot of unnecessary  items

because  under  the  tyranny  of  the  P.A.P. the

Ministry   of  Culture  has  long  ago   become   a

monopolised   organisation   for   its   propaganda

machinery. It has been used to mesmerise the people

and  inculcate  pro-colonial ideas into  them.  The

Prime  Minister has betrayed the people. They  have

been   suppressed  in  their  pursuit  of   healthy

literature and culture. Mr Deputy Speaker, in  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech,  the  Government

claim that culture has flourished under their rule.

They  are only praising themselves. In the past  4½

years of P.A.P. rule, only three literary magazines

have  been published. Those that were not  approved

for   publication  numbered  thousands.  Even   the

University magazines on studies and dramatics  were

also  banned.  On  16th October. 1962,  the  P.A.P.

Government  approved  an  amendment  Bill  to   the

Undesirable  Publications Ordinance. By  using  the

power given them in the Bill, the P.A.P. have  been

making  use  of it to prevent the people's  culture

from  developing.  So  in the  end  only  very  few

publications were allowed and the P.A.P. restricted

the  publication of private newspapers. This  is  a

fact  and  everybody knows it. Not  long  ago,  the

P.A.P. also cancelled the registration of more than

ten  publications  in the two Universities  without

any reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the reign of the P.A.P., a number of

yellow literature publications



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



has  been  banned.  That is all they  can  do.  The

P.A.P. have been blinding the people. They give out

P.A.P. literature as healthy literature. The people

can now see through clearly the P.A.P.'s policy  in

regard  to  the Ministry of Culture. For  instance,

certain  films  which have a low taste  and  sexual

appeal have been passed by the Board. There  was  a

film  whose title was "Love and Desire". This is  a

filthy  film of very low taste. Yet this  film  was

passed  by  the Board of Film Censors.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  this film "Love and  Desire"  is  a

filthy  film.  Such a dirty film has been  approved

for screening by the Ministry of Culture. And these

people, Ministers of low morals, dare to go and see

this film.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> How many times did you see it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They should not

lower the morals of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the National Library, the number

of  books  there cannot compare with  that  in  the

University of Singapore or in any modern  secondary

school. There are very few literature books in  the

Malay, Chinese and Tamil languages. Almost all  the

literature is in the English language. This  is  to

help  the  English educated. Students from  English

schools will perhaps find it convenient to read  in

the library. But students from the other streams of

education  will  find  it  difficult  to  get   any

literature to read. This is wrong. This is an  evil

which  has  been  perpetuated by  the  Ministry  of

Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us talk about the P.A.P. radio. We can

say  that  the present Radio Singapore is  actually

Radio P.A.P. During these few days, Radio Singapore

has  been  taking  passages from  our  speeches  at

random. They have given very little coverage to our

speeches.  On the other hand, all the coverage  has

been devoted to the speeches made by the Government

Ministers  and their Back-benchers. This shows  the

P.A.P. are traitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about the T.V. shows? Most of the

programmes are about fighting and the rest of  them

are given to such dirty things as practised by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. There were scenes as those published in  the

Straits  Times. They are as dirty as that. Whenever

you  tune in to the radio, you will hear all  sorts

of  Western  music such as Rock  'n  Roll  and  the

"Twist".  Many  kinds of national music  have  been

either curbed, restricted or prohibited from  being

broadcast.  Many  of the concerts  put  up  by  the

schools  and  civic organisations  were  prohibited

from being broadcast over the radio and telecast on

television.  This goes to show that  they  are  the

running dogs of the British imperialists. They  are

controlled by the British imperialists. The  people

will  not  forget  how  the  Government,  by  their

control  of the broadcasting station, have made  it

their  instrument to further the interests  of  the

colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make use of broadcasting as an instrument

to improve the standard of education of the people.

This  is  necessary in order to  inculcate  in  the

people  a high sense of morality and improve  their

standard  of  education. Radio and  television  can

play  a  great  part  in this respect.  Since  this

instrument is now virtually a P.A.P. monopoly,  the

provision  of  such large sums of  money  for  this

department is a waste of public funds. It is  evil.

That  is  why we have moved an amendment to  reduce

the  sum  provided  for radio and  television.  The

whole  set-up gives the people the impression  that

the department is only a branch of the Voice of the

U.S.I.S.  The literature issued by the Ministry  of

Culture  is no different from that issued from  the

Anglo-American imperialists. "Television Singapura"

has almost become T.V. America. Radio Singapore has

almost  become  Radio  America.  The  Minister  for

Culture  cannot be a suitable Minister for Culture.

All  he  can  do  is to shout "Communist"  in  this

Assembly  whenever he opens his mouth.  Other  than

that,  he  cannot talk of anything  else.  He  says

today  that  the  Barisan Sosialis is  a  Communist

Party.  That  is  an  insult  to  this  Legislative

Assembly. To describe us as Communists or our Party

as   a   Communist  Party  is  an  insult  to   the

Legislative Assembly. We were elected by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



people to be their representatives in this House in

a constitutional manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, is

<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Link</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, I am of the opinion that the Minister  for

Culture  has not met with the general approval  and

desire  of  the people in his dealing with  matters

relating  to  his  Ministry.  Although  they   have

claimed  that we are living under the rule of  law,

yet whenever we debate any matter in this House  we

are  interrupted.  The coverage they  give  to  our

speeches in their reports is most unreasonable  and

biased.  They  give the Government side  favourable

coverage. I hope the Minister for Culture will  try

to  take steps to remedy this situation if he wants

to  claim  to  be the fit and proper man  for  this

Ministry.  He should take measures to  improve  the

work of the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

before  the Member for Tampines got up to speak,  I

shouted  across the Floor that the first  thing  he

was  going  to say was "Radio P.A.P." Sure  enough.

Sir, he said that the people are very depressed  by

what  they hear over Radio Singapore and Television

Singapura.  The  people  are  not  depressed.   The

Barisan  are depressed. Every time television  goes

on  the air, the news comes out, the truth is told,

and  the people understand. The 13 Barisan Sosialis

Assemblymen  then  vanish.  Sir,  may  I,  in  this

connection,   ask  the  gentlemen,  because   their

adopted  country  is Jakarta, who  gives  a  fairer

report?  Is  it Radio Jakarta or Radio  Singapore'?

Sir,  I  have the Monitoring Digest for  Wednesday,

11th  December, 1963, which reports the  debate  in

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`10th December, Jakarta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Party, the Barisan Sosialis of

Singapore,  has tabled a proposal in the  Singapore

Assembly that Singapore and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



so-called  Malaysian Government should contact  the

Indonesian Government to settle present differences

for their common interests..'



<br><br>and so on.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair enough, Sir. First, the report was

only three paragraphs amounting to no more than 150

words.  Radio  Singapore  on  the  same  day   gave

something  like  200  to 250 words.  That  is  fair

enough.  Secondly, Radio Jakarta in  reporting  the

proceedings of the Assembly, reported nothing about

the  Government  speeches,  but  only  the  Barisan

Sosialis  speeches.  But even  worse,  Sir,  unlike

Radio  Singapore  whose report is  accurate,  Radio

Jakarta, their adopted country, concluded by saying

- and  I  hope the gentlemen will take good note  of

this,  and  tell Radio Jakarta to  be  a  bit  more

factual about their reporting:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The leader of the Barisan Sosialis, Dr Lee Siew

Choh,  said that the difficulties suffered  by  the

people  in  Singapore resulted from the  Indonesian

confrontation.'



<br><br>Sir,  everybody knows that Dr Lee  Siew  Choh  has

vanished.  And  here  was Radio  Jakarta  reporting

them,  ignoring them, and saying that Dr Lee  Siew

Choh  is  still their leader in the Assembly.  Sir,

either they are sending incorrect reports or  Radio

Jakarta  has so great a contempt for them  that  it

thinks  it  is  not  worth while  mentioning  their

present  leader  because the leader  is  no  longer

here.  Sir, this is a good example. Whatever  might

be  said  of  Radio  Singapore,  it  gives  greater

coverage  for  them and it reports  accurately  and

faithfully. But the radio of their adopted  country

gives,  firstly, an incorrect report, a very  brief

report  and  insults them. Yet they  support  their

adopted country. Sir, let them, therefore, not come

around  here denouncing Radio Singapore.  They  are

repeating old speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points they made was this. They said

that  under  the  P.A.P.  Government  healthy   and

recreative reading has been suppressed. We ask  the

seven of them, the eight of them - if this gentleman

ever comes back to this Assembly - this. Please give

us  a  list of healthy reading matter. I  am  quite

sure,  Sir,  that  if  it  is  not  Communist,  not

subversive, we will order it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



Before  this Assembly debate is over, I  hope  they

will  give us a list of what they consider  healthy

reading  matter  - the  titles,  the  authors,   the

publishers, and where they can be obtained. I  hope

it  will not be the kind of reading matter that Mr

Lim Ching Siong recommended in a document which was

published  in  The Battle for Merger - Document  One

- and reads, "We have sworn before the Red flag  and

old  Stalin."  Sir,  all this is  Communist  bogey!

Signed  by him, never denied by him, he never  sued

us  for  libel for publishing a statement  that  he

took  an oath to Stalin. Still they keep on saying,

"Communist bogey". Communist bogey! [Interruption]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they have been talking about "healthy

reading  matter", I have asked them to  give  us  a

list  and  I am quite confident - I can take  a  bet

- there  will not be a single list of titles  coming

from them on healthy reading matter. I can be quite

sure  that they will not be able to give me a  list

of titles, authors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



publishers of what they consider as healthy reading

matter.  But I hope it will not be a list that  Lim

Ching  Siong  recommended  for  the  work  of   the

underground  and Communist organisations,  such  as

political  reports, Stalin's talks,  Li  Shao-Chi's

Training   in   Discipline  for  the  Organisation,

editorials  of  the  Freedom  News  which  we  have

suppressed,  further books for  acquiring  a  basic

knowledge of Marxism and Leninism, "The history  of

the  Russian Communist Party" - which is now  out  of

date,  Sir,  because since then I think they  enjoy

reading the history of the Chinese Communist  Party

- the basis of Leninism and "On Political Parties".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only valid point that they made and

which  I  can  say without insulting  them  was  in

regard to the number of non-English books. I am not

referring  only  to Chinese books.  By  non-English

books,  I refer to Malay, Tamil and Chinese  books.

These  gentlemen  are  only interested  in  Chinese

books.  It  is  quite  true that  in  the  National

Library, the number of non-English books is not  as

numerous as it should be, but I would like to point

out  to  them  that since the P.A.P. took  over  in

1959,  the number of books in Chinese lent  out  in

1959  was 18,000. The present figure is 113,000  - a

substantial  increase. Similarly, there  were  only

1,000  hooks  in  Malay in 1959; there  are  31,000

books in Malay now. In Tamil, there were only 4,000

books; today there are 23,000 books. In 1963  alone

we  have purchased over 25,000 books in Chinese for

the  National  Library. One of the difficulties  is

the  availability of non-English books, because  we

can  get books in English from all over the  world,

cheaply and in adequate numbers. Many of them  come

to  us  as  gifts, but some of the books  in  other

languages are not as numerous. I know that is  what

the  gentlemen  opposite are  hoping  I  will  say,

"Well,  what about Mao Tse-tung's works,  Stalin's,

Marx's,  Lenin's?" Sir, those which  are  available

- [Interruption]  If they do not want  those  books,

then  I  am  quite prepared for them to give  me  a

list. I hope they will give me a list of the titles

of books and we will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



consider them and order not only one copy but  five

or six copies each.

<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

find  it  difficult  to  understand  the  line   of

argument of the Barisan Sosialis, or even get  near

the  province  of  understanding the  mentality  of

their    argument.   We   were   alleged   to    be

irresponsible, that our cultural activities brought

disaster.  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  do  we  have   an

eruption in Singapore like the Bali eruption? Do we

have  famine in Singapore? I can assure the Members

of  the Opposition that the people of Singapore are

the  best  informed, at least in this part  of  the

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were accused of using the radio and T.V.

Singapura  to  deceive  the  people.  But  can  the

Barisan Sosialis account for the rapid increase  in

radio and television sets? Are they suggesting that

the  people of Singapore are so foolish they  allow

themselves  to be deceived by the so-called  "Radio

P.A.P."!  Surely they are not thinking that  it  is

"Radio  P.A.P."  broadcasting in this  House.  Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were accused of having no cultural activities.

Now, what cultural activities do they want? Do they

want  the  "Yong Koa" - The Harvest Dance? [Laughter]

Simply because we do not show a "Yong Koa" on  T.V.

and we have no cultural activities. Those items  we

put up on T.V. in the dim --- [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, about the films again,

there  was a very interesting point put up  by  the

Opposition  Member  who said we should  show  films

with sex appeal and so on. I think those films  may

appeal to them, but I am afraid I have to, say that

the  Member  for Tampines probably  has  seen  such

films several times, otherwise he would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



not be able to analyse the films. [Laughter] No, it

is  true. How is it he was so sure and so confident

the film was banned?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is common logic

which the Barisan Sosialis must accept and adopt.

I just  want  to put a simple question to them.

Will Radio  Jakarta be prepared to allow the  "Rebel

of Celebes" to broadcast over it? Will they? No!  What

they  have  is  anti-revolutionary.  There  is   no

revolution in Singapore. What revolution  we  refer

to   is  bloody  and  violent.  We  have  no   such

revolution in Singapore. There is peaceful,  social

evolution  here.  We are charged with  broadcasting

anti-revolutionary  material.   Is   Radio   Peking

prepared to allow Radio Kuomintang to broadcast  to

the people of China? Will they allow that? No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is the duty of the Government to

explain to the people what kind of society they are

in.  They should be kept informed of what is  going

on  in  Singapore. They charge that we do not  give

them  coverage over the radio on their speeches.  I

think  we will be failing in our duty if we do  not

broadcast their speeches, but they contain  nothing

but  repetitions. No quality, no substance. We will

be  failing  in our duty if we do that, Mr  Deputy

Speaker.  Do they want us to broadcast  folk  songs

and  play  gramophone records? What songs  do  they

want?  Give  us a list and we will check  with  our

library. If those songs are not there, and  as  the

Minister  for  Culture has said, if  they  are  not

Communist, we are prepared to put them as additions

to our library.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Order, time is up. Does the Member

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 35 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that under Head 35 there is one

department,  that  is, the Registry  of  Societies,

whose  title  should be changed  to  "A  Department

which dissolves all Organisations". I want to  cite

one example to prove that the myths put forward  by

the P.A.P. cannot hold water.



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along they have been shouting about

Communists. This is only a pretext. On the 22nd  of

last month, we received a letter from the Registrar

of Societies asking us to dissolve the kindergarten

classes  which  were held in the  premises  of  the

Country   People's  Association   and   the   Rural

Dwellers'  Association. The reasons  given  by  the

Registrar were that these classes were carrying  on

indoctrination   of  Communist   ideas   into   the

children.  But  it  is strange that  these  classes

cater  for children of only five to six years  old.

They  are  so young. How can we say that  we  could

inculcate  in  their heads the Communist  ideology?

Anyone  with common sense will not say such things.

But  the  P.A.P. have been all along talking  about

the Communists and creating a Communist bogey. They

are  accustomed  to use the term  "Communist"  and,

therefore,  they fall into the trap  of  describing

these classes as inculcating Communist ideas in the

young children, which is very absurd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you can see that the textbooks used by these

classes  were  printed by some  of  the  publishing

firms  in Singapore. I will enumerate some of them.

[Mr Koo Young held up a Chinese textbook.] This is

a  textbook  on general knowledge entitled,  Go  to

School  in  the  Morning. This book says,  "in  the

morning,  go to school". And it has been  described

by  them as Communist ideology! Another book is  an

arithmetic  book, about figures, from one  to  ten;

and  this  has  also  been  described  by  them  as

Communist ideology. There was another book full  of

pictures,  and they also call it a Communist  book.

It  is an English textbook entitled My Book of ABC.

You  may  investigate, and if you have any evidence

you can bring it to Court. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



first  lesson in this book reads "A-Apple,  Arrow".

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  just  look  at   this   book.

[Indication]  Is it a Communist book? The  Minister

for  Social Affairs can look at it. Perhaps he will

say that the apple is an apple imported from China,

and  that when the children look at it they  become

Communist. What a funny reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been thinking why the

P.A.P. said this is Communist, that is  Communist;

even  a  book  on A, B, C, can become  a  Communist

literature  book. Perhaps our Minister  for  Social

Affairs  can  supply some material to the  Minister

for  Culture so that when the Minister for  Culture

attends the United Nations General Assembly he  can

tell  the  U.S.  President, Mr  Johnson,  that  in

Singapore, children from four to six years old  are

receiving  Communist  indoctrination.  Perhaps  the

U.S.   President   will  say,  "Good,   good,   Mr

Rajaratnam. Your discovery is splendid,  excellent.

I  will  order  the Pentagon to give you  a  title,

Doctor  of  Anti-Communist". Perhaps  this  is  his

reason.  But we must warn the Minister for  Culture

if  this news were to lead to the belief among  the

Americans  that  children  in  Singapore  are  also

Communists, the people in Singapore have all become

Communists,  I  am afraid the U.S.  President  will

send  a  plane to bomb Singapore because  he  fears

that there are many Communists in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a Communist? This is what they call a

Communist.  They are entirely irrational  in  their

argument.  The Minister for Education, in  debating

the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech,  mentioned

this.  If  you  do not believe, we  can  produce  a

letter.  The letter from the Registrar of Societies

did   contain  such  statements,  saying  that  the

classes were used to propagate Communist ideas. All

these statements are false. The real reason is that

they are afraid that we are helping the farmers  in

the  rural  areas  by  opening  these  kindergarten

classes.  We  are helping to solve  their  problem.

These  classes have very large attendances, whereas

the  Government classes have been all empty. We are

looking  after  the children so as  to  enable  the

householders to go to work. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



helping  the  farmers by conducting  such  classes.

What do you mean by Communists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 26th November we saw a news item in the

Sin  Chew Jit Poh that the Queenstown P.A.P. Branch

is  going  to  open adult classes. The notice  says

that  the  Branch are recruiting students  for  the

adult classes and list the vacancies in the various

classes; 40 vacancies for the kindergarten classes,

40 vacancies for first-year primary. Why the P.A.P.

Branch can run such classes, and why not Communist?

Because  the classes are run on Fascist  education?

Why  should the Minister for Labour talk about  the

Chinese,  saying that you allow only the  officials

to light a big fire, whereas you prevent the common

people  from lighting a lamp? I would like  to  ask

the  Minister  for Culture whether he  admits  this

fact. If he wants to deny, of course, he can do so.

But  I  would advise him not to talk about children

of  four  and  six being inculcated with  Communist

ideology. It is a ridiculous allegation. Were  this

news  to  leak out to foreign countries,  then  the

American  Press  would be publishing  in  headlines

that Singapore's Minister for Culture said that the

children  of  Singapore from four to  six  are  all

Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

openly.  That shows that we are not Communists.  If

they  dare not, then they are Communists. Say  that

you are not Communists. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot follow the English

that  you are not Communists. You can come to Radio

publicly  and in the newspapers that  you  are  not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>

Communists   but  when  other  people  talk   about

Communism, you are so very angry. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No more interruptions, please.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The fact is

that  whenever  I  or any of the Ministers  mention

Communists, the Barisan Sosialis are very angry. If

they  are  representatives of the Communist  Party,

then  we will not blame them, but because they  say

they  are  not Communists, then people  doubt  very

much  why  they should adopt such an attitude  when

they are called Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of Societies is in charge of

matters  relating to societies and the  control  of

them.  Certain  societies are  engaged  in  illegal

activities, so it is necessary for the Registrar to

take  steps to control them and also to investigate

as  to whether they have been used for purposes  of

Communist propaganda or other subversive activities

or  used as gambling dens. Do I hear somebody  say,

"My  house"?  Now,  the father of  the  Member  for

Tampines,  I  heard, is operating  a  gambling  den

which was closed down recently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

that  his  father is involved in running a gambling

den.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister is out of order there

because  he  is attacking the Member's father,  and

surely he is throwing implications at the gentleman

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He does not have a father.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There you are, when you talk of

minutes  and  I  suggest he make  full  use  of  it

without any abuse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  had not wanted to talked about  that,  but

because  the Member for Thomson said that I  had  a

gambling den in my house, that is why, in order  to

show  that something is happening, I said that  the

Member's father is having a gambling den.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, because I have only

about  one  minute,  let me rebut  the  allegations

hurled  by the Barisan Sosialis in connection  with

the  kindergarten classes conducted  by  them.  The

Registrar  of  Societies  wrote  to  them  in  this

connection.  Mr Speaker, just now the  Member  for

Thomson has shown to us books which he claims  were

used  by these kindergarten classes. But what about

those  books  in the curriculum? Can  they  exhibit

other   books  which  are  being  used   in   these

kindergarten classes, for instance, anti-Government

songs, anti-Prime Minister songs, Communist songs?

Not  a  word about these. They concentrate more  on

these  in  the kindergarten classes. Secondly,  Mr

Speaker, the law of this State lays down that it is

not  an  offence for a political Party  to  conduct

kindergarten classes, but they must first obtain  a

permit  from the Ministry of Education. The  letter

written    to   the   Barisan   Sosialis   concerns

kindergarten classes based on the State laws  which

are in force at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, during the general elections we did

see  how the Barisan Sosialis used children in  the

election campaign to attend election rallies ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,074,860 for Head 35 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 37 be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I cannot understand this question,

whether  it is connected with the Communist  bogey,

but  it  is  a  very important one. The  people  of

Singapore,  especially those living  in  the  rural

areas  in  congested  attap  dwellings,  pay  great

attention  to this question of fires. We  hope  the

Ministers  will  not think we are  trying  to  pull

their  legs.  But these people are  not  like  them

living   in  new  air-conditioned  flats.  If   the

Government are sincere in wishing to solve problems

- as the Prime Minister has said he is very glad  to

hear criticisms from the Opposition as well as from

his  own  Back-benchers - it is our duty to  put  up

suggestions in this House. Here I have some figures

to  show that this is a question which is receiving

much attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Fire Brigade Department's recent

Report,   in  1962  there  were  1,776   fires   in

Singapore.  The losses incurred amounted  to  about

$859,000.  One  example is Siglap. In  1963,  there

have been 2,882 fires. It means that there has been

an  increase  in  the number of  fires  this  year.

Losses amounting to $755,000 have been incurred  in

1963. Of course, this includes the fires that  took

place in Lorong 21 and Lorongs 5 to 9, Geylang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise a few points. I hope the

Government  will pay attention to this.  The  first

question  is  whether  these fires  have  a  direct

bearing on the water rationing. I hope the Minister

for  Social  Affairs  will give  a  reply  to  this

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the causes of the

fires.  As  far  as  I know from  the  Government's

report,  no explanation or reasons have been  given

for  the  causes  of  these fires,  but  there  are

rumours circulating that they have some bearing  on

the  landlords'  desire to evict the  occupiers  of

their  lands. There are rumours that certain people

were  so  hard up that they burned their houses  to

achieve their purposes. Some people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



say  that  it was due to Communist activities,  and

there are other rumours. There have been such fires

in Lorong 29 and Lorongs 3 to 11, Geylang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is on the coordination between

the  Fire  Brigade Department and  the  rural  Fire

Brigade  branches.  I would like  the  Minister  to

assure us that in future more fire stations will be

built  in  the  rural areas which are crowded  with

attap houses. But there are two difficulties to  be

faced.  One  is  the  question  of  equipment   and

supplies.   Many  fire  stations   are   short   of

equipment.  Without the necessary  equipment,  they

are  of  no use even if there is water. I hope  the

Government  will provide more and better  equipment

to  the  various fire stations and give them better

training.  The  second point is in  regard  to  the

funds  available. In the past, the  voluntary  Fire

Brigade corps formed by the rural people themselves

were  supported  by  the farmers  living  in  those

areas.  But the Government did not seem to want  to

give a single cent. The people on watch took turns,

and  some  of  them stayed awake overnight.  While

they  were  on duty, they had to pay for their  own

food and other expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give a reply to my

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Member opposite spoke for five

minutes. The Barisan Members can only repeat  their

argument and waste a lot of the time of this House.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member concerned said that he heard many

rumours  in  regard to the fires in  Geylang,  that

some  people  say  that they  were  caused  by  the

Communists.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this is another  way

to  spread rumours. In fact, those who spread  this

rumour here are the rumour-mongers themselves. Some

fires  like  lallang fires cannot be controlled  by

the  Government.  These are due to natural  causes.

And  they  also said that some fires are caused  by

rats.  They make use of all these points to  attack

the  Government.  If they want to  criticise,  they

must substantiate their criticisms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



so that the Government can take proper action. They

also blame the Government for the lack of rainfall.

During their campaign, they said that if they  were

elected  they  would abolish water-rationing.  Some

people asked them, "Where is your water reservoir?"

What causes a wild fire? Now this is not caused  by

the  rural  people. Wild fires cannot be controlled

by  people. I hope the Barisan will not  waste  our

time by bringing up all these irrelevant points  in

order to attack the Government. [Interruption]  You

talk  about God! Do you believe in God? If you want

the  Government to listen to your suggestions,  you

should  bring  up substantial points.  The  Members

opposite  cannot  bring  up substantial  points  to

support their amendments. They have been unable  to

bring  up  concrete points. [Interruption]  Do  you

want me to prove that you are Communist stooges?  I

have  a lot of material to prove that. This is your

leader  - your god! [Indicating a Chinese newspaper]

And  you have posted this picture on the walls  and

the   pillars!  These  words  were  spoken  by  Mr

Puthucheary and Mr Woodhull! These words were said

by your leaders - your gods!



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

order.  The Member for Bukit Panjang spoke  on  the

causes  of the fires between Lorongs 5 and 21.  But

the  Parliamentary Secretary has  not  given  us  a

clear reply on the causes of these fires.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. The

Parliamentary  Secretary  was  about  to  read  the

Chinese  newspaper  to prove that  somebody  was  a

Communist.  I think he was invited to  do  that  by

interruptions from the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I must protest

against  the  Member for Thomson. He said  that  my

area  is a dirty area. He said that my constituency

is  a  dirty constituency. I want to lodge a strong

protest   against   him.   What   about   his   own

constituency?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us forget Thomson. Let

us  forget  Jalan  Besar. Let us get  on  with  the

debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, if you will allow me, I can repeat what I said

about  their leaders, their gods and the source  of

their inspiration. I can reveal all this to you  to

prove  whether they are really the stooges  of  the

Communists.  I  think they are not politicians  but

stooges  of the Communists. They are not  Communist

members themselves, but they are Communist stooges.

Mr  Lim  Shee Ping is my friend. I have known  him

from  my school days. He is also one of the Central

Executive members of the Barisan Sosialis. He said,

"The   Communist   activities   in   Malaysia   are

incompatible  with their objectives. Now  Communism

in  Singapore  is  not a bogey.  The  Barisan  have

become  the stooges of the Communists and yet  they

do   not  realise  it."  If  they  can  rebut   the

statements of their ex-leaders, then I can say that

they  are  clever. Can they rebut or  refute  their

statements? But I think they are opium addicts.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must remind Members that

although  a  little  humour  will  take  away   the

dreariness of this debate, they should not make any

personal  attacks  as  the Parliamentary  Secretary

did.  We  have  only  two  minutes  more  for  this

particular item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Member for Bukit Panjang asked about the causes  of

the  fires  at  Lorong 21 and at Lorongs  5  to  9,

Geylang,  but the Parliamentary Secretary  did  not

give us the answer at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> On a point of order. I can

explain that. Rainfall and wild fires are not under

our  control.  How  can he  say  that  I  have  not

answered their points?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. It is

a matter of opinion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Our question was

not  directed against the Government, accusing them

that  they  did not try to put out the  fires.  The

question  was in regard to the causes of the  fire.

Yet  the  Member just now produced a  newspaper  to

read  about the Communists and so on. All this will

not  help to resolve the question. On this question

we hope that wherever there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



a   likelihood  of  a  fire  starting,   preventive

equipment  should be provided at such  places,  and

that  the  Government should look  after  the  fire

victims and find out the cause of the fire in order

that  rumours  will  not spread leading  people  to

believe that the Government are taking advantage of

the situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> I am very glad that the Member for Bukit

Panjang brought up this matter. I am very happy  to

note  that  he is as concerned as we are  over  the

numerous fire outbreaks during the last few  years.

But  if  he will look into the matter properly,  he

will  note that all the fires took place  in  attap

hut areas. However, his method differs from that of

the  Government  in  trying to  prevent  fires.  He

suggests  that  there should be more  fire  brigade

stations and more equipment. We, on the other hand,

say  that  we must not allow a situation  to  arise

where Reds or Communists or anybody can set fire to

a place. And in fact ---

Lorongs  5  to 9 and Lorong 21, Geylang,  how  many

fire  victims received public assistance  from  the

Government?  How much did each of  them  receive?

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In answering the

questions  posed  by the Member on  the  Opposition

side  regarding the fires at Geylang, I  will  give

full  details. Victims of the Lorong  21,  Geylang,

fire which occurred on the 29th October, 1963, have

received  $40 each. The last payment of the  fourth

instalment to the victims of Lorongs 5 and 9  fires

have  been  paid today. That is the  position,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the families who have lost their

possessions as a result of both the fires have been

paid a rent subsidy of $7 each, but the maximum for

each  family is $35 per month for a period of three

months  irrespective  of whether  the  family  want

flats from the Housing Board or other accommodation

for which they have to pay rent. The victims of the

Lorong  21  fire were also given a tin of condensed

milk  per  person  from stocks of food  which  were

donated by the public who were in sympathy with the

sufferings of these victims. For the victims of the

fire  at  Lorongs 5 to 9, donations in the form  of

condensed milk, rice and noodles were received



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



from  the public and these were distributed to  the

victims.  Each person was given a tin of  condensed

milk,  three  katties  of rice  and  one  pound  of

noodles. Clothing donated by members of the  public

was  also distributed to the victims of both  fires

at  Lorong  21  and at Lorongs 5 to 9.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, the amount of $40 given to  each  of

those   victims   is   from  the   Social   Welfare

Department, $5 from the Lee Foundation and $30 from

the  Singapore Council of Social Services. The fire

victims at Lorong 21 involved 82 families and those

at Lorong 9 involved 179 families or 1,001 persons.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I am glad to state  here

that  as  a result of the efforts and work  carried

out by members of the Social Welfare Department and

the  Housing  Board, these victims of the  fire  at

Lorongs  5  to 9 have been given houses  within  24

hours.  I  hope this explanation of mine  satisfies

the question of the hon. Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have a further

question   to  ask  the  Minister.  That   is,   in

Marsilling, Bukit Panjang. There is a Lian Wah  San

Temple.  There  are  50 aged  people  living  there

- widows and widowers. These 50 aged people have not

been  looked after by the Government. Some of  them

come  from  institutions for the  aged,  public  or

private,  and  some  come from the  Tan  lock  Seng

Hospital,  and  some even come from  homes  in  the

Federation. I would like the Minister concerned  to

indicate  whether he would consider giving  aid  to

these people and increase their personal allowance.

I  have been there to see for myself and found that

their facilities and aid are very poor. I hope  the

Minister will do something in this regard  to  help

them.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As this House

knows, the Social Welfare Department has two  Homes

to look after - homes for the aged. One is at Bushey

Park for men, and the other at Woodstock for women.

I  am thankful to the Member for Bukit Panjang  for

drawing my attention to the fact that there are  so

many aged people who are in need of assistance.  If

the hon. Member will be good enough to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



give me further details, I will be only too glad to

look  into the matter. Assistance is based  on  the

conditions and circumstances of the people. I  hope

the  hon. Member will be good enough to provide  me

with further details that I have asked for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think I can

give the details to the Director of Social Welfare.

Most  of the people at this temple are sick.  Since

they  are  being treated at the temple,  they  have

been  staying at the temple. They are  getting  $15

each  per month from the Social Welfare Department.

That  is not enough to pay for medicine. Even  they

have  to  wash their clothing and they need further

aid.  Up  to  now  they have been looked  after  by

public  donations. I hope the Minister will provide

them with medical care.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, if these people are prepared to  come

to  the  Homes  for the Aged, I can guarantee  that

they will be given free assistance and aid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to

ask  one  question. As to the explanation given  by

the  Minister  and  the Government  in  respect  of

assistance   and  aid  given  to  the   people.   I

appreciate  it. I would like to ask whether  people

who  are  not  Singapore citizens and living  under

such   conditions  would  also   be   admitted   to

institutions for the aged. I hope the Minister  can

also do something and give some means of livelihood

to  these  people,  as  they are  also  members  of

society.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, let me explain here that in all cases

of  assistance, whether in the form of money, etc.,

priority is given to Singapore citizens. Those  who

are  not Singapore citizens are not given priority.

We  are  governed  by the laws  of  the  State  and

Singapore citizens are given priority in respect of

such aid and assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 10th of this month, on Tuesday, we heard

the Minister for Education outlining the Government

policy on education. What I feel strange about  his

speech  is that half of it was about Communism  and

chauvinism. I just do not understand and I fail  to

see how Communism, Marxism and Leninism should have

come  into his speech. In fact, he has talked  more

about Communism than the Minister for Education  in

other  countries  in the world,  and  even  in  the

Communist  countries. Perhaps he is just  like  our

friend Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



Rajaratnam who wants to go there to get a doctorate

in Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Members are not allowed to refer to

other Members of the House by their names. You  may

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Rajaratnam is

the  Minister for Culture. I will refer to  him  by

his  designation.  Mr Deputy Speaker,  the  P.A.P.

always say that the question of education is a very

emotional  one  and  can stir up  the  emotions  of

people  very  easily. The P.A.P. are always  making

use   of  educational  issues  to  stir  up  public

emotions.  I  shall make an adequate reply  to  his

allegation  of chauvinism and Communism  later  on.

Now  I  wish to deal with the figures given by  the

Minister  for Education in his speech. He has  said

that  the P.A.P. has implemented the six-year  free

primary  education for a few years.  He  also  says

that there are 460,000 students receiving education

in  Singapore. He also says that these children are

well-dressed and well-fed before they go to  school

and that this standard is very high in Singapore. I

do not know how he can bring in this matter of well

-dressed   and  well-fed  children  into  education,

unless  education  means eating  and  dressing  and

nothing  more than that. I dealt with the  question

of  education on Tuesday. In my speech I said  that

the  question of education cannot be explained away

by figures and slogans. Education should be made to

nurture  our  future generation.  The  question  is

whether  education managed by the  P.A.P. will  go

towards the fostering of a better generation. If he

wants to talk about figures and figures alone,  and

shout  slogans  and slogans alone, then  I  say  to

everybody in Singapore and to our future generation

that   it  is  useless,  and  even  to  the  P.A.P.

supporters it will be useless. What we want to know

is  the quality of education. What we want to  know

more  is  whether in the process of being  educated

children in schools will be able to learn how to be

human beings, how to become members of society  and

live  happily  in  a  community,  and  whether  the

knowledge  that they acquire in schools can  be  of

any  practical use to them when they  come  out  to

society. But the P.A.P. are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



more  interested in figures than in the quality  of

education.  You  may have some, children  receiving

education for six years but they are not able to go

for  further education and they have to go into the

streets  and  sometimes  they  may  fall  into  the

company   of   bad  associates  and   they   become

hooligans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member

seems  to say that our education system is  turning

out  hooligans. I do not know what  he  is  talking

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> I think the Member for Thomson is

speaking on a relevant matter. He may proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, may I

make an earnest request to the Members on the other

side  to  listen to me carefully? I am  talking  of

facts.  I  do  not say that the P.A.P.'s  education

system is to turn out hooligans. This is not what I

said.  Please  give  me time to speak  without  any

interruption. Nobody can ever deny  that  it  is  a

fact  that some children, who are unable to go  for

further  education,  fall into  bad  company  after

leaving  school. In Malay schools, Chinese schools,

English  schools, there are many children who  have

left  school and who are unable to find  jobs,  and

they  have no future and no outlet. Is this  not  a

point which should be taken up by the Government in

the review of the education structure? The Minister

for Education in his speech on Tuesday, the 10th of

this month, said, in the last four and a half years

the  Government has pushed forward a  programme  of

school  buildings, thereby providing  opportunities

for  children of various races to go to school.  He

said,  "We  are  faced with a very serious  problem

concerning  Chinese  education  in  the   twentieth

century  and that is the question of the Communists

making use of educational issues in Chinese schools

as a cover for their activities."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> From which paper is he

quoting?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Could the Member for Thomson answer

that and proceed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, I am

quoting from the Sin Chew Jit Poh of Wednesday.  If

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



Minister for Education is going to withdraw what he

said, I am not going to quote any more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I was going to advise him to

make  use of the Sin Chew Jit Poh, because it gives

a  better translation. I was worried that he  might

he reading from a different paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> You may proceed, Mr Koo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not know

whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Social  Affairs says that this  is  a  Barisan

paper,  but anyway we will forget about this  other

talk. We proceed with the debate. The Minister  for

Education  continued  - "to  a  certain  degree  the

Communists are successful, in that they are able to

instigate the children against the Government".  He

continued,   "these  political  opportunists   will

resort  to  all  ways  and means  to  make  use  of

educational  issues  to cover  up  their  insidious

activities  of  a political nature".  This  is  the

point  I have raised just now. On his speech, which

is   supposed  to  deal  with  education,  he   has

mentioned    Communist   activities    more    than

educational matters. I do not know how  far  he  is

true  in  making  this allegation.  Perhaps  he  is

making  an allegation about his own senior officer,

Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew.  If  there  is  anybody  using

educational  issues for their insidious objectives,

he  is  none other than Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I believe

we  are not so absent-minded in this connection. In

1954,  1955  and  1956, there were  camping-ins  in

various  Chinese schools. Mr Lee Kuan Yew at  that

time  was the legal adviser to the Singapore Middle

Schools' Students' Union. He was fighting very hard

for the Chinese school students against the Lim Yew

Hock  regime  and  the colonial masters  for  their

action  against Chinese education,  and  for  their

action  in  forcing  the children  in  the  Chinese

schools  to  become  soldiers for  the  purpose  of

national  registration.  So  if  the  Minister  for

Education  should  now  turn  round  and  say  that

educational  issues are being used  by  people  for

political purposes, then that person is none  other

than Mr Lee Kuan Yew, our Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think the Member should be at

least  courteous enough to refer to  the  Ministers

and     Parliamentary    Secretaries    by    their

designations. It is only a courtesy. I  mean,  they

may not accept the Constitution of the country, but

it is a courtesy which is expected of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Will the Member for Thomson please

remember  that  Members must  not  refer  to  other

Members  of  the  House  except  by  their  correct

designations  and  not  by  their  names?  He   may

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am very sorry, but

at  that time the Prime Minister was not the  Prime

Minister yet, so I have to refer to him by name. He

is now of course.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this allegation made by the Minister for

Education is not quite fair. Sonic people say  that

the P.A.P., in order to come to power, in 1955 came

out  to  fight for Chinese students,  to  speak  in

their  defence,  to see that justice  was  done  to

them.  But they have forgotten what they  had  done

and  they  now turn round and say that  it  is  the

Communists  who make use of educational  issues  in

Chinese schools to instigate the students.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have a grave

suspicion  that  if  that is  so,  then  our  Prime

Minister  is  a Communist as well. Mr  Speaker,  I

must  point  out  to you, if I remember  correctly,

that  our  Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,  on  a

certain  occasion when a meeting of  the  Singapore

Middle  Schools' Students' Union was held,  shouted

"Long  Live Chinese Education!" He said so  at  the

meeting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> When a Member is making an

allegation,  he  must quote the  source.  Could  he

indicate to us when, where and from what source Mr

Lee,  the  Prime Minister, shouted this  slogan  of

"Long  Live Chinese Education! "? Could  he  please

quote   the  source?  It  is  essential   for   our

reference?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Member for Thomson quote

the source?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, if you

want  to  know the place and the time, I think  the

Minister  for Culture should go and ask  the  Prime

Minister. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please allow the Member for

Thomson to proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I try

to  go over my speech as quickly as possible.  This

is  a  national issue, but the Minister for  Labour

always attempts to interrupt me. It seems that  our

friend  the Minister for Labour has eaten too  many

onions  and that is why he is letting out a lot  of

gas! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have had occasion previously to

ask  all  Members of the House not  to  attack  the

personal  conduct of any Member of  this  Assembly,

because one attack from one side of the House leads

to  an  attack from the other side, and it goes  on

and  on  forever. So I will remind the  Member  for

Thomson  not  to cast any aspersions  even  on  the

Minister for Labour. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, as a

matter of fact, the cause of the camping in and the

boycott by the Chinese school students was  due  to

the  fact that they had made legitimate claims  for

certain things. The true cause is mentioned in  the

speech  of the Minister. He said that the  colonial

regime    was    not   interested   in   education,

particularly Chinese education, in Singapore.  That

is  why the Chinese themselves had to take it  upon

themselves  to build schools to educate  their  own

children. When employment avenues opened up for the

English  school  students, then the  school-leavers

from  the  Chinese  stream were despondent  because

they felt that they were not wanted by society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of order. I suggest

that  when the Member for Thomson quotes, he should

not  quote  out of context but he should  give  the

particular period which I referred to.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If he can, and if he wishes to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> No. I was referring to prewar ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister say that he was

reading out of context? He was referring to prewar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> No. I was referring to prewar

and  not  during the time of the P.A.P. Government.

But  he  did not quote the period when the  Chinese

educated     were    rejected,    and    employment

opportunities were denied to the Chinese educated.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well. Please proceed, Mr Koo

Young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If what the Minister

has  said existed in the past, then I say that  the

same  situation also exists at the present  moment.

The  P.A.P. say that during their term  of  office

there has been equality in education. But they  are

unable to convince the people of whatever they say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the question of Communists in the

field  of  education  does not actually  exist.  It

exists  in  name only. If there is any  unrest  and

discontent, it is because the P.A.P., to a  certain

degree,  are perpetuating the educational  policies

of the colonial masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, the 10th of December, I spoke very

clearly  on five points. I believe that if  we  put

aside our party affiliations for the time being and

look  at  the  matter  from the purely  educational

point  of view, then we can examine the educational

policies of the P.A.P. and realise that what I have

said is true. I quoted on Tuesday the speech of the

ex-Education  Minister  from  an  article  entitled

Youth is the Spring of the Nation. Mr Speaker, the

P.A.P., in trying to cover up their mistakes in the

field  of  education,  make  the  allegation   that

Chinese  school  students have been manipulated  by

the  Communists.  They even go  to  the  extent  of

smearing  the students. Now, how are they going  to

explain  the position of the merchants who  support

and finance Chinese education? [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Well, they turn round

and call



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



these people Chinese chauvinists. Mr Speaker,  the

P.A.P. always make the allegation that the Barisan

Sosialis  always  bring  up educational  issues  in

order  to  stir up public feelings and  discontent.

But  the  people who really stir up public feelings

are  the  P.A.P.  They talk about chauvinism.  This

allegation  about chauvinistic feelings can  easily

stir  up the emotional feelings of other races  and

even  give rise to misunderstanding. This is a very

dangerous game to play. We warn the P.A.P. now that

if,  as  a  result of what they have done and  what

they  are doing, there is any racial riot  - as  the

Prime  Minister  has said, a riot  like  the  Maria

Hertogh  riot  - then  they  should  be  held  fully

responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education says that the

directors  of  the Chinese schools are chauvinistic

in  their outlook. In the same way, they smear  the

School Management Committees as organisations which

run  schools  on  a  commercial basis.  Both  these

allegations  are equally insulting  to  the  people

concerned.  I am talking of facts. I am not  trying

to  stir  up  any feelings or sour up relationships

between people. Mr Speaker, we urge the P.A.P. to

give  equal  treatment  to  the  four  streams   of

education in the real sense of the term. I  believe

that   if  the  P.A.P. can  actually  give   equal

treatment to the four streams of education, then we

will support them to the fullest extent.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of encouraging the learning of

the  national  language and the  assistance  to  be

given to our Malay brothers for higher education, I

say  that  we  are in full support of  this  P.A.P.

policy.  But I wish to tell them now that in  spite

of   their  slogans  and  publicity  given  to  the

"National Language Month" and the rest of it,  they

are  unable  to promote fully the learning  of  the

national language. They are just putting up a show.

Some  years ago, the Adult Education Board  started

many  Malay classes in the night. But what  is  the

position now?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al- Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Why do you not want to

learn?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Parliamentary

Secretary asks me why I do not learn Malay. Yes,  I

do. What is the position now? What has happened  to

all  these  national  language classes?  They  have

disappeared, and the P.A.P. have become  quiet.  In

some schools, at the beginning there were about  10

classes,  but  now  there are  only  two  or  three

classes left. Formerly, there were about 30  to  40

students  in each class, but now you can only  find

about  8  to  10 students in each class.  What  has

happened? Why has this happened? Is it because  the

people   are   unwilling  to  learn  the   national

language? Or is it because they joined the  classes

only for a short while and then left? It is because

the  P.A.P. have not got a comprehensive  plan  to

encourage  the  learning of the national  language.

Many  people joined these classes with  high  hopes

but   because  they  were  unable  to  obtain  good

results,   they  were  discouraged  and  left   the

classes.  This  is  a very good  example  of  their

failure  to  promote  the  study  of  the  national

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the aid to be given to our Malay brothers for

higher  education,  we  are accused  of  having  no

interest  in this matter. We are now bringing  this

up  to show that we are really interested in it. In

our Budget, we see under subheads 16 and 17 of Head

40  that  the aid to be given to Malay students  at

the   Singapore   Polytechnic  and  the   Singapore

Vocational Institute by way of bursaries  has  been

reduced  in  terms  of money. Bursaries  and  other

forms of assistance to students at the Universities

of  Singapore  and Malaya have also  been  reduced.

Bursaries  for  the Singapore Polytechnic  and  the

Singapore  Vocational Institute have  been  reduced

from  $50,000  for  1963 to $20,000  for  1964.  In

respect   of   students  at  the  Universities   of

Singapore  and Malaya, the amount has been  reduced

from  $50,000 in 1963 to $40,000 in 1964.  We  draw

the  attention of the Government to this point  and

these  figures.  We  hope  that  the  Parliamentary

Secretary   to   the  Minister  for  Education   in

particular will pay attention to this. We just want

to  know why these reductions have been made. Is it

because the Malay students in the universities  and

the Polytechnic have, after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



five  years of P.A.P. aid, left the institutes  and

the  aid  has therefore got to be reduced? Or  what

other reasons have they got?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, nobody can ever deny that education is

a  national matter and that it must not be used to

serve the interests of a Party, nor should it be allowed

to  be  made use of to  achieve  political ends.  Nobody

can deny these facts and  assertions. If   the  People's

Action  Party  try  to  control education,  then  the

consequences  will  be  very grave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already pointed out certain facts to show

that   the   P.A.P. are  trying  to  control   and

monopolise  education  for  their  own   ends   and

objectives. My facts have now been proved and  they

will continue to be proved in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to bring out more facts and

examples to supplement what I have said a few  days

ago.  At the 8th Executive Council meeting  of  the

Singapore Chinese Teachers' Union the P.A.P.'s  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary to to the ex-Minister  for

Education,  who is now the Political  Secretary  to

the  Prime  Minister, instigated some  teachers  to

capture  the  leadership of  the  Union.  For  what

reasons?  The  reasons are that  the  7th  and  8th

Executive  Council  members exposed  the  education

policy   of   the   P.A.P.  Some  teachers,   under

intimidation, coercion and inducement, carried  out

instructions  to  capture  the  leadership  and  so

overthrow the Executive Council led by Mr Lim Seck

Kian. The ex-Parliamentary Secretary hunted that if

they were successful in overthrowing the leadership

they  would be promoted. As a result, many  of  the

teachers became principals of schools. Many  school

clerks    were   promoted   to   become   teachers.

[Interruption] If you want me to produce  evidence,

I might expose your evil deeds and weaknesses.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Apart from this, it

is said that the P.A.P. planted their own people as

school  teachers,  school  clerks  or  even  school

servants  in the various schools. Their job  is  to

investigate  whether the teachers  in  the  schools

supported their education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



policy  or  not.  Is it good for  them  to  do  so?

[Interruption] The Minister for Labour is a  second

Ngo Dinh Diem.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Please allow the Member for

Thomson  to proceed without interruption.  We  have

one  and  a half hours left. I was hoping we  might

finish this debate before even eight o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what is the result of their action? Will it do  any

good  to  the  P.A.P.? Will it do any good  to  the

cause  of  education  itself?  The  principals  and

teachers  are  worried. They  are  in  a  state  of

anxiety. Whenever they explain their lessons,  they

must be careful lest they say something which might

lead  to  their dismissal. If they are not able  to

carry  out  the work of educating our pupils  in  a

peaceful  atmosphere and without fear and  anxiety,

how  is  it possible for them to educate our future

generation   in  a  better  way  of  life?   Graver

situations  have arisen. In order  to  control  the

educational  institutions, the P.A.P. have  sacked

all  those who do not support them in the field  of

education.  But  the  P.A.P. dare  not  sack  these

people  themselves. On the other hand,  they  force

innocent   people,  like  members  of  the   School

Management  Committee, to do the work of dismissing

their  political opponents and all those whom  they

do  not like. Of course, the P.A.P. can do whatever

they  like at the present moment. These people dare

not  oppose  them. It is really  too  mean  of  the

P.A.P. to  do this. Instead of asking  the  School

Management Committee to sack the teachers whom they

do  not  like,  why do they not sack  the  teachers

themselves? [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, there

is a tendency on the part of the P.A.P. not only to

control the regular schools, but also to monopolise

organisations and movements for the eradication  of

illiteracy. Not only do they not praise some of the

literacy classes run by others, but they also  want

to   obstruct  other  people  from  running   their

literacy classes. We have this to ask the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can they solve our illiteracy problem by

monopolising  this campaign for the eradication  of

illiteracy? After having been in office for so many

years,  what results have they achieved in the  way

of  eradicating  illiteracy?  If  the  campaign  is

helped by other people or organisations, I am  sure

the  number of illiterate people will become  fewer

and fewer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about the new slogan

which  has been brought forward by the P.A.P.  This

is  to raise the standard of teaching of the second

and third languages in the schools. I have said  in

the past that this slogan is good. But we call upon

the  P.A.P. to  carry  out  this  programme  in  a

practical way. They must achieve results.  We  urge

upon  the P.A.P. to find ways and means of  how  to

raise  the  standard of teaching of the second  and

third languages. The period devoted to the teaching

of  geography,  history, science,  mathematics  and

other technical subjects is becoming less and less.

It is not possible to reduce this period further in

order  to  increase the period for the teaching  of

the second and third languages. The children in the

vernacular  schools  have  also  fewer   hours   in

learning  their mother tongue. They have  only  one

hour  a  day  to  learn their  mother  tongue.  The

Government cannot further reduce the period for the

teaching of the mother tongue in order to teach the

second and third languages. How then are the P.A.P.

to  raise  the standard of these second  and  third

languages? Are they prepared to curtail  the  hours

of  teaching,  or do they propose to turn  all  the

textbooks   on  history,  geography,  science   and

mathematics into English textbooks in the Malay and

Tamil  schools?  If it is so, I  believe  that  the

raising  of  the standard of the second  and  third

languages   will  be  tantamount  to  raising   the

standard of English only. This will result  in  the

lowering  of  the standard of the other  vernacular

languages.  I  hope the Minister will  pay  careful

attention to this point. If they really have a good

educational  programme which is not detrimental  to

the   teaching  of  the  mother  tongue  and  other

subjects  like  science and  mathematics,  then  in

principle it is good to raise the standard  of  the

second and third languages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I were to join the P.A.P.,

then  I  would  be  forced  to  shout.  "Communist,

Communist!" all the time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Opportunist!



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They only know how

to  enjoy  life. On the 26th of November the  Prime

Minister, in talking to a reporter of the Sin  Chew

Jit  Poh,  referred to the learning of  the  mother

tongue. He said that the War broke out in 1942.  He

said  that  in  those difficult years  it  was  the

Chinese  educated who were brave and most  able  to

endure the difficulties. He continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I also found that the Chinese, because of their

long  tradition of culture and history, arc  imbued

with virtues and a high sense of morals. When I was

in  Europe,  I  had occasion to meet students  from

China  and  other Chinese students.  I  found  that

those  who  had received education in their  mother

tongue and those who had received Chinese education

were very polite generally.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Point of order.

If  the  Member for Thomson is going  to  read  the

whole  text instead of just giving a precis of  the

printed  matter he is reading, then I am afraid  he

is wasting our time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Under our Standing Orders, a Member

can  read from the text of a newspaper when  he  is

quoting.  I  am sure he is not going to  waste  our

time   by  reading  the  whole  newspaper.   Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am going to read

only a short passage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those who were not educated in their mother

tongue  or  those who were not educated in  Chinese

are totally different. Their way of thinking, their

feelings,  and  their  way  of  life  are   totally

different. It is easy to distinguish between  these

two groups of students.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that this discovery had

deepened  his conviction in the value of  education

in  the  mother  tongue. Whatever education  people

receive, they must first receive education in their

mother  tongue, whether in Chinese, Malay or Tamil.

And these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



words  were  spoken  by the  Prime  Minister  to  a

reporter of the Sin Chew Jit Poh. We admire him; we

pay  high  tribute to him for his  high  esteem  of

education in the mother tongue. But we hope that he

will  not only pay lip service to what he has said,

but he must also carry it out. If the P.A.P. ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There is one microphone

amongst  Members of the Assembly or  those  in  the

Gallery  which is blasting in Malay.  Can  we  just

check?  It is a little disturbing, and I  would  be

obliged  if  Members could assist. Please  proceed.

Mr Koo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What we urge is that

the P.A.P. should carry cut what the Prime Minister

has  said, and that they should not merely pay  lip

service or merely carry out propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On education, our demand is that the P.A.P. must

carry   out  their  promises  and  put  them   into

practice,  and not accuse us of stirring up  racial

feelings, or of having penetrated the schools. What

are  they like? If we ask them to do these  things,

they accuse us of being Communists and of trying to

stir  up all sorts of disturbances. What about they

themselves?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sincerely hope that the Party in power,

especially   the   Minister  for  Education,   will

consider  our suggestion and not merely talk  about

Communists,  chauvinism, or of stirring  up  racial

feelings.   The  Minister  should  face   education

problems and try to solve them, if he can do so,  I

think  these problems will be resolved  easily  and

there will be success.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al- Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,   nobody  can  deny  the   importance   of

education  and  teaching  in  the  development  and

progress of a nation. Because of the importance  of

education,  the  P.A.P., in merging Singapore  with

the  Federation, have defended and safeguarded  its

autonomy in education.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members who have left the Party and crossed

over  to  the Opposition in the last session  about

two  years  ago  did  not dare  speak  about  Malay

education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



They merely spoke about Chinese education. I warned

them  at that time to look into education in  other

streams,  i.e. other than the Chinese  stream,  for

example,  in the Malay, Tamil and English  streams.

But today is the first time I have heard the Member

for   Thomson  say  that  his  Party  supports  the

Government's  policy which gives special  treatment

to  Malay  education. It seems that they  have  now

changed  their  attitude  after  failing   in   the

election to get the support of the Malays. I  think

they  are  doing this not out of sincerity  but  to

show to the Malays that they are the champions who

will  safeguard  the rights of the Malays  in  this

Assembly. They have indirectly slapped the face  of

the Malay Members here on this side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are not communalistic. That is

why  you  can  see  that we have Chinese,  Indians,

Ceylonese, Eurasians and Malays on this side of the

House.  All  but one of the Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis   are   Chinese.  The   Barisan   Sosialis

previously   entrusted  the   question   of   Malay

education  to  the  Party  Rakyat  who  are   their

colleagues  and  comrades-in-arms. Since  they  had

entrusted  the  Party Rakyat  to  fight  for  Malay

education  that  was  why  the  Party  Rakyat   had

instigated the Malay children in the Geylang  Craft

Centre  to  go  on  strike. But  let  me  say,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that it is better to keep quiet,  so

that people cannot judge whether they are stupid or

clever,  than  to  speak and show  ignorance  on  a

certain subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the students in the Geylang Craft Centre

go  on  strike? If we were to investigate this,  it

would take two or three hours. This was because  of

the  members  of Party Rakyat. The  leader  of  the

strikers  was the fiancee of the Chairman of  Party

Rakyat. There is no use for me to speak further  on

this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain to this Assembly the

tactics  of their struggle in the education  field.

With  regard to the Chinese middle school students,

I  am  not against them. I would like to state that

the  P.A.P. fight  for autonomy  in  education  to

safeguard and improve the standard in all the  four

streams  of  education in Singapore.  This  is  our

task. Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



objective  is to fight so that all schools  in  the

four language streams will get equal treatment. But

unfortunately there are people who use  educational

problems  in a very peculiar way. I would  like  to

stress  in  this  Assembly that in the  history  of

Singapore  there is no one except  the  P.A.P. who

have  improved Malay education. Malay schools  have

been  built  for the past hundred years, especially

in  the  colonial days but there is  not  a  single

Malay  secondary  school. It  was  only  after  the

P.A.P. came to power that a Malay secondary school

was  built.  There are now two of them.  With  this

proof,  is  the allegation made by the Member  just

now  true,  that  the Government  have  disregarded

Malay  education? This is just a move so that  they

can win over the Malay votes because their comrades

in Party Rakyat failed to win even a single seat in

this Assembly. The candidate who lost in Ulu Pandan

has  run  away  to Indonesia and is supporting  the

United  States of Kalimantan Utara. Are  these  the

kind  of  men who want to fight for the destiny  of

our  people and defend the fate of our nation?  But

when  we face confrontation, these people run  away

to  the  enemy? As the Malay proverb goes: "If  the

house is on fire, all the rats will run away."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I on the Government side am

responsible for the national language campaign. But

let me remind them that it is the responsibility of

every citizen to urge members of the public to join

the  schools and classes which are sponsored by the

Adult Education Board. But in most cases there  are

elements  that obstruct and hinder the people  from

joining  these  classes, so that now these  classes

are  dwindling.  Who  are to  blame?  If  they  are

sincere, come forward. It is in this Assembly  that

the  Government  provided $3 per hour  to  give  to

teachers who teach the national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a single Member from the Opposition

wanting  to  speak  the national  language  in  the

Assembly. The teachers are paid. Now they  want  to

speak  about  others.  Let  them  cut  their   coat

according to their cloth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to bursaries being cut, it already

happened  the last time in this Assembly  when  the

U.M.N.O. was in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



the  Opposition. The U.M.N.O. said that the  P.A.P.

was  treating  the  Malays like step-children  with

regard to education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount allocated is sufficient and adequate,

because the Malay secondary schools have been built

during  the time the P.A.P. are in power.  Only  in

1960  was  it  possible to build a Malay  secondary

school  and  there  is no single student  that  has

passed  out  from that school this year. Therefore,

if  we  are  to  follow  the development  in  Malay

education, let us not speak about matters which  we

do  not  know of, lest others should laugh  at  us,

just  like the Malay folk-lore that says about  the

stupid man jumping with a pumpkin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Members of the Barisan Sosialis want to

clean  themselves of the allegation of  communalism

and  so  forth, it is better for them not to  speak

about communalism. You are the ones who set fire to

the  thing  and then you accuse others  of  setting

fire  to  it. The carcass of an elephant cannot  be

hidden by a coconut husk. It is clear to the people

of  Singapore that the incidents in the past  prove

that   Members   of  the  Barisan   Sosialis   used

communalism.  They used communalism  for  elections

and  other  issues. Therefore, there  is  no  Malay

Member who represents the Barisan Sosialis in  this

Assembly.  These are facts. We treat all  as  equal

and  we  safeguard  the rights of  all  communities

Malays, Indians, Eurasians. Look at us. Because  we

fight for equal rights and equal treatment for all,

we  are  therefore  chosen by the  people.  We  are

members   of   all  communities.   In   the   Malay

constituencies  like the Southern Islands,  Geylang

Serai and Kampong Kembangan, which previously  were

fortified  places of U.M.N.O., we  won  over  them,

because    we   do   not   differentiate    between

communities.  Therefore, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  if  we

talk  about  communalism, we should reply  to  that

allegation and accuse them that they are  the  ones

who are communalistic. Let us refer to the speeches

made  by  the  Opposition Members from the  Barisan

Sosialis,  during those years that they  have  been

here. Let us check what they have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members</b> rose ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I notice that we have less than one

hour and I see that so many Members are anxious  to

speak. I cannot impose on any Member and ask him to

cut  down his speech. I can merely request  Members

on  both  sides  of the House to  be  as  brief  as

possible so that as many as possible can be  heard.

Mr Chia Thye Poh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Party in power used to say  that

they  wanted to hear constructive suggestions  from

us,  but  whenever the Opposition put  forward  any

constructive  suggestions,  they  turn  round   and

accuse  us of trying to create trouble or make  use

of the issues under discussion to create trouble to

further our own purposes. We always put forward our

constructive suggestions and it is the  P.A.P. and

the  Back benches who interrupt and accuse us.  The

P.A.P. are  the real persons who do not  want  our

constructive suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the speech by the Minister, he has said

that  in  Singapore equal treatment  for  the  four

streams of education has been achieved and  he  has

given  certain  figures to show that the  so-called

"lies"  about  the  Left-wing  P.A.P.  Government's

destruction of Chinese education are unfounded.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show that this allegation is wrong, he has

used  the  figures of students and  schools.  These

figures,  of  course, are only those favourable  to

them. The Minister dare not give the other side  of

the  picture  because it will go to show  that  his

policy is not really giving equal treatment to all.

If  it is really true that there is equal treatment

for  all four streams of education, I will ask  him

to  produce  figures  of  the  last  few  years  of

students   in   the   four   streams   of   schools

respectively, and show in which stream  the  number

of students has increased faster; show which stream

of education has been fostered and developed faster

than  the others. He dare not give us such figures.

He   has   mentioned  Government  Chinese   Primary

Schools. How is it that he dare not give us figures

relating  to  the  numbers  of  Government  English

schools, Malay schools, and other schools to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



serve  as a comparison? How is it that he dare  not

give us such figures? And he dare not also disclose

how  many schools have been closed down under  such

pretexts  as unhygienic conditions in such schools.

How  many such schools have been closed during  the

course  of the past few years? He dare not tell  us

the  figures of these schools. As a result  of  his

policy, teachers, principals and others were sacked

and  schools  dissolved on the pretext  that  their

activities  were  detrimental  to  the  State   and

endangered  the  security of  the  State.  This  is

suppression  and, not a true education  policy.  I

hope  if there is any equality in education,  there

should  be  equality all round and  not  just  one-sided. The figures given should show both sides  of

the  story and not just one side. He says  that  in

Government Chinese Primary Schools, more than  half

of  them  are integrated schools. If these  schools

can  really  bring  students of various  races  and

enable them to live harmoniously together, then  we

will welcome them. We will be glad about it. But is

this  the  case? It is not. The P.A.P. are  turning

Chinese schools into English schools and integrated

schools into English schools. They are also  making

students from schools other than English to  become

English school students. And English has been  used

as  the main stream of education. Other streams  of

education  are not well looked after. Most  of  the

administrative staff are English-educated too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the policy of integrated schools, it is

always the English schools which are being used  as

the    pivot.   There   are   only   English/Malay,

English/Chinese   and   English/Tamil    integrated

schools.  In  the integrated schools built  by  the

Government, we can see that they have resulted from

the  dissolution of certain Chinese  schools.  When

such  Chinese  schools  were dissolved,  they  were

integrated into English schools. These are their so-called integrated schools. These are the facts. The

simple picture is this. I would be taking up a  lot

of  time  if  I were to mention other examples  and

enumerate more facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on Malay education, a Member from the

Government side said that the P.A.P. have,  in  the

course of their office,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



built a good number of Malay schools. He said  this

situation  had  never existed  under  the  colonial

regime. He also claimed that they had achieved more

than  had  been achieved in the past. The  Minister

said  that under the P.A.P. rule two Malay  schools

were  created. He said "created". He said  this  in

order  to  praise the achievements of his education

policy.  I would say that Malay education  was  not

allowed to develop in the past because it was under

the suppression and control of a colonial power. If

there are Malay schools today, it is the result  of

the  fight by the Malay community itself. From  the

talks  given  by  Malay  educationists,  they  have

claimed  this  because they  have  all  along  been

insisting on having more Malay schools built.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> On a point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche A. Rahim Ishak:</b> The point of order is to

show  an  untruth just uttered by  the  Member  for

Jurong. Under the Lim Yew Hock regime, there was  a

Malay  Assistant Minister and there were many Malay

members in the Government. But in spite of the long

struggle by the Malay Education Council calling for

the establishment of Malay secondary schools, not a

single Malay secondary school was established.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary cannot

debate  this point. His point of order is that  the

Member for Jurong has stated an untruth. But surely

that  is  a  matter  of opinion. The  Parliamentary

Secretary can reply to it as soon as the Member for

Jurong has finished. Please proceed. Mr Chia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In the speech

given  by  the Member from the Government side,  he

also  admitted that as a result of the  efforts  of

the  Malay  community, we see nowadays  more  Malay

schools. You do not have to claim it as due to  the

merits of the P.A.P. After the setting up of  these

two  schools not very long ago, the students of one

of these two, namely, the Malay Girls Craft School,

went on strike.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



The  Member  who  spoke on this  subject  just  now

accused  the  Party Rakyat of being the instigators

of  the  strike. He dare not accuse us any more  of

being the instigators of the strike. Let us see the

report  that appeared on the 20th of October.  This

is  a memorandum submitted by the striking students

to the Minister for Education. Let me quote from it

in order to show the truth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> When he is quoting from a

document, he should produce the document.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not quite followed, Mr

Minister. I did not know what he was quoting from.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Now he says he, is quoting from a

memorandum. I notice he is quoting from his  notes.

If he is quoting from a memorandum, he must produce

the memorandum.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If he has got the memorandum.

Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was talking

about  the extract contained in the memorandum.  If

the  Minister for Education wants to have the  full

facts  he and the Minister for Culture can go  back

and refer to the records. Here in my file is also a

copy  written in Malay. If he wants to read it,  he

can  come  now and read it from my file. I  have  a

copy   in   Malay  distributed  by  these  striking

students action committee. The memorandum says,  "I

feel  the graduates of this school do not have  any

outlet    or    opportunity   because    Government

departments and commercial firms do not esteem  our

value. Our graduation certificates are deemed to be

valueless  and  are not recognised.  The  Singapore

Government   do   not  recognise   our   graduation

certificates,  not to mention about private  firms.

We  are very sorry for this situation and are  very

concerned because the Singapore Government has  not

taken  any  steps  to Improve the situation  or  to

remedy it. We appeal to all the parents of students

and  members of the public to pay attention to this

fact.  We  have received various promises from  the

Government, but they are of no use."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called equality of treatment to all the

four  streams  of education amounts  to  this.  The

Party in power has just now accused us of being not

concerned with Malay education.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In raising this question, I hope they will not

say  that we are trying to get the support  of  the

Malay community, or that we are trying to play  the

communal line. The Government benches have  accused

us  of  rousing up racial feelings.  Who  is  doing

this? The P.A.P. have been telling the Chinese that

the  Barisan  Sosialis wants  to  collaborate  with

Indonesia,  which is anti-Chinese,  and  therefore,

the  Barisan  is anti-Chinese. Now, this  has  come

from  the horse's own mouth. It came from the  last

Member  who  spoke. This kind of talk  will  create

disquieting   racial  feelings,  disturbances   and

disharmony. There are Malay Members in our Party as

well.  If  the Government had not resorted  to  the

P.P.S.O. and other repressive measures,  we  would

have  had  many more Malay brothers among our  rank

and  file.  But  since  so many  of  us  have  been

arrested   and   suppressed  all   along   by   the

Government,  the result is that we  are  left  with

members on our side who are mainly Chinese. This is

the  result  of Government's repressive action.  We

even  have Malays in our Central Executive Council.

This  is a fact the Government cannot deny. We have

all  along been concerned with Malay education.  We

hope   that   Malay  education  will  develop   and

flourish,  and that it will take its place  in  our

stream  of education. We regret very much  that  in

the  past  colonialism and imperialism have  curbed

Malay  education with the result that the  progress

of Malay education has been retarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the P.A.P. Government whether it is

their  intention  to set up a Malay  university.  I

would  ask  them  whether they would  consider  the

matter seriously. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have not much time left. We will

stop at 7.55 p.m. The more the Member for Jurong is

interrupted, the longer he will take to finish  his

speech. Please allow him to proceed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When Members of

the Opposition queried certain matters relating  to

education  today, the Minister for  Education  said

that  he did not have the figures concerning  Tamil

education.  He  is  not paying attention  to  Tamil

education, and that is why he has not ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Jurong please

proceed? I have just ruled ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> A Committee of Inquiry into

Tamil  Education is sitting at the moment.  It  has

not  finished its deliberations. When the Committee

has  finished its deliberations and its report  has

been  published,  I  am sure the  reasons  will  be

given.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the Minister's point that the

matter is sub judice?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> No, I do not want to say at

this point what are the reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We can,

therefore, see that the so-called P.A.P. education

policy of giving equality of treatment to the  four

language  streams has not amounted  to  much.  Ever

since the P.A.P. came to power, the number of Tamil-

educated students has remained at the static figure

of  between  1,300 and 1,500 students. Why  do  the

Government  not take further steps  to  help  Tamil

education? There are more Tamil students in English

schools  than  there are Tamil  students  in  Tamil

schools. The number is many times more. It  may  be

about ten-fold. Why is there such a phenomenon?  It

is   because  the  P.A.P.  Government  have   never

seriously  tried to understand the difficulties  of

Tamil  education in the past. They have never tried

to develop Tamil education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates from Tamil schools find it difficult to

obtain  employment. Tamil schools find it difficult

to  get  support  from  the Government,  the  Tamil

community, and the public as a whole. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



feel   the  Government  should  not  ignore   Tamil

education.  We  feel that the Government  have  not

taken  proper measures to look after the  education

of  the  Tamil community in the last few years.  As

disclosed  by  the  Minister  for  Education,   the

Government have set up a Committee of Inquiry  into

Tamil  Education. According to the reports  in  the

Press,  there  is an inquiry into the Umar  Pulavar

Tamil High School to find out what the Ministry  of

Education should do in order to raise the  standard

of  teaching  in this school and other  matters.  I

hope that after this investigation, the P.A.P. will

be able to help Tamil education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also hope that the Party in power will not

allege that because we have raised this matter,  we

want  the  support of the Tamil community.  If  the

Government have the interest of Tamil education  at

heart, they should have raised the point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few days we have been debating

the  question of printing official documents in all

the four official languages. We find it regrettable

that  the Minister for Labour should blame  us  for

not  having been educated in English. This is their

attitude.   This  is  a  question  of   fundamental

principles. It is a question of whether the  P.A.P.

are really sincere in their desire to have equality

of  treatment for all the four languages.  Do  they

recognise this principle or not? They put the blame

on  us  by  saying  that we did not  try  to  learn

English  in the past. It is a question of  adopting

the  principle of having documents printed  in  all

the  four languages. Nothing more than that.  Since

the  Government  have not been really  implementing

the  policy  of giving equal treatment to  all  the

four language streams, many parents have sent their

children  to English schools. I urge the Government

to  do  something more to help implement the policy

of  equality of treatment for all the four  streams

of  education.  Before the P.A.P.  Government  have

achieved the objective of equality of treatment, we

find that they have inherited the evils left by the

colonial regime.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Point of order, Sir. The

Member is repeating his points over and over again.

This  is  a waste of time. This is a repetition.  I

have heard it several times.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think he is repeating

himself. [Interruption] No comments, please. I rule

that  he is not out of order. I realise that  there

are only 25 minutes left. I pointed that out to the

Member 25 minutes ago. I have asked Members not  to

interrupt.  The  more Members interrupt,  the  less

time will they have available. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We find that

education  laws and regulations left  over  by  the

colonialists  are still in force  today,  e.g. the 1957 Education Ordinance. Why is it not  repealed?

If   the   Government   are   really   sincere   in

implementing  their new education  policy,  why  do

they  not  repeal  laws  made  under  the  colonial

regime? Furthermore, in the programme of education,

we  notice that the curriculum and textbooks  still

smack  of  colonialism and colonial ideas.  If  the

Government  agree  that  the  existence   of   such

textbooks  and curricula is wrong, then  they  must

take  steps to remove them and improve upon it.  If

they  say  that  the Communists are trying  to  use

kindergarten   classes   to   indoctrinate   school

children,  then  in  the whole education  structure

this system of enslavement should be removed in the

first place. Why do they not direct their attention

to  this aspect? The point now is whether they want

to  eradicate colonial colour from our  educational

structure or not. There is no question of Communist

manipulation of schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. make use of the Communist

bogey  for  one objective, and that is to  try  and

cover  up their failures in implementing the policy

of equal treatment of the four educational streams.

In  covering up their mistakes on this aspect, they

put  the  blame on the Communists saying that  they

try  to destroy Chinese education, to instigate the

students into going on strike, and so on.  But  one

of  the Members opposite said that the decrease  in

the student enrolment in Chinese schools is not due

to the "strike" of students. I hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



the  Member  who  has  said this  will  not  remain

silent.  He  must  admit that he has  made  such  a

statement.  He  cannot just change the  story  from

time  to  time. They cannot give one  side  of  the

picture and forget the other side. They just cannot

change the story every so often to puzzle others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to talk about academic freedom and

autonomy in universities. The P.A.P. have all along

been trying to gain control of the two universities

in  Singapore. Before the P.A.P. can achieve  their

control  over  Nanyang University, they  have  made

certain allegations which are sheer nonsense.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, in moving his motion of

thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, said

that  because of financial problems, there are many

difficulties  besetting  the  University.  If   the

difficulties are not solved within five years, then

Nanyang  University will become the  University  of

Yenan. Now let me refute him on this point. Here is

a  newspaper which reports that Dr Sreenivasan, an

expert  in  education,  and  who  is  the  ex-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore said in a

letter to the Prime Minister that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, can we have the

date  of  the  newspaper and  the  source  of  this

information?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The newspaper is there before the

Member.  Well, could the Member cite  the  date  of

that newspaper, and what newspaper it is?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am quoting the

Nanyang  Siang Pau of 27th October, 1963, Singapore

news,  page  1, which publishes the letter  of  Dr

Sreenivasan  to the Prime Minister  dated  the  5th

July, 1963:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A few months ago when I accepted the post of

Vice-Chancellor,  I  discovered  that  there   were

certain discouraging aspects among the staff in the

University.   The  staff  were  afraid   that   the

Government  might  interfere  with  their  academic

freedom and the autonomy of the University.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 12th February, 1963, in another letter to

the Prime Minister, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government should not give me a tutelar

position if I am not given actual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



powers  to  deal  with  the  requirements  of   the

students  and  to  have enough  funds  to  run  the

University. I will be forced to accept not so well-qualified staff if insufficient funds are given to me.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that financial autonomy

will  strangle academic freedom. That is  what  the

Prime   Minister   said  in  respect   of   Nanyang

University, but this point has been well  taken  up

by   the  Vice-Chancellor  of  the  University   of

Singapore,  that  as long as financial  powers  are

held  by  the Government, then academic freedom  is

threatened to a very great extent.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the hon. Member that

we  have  only 20 minutes more? He has  been  quite

long  on  his feet. Could he wind up his  arguments

quickly, as I think it is fair to give the Minister

for Education a little time to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I shall try to

cut short my speech as far as possible. I will just

give  you the main points now. As a matter of fact,

if financial control is in the hands of the P.A.P.,

they   will  abuse  such  control  and  they   will

interfere with the autonomy of the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says, it is likely that

Nanyang  University will become  Yenan  University.

But  that  is  very  ridiculous.  Actually  Nanyang

University is using textbooks written and published

in  America. How can it be said that it will become

Yenan  University? In fact, the staff  come  mostly

from  places other than Yenan and Communist  China.

Under  these  circumstances, how can you  say  that

Nantah  will ever become Yenan University? This  is

ridiculous. We know that the Government will always

try  to make use of preposterous excuses to further

their   cause.  We  have  a  suspicion   that   the

Government  are  trying to take  further  steps  to

suppress Nanyang University by refusing the permits

of  some  members  of  the  staff  of  the  Nanyang

University to extend their stay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go further into the question of autonomy

in  education.  The  P.A.P. have  all  along  been

boasting about autonomy in education. But the facts

have shown that there is no autonomy in education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



When they want to take steps against any school  or

any educational organisation, all that they have to

do  is to brand these people as Communists, and the

Central  Government  will then take  police  action

against  them.  This  is the game  they  play  with

regard  to  autonomy in education. If  they  really

want  to  give us autonomy in education, then  when

the   Central   Government   arrest   persons    in

educational  circles, what should  the  P.A.P. do?

They  should speak on behalf and in defence of  the

persons arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have already stated very clearly

that  the greatest crisis existing in the field  of

education is that the P.A.P. are making use of  the

State  machinery  and  political  powers  to  bring

politics into the schools in Singapore, and to take

action  against those who do not agree  with  them.

They  take  steps to dismiss teachers  who  do  not

agree with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Chia, can you wind up

the debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> Yes. (In Mandarin) If they

really  want  to  have autonomy in education,  then

they  must allow those who are really dedicated  to

education  to  take part in teaching our  children.

They  should  not allow personnel from the  Special

Branch  to run education in Singapore. That is  the

end of my speech, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I just wish

to  answer some of the points that have been raised

by the various speakers in the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson alleged just now that many

of  the  students  can  only attend  six  years  of

primary education and that thereafter they have  to

leave  school  with no opportunity  to  proceed  to

secondary  education.  Sir,  I  think  this  is   a

falsehood which must be corrected. Any student  who

passes his primary school-leaving examination  will

be given a place in a secondary school and even for

those  who  fail  in  their primary  school-leaving

examination, a place will be found for  them  in  a

vocational  school  where  they  will  receive  two

further years of education with a vocational bias.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations have also been made that many of the

secondary school-leavers cannot find jobs, and  for

this I will give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



two  reasons. One is the economic problem  and  the

other  is  the  problem  of the  education  system.

Unless  the economy of the country can prosper  and

develop, however perfect your education system  is,

there   will  still  be  this  problem  of  finding

employment opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the secondary school education, we

have  decided  that the previous  emphasis  on  the

grammar  school stream should change  and  that  we

should   give  more  emphasis  to  vocational   and

technical   training.  While  we  are   trying   to

industrialise    in   order   to    provide    more

opportunities  of  employment  for  our   secondary

school-leavers,  it is the Barisan  Sosialis  chaps

who  are  fomenting  strikes and agitation  causing

about 1,800 unemployed ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And the confrontation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The confrontation encouraged

by  them  is likely to cause another 8.000 to  lose

their jobs ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for Jurong spoke on academic freedom and university

autonomy.  Much has been said about the  Government

interfering   in   academic  freedom   at   Nanyang

University.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the  Government  are

all  for  genuine academic freedom and the  genuine

pursuit  of  knowledge and truth. But the  kind  of

academic   freedom   the   pro-Communist    Nanyang

University  students are asking for is the  freedom

to recruit, preach and train their cadres for anti-

national activities and to undermine the democratic

system. Where is the academic freedom when  in  May

1961   the   pro-Communist  students   in   Nanyang

University   demanded   the   expulsion   of    six

undergraduates who dared to defy their  activities?

Where is the academic freedom when in 1961 the pro-Communist controlled Dramatic Society wrote to  the

Registrar of Societies to object to the application

for registration of another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



rival   body?  One  would  have  thought  that   as

followers  of  Mao  they would have  welcomed  "100

flowers to bloom" and "100 birds to sing." But  no.

They objected openly to the registration of a rival

student society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The seven birds sing!



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Similarly the pro-Communist

Students'  Union  objected  to  the  formation   of

another  student body in early 1963 by getting  the

Board  of  Student Welfare, which they control,  to

refuse   the  Society  from  functioning   in   the

University.   As  a  result,  this   student   body

subsequently  went  direct  to  the  Registrar   of

Societies for advice and registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1962 both inside and outside this

Assembly,  I quoted a number of articles  appearing

in  the  University Tribune which  were  reproduced

with  superficial changes, articles written by  the

Communists. On 7th September, 1962, the  Government

had  to  ban a booklet entitled A Brief History  of

the  National Movement in Malaya, published by  the

Nanyang  University History and Geography  Society.

This   booklet,  though  purporting   to   give   a

historical  record of the independence movement  in

Malaya, was in effect justifying the armed struggle

of  the  Communist  Party of Malaya.  It  not  only

blatantly  defended  the record  of  the  Communist

Party  of  Malaya,  but it also openly  lauded  the

violence and terrorism of the Communist Party. This

booklet.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  was  one   of   the

publications which the Nanyang University Students'

Union  wanted  Government's permission  to  publish

during the 1962 University Week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the University Week, the House may be

aware  that there is another one being prepared  by

the  Students' Union for March 1964. In fact, today

is  the  last day of the camping-in in the  Nanyang

University  campus by some 300 hard-core  students,

ostensibly  to  prepare for the  coming  University

Week  when  their academic work in  the  University

will be exhibited to the public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is interesting to know some of the

things  that have been going on during the camp-in.

First,  the  camp-in students set up  a  Livelihood

Committee which is similar in pattern to  the  ones

organised by the middle school students in the past

whenever   they   defied   the   Government.   This

Livelihood   Committee  is  to  run,   direct   and

coordinate the activities of the 300 undergraduates

who  stayed  in  the campus during  the  University

vacation. The programme of activities published  in

the  local Chinese Press has very little to do with

the  preparation of University Week. A few examples

of the activities will prove this. Two stories, The

Story  of  an  Old  Lady and The  Struggle  by  the

Riverside which glorified the armed struggle of the

Red  Army  in China, were tape-recorded and  played

through  loudspeakers at 7 p.m. and  7.30  p.m. to

students  in the campus. A Current Affairs  Session

was  conducted in which questions on  the  Alliance

Government's definition of "patriotism", loyalty in

the  current Indonesia confrontation, and  national

service registration were discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A forum was organised on 6th December, 1963, on

"some  problems concerning the current  situation."

Prepared  speeches  were  read,  and  the  aim   of

national  service  registration  was  attacked   as

bringing about hostility among Asians, thus serving

the purpose of the imperialists and suppressing the

patriotic national independence movement  which  is

unfavourable  to Malaysia, and that the  Government

should  be held responsible for the creation  of  a

state of war between Indonesia and Malaysia through

the formation of Malaysia by force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is obvious that these

activities have nothing whatsoever to do  with  the

academic work which they are supposed to exhibit to

the public during University Week early next March.

It is clear that it is not genuine academic freedom

that   the   anti-national  pro-Communist   Nanyang

University  Students' Union are  asking  for.  What

they  are  demanding is the freedom  to  carry  out

indoctrination  in  the  Communist  ideology,   the

freedom to train their cadres for anti-national pro-Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



activities, the freedom to intimidate and

victimise  students who dare show  independence  of

thought  and  action, and the freedom  to  run  the

University as they like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it pains me to relate all these

happenings in the University which is built  up  by

the  support of thousands of ordinary citizens  for

the advancement of Chinese language and culture.  I

am  sure these citizens, like the Government, would

be eager to see that Nanyang University is restored

to  its  real  purpose for which it was established

and that it should become a genuine institution  of

higher  learning and dedicated to  the  pursuit  of

knowledge and truth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the impressive and concrete

achievements   in   education  under   the   P.A.P.

Government  in  the last four years can  stand  the

test of time as much as it can stand any amount  of

destructive and senseless attacks from any quarter.

The  more fantastic and malicious the charges  made

by  the  Barisan Sosialis, the more they reveal  of

the  achievements, progress, growth, expansion, and

development   of   education  in   Singapore.   The

trouncing  defeat the Barisan Sosialis suffered  in

the  last  general election is clear evidence  that

the  people's eyes are as clear as snow. No  amount

of falsehoods and malicious distortion of facts can

blind  the people from seeing the numerous new  and

splendid schools going up everywhere in the last 4½

years,  and many more thousands of school  children

going  to  school every year. Parents in  Singapore

know that their children are enjoying ten years  of

education,  six years of which are free.  They  can

choose whatever medium of instruction they like. If

they are poor, their children can get assistance in

the form of bursaries and free text-books and there

are  equal opportunities for education from primary

level  to  university level if their  children  are

intelligent  and are prepared to study.  They  know

that  nowhere else in South-East Asia can  children

enjoy such full facilities for education, least  of

all  in  Indonesia, the country of adoption of  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think there is time, and

I might as well stop here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As you please, Mr Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has one minute.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Thomson earlier mentioned bursaries and  other

forms of assistance to Malay students, and since he

tried  to  distort the facts, I have got  for  you,

Sir, some very telling facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, of the provision for this subhead for 1963,

only $11,992 has been expended. There was an under-expenditure   of   this   vote   because   of   the

insufficient  number  of  Malay  students  at   the

Singapore  Polytechnic to qualify for such  awards.

Consequently in an attempt to arrive at a realistic Budget,  the  Ministry  of Education  agreed  to  a reduction of the provision from $50,000 to  $20,000

for  1964.  That is the reason. In  regard  to  the

University of Singapore of the provision for  1963,

only  a  sum of $18,084 has been spent. This under-expenditure was recognised, and in order to  arrive

at  a  realistic Budget, the Ministry of  Education

agreed  to  a  reduction of $ 10,000  in  the  1964

Estimates.  However, the number of Singapore  Malay

students  seeking  admission to the  University  of

Singapore and the University of Malaya is  expected

to  increase. In order to meet the expected  demand

adequate  provision  has to be  made.  Lastly,  Mr

Speaker,   in  1963  there  were  15  awards.   The

provision  of $40,000 is for 40 awards. That  means

there is an increase of awards for the coming year.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Thomson

indicate whether he wishes to withdraw the

amendment or take a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young:</b> Take a vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $94,856,000 for Head 40 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining heads of expenditure

in  respect  of  which no amendment stands  on  the
