<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to inform hon. Members that

I communicated to the President the Address agreed

to by resolution of this Parliament on the 15th of

May, 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received a reply from the President

acknowledging  receipt  of  the  kind  message  of

Parliament transmitted to him.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>APPLICATIONS FOR CITIZENSHIP</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked The Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour the  total

number  of app1ications for citizenship  received

(i)  between 1st January and 31st December,  1967;

and (ii) between 1st January and 30th April, 1968;

and what measures have been or are being taken  10

speed up the processing of applications.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker Sir,

the  total  number of applications for citizenship

received  between 1st January and  31st  December,

1967,   was  32,337.  The  total  number  received

between  1st  January and 30th  April,  1968,  was

8,338.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member will appreciate that the grant

of citizenship is a matter of privilege and not of

right.  A person who has the necessary residential

qualifications will not automatically  be  granted

Singapore  citizenship. The hon. Member  is  aware

that  by  the end of 1971 the British  would  have

withdrawn from their bases. A great number of  our

citizens  will lose their jobs. The complexity  of

our  problems  has  been  outlined  by  the  Prime

Minister  and the Finance Minister in  the  recent

series  of Ministerial talks on the Crucial Years.

In  view of the run-down of the British forces and

mounting unemployment, the Government has  decided

not to grant citizenship as freely as in the past.

The number of cases that will be approved will now

depend upon our economic position. A person who is

granted  citizenship  must  be  able  to  make   a

positive  contribution to the economic  well-being

of Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>INVESTIGATIONS INTO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ANONYMOUS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TEACHERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether  investigations  are  conducted

into   allegations  against  teachers  which   are

contained in anonymous letters addressed to him or

to any official in his Ministry or brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



to   his   Ministry's   notice;   and   how   many

investigations  of  this kind were  undertaken  in

1967.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are no hard and fast rules

in  regard to the action to be taken arising  from

anonymous complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the allegations are frivolous and obviously

unfounded, the complaints are ignored. If they are

of a serious nature and appear to be plausible, an

investigation  is  carried  out.   If   they   are

substantiated   as  a  result  of   investigation,

suitable remedial or disciplinary action is taken.

If  the results of the investigation show that the

allegations  are  mischievous  and  unfounded,  an

attempt is made to trace the complainant and bring

him to book. Such attempts have been successful in

a  number  of cases although the complainants  had

written  their letters anonymously and  had  given

fictitious names and addresses. In 1967,  no  less

than 189 investigations were carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what has been the result of these

189  investigations? How many of them can be  said

to be warranted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all these

189  complaints  warranted  investigations.  Those

which appeared to be frivolous and mischievous had

already been ignored.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Is the Minister able to state

whether  this  evidently undesirable  practice  in

which  the  accuser  is  never  present  will   be

discontinued  in  order to prevent  a  decline  in

morale in the teaching profession?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

informed the House just now, 31 of these anonymous

complaints  were substantiated. There are  various

reasons  why  the complainants at  times  are  not

willing  to disclose their identities. So long  as

we  exercise caution, I think it is not  necessary

to   discontinue  this  practice  of   taking   up

anonymous  complaints which appear to  be  serious

and also likely to be true.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Expansion of sub-collection centre at Lim Tua Tow Road Market)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development if he will ascertain from

the Public Utilities Board whether the Board plans

to expand its sub-collection centre at the Lim Tua

Tow Road Market, which is inadequate, or to set up

additional such centres in the surrounding areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public

Utilities Board does not consider that the service

provided by the existing sub-collection centre  at

the Lim Tua Tow Road Market is inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sub-collection centre was set up by the Board

to  serve  24.877 consumers residing  around  that

area.  Payments  are  made at  the  sub-collection

centre  on  eight working days per month following

the  despatch  of the consolidated  bills  to  the

consumers  in  that area. The past experience  has

been  that  out  of  the  eight  days,  the  Board

normally  receives very few payments on the  first

two days of the opening and the last day. Over the

past  four months, only an average of about  4,440

or  19  per  cent  of the consumers  have  availed

themselves  of  this  service.  It  appears   that

neither  extension of the number of  working  days

for  this sub-collection centre or the setting  up

of  additional  centres in the  surrounding  areas

seems necessary at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

will  the  Minister  indicate whether  the  Public

Utilities Board is continuously looking  into  the

question   of   setting  up  more   sub-collection

centres?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Board is

continuously looking into the question of  setting

up  more collection centres to facilitate payments

by  consumers.  This includes the  review  of  the

present  sub-collection facilities with a view  to

improving  service to the public. In  1967,  there

were 11 sub-collection



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



centres  and  five mobile collecting  centres.  In

1968,   these   were  increased  to   12   and   7

respectively.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Will the Minister give the

House the location of these sub-collection centres

and collection points of the mobile sub-collection

centres?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are sub-collection centres at Rayman Market off Balestier

Road,  the  old  Kallang airport,  Seng  Poh  Road

Market,  Joo  Chiat  Road  Cleansing  Depot,   the

Princess   Estate  Market  (Queenstown),   Queen's

Crescent   Market  (Queensway),  the  Commonwealth

Crescent Market, Serangoon District Office,  Bukit

Panjang  District Office, Lim Tua Tow Road Market,

and the junction of Aljunied and Geylang Roads  at

the electric showroom there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mobile collection centres stop for

collection  at  the junction of  Jalan  Eunos  and

Jalan  Kuda,  at the junction of Cheong  Chin  Nam

Road and Chun Tin Road, the Sembawang Post Office,

the  Bedok  Post Office and the Housing Estate  at

Pesiaran Keliling. Three more were added in 1968 - the  Selegie House Car Park, the junction of Pasir

Panjang  Road and South Buona Vista Road  and  the

junction of Thong Aik and Sembawang Roads.

<div align="center"><b>PERMIT FEES FOR TEMPORARY STRUCTURES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development whether he will consider

reducing  the Temporary Permit fees for  temporary

structures  like chicken-coops and pig-sties  from

the present $12 per annum to $2 per annum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of

National    Development    has    given    careful

consideration  to this matter and I have  recently

directed  that,  instead of an annual  payment  of

$12, there should be just one payment of $12 for a

temporary permit fee. This decision will come into

force by way of a Gazette Notification.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Do the temporary permit fees

<br><br>2.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is an omnibus Bill which seeks to

rectify   the   restrictive  nature  of   existing

legislation  which limits the types of investments

that may be made from funds of the Government. The

existing  legislation is over-restrictive  on  the

types of investments that may be made so that  the

bulk  of  our funds have to be invested in trustee

securities, and these are mainly fixed price gilt-edged securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current legislation we are not in a

position  to  provide any long-term hedge  against

endemic  inflation in countries where these  funds

are   held.   Under   the   proposed   amendments,

investments  may be made in any  form  as  may  be

approved by the President. This will allow greater

flexibility in our investment policy, as  it  will

be possible to attract investments which would not

fall  strictly within the category of fixed  price

gilt-edged   securities  to   be   held   by   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earlier outmoded restrictions on the

investment of Government funds must be removed  if

Government  is  to  follow a  realistic  and  more

effective investment policy with surplus funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>EXTERNAL LOANS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Bill seeks to empower the

Singapore  Government to float  loans  in  markets

outside  Singapore. Such loans  could  be  floated

either for the purposes of the Development Fund or

for  amortisation  of another external  loan.  The

maximum amount or amounts of the loan that may  be

floated will be approved by the President  on  the

recommendation of the Minister. This  is  provided

under clause 2 (3) of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For raising these external loans, the Minister

is  empowered under clause 4 (1) of  the  Bill  to

create and issue such securities as he thinks fit.

The Minister may also determine under clause 4 (2)

the   terms   and  conditions  as  to   repayment,

redemption and other matters, including  provision

for a sinking fund to which the securities will be

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to provide Government with

the  enabling powers to borrow in external markets

should the need arise. We have up till now floated

loans   in   the  domestic  market  to  meet   our

development   expenditure.  With  the  accelerated

British   military  withdrawal,  our   development

expenditure will need to be increased in the years

ahead.  This necessitates increased borrowing  and

it  is clearly in our interest to widen the market

to  include  external ones. Having  increased  our

range  of options, it is then up to the Government

to  take  advantage  of  money  market  conditions

internally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



or  externally, or both, in the best interests  of

the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  sure that I am voicing the sentiments of  this

House  when  I  say  that Singapore,  unlike  some

emerging countries, does not require foreign loans

to  live. Singapore only requires foreign loans to

expand  its  economy  more rapidly.  The  rate  of

Singapore's economic expansion has been such  that

it  has  been equalled only by a few countries  in

Asia, and even in the world. But circumstances are

such  that,  especially in  the  next  few  years,

Singapore  needs to expand much more rapidly,  and

because  of  this need I welcome this  Bill  which

will enable us to raise external loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I welcome the intention of this Bill, I

feel  that  it  is my duty to raise objections  to

some  of the provisions in the Bill. If this  Bill

is  passed  into law as it stands, a blank  cheque

Bill,  as it were, would be handed to the  Finance

Minister.  I  am sure no one in this House  doubts

that with the present Finance Minister at the helm

of  our economic ship, we will not run the risk of

foundering.  Everyone in this House  is  confident

that  he, armed with the wide powers conferred  by

this  Bill,  will not seek the easy way  out  when

confronted by a shortage of cash. I am  also  sure

that  he will do his best to mobilise all domestic

resources before attempting to borrow from abroad.

But,  we are not legislating for one man. What  we

are  doing  today  is  to  consider  a  piece   of

legislation  which will fit in with our  structure

and system of government for some time to come. As

the  Bill  stands, the Finance Minister can  raise

any  amount of money he likes from abroad and  pay

any rate of interest he likes on those loans. As I

have  said before, I am confident that the present

Finance Minister will neither be foolish nor  will

he   mortgage   our   future  unnecessarily.   But

circumstances may change and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



occupiers  of posts may change. Are we  then,  and

then  only, to amend a piece of legislation  which

we pass now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that there should be some safeguard

that  this  House must retain for itself.  I  also

feel  that  this  House must set a  limit  to  the

amount the Minister may borrow, and if he requires

more  funds, he should seek authority  again  from

this House. Similarly, I feel that this House must

set  a  limit  on  the rate at which  our  Finance

Minister can borrow. If he feels that he must  pay

higher   rates,  he  should  seek   the   specific

authority of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for us, our international credit

rating  is high and we do not have to pay interest

rates  as  charged  by  the Market  Street  money-lenders  for any external loans we seek to  raise.

But  we  still  need  to  determine  the  rate  of

interest which this House must set as the limit on

which  the Finance Minister can borrow.  I  should

like  him  to advise this House on the appropriate

figure.  Similarly, I should like  him  to  advise

this House on the limit he should be authorised to

raise from external loans.



<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the hon. Member

really   raises  issues  which  are   largely   of

theoretical and academic interest. First  of  all,

he  says  that the Finance Minister can raise  any

amount  of money in the overseas money markets.  I

think  he  is aware of the fact that most  of  the

developing  countries are not able  to  raise  any

loans  in  these  overseas money  markets  because

nobody  will lend them any money. It is  true,  of

course, that our credit rating is much better than

that  of  the general run of developing countries,

and   one  hopes  that  this  credit  rating  will

continue to be good. I do not think there  is  any

advantage in raising any limit on loans  that  may

be  raised  in  overseas markets, for  the  simple

reason  that I do not expect these loans would  be

substantial and, in any event, any legislation  on

the limits of quantum of loans that may be floated

does not really confer on Parliament



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



any real control over the financial activities  of

the  Government. When the limit is  reached,  then

the  Finance Minister will come to Parliament  and

ask for it to be raised. In fact, in regard to the

limit  on  Treasury Bills which has  been  set  by

Parliament  at  $500  million,  I  shall  soon  be

introducing a Bill to raise this limit  to  $1,000

million because we are fast approaching the  limit

of $500 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards interest rates, here again this is

determined by the rates of interest prevailing  in

money  markets and by the credit rating which  the

borrower  enjoys in the market. Rates of  interest

are at the moment pretty horrendous. For instance,

if  we are to borrow money on the New York market,

say, a short-term loan of about five or six years,

it  is  unlikely that we can borrow at an interest

rate  of  less  than  eight  per  cent  per  year.

Interest  rates in continental money  markets  are

slightly  lower, but not all that much  lower.  In

Frankfurt,  we may be able to borrow at  about  6¾ per  cent, and in Switzerland possibly at  6¼  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these loans are not for the asking, because

very  prolonged and delicate negotiations have  to

be  entered  into between the Government  and  the

lender  or a consortium of lenders. What I  intend

to  do  really  is  to raise a small  loan  at  an

opportune time either in America or in Europe, not

so much to use the money - because when you borrow

at these rates of interest, it is going to be very

difficult to justify expenditure on development on

infrastructure at 7½ per cent, 8 per cent or  even

6¾  per  cent - but to introduce ourselves to  the

financial  community of the  world.  I  have  been

advised  by  various people that  it  is  best  to

borrow money when you do not need it, because when

you  really  need  the money desperately  you  are

unlikely  to  get it. At this time,  when  we  are

reasonably flush, it may be a good thing to  raise

the money either in New York, Frankfurt or Geneva,

and  to  re-invest the money there possibly  at  a

higher rate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



of interest. Actually, this is our plan and we are

waiting  for the right opportunity to put it  into

operation.

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Development Loan

Act,  1967, to allow the Government to raise loans

in  the  domestic  market by the issue  of  bearer

bonds. The bonds will be issued in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



such  denominations and under such  conditions  as

may be decided by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the Government has been issuing only

registered  stock  which requires  registering  on

purchase  and whenever the ownership of the  stock

is  changed. Such stocks, therefore, appeal  to  a

limited  market and we have found  that  our  past

issues have been mainly subscribed by institutions

who hold such stocks till maturity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the attractiveness of our loan

issues,  the  Government proposes to issue  bearer

bonds  as well. These bonds are payable to  bearer

and  transferable by delivery without  endorsement

or  registration.  The names of stockholders  will

not  appear on the stock certificate, neither will

a  register  of  stockholders  be  kept,  so  that

anonymity   of  subscribers  will  be   preserved.

Interest  coupons will be attached to  the  bonds,

and  on  each  date  when interest  is  due,  such

coupons may be cashed at the nearest bank or  with

the Registrar of Loans. It will be clear from this

brief  description  that the  administrative  work

involved will be reduced considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Development Loan Act,

which  require sinking funds to be established  to

meet  redemption of a loan floated,  will  however

continue  to  apply to bearer bonds  issued  under

this  Act.  So, once a loan is floated,  money  to

meet  its  redemption is automatically  set  aside

each  year.  Such bearer bonds, when issued,  will

become  negotiable instruments and  we  hope  this

will encourage greater public participation in the

mobilisation of capital for development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to establish the Jurong Town

Corporation which will take over from the Economic

Development     Board     all     the     latter's

responsibilities  in regard to  the  provision  of

facilities   for  the  management  of   industrial

estates, sites and flatted factories in Singapore.

The   Corporation   will,  in  addition,   provide

amenities for the advancement of the well-being of

the  people living in such estates and sites. Upon

its  establishment, the staff  of  the  Industrial

Facilities   Division,   the   Civil   Engineering

Division  and  other  relevant  Divisions  of  the

Economic Development Board will be transferred  to

the  Corporation. In taking over the  property  of

the   E.D.B.,   the  Corporation  will   also   be

responsible for its liabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board was formed in

1961 as the principal agency of the Government  in

promoting  industrial growth. It was a  novel  and

pioneering venture. We decided at that time -  and

events showed that the decision was a right one  - that the E.D.B, should undertake a large number of

functions   related  to  its  work  of  industrial

promotion. One such function was the provision  of

industrial  sites equipped with all the facilities

needed  by  modern  industry  -  roads,  railways,

wharves, industrial water, electricity, telephones

and  so on. One advantage of concentrating diverse

functions  in ore organisation is the  convenience

this offers to the potential investor. He need see

only  one  agency  to settle  a  large  number  of

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid expansion of the Economic Development

Board and the experience its staff has gained over

the  years make necessary a review of this  policy

of  concentration  as against  the  dispersion  of

specialist functions into specialist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



agencies.  The  Government  considers  that   the

present  time is appropriate to make a  change  in

the structure of industrial promotion agencies and

the  advantages of creating a separate  agency  to

look   after   industrial  estates  outweigh   the

advantages  of  retaining the  present  system  of

concentration of functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrial estates, sites arid flatted

factories to be transferred from the E.D.B, to the

Jurong Town Corporation will include those in  the

Jurong  Industrial Estate, Tanglin Halt,  Redhill,

Tiong  Bahru,  Kallang  Basin,  Kallang  Park  and

Kranji.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that the finance of the

Corporation  will  be on a sound  basis,  but  any

financial    shortfall,    after    taking    into

consideration  its revenue from  rentals,  leases,

and so on, will be made up by Government by way of

grants   and   loans.  Subject   to   Government's

approval,  the Corporation may also  borrow  money

from the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With adequate resources, the Corporation can

provide  for amenities for the well-being  of  the

people   working   and  living  in   the   various

industrial  estates and sites to the extent  which

was not possible with the E.D.B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the staff are concerned, they will be

employed by the Corporation on the same terms  and

conditions  as they have enjoyed with the  E.D.B.,

and  service with the E.D.B, will be deemed to  be

service  with the Jurong Town Corporation for  the

purpose  of  determining  seniority  and  of   any

pension or provident fund scheme to be established

by the Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation will consist of a Chairman, a

Deputy  Chairman and 15 other members all of  whom

will  be  appointed by the Finance  Minister.  The

object of having a large number of members  is  to

enable  more  participation  by  members  of   the

public, especially those who are actively involved

in the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate

and other industrial sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to establish the Jurong Town

Corporation as soon as possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



to  enable  a smooth take-over from the E.D.B.  In

welcoming  this  new institution,  we  should  not

forget  the past contribution of the E.D.B, which

has  so  ably carried out its complex  tasks  with

much drive and imagination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill which

is far-sighted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said just now that the main

purpose  of this Bill is to make plans to  provide

better facilities for Jurong Town so that it  will

not  only  be a new and modern town,  but  also  a

place where thousands of people can work and live.

Since  the  P.A.P, came to power and  started  its

industrialisation plan in 1960, Jurong has  become

a  large  industrial  town. I understand  that  it

covers  about 18,000 acres and the Government  has

done  a lot by putting all this acreage to various

uses.  For  instance, about 1,700  acres  are  for

heavy  industries and about 7,000  acres  are  for

light  industries. The Government has  made  plans

for  residential  and commercial areas,  community

services, facilities and amenities such as  public

telephones,  etc.  From this,  we  know  that  the

Government does not intend to make Jurong only  an

industrial  town but also a place where  thousands

of people can make a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the rapid development of Jurong,

various problems have arisen and have to be looked

after, such as education, transport, etc, for  the

people  living  there. It would not be  convenient

for  the  Economic Development Board to  do  these

things by itself. That is why there is need  today

for a Jurong Town Corporation which will take over

the  functions  of the E.D.B, in  respect  of  the

Jurong industrial site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our achievements in the Jurong industrial

site  are  well known throughout the  world.  Good

progress  has been made all round. In addition  to

industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



development,  we  have also set  up  a  Fisheries

Wharf   in   Jurong  which  will  facilitate   the

distribution of fish to our markets.  The  harbour

is   good  and  deep  with  facilities  for  ship-repairing  and ship-building in docks.  This  Bill

also provides for various kinds of development  in

Jurong Town. There is a, proposal to form a  Board

comprising a number of members who will  plan  the

development of Jurong Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this Bill becomes law, I am sure that

Jurong   will   be  a  prosperous  and   efficient

industrial area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give my support to this Bill.



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish to give my whole-hearted support  to

the proposal by the Minister for Finance to create

and  establish  the Jurong Town  Corporation,  the

objectives  of which are to develop an  industrial

estate and to provide the amenities of life to the

working people and residents of the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move to form the Jurong Town. Corporation is

indeed a bold and imaginative move to correct  the

imbalance  between the Jurong area and, the  other

parts of developed Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, when we speak of Jurong Town,

we  do  so  with  pride because it  manifests  the

confidence   of   the  world  in   Singapore,   in

particular in the industry of the working  people.

In  this connection, I am sure there will  be  the

right  incentives like good and efficient  utility

services  provided not only to the industries  but

also to the residents. Therefore, in order to make

the  Jurong  complex more attractive to  investors

and workers, things in Jurong will have to improve

and the co-operation of not only the employers but

of the workers too is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer to clause 5 (1) (c) of

the Bill and I hope the Minister will also appoint

trade  union representatives to be members of  the

Corporation.  It will be appropriate  for  him  to

appoint representatives of the National Trades



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



Union   Congress  or  of  the  Pioneer  Industries

Employees' Union to this Corporation so  that  the

wishes  and  desires  of the workers  working  and

living in that area can be heard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party Government has given

status and recognition to the labour movement,  so

much so that trade union representatives are found

on   many   statutory  bodies,  and  I  hope   the

Government   will  continue   to   do   so,   more

particularly  at  this moment as the  workers  are

beginning  to  question  the  intentions  of   the

Government, which I do not doubt are good.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Jurong

Town should be a place of joy in which to work and

live. But it is sad to say that although it  is  a

thriving  industrial estate, it is quite a  desert

for  social  life.  I  say  this  with  experience

because  I  live not far off -in fact,  a  stone's

throw - from the Jurong complex. Every morning for

about  l« or 2 hours, you can see streams of cars,

motor-cycles  and scooters going in one  direction

and  in the evening for about 2 hours, they go the

other way. Throughout the morning and even in  the

night,  Jurong is quite a dead town. Life is  dull

and   gloomy,   and  except  for  the   occasional

Christmas  or  New  Year parties  thrown  by  some

Father Christmas of an employer, Jurong is quite a

dead  town. From my experience, most of the people

after work go to the city to enjoy themselves  and

it  is very difficult sometimes to find friends at

home  in Jurong, because most of them live in  the

city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said just now that Jurong should be a

pleasant  place in which to work, and I hope  that

the  Corporation  to be set up will  endeavour  to

improve  things in the Jurong complex and  provide

all   the  modem  amenities  to  the  workers  and

residents. Things in Jurong are not so good,  even

the  daily food. This is to be wondered  at,  that

although Jurong is a landing point for the fishing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



fleet, the fish one gets in Jurong is not so fresh

as  one  gets in, say, the Kandang Kerbau  Market.

This  is  a complaint of the workers, that  Jurong

has  not  been taken care of in the past. I  speak

not  only from experience but also as a result  of

the  complaints made by workers working in Jurong,

that  Jurong is not a very pleasant place in which

to work, because not only are the wages there low,

but there are also no social amenities at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Bill intends to improve things

in Jurong, I give it my whole-hearted support.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I thank the Member for

Sembawang  for his very kind words on the  efforts

of the Economic Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Kallang, he has made a

number  of constructive suggestions and criticisms

and  I  would like to comment on some of them.  He

has  asked  for  an  assurance  that  trade  union

representatives should be appointed to  the  Board

of  the Jurong Town Corporation. Actually it is my

intention to appoint equal numbers of trade  union

representatives  and employer representatives.  In

fact,   we  have  written  to  the  N.T.U.C. for

nominations,  but so far we have not received  any

reply.  So  if  the  hon. Member  can  exert  some

pressure  on  his  colleagues in the  N.T.U.C.,  I

would be most grateful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the observation that there is an immense

amount  of commuting between Jurong and the  city.

He  said  that  the reason for this was  that  the

amenities  in Jurong were not as good  as  in  the

city. Actually the vast amount of commuting is not

because  amenities are inadequate.  Amenities  are

inadequate  because  there  is  this   amount   of

commuting.  In  other  words,  so  long  as  small

numbers  of workers live in Jurong, you  will  not

get  the amenities coming up. For instance,  there

must   be  a  certain  minimum  population  before

anybody  thinks it worth while to set up,  say,  a

cinema. This problem has been exercising our minds

for some time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wonder why workers prefer to spend nearly one

and  a  half  hours to two hours a day  riding  on

buses  or  lorries or private taxis,  or  whatever

method  of  transport it is they  use,  to  go  to

Jurong  and  come back to work. We  did  a  social

survey  of this problem some years ago.  We  found

that  the  vast  majority of workers  employed  in

Jurong  are people getting their first jobs.  They

are  mostly youngsters living with their  parents.

They  find it is more economical to live off their

parents than to move on to Jurong and set up their

own  homes.  But no doubt as these  young  workers

advance  in age and mature, they will get  married

and  then they will want to find their own  homes.

When  this  happens, we shall find more  and  more

workers living in the flats that we have built  in

Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards complaints of fish and vegetables not

being  fresh,  I do not know to what extent  these

complaints  are justified. No doubt there  may  be

some justification.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> I live there. I know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon. Yes, but I

find   it   difficult  to  believe  that   it   is

consistently  worse than in other places.  It  may

not  be  the  freshest you can  get  in  Singapore

simply because the demand is rather small compared

with,  say,  the  bigger  markets  in  town  where

stallholders  will find it worth  while  to  bring

first quality goods because people are prepared to

pay good prices for them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> These amenities will no doubt

develop in course of time. In fact, it will be one

of  the principal objectives of the Corporation to

improve social amenities in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Constitution (Amendment)

Bill  now  before  the House  seeks  to  introduce

certain changes in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these is the provision of a new

Article 1A empowering this House to elect a  Vice-President of the Republic of Singapore.  The  need

for  the  creation of a Vice-Presidency  has  been

felt  for  some  time now - in  fact,  ever  since

Singapore    became   an   independent   Republic.

Consequential   upon   Singapore    becoming    an

independent   Republic,  the  duties   that   have

devolved upon the President as Head of State  have

increased,  as  hon. Members know full  well.  The

occasions  which  have  necessitated  the   actual

participation of the President himself  in  purely

ceremonial    functions   have   also   increased.

Furthermore,  each time the President  leaves  the

Republic,  an  Acting Head  of  State  has  to  he

appointed  in  order to carry on his  duties.  The

Government   has  for  some  time  in   the   past

considered   this  matter  and  has  reached   the

conclusion  that it would be advantageous  that  a

Vice-President  be appointed who  could  not  only

assist the President but also act as Head of State

during his absence. As with the Head of State,  so

also  in regard to the Vice-President, the  proper

method  of  appointment should be by  election  in

this Chamber, so that Parliament may exercise  its

choice in regard to whoever may be so appointed to

perform the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



functions of the President of the Republic.  Hence

this  new  Article which will enable the House  to

elect such a person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Vice-President, as hon.

Members  will see in the Bill, must first  possess

certain qualifications in order to be eligible for

election.  In this regard, his qualifications  are

to  be similar to those conditions set out in  the

Constitution  regarding the office  of  President.

The   term   of  office  for  the  Vice-President,

however,  would  only be for a  maximum  of  three

years.  He may, of course, as in the case  of  the

President,  resign  his  office  and  there  is  a

further  provision in the Bill for the removal  of

the  Vice-President from office by Parliament. The

Vice-President  is  also  enabled  by   this   new

amendment in the Constitution to exercise all such

duties and functions as may be delegated to him by

the  President, who, of course, would be  required

to  act  in  accordance with  the  wishes  of  the

Government  of  the day. The Vice-President  would

further  assist the President in the  exercise  of

such  duties  and functions as any  constitutional

Head  of  State  in  a modern democracy  would  be

required to perform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important provision which I would like to

emphasise is that this Bill would also enable  the

Cabinet  to empower the Vice-President to exercise

all   the  functions  of  the  President,  as   an

alternative  to  appointing a person  to  exercise

such  functions of the President and thus  act  as

Head of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that hon. Members will agree with me when

I say that the need for the creation of the office

of  Vice-President is obvious enough, if  only  to

relieve  the  President of some  of  his  manifold

duties.  The Vice-President, under the  provisions

of  the  Constitution,  need  not  necessarily  be

appointed   full-time,  although   there   is   no

prohibition  for  a  full-time appointment  to  be

made.  The  Government,  however,  envisages   the

situation   where   whoever  is  appointed   Vice-President  should  also be  allowed  to  carry  on

whatever functions or work he may have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



been performing before his appointment as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment to the Constitution, purely a

financial  one, seeks to amend Article 86  of  the

Constitution which, as it now stands, requires the

Government   to   introduce   a   Supply   or    a

Supplementary  Supply  Bill in  Parliament  before

appropriating  funds from the  Consolidated  Fund,

save  in regard to such sums as are by law already

charged  to  the  Consolidated Fund.  Furthermore,

under   the   present  constitutional   provisions

relating  to  financial  expenditure,  as  it  now

stands, the Minister for Finance would be required

to authorise, subject to the prior approval of the

Cabinet, expenditure from the Consolidated Fund or

other   Government  funds  as  he   may   consider

essential  for  the  continuance  of  the   public

services.  There is also a further  limitation  on

the  expenditure so authorised for any service  to

the effect that the expenditure so authorised must

not  exceed  one-quarter of the amount  voted  for

that particular service in the Supply law for  the

preceding year. Hon. Members will agree that  such

restrictions  may at times prove  too  restrictive

and   indeed  work  to  the  disadvantage  of  the

Government  of  the day in certain  circumstances,

as, for example, where an unusual emergency arises

which  necessitates spending of  an  exceptionally

large amount of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order therefore to remove these fetters, the

Government now seeks the approval of the House  to

this  proposed amendment to Article  86.  I  would

like  to point out that the proposed amendment  is

not  an  exceptional provision as it  follows  the

financial  practice in many countries, the  United

Kingdom and India amongst them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is purely to enable the Government a

freer   hand   in   authorising   expenditure    - expenditure  that can be regarded as required  for

unusual circumstances and to meet exigencies  that

we  may  be  faced with during the  crucial  years

ahead  of  us  and which may be in excess  of  the

annual  Supply  law  - that it  has  been  thought

necessary  to  introduce  this  amendment.   These

enlarged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



powers  would only be used on the occasions  which

require  the  appropriation of  amounts  over  and

above  normal  expenditure that are  sometimes  of

such magnitude or of such indefinite character  as

would be extremely complex and therefore difficult

to  explain without technical knowledge and  which

may  at  any rate prove undesirable in the  public

interest  to disclose in detail. Nevertheless,  as

it is and has always been the law that expenditure

should  be  approved by Parliament, the  amendment

would  still require the Government of the day  to

authorise  such expenditure. While clause  (6)  of

Article  86  of  the  Constitution  removes   such

fetters   as  may  appear  superfluous   in   such

exigencies  as I have referred to, the  canons  of

prudence  and  careful  husbandry  will   not   be

abandoned as the normal procedures will still have

to be observed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, clause 4 of this Bill seeks to amend

the definition of the term "office of profit",  as

defined  in  Article 91 (1) of  the  Constitution.

This   article  has  again  been   found   to   be

restrictive  to such an extent as to prohibit  one

who  is  employed in the public service full-time,

from  holding  appointment at any of the  Missions

Singapore maintains in countries abroad. It is  to

enable  persons  who would now by reason  of  this

technical  definition "office  of  profit"  to  be

appointed   to  public  offices  abroad   at   the

country's  various  Missions,  that  it  has  been

decided  to  bring  about  this  change  with  the

introduction  of  this amendment  to  Article  91.

Persons who would otherwise be debarred from  such

appointments abroad would thus be enabled to serve

the public and the nation both within the Republic

and  elsewhere.  Article 91 of  the  Constitution,

when  drafted, did not have in mind the status  of

Singapore as an independent nation, but rather  as

a   component  State  within  the  Federation   of

Malaysia. One can really say, therefore, that  the

present amendment to Article 91 is necessary as  a

natural consequence of Singapore having become  an

independent Republic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Second

Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I  rise  in  support  of  the  Constitution

(Amendment)  Bill and I would like to  say  a  few

words  on  the  new Article IA.  Singapore  is  an

independent country and, as such, has  acquired  a

lot   of   pomp  and  ceremony.  And  with   this,

naturally,  a  lot of protocol. In  the  past  two

years or more, it has become apparent to even  the

least alert of our citizens that the duties of our

President  have  been  more  than  one   man   can

shoulder,  no matter how fit he may  be.  A  Vice-President  will  therefore be a useful  person  to

have  to  share or undertake some or  all  of  the

presidential  duties. I am glad to hear  from  the

Minister   that  the  proposed  office  of   Vice-President  will  not necessarily  be  a  full-time

appointment. This provision will therefore allow a

wider  choice  of  a suitable person.  However,  I

cannot  see  how  the  Cabinet  can  come  to  the

conclusion that the appointment should  be  for  a

maximum period of three years. I think three years

is  rather  too short a time. It is so short  that

before the new Vice-President can get to know  his

job  and its finer points, he will relinquish  his

job  and a new person could be appointed.. I  feel

that  a  five-year term will be a more  reasonable

appointment.



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I fully support the Constitution (Amendment)

Bill.  Its  main purpose is to make provision  for

Parliament to elect a Vice-President in  order  to

assist  the President in such of his functions  as

the  President may care to hand over to him.  Also

when the President is abroad or is absent for  any

other reason, he may act as President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Head of State of a newly emergent

country,  the  President has a lot of  duties  and

functions to carry out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



Our  present President, Inche Yusof bin Ishak, has

been  the  Head of State since 1960.  After  1965,

when Singapore became independent, he has been the

President of our Republic. We know that he  seldom

went abroad, but recently he went to Australia for

a  holiday. So in the absence of a Vice-President,

we  requested the Speaker of the House to  be  the

Acting President. With the passage of the Bill, we

will  be in a better position and we will find  it

more convenient to have a Vice-President to act as

President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a few points to raise. Firstly,

when  will a Vice-President be elected? The second

point  is similar to what the Member for Joo  Chat

has raised. Why should we limit his term of office

to  three years? As the President's term of office

is   for  four  years,  I  feel  that  the   Vice-President's term of office should also be for four

years.  Otherwise we will have to  elect  again  a

Vice-President  while the President  is  still  in

office.  So  I would like the Minister to  explain

why there should be the stipulation of three years

of office for the Vice-President.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I would like

to  thank the Member for Joo Chiat and the  Member

for  Sembawang for their support. They have  asked

one  question,  "Why  three years  for  the  Vice-President  and four years for the President?"  Why

not?  It  does not follow that because you appoint

the  President for four years you must  appoint  a

Vice-President for four years. After all, the Vice-President is second to the President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants to know when the

Vice-President will be appointed. All  I  can  say

here is, "Very soon." But assuming we appoint  the

Vice-President tomorrow, surely we cannot  appoint

him for four years. I think that should answer the

two  Members'  question as to how long  the  Vice-President  should hold office. Our  President  was

appointed in December



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



last for a period of four years. A few months have

passed.   We   cannot  appoint  a   Vice-President

starting  from  tomorrow for another  four  years.

Hence  three  years, which we think  should  be  a

suitable period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. --[Mr Barker].

<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Procedure Act, as it now stands,

does  not enable Parliament to approve expenditure

for  extraordinary  or  unspecified  purposes.  In

Britain  and  a  number of Commonwealth  countries

including India, Pakistan and Malaysia,  there  is

provision for the approval of expenditure which on

account  of the magnitude or indefinite  character

of  the  service cannot be stated with the details

given, as in ordinary estimates of expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, such needs for

expenditure  are brought before Parliament  by  an

application based on the estimate of the total sum

required for a vote of credit. The form of a  vote

of  credit  is  a demand for a lump sum  with  the

objects  stated  in  very  general  terms.  It  is

accounted for by the Treasury which issues  monies

to   the  departments  in  accordance  with  their

requirements.  Recourse to these procedures  takes

place only in exceptional times.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, no one can say that they will

never be necessary, and it is prudent that we make

provision   for   all   eventualities   as   other

Commonwealth countries have done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necessary amendments to the Constitution

have   been   brought  to  the  House  under   the

Constitution   (Amendment)  Bill.   The   proposed

amendment  to  the  Financial  Procedure  Act   is

complementary   to   the   amendments    to    the

Constitution  to  enable  Parliament  to   approve

expenditure   for  extraordinary  or   unspecified

purposes.
