<div align="center"><b>ROAD TRAFFIC (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Road Traffic Act empowers a Police

officer to arrest without warrant and prosecute any

person found driving or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



attempting to drive, or in charge of a motor  vehicle,

under  the  influence of alcohol or drug  to  such  an

extent as to be incapable of having proper control  of

the  vehicle. However, the existing Road  Traffic  Act

does  not require the defendant to submit to a medical

examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case, a Subordinate Court refused to

admit  in  evidence  the  statement  of  a  Government

medical  officer that the driver of a vehicle was,  at

the time he was brought to the General Hospital, drunk

and incapable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



of  having  proper control of the vehicle because  the

defendant's  consent was not obtained  before  he  was

examined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend the Road Traffic

Act  by  making it obligatory for any person, arrested

under the provisions of the Act mentioned earlier,  to

provide a specimen of his blood or urine, or both, for

a  laboratory test if required to do so  by  a  Police

officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause also seeks to introduce a presumption

that  a  person  with  a  blood alcohol  concentration

exceeding 1 10 mg/100 ml is incapable of having proper

control  of  a  motor vehicle. The proposed  amendment

serves  as  a  guide  to Police officers  and  medical

practitioners as well as evidence upon which the court

can  convict any person who is arrested under  section

29  or  30 of the Act. The concentration level of  110

mg/100  ml is within the range of the legal limits  of

blood  alcohol concentration adopted by the courts  in

other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we introduce this particular

amendment because in -our experience it has been  very

difficult  to  certify whether  or  not  a  person  is

intoxicated.  Much depends on the individual  judgment

of  the medical practitioner. The physical state of  a

patient who is involved in a road traffic accident and

who has been admitted to a hospital has been variously

described  in  terms  of whether he  is  conscious  or

unconscious,  rational or irrational,  or  whether  he

smells  of  alcohol,  or  whether  he  is,  sometimes,

allegedly claimed to be intoxicated. The fact that  we

now have a legal provision for a blood level of 110 mg

is  to me a necessity. This particular amendment makes

it  compulsory that all these people be subject  to  a

blood test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if he had taken

into consideration the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



different  people have different tolerance to  alcohol

and  if, in fact, this blood level of 110 mg is a fair

level  to  be  placed. Secondly, could he inform  this

House as to the specific blood levels imposed by other

countries,  and  how  do  we compare  to  these  other

levels. I understand that in the United Kingdom it  is

in  the  region of 80 mg. Perhaps he could  inform  us

more  about  this provision in the other countries  of

Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also inform this House as to the

number  of  persons in the past year or two  who  were

involved  in road traffic accidents and were found  to

be intoxicated at the time of the accident?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, could the Minister explain in layman's

terms  what this blood level of 110 mg means. Does  it

mean consuming two bottles of beer or three bottles of

stout  or four pegs of whisky? This seems to us to  be

more meaningful than a blood level of 110 mg.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  just ask the Minister whether  in  the

implementation  of  this  law  there  would  arise   a

situation where a blood test is required but it is not

available  under  the circumstances,  and  in  such  a

situation should the person concerned be unable at the

particular  time to produce the required urine, would

that   constitute  a  justifiable  reason  under   the

circumstances?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate

the  Member  for Kim Seng's support of  the  Bill.  He

raised  a number of questions. Perhaps I should  first

answer  the  last point about the blood level  of  110

mg/100 ml in layman's terms. Generally speaking, if  a

person has consumed three full pegs of hard liquor  or

three  large  bottles of beer within a  space  of  one

hour, his blood alcohol concentration would be in  the

region  of  110 mg of alcohol in 100 ml  of  blood.  A

normal   whisky/water   or   brandy/dry   served    in

restaurants  or  bars contains  half  a  peg  of  hard

liquor. That would give some idea of the blood alcohol

concentration in layman's terms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Senior Forensic Pathologist has confirmed that a

person  with  such a concentration of alcohol  in  his

body  is  not in a fit state to drive a motor vehicle,

and his opinion has been supported by many experiments

carried  out in other countries throughout the  world.

In  ordinary  circumstances, a seasoned drinker,  even

though  he may be an experienced driver, will  not  be

able to have proper control of his vehicle with such a

level of blood alcohol concentration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the different legal limits adopted by

other   countries  on  blood  alcohol   concentration,

Members  would be interested to know that this  ranges

from  a  very  low  30  mg/100  ml  in  Bulgaria   and

Czechoslovakia 50 mg/i 00 ml in Norway and Sweden;  80

mg/100  ml in the United Kingdom and France; and  80-1

50  mg/100  ml  in the United States of  America.  Our

limit  of  110 mg/i 00 ml is, therefore, a compromised

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the number of traffic accidents involving drunken

driving in the past, unfortunately, I do not have  the

full  details. I only have the figures  for  1974  and

1975. In 1974, the number of cases of drunken driving

brought  to  court  was  103.  In  1975, the   number

increased  to  160. This represents more  than  a  50%

increase over the 1974 figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens raised the question

regarding  a  defendant  who  could  not  produce  the

required  urine  at  the time of examination.  I  will

leave  it  to  the court to decide and the  Member  to

defend the defendant ably at the trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Teng Cheong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>SUBORDINATE COURTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to increase the civil jurisdiction of -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the District Court from $5,000 to $10,000, and

the Magistrates Court from

$1,000  to  $2,000 on actions founded on  contract  or

tort; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the District Court in relation to any action for

the recovery of immovable property the annual value of

which  does not exceed $9,600 a year or $800 a  month,

as  against the present annual value of $4,800 a  year

and $400 a month respectively. The amendments proposed

above will enable many of the cases presently with the

High  Court  to  be  transferred  to  the  Subordinate

Courts, and be dealt with more expeditiously, with the

additional  staff  (one  District  Judge   and   three

Magistrates)   being  provided  for  the   Subordinate

Courts,  in  the  coming fiscal year. This  will  thus

effectively  off-load  some  of  the  work  that   has

previously been done in the High Court. Besides, costs

will  be much less in the Subordinate Courts, and  the

procedure much simplified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments made to sections 28 and 29 of the

Subordinate   Courts   Act  seek   to   increase   the

jurisdiction of the District Courts to enable them  to

grant  probate or letters of administration in respect

of  estates which do not exceed $50,000 in value. This

is in line with the exemption from estate duty granted

by the Minister for Finance in April 1974 on the first

$50,000 of the total value of any property left  by  a

deceased person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is a corollary to the Subordinate

Courts  (Amendment) Bill, 1976, which  has  just  been

read  for a Third time. The Probate and Administration

(Amendment) Bill seeks to increase the jurisdiction of

the  District Court to enable it to grant probate  and

letters of administration in respect of estates  which

do  not  exceed $50,000 in value. This provision  will

again  off-load some of the work handled by  the  High

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to increase the power of the

Official  Assignee to administer, without  letters  of

administration, the estates of persons who  have  died

leaving property in Singapore, the value of which does

not  exceed  $50,000.  Under  the  existing  law,  the

Official Assignee may only administer the property  of

such  persons  without  letters of  administration  if

their estates do not exceed $10,000 in value. In  view

of  the increase in the rate of Central Provident Fund

contributions,  most  Singaporeans  will  be   leaving

estates exceeding $10,000 in value when they die. This

proposal in the Bill will enable the Official Assignee

to  administer such estates summarily if they  do  not

exceed $50,000 in value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E.W. Barker].

<div align="center"><b>MAINTENANCE ORDERS (RECIPROCAL ENFORCEMENT) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps I should explain to Members what the

Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act is all

about.  Should a Member of this House desert his  wife

and  run  off to some other country, leaving his  wife

and children without means, then the wife can apply to

a Singapore court for an order for maintenance. But if

the  errant  husband is not in Singapore, one  cannot

enforce  the order. Should he run off with some  other

woman  to  another country, then the  order  which  is

obtained  in  Singapore  can be  sent  to  that  other

country  for  enforcement  in  that  country's   court

provided,  of  course, we have reciprocal arrangements

with that country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will recall that the Maintenance

Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act, 1975, was enacted

in July, 1975, to introduce certain changes in the law

relating   to   the   enforcement  in   Singapore   of

maintenance  orders made elsewhere,  as  well  as  the

enforcement  in other countries of maintenance  orders

made  in  Singapore.  Before the  said  Act  could  be

brought  into force, we sought the views of countries.

which    had   previously   entered   into    existing

arrangements  with  us for reciprocal  enforcement  of

maintenance  orders, as to whether they were  able  to

enter into new arrangements based on our new Act. Sir,

in the Law Ministers' Conference in Lagos, Nigeria, in

1974,   most  countries  agreed  to  pass  appropriate

amendments to their Reciprocal Enforcement Act so that

these  new arrangements could be made. But up  to-date

some countries have replied that they are unable to do

so  as  their  laws have not been changed.  For  these

countries, therefore, it will be necessary to continue

the existing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



arrangements  made  on  the  basis  of  the   existing

Maintenance   Orders  (Reciprocal   Enforcement)   Act

(Chapter 26).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1975 Act has a provision which seeks to repeal

the existing Act. It is, therefore, necessary to defer

the repeal of the existing Act until all countries can

make  arrangements for the reciprocal  enforcement  of

maintenance orders on the basis of the 1 975 Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, therefore, seeks to amend the 1975

Act to include a provision to empower the Minister  in

charge to appoint different dates for the coming  into

operation of the different provisions of the Act. This

will  enable  the 1 975 Act to be brought  into  force

except  for  the provision which seeks to  repeal  the

existing Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. [Mr E.W. Barker].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Commercial and Industrial Security

Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 1976, seeks to amend the

Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation Act.  1

972, for the following purposes:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To regularise Government's contribution towards

the retirement benefits payable to an employee of the

Corporation for the years of service he has rendered to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>





Government under the former Guard and Escort Unit;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To make provisions for the Corporation to

adopt certain financial procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Corporation is required under the law to

bear  all rights, liabilities and obligations relating

to  the  Guard and Escort Unit immediately before  the

coming into Operation of the Commercial and Industrial

Security  Corporation Act, 1 972. However,  Government

has   agreed,  in  line  with  the  policy   governing

transferred  employees of other statutory  boards,  to

contribute  to  the  retirement benefits  to  a  CISCO

employee  for his service while serving the Government

under  the  former  Guard  and  Escort  Unit  of   the

Singapore  Police Force. This arrangement is currently

given  in  a Letter of Undertaking from the  Permanent

Secretary.   Ministry  of  Finance,  to  the   General

Manager.  CISCO.  It  is  necessary,  now,   to   make

provisions  under  clause  2  of  the  Commercial  and

Industrial  Security  Corporation  (Amendment)   Bill,

1976, to regularise this payment by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Act also lacks detailed provisions to

deal  with  the  appointment of auditors,  powers  and

duties  of the auditors, keeping of financial  records

and  submission of financial statements to Parliament.

With  the  concurrence  of  the  Auditor-General   and

consistent  with  the policy applicable  to  statutory

institutions, it is now proposed to add a new schedule

to  the  Act.  This is to require the  Corporation  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provision of the Parliamentary

Pensions  Act, a Backbencher, who previously held  the

office of Prime Minister or a Cabinet Minister  for  a

period  of not less than three years and has completed

nine  years'  reckonable service and has attained  the

age  of 45 years or upon his attaining this age, shall

be granted a pension calculated on his ministerial pay

and  the allowance received by him in respect  of  his

service as a Member of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in this Bill to exclude the M P

allowance  in  such a computation as  the  Backbencher

concerned, whilst having ceased to hold the office  of

Prime  Minister or Cabinet Minister, is still a Member

of  Parliament  and  therefore  should  not  have  the

element of the MP allowance calculated in his pension.

Section 5 (2) of the Act is therefore being amended to

provide  for pension to be computed only on the  basis

of his ministerial pay. When he finally ceases to be a

Member of Parliament, section 4 (3) of the Act  as  it

stands  will  enable  his pension to  be  re-computed,

taking  into  account his allowance  as  a  Member  of

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.
