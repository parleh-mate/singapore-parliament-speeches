<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Payment of damages)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for

Labour if he will consider introducing legislation

to  amend section 41 of the Workmen's Compensation

Act  or any other appropriate sections thereof  or

other  legislation to provide that, in cases where

the   injured   workman   has   instituted   legal

proceedings  to  recover damages  or  compensation

independently of the Act, payment of such  damages

as  are  awarded  by  the  Court  or  compensation

secured  which exceed $500 shall be  made  to  the

Public  Trustee as trustee for the person entitled

to the benefit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by my

Minister to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 41 of the Workmen's Compensation Act,

besides  giving an injured workman the  choice  of

either  claiming  compensation under  the  Act  or

instituting action for damages in common law,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



also at the same time reserves his right to revert

to  the Workmen's Compensation Act should he  fail

in  common law. Any payment of compensation  under

the  Act  is made by the Commissioner directly  to

the claimants and, unless he directs otherwise, no

insurer  or  employer  may  pay  directly  to  the

claimant.   The   Commissioner,  however,   cannot

withhold  any sum due to a claimant except  minors

in  respect  of whom he holds the amounts  due  in

trust until they reach the age of 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that neither under the present

Workmen's Compensation Act nor in common  law  are

safeguards  provided to prevent  a  claimant  from

being  exploited by unscrupulous persons  or  from

squandering  away  the lump sum  awarded  to  him.

However,  the  present  Act  is  being  completely

revamped.  The  new  Bill not  only  provides  for

increased  quantum of compensation but would  also

empower  the  Commissioner for Labour to  withhold

such sum in the interests of the claimant. He can,

under  the new Bill, make monthly payments instead

of   one  lump  sum,  thereby  ensuring  that  the

claimant is assured of a steady monthly income.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that section 41, as explained

above, is the most appropriate section to amend in

order  to  make provision that if any  payment  of

compensation exceeding $500 is made to  a  workman

by  his employer in common law, then it should  be

made to the Public Trustee.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is the Parliamentary Secretary in a position

to  inform this House when this new Bill  will  be

introduced?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, this Bill is in an

advanced stage of drafting, and as soon as  it  is

ready  it  will  be tabled in this House  for  the

consideration of Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Culture  if the Anson Community Centre is affected

by  urban  redevelopment and where the alternative

site for the Centre will be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  answer  is  yes,  the   Anson

Community  Centre  will  be  affected   by   urban

redevelopment. However, the plan has not yet  been

finalised and the Urban Redevelopment Authority is

not able to tell when the community centre will be

affected  and where the alternative site will  be.

The  Member  for Anson will be informed  when  the

site  is known, and his views will be sought  when

the time comes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when

will the Minister for Culture ask the Minister for

National Development to get a place? When will  we

get it? The Minister for Culture should insist  on

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, when a site is available, the Member will be informed of it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>(Public address system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development if the Government  will

consider   the  installation  of  public   address

systems in the courtrooms of the Supreme Court  to

ensure  that  justice is not only  seen  but  also

heard.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, the Government does not

consider that there is a need to provide  for  the

installation of public address systems in the air-conditioned courtrooms in the Supreme Court.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, with

one  experience behind us, can the Minister inform

the  House  whether  or not the Subordinate  Court

buildings  that  are  nearing completion  will  be

installed  with sufficient public address  systems

to ensure that justice there will be heard?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There will be a public address system

in  the  Senior  Magistrates' Courts  in  the  new

Subordinate  Courts  building  to  enable  parties

appearing  thereto to hear their  summonses  being

called.  This  Court will be the Court  where  the

majority of criminal cases are first mentioned.

<div align="center"><b>REORGANISATION OF PRISONS DEPARTMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress made)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Health and Home Affairs (a) what progress has been

made   in   the  reorganisation  of  the   Prisons

Department  since early 1973; (b) if his  Ministry

proposes  to  recommend revision  of  salaries  of

Prisons  Officers; and (c) what  steps  have  been

taken  to  give Prisons Officers the four off-days

per month.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

appointed  a Committee to study the reorganisation

of  the  Prisons Department in February 1973.  The

Committee  made  a  comprehensive  review  of  the

Prisons  Department and studied, inter  alia,  the

sentences  imposed on criminals,  the  systems  of

rehabilitation  of  prisoners  and  the  pay   and

service  conditions of the staff  of  the  Prisons

Department. The final Report was submitted to  the

Ministry of Home Affairs in March 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee made various recommendations,

including a salary revision for the Prisons staff.

The Government has since accepted in principle the

recommendations (other than those relating to  the

salary    scales)    and   directed    that    the

reorganisation  of  the  Prisons   Department   as

recommended should be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement has also been reached with the Finance

Ministry  to  revise  the  salary  scales  of  the

custodial  ranks in the Prisons Service and  these

have been implemented with effect from 1st August,

1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the peculiar nature of prison work, it

is  not possible to give Prison officers regularly

four  off-days per month. They are given one  off-day  in  a  fortnight and, they  do  not,  on  the

aggregate, work more than 44 hours per week.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Prisons Department's

recommendations   have  been   accepted   by   the

Government. Is it true that the salary scales  for

senior officers have also been accepted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

already  answered that question  just  now.  As  I

said,  all  the  recommendations of the  Committee

have  been  accepted,  except  those  relating  to

salaries.  As  far as salaries are  concerned,  an

agreement  has  been reached between  the  Finance

Ministry and the Home Affairs Ministry with regard

to the revision of salaries, particularly those of

the  custodial staff, and that the improvement  in

the salaries of the custodial staff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



has been implemented on 1st August this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, has the Home Affairs

Ministry  recommended to the Ministry  of  Finance

its support for the implementation of these salary

scales?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I have said that as far as

the custodial staff are concerned, recommendations

for  a salary revision had been put to the Finance

Ministry, and they have agreed to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, are the senior officers

included in the salary revision scheme?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the salary revision is

for  all  the Prisons staff. But, as I have  said,

the  improvements of salaries have  been  effected

for the custodial staff.

<div align="center"><b>VIGILANTE CORPS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Health and Home Affairs (a) if he will give  facts

and  figures  of  the progress  and  work  of  the

Vigilante Corps; (b) what is the ratio of  members

of  the  Corps  to instructors; (c) what  measures

have  been  taken to counsel members of the  Corps

who are frequently absent from parades; and (d) if

he  is  aware  that  due to the  poor  quality  of

uniforms supplied to members of the Corps many  of

them  prefer to stitch their own uniform, and what

steps are being taken in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo) (for the Minister for Health and Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have been asked by my Minister to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps (VC) was reorganised into a

National   Service  organisation   for   part-time

National Servicemen in 1967. Since then it  has  a

constant inflow of about 5,000 National Servicemen

annually. With the intake of more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



members, the Corps was able to extend its  service

in  1971 to include Civil Defence training for its

part-time National Servicemen. Early this year its

service    was   further   extended    with    the

establishment  of  the  Community  Security  Force (CSF).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Vigilante Corps has emerged as a large

and expanding disciplined force. Out of a total of

31,089 National Servicemen in the Corps as at 30th

September, 1974: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 11,208 are in the Vigilante Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 13,318 are in the Civil Defence Service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) 5,892 are in the Community Security Service; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) 671 are in the Auxiliary Fire Service.



<br><br>The Vigilante Service is a mass youth organisation

which  seeks to inculcate in the men  a  sense  of

social    consciousness,    responsibility     and

discipline  through  civics  and  organised  youth

activities.  Specific cultural  groups  have  been

formed  to  enrich the cultural life of our  young

citizens. In addition, a Lifeguard Unit was set up

in  February  this year. Within a  brief  span  of

eight  months since its inception, members of  the

Lifeguard Unit have saved the lives of 13 persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Civil Defence Service, the National

Servicemen are trained in rescue operations, first-aid  and fire-fighting, so as to meet any national

emergency.  Included  in  this  field  of  service

recently  is  the  introduction  of  Lift   Rescue

Training. It is hoped that the availability  of  a

group  of well-trained VC National Servicemen  for

such  rescue  work  will  help  to  minimise   the

inconvenience  that  can be caused  to  HDB  flat-dwellers in the event of power failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Community Security Force became

operational in January this year, there has been a

significant reduction in crime between 7 p.m, and

11 p.m, in the crime-prone areas selected for CSF



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



policing  service. During the first six months  of

this  year, there were on the average 21 days  per

month  during which such areas were free of  crime

because of the presence of the CSF members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratio of instructors to members of the Corps

is  1  : 125. However, as there are some vacancies

in the instructorate, the actual ratio is 1 : 172.

Steps are being taken to fill the vacancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps has set up a counselling

service for VC National Servicemen. It is part  of

the  job  of  this  counselling unit  to  go  into

individual  cases  of  those  who  are  habitually

absent  from  duty or training.  They  also  visit

homes  of  habitual absentees to  find  out  their

problems and advise them to return for training or

duty. Absentees working in shifts or at night  are

allowed  to  do  their training  during  the  day.

Alternatively,  they can attend  make-up  training

subsequently, provided they are granted  leave  of

absence  from  the usual training in  advance.  It

should,   however,  be  pointed   out   that   the

counselling service is not the decisive factor  in

reducing the absentee rate in the Vigilante Corps.

With  suitable punitive measures and  an  improved

training programme, the Corps has now been able to

cut  down drastically the rate of absenteeism.  As

at  1st  April, 1974, there were a total of  2,494

bad   absentees  and  gazetted  deserters  in  the

Vigilante Corps. This number was reduced to 909 as

at  30th  September this year. Taking into account

that  the  total  strength of the Vigilante  Corps

today  is  30,984  (excluding 105 deserters),  the

overall  absentee rate has now dropped to an  all-time low of 2.9 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mass uniformed organisation like the

Vigilante  Corps,  it  is  not  possible  for  all

members  of the Corps to be provided with made-to-measure  uniforms. However, every effort has  been

made to improve upon the style and comfort of  the

uniforms provided for members of the Corps.  Prior

to  1967, the national servicemen in the Vigilante

Corps  were provided with uniforms made of  drill.

This  has  since  been changed to cotton  for  the

shirts and teteron for the trousers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



Junior  officers  in  the Corps  are  issued  with

uniforms made to standard sizes owing to the large

numbers  involved.  Slight  alterations   to   the

uniforms  may have to be made by individuals.  The

senior  officers are provided with made-to-measure

uniforms in view of their smaller numbers.

<div align="center"><b>DRUGS REGISTRATION BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang</b> asked the Minister for Health

and  Home  Affairs whether he is  considering  the

setting  up  of  a  board for the registration  of

drugs,  and  what  measures  are  contemplated  to

ensure  that drugs are of clinical and therapeutic

efficacy and are proven safe from dangerous  side-effects.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the   setting  up  of  a  board   for   the

registration of drugs is being considered  as  one

of  the  ways in which the proposed Medicines  Act

may  be administered. It will be necessary to draw

on  the  experience in drug control and safety  of

other  countries, such as the United Kingdom which

has a similar Medicines Act. For instance, in U.K.

there   are  several  committees  which  undertake

various  and  different aspects of  drug  control.

There  is  a Medicines Committee which is  charged

with  advising on the general policies  concerning

medicines,  answering questions  put  to  it,  and

volunteering  information. There  are  also  other

expert  committees  such  as  that  on  Safety  of

Medicines,  and  the Pharmacopoeia Commission,  as

well  as  sub-committees such as on the prevention

of  microbial contamination of medicines.  In  our

case,  where  necessary, committees along  similar

lines may be formed in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic measure to ensure safety, efficacy and

the  quality  of  medicine will be  by  licensing.

Licensing  of  the  products (in  other  words,  a

registration of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



the  products)  will be based on evidence  of  the

following: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The product does not contain any deleterious

substance;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There is good quality control in

manufacture;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) There has been exhaustive and comprehensive

testing  chemically, by bio-assays  and  by

clinical trials; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) They are marketed in approved forms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a corollary it will have to eliminate drugs

which   are  of  doubtful  safety,  efficacy   and

quality.  Drugs will be screened on the  basis  of

scientific   evidence  of  safety,  efficacy   and

compliance  with the principles of internationally

accepted standards of good manufacturing practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has now five officers with overseas

training  in  quality  control  of  drugs  and  in

procedures  of drug registration. Inspectors  will

be  appointed  to see that the conditions  imposed

are observed by product licencees. They will visit

the   premises   of  manufacturers  applying   for

licences  and  also  do  spot  checks  on  licence

holders. Drug wholesalers will have to maintain  a

specified  standard of record-keeping and  storage

facilities. It will be an offence to make false or

misleading statements in an advertisement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  will  the Ministry of Health, in considering

the setting up of a board for the registration  of

drugs,  provide facilities for screening?  What  I

mean is besides just checking on the claims of  an

importer  of  a  particular  new  drug,  will  the

Ministry  of Health itself have the facilities  to

test the claims?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> We have not yet quite decided

on  the establishment of a board. At this stage of

drafting the Bill, I am in no position to  specify

the details on how we would implement this measure

of drug control.

<div align="center"><b>MEDICINES BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Introduction of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang</b> asked the Minister for Health

and  Home Affairs if the views of experts  outside

his  Ministry and of interested organisations  and

associations are being sought in the  drafting  of

the  Medicines  Bill, and when the  Bill  will  be

introduced.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Health and Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the usual

practice   to   seek  the  views   of   interested

organisations and associations at the stage when a

law  is  being drafted. Nevertheless, a  group  of

knowledgeable  persons  outside  the  Ministry  of

Health  has been asked to study closely the  final

draft  of  the  Medicines  Bill  with  a  view  to

advising on the principles and implications of the

important   provisions.  This  group  of   persons

includes  a senior lecturer in Pharmacy  from  the

University  of Singapore, a pharmacist in  private

practice and a general practitioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are far too many organisations and

associations  with interest in medicinal  products

which  makes seeking representative views at  this

stage  impracticable. It is, however, proposed  to

send  the  Medicines  Bill to a  Select  Committee

after its Second Reading in Parliament. This  will

be   the   time   when  interested   persons   and

organisations will be asked to submit their  views

and memoranda on the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medicines Bill will be presented to

Parliament as soon as it is ready. This will be in

about  three months' time. It should, however,  be

noted  that  the  Bill, being a complex  piece  of

legislation, may have to be brought into effect in

parts. The Medicines Act in the U.K., for example,

has  still not been completely enforced in all its

sections,  after  it  was passed  by  the  British

Parliament nearly six years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, 1973, the Minister for Home Affairs

appointed   a   Road   Traffic   Management    and

Enforcement Committee to formulate basic  policies

of  Road  Traffic Management as  well  as  to  co-ordinate  the  roles  of the  various  departments

involved in traffic enforcement and management and

to  supervise the activities carried out by  these

departments  with  a  view  to  achieving  greater

efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  tackling   the

immediate,   short-term  and   long-term   traffic

problems. This Committee, chaired by the Permanent

Secretary      (Home      Affairs),      comprised

representatives    from    the    Ministries    of

Communications, Finance, Environment, Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



Works  Department, Registry of Vehicles, Attorney-General's Chambers, Public Utilities Board and the

Police  Force. This Committee has been  superseded

by  the Road Transport Action Committee which  was

established  in  November, 1973,  comprising  five

Permanent  Secretaries  from  the  Ministries   of

National Development, Communications, Home Affairs

and  the  Budget  and  Development  Divisions   of

Finance Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one year of close study and research, the

Road  Traffic Management and Enforcement Committee

came   to   the   conclusion  that   our   present

enforcement  system  is,  amongst  other   things,

noticeably lacking in the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) effective means of detecting persistent

offenders;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) adequate penalties to deter persistent

offenders;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) administrative procedures that allow

expedient enforcement action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rectify this, the Committee recommended a

number of amendments to the Road Traffic Act (Cap.

92).  The  recommendations of the Committee  which

have  been accepted are incorporated in  the  Road

Traffic (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Amendment Bill will empower a

Police  Officer  to require any person  driving  a

motor  vehicle  on a road to produce  his  driving

licence  within 24 hours at such police office  or

station  as may be specified by the officer  where

the person is unable to produce his licence on the

spot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Amendment Bill provides that if a

person is convicted of an offence under the Act or

is   disqualified  by  a  court  from  holding  or

obtaining a driving licence, the court shall  send

a    notice    of   conviction   or    order    of

disqualification to the Registrar of Vehicles  who

will  be  required to record such  particulars  of

conviction  or disqualification and maintain  such

record for a period not exceeding three years from

the   date   of  the  conviction  or   expiry   of

disqualification as the case may be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much publicity has already been given to clause 5

of  the  Amendment Bill. This concerns the  Points

Demerit  System  which  aims  at  identifying  and

removing dangerous drivers from the roads. It also

serves   as  a  psychological  deterrence  against

reckless  driving. This system entails the  giving

of  points  by  administrative means  for  traffic

offences  likely  to  cause  accidents.  A  points

penalty  table  under the Rules will  specify  the

points for various traffic violations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a driver has attained a total of 12 or more

points  within a year, the Registrar  of  Vehicles

will have powers to suspend the driving licence of

the  driver for a period not exceeding six months.

A  warning notice, however, will first be sent  by

the  Registrar  of  Vehicles to the  motorist  the

moment  he has accumulated or exceeded six points.

On  receipt of a notice of suspension, the  driver

has  the  right  within 14 days to appeal  to  the

Minister against the decision of the Registrar  of

Vehicles.  The Minister's decision on  the  matter

will be final. Any person whose driving licence is

suspended  will  have  to  surrender  it  to   the

Registrar of Vehicles and will be prohibited  from

driving any motor vehicle on the roads during  the

period of suspension of his driving licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Amendment Bill will impose

liability  upon a motor vehicle owner for  parking

offences  in  cases where the particulars  of  the

offending  driver  are not available.  Unless  the

vehicle  owner  can  furnish  particulars  of  the

driver  to the police within seven days  from  the

date of issue of the police notice or satisfy  the

police  or the court that the vehicle was, at  the

relevant time, stolen or had been illegally  taken

or  used,  or establish that he did not  know  and

could   not,   with  reasonable  diligence,   have

ascertained  the name and address of  the  driver,

the vehicle owner would be liable for the offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Amendment Bill will enable the

Minister to make rules with respect to jaywalking.

Over the last three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



years,  a total of 10,519 pedestrians were  killed

and injured by motor vehicles. In 1973, a total of

380 persons were killed in road traffic accidents,

185  of whom were pedestrians. While many of these

accidents   involving   pedestrians    could    be

attributed  to  reckless driving by  motorists,  a

great  number of these fatalities were  caused  by

pedestrians crossing the road heedless of  traffic

conditions. The pedestrians, therefore, need to be

disciplined as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Amendment Bill, it will be an offence

for  pedestrians to cross the road other  than  at

places   where  proper  crossing  facilities   are

provided. This would, however, apply to  the  area

50  metres  from either side of any such crossing.

Where the crossings are close to one another,  the

area  of enforcement may be extended to cover  the

length between and a little beyond such crossings.

Traffic  signs  will be erected  to  indicate  the

areas  of  enforcement. As it is not the intention

to punish but to educate pedestrians in the proper

use of the facilities provided for them, initially

small  composition  fines  would  be  imposed   on

jaywalkers. This may be increased later  if  there

is   no  salutary  effect.  Jaywalking  by  school

children  will be referred to principals of  their

schools  for appropriate action to be taken.  Aged

and disabled persons who are unable to make use of

the   pedestrian  crossing  facilities  would   be

exempted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To empower the courts to impose and enhance

penalties  in respect of traffic offences,  clause

10   of  the  Amendment  Bill  provides  for   the

imposition  of a fine not exceeding $1,000  or  to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months

for the first offence. For a second and subsequent

offence,   the  courts  may  impose  a  fine   not

exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not

exceeding   six   months.   For   uniformity   and

consistency,  these  enhanced  penalty  provisions

would  apply  to  all offences under  the  various

rules and regulations of the Road Traffic Act. The

existing   penal  sections  in   the   rules   and

regulations   will   be  amended   in   subsidiary

legislation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new ticketing system in respect of traffic

offences will be introduced under clause 12 of the

Amendment Bill. The objective of this is to reduce

the  present  cumbersome paper work which  hinders

the  Traffic Police in its work and saps up  extra

manpower   unnecessarily,   thus   reducing    the

effectiveness  of  enforcement action.  Under  the

proposed ticketing system, a traffic ticket served

by   the   policeman   on  the  motorist,   either

personally or by registered mail, will  be  deemed

to be both a report as well as a summons to appear

in  court.  If  the  offence is compoundable,  the

ticket   would   also  serve  as   an   offer   of

composition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the Points Demerit System and the

ticketing   system   function   effectively    and

efficiently,  the Traffic Police and the  Registry

of  Vehicles  have computerised their records  and

procedures,  and  the records  and  procedures  of

these two departments would be linked. Members  of

this  House  may be interested to know that  these

new  enforcement procedures are based  on  systems

successfully applied in countries like the  United

States,  England, Australia and Japan.  They  have

been  recommended for adoption here after  careful

study and research by the Traffic Police, Registry

of   Vehicles,  Attorney-General's  Chambers   and

Computer  Services  Division of  the  Ministry  of

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 15 of the Amendment Bill will

enable  the courts to accept certificates endorsed

by   a  police  officer  not  below  the  rank  of

inspector,  as to the accuracy and reliability  of

radar  speed  traps  and  speedometers  of  police

vehicles.  This  is  required for  more  effective

enforcement  against speed hogs  whose  mania  for

speed without consideration for others often  kill

and maim innocent people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, traffic law enforcement consists

basically  of five processes: (i) detection;  (ii)

apprehension;     (iii)     prosecution;      (iv)

adjudication;    and    (v)   penalisation.    For

enforcement to be effective, there must be  enough

teeth in the traffic laws to enable enforcement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



officers to carry out their task without  let  and

hindrance.   The  underlying  objective   of   the

Amendment  Bill  is  to speed up  the  enforcement

process  and,  at  the  same  time,  enhance   the

efficacy  of traffic law enforcement. It  is  also

aimed  at  drastically reducing the  road  traffic

accident rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All careful and law-abiding motorists and

pedestrians should welcome the various  provisions

contained  in  the  Amendment Bill,  as  they  are

intended to make our roads safer and to reduce the

unnecessary heavy toll on lives we see today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the aim of this Bill is to introduce

a   Points  Demerit  System  in  order  to   deter

motorists  from driving dangerously or  recklessly

on  the  road.  The  number of road  accidents  is

increasing every year and the number of fatalities

is  also  increasing. The adoption of this  System

against  reckless  motorists  is  timely.  In  the

Points Demerit System, because of the awarding  of

points - four, five or six points depending on the

nature of the traffic offence - a motorist who  is

found  guilty  of offences for which  12  or  more

points   are  awarded,  will  be  suspended   from

driving.  So  he must not commit more  than  three

traffic  offences. Otherwise his licence  will  be

suspended for six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that such a penalty is too drastic,

especially  against bus drivers, taxi drivers  and

lorry drivers, who depend on driving as a means of

earning a living. This system is a threat to their

livelihood as it may break their rice bowl.  These

professional drivers spend at least eight hours of

driving  on  the  road. Take the case  of  a  taxi

driver.  He  is quite different from the  ordinary

motorist. He has to spend about eight to 12  hours

of  driving, and working two shifts in one day.  I

feel that we should have a different system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



of awarding points for these professional drivers.

We  should  increase the maximum number of  points

four-fold  for  the  penalty of  suspending  their

driving  licences. I am not advocating  that  taxi

and  lorry  drivers  should be allowed  to  commit

traffic  offences. What I am pointing out is  that

we should be sympathetic towards taxi drivers, bus

drivers and lorry drivers. It is not quite correct

to punish them heavily by suspending their driving

licences if they are awarded 12 points, because  a

suspension of six months' driving will  amount  to

depriving them of their livelihood for six months.

How  will  their families live? Who  is  going  to

support  them?  And in the face of  inflation  and

economic  recession  these  days,  the  Government

should see that the livelihood of these people  is

safeguarded.  The Government should  not  increase

the  pool of unemployed or cause more hardship  to

the  people. So we should adopt a different system

of  awarding points for the professional  drivers.

Apart   from   serious  traffic  offences,   other

punitive  measures  may be taken  -  for  example,

warnings, fines or suspension of driving  licences

for  one  week. For minor offences we  should  not

suspend their licences for six months in order  to

deter   them  from  committing  further   offences

because  we  should  not cause hardship  to  their

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also provides for a ticket system.

Careful  consideration  should  be  given  in  its

implementation  to ensure that it is  not  abused.

For example, the officers concerned should be fair

in  their attitude. They should not be allowed  to

abuse  their rights by causing unnecessary trouble

to drivers so as to avoid disputes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, civil servants in certain departments do not

carry out their duties correctly. Some of them are

not  even  familiar  with the relevant  laws.  For

example,  in  the  case of bus  lanes,  these  are

reserved for buses during the hours



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



from 7.30 a.m, to 9.30 a.m, and from 4.30 p.m, to 6.30 p.m, on weekdays. On Saturdays, the hours  of

restriction  are from 7.30 a.m, to 9.30  a.m, and

from   11.30  a.m, to  2.30  p.m.  Outside  these

periods, the restriction is not enforced. In other

words, outside these hours all vehicles can travel

along  bus  lanes just like any other  stretch  of

road.  However, taxi drivers have been  prosecuted

for  driving in bus lanes outside these restricted

times.   This   shows   that   the   police   have

unnecessarily interfered with the control of  taxi

drivers.  Beyond  these  restricted  times,   taxi

drivers should be allowed to use the bus lanes  as

well.  This  shows that certain officers  are  not

familiar with the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of an abuse of the law concerns

taxi  drivers.  We  know that  taxis  have  to  be

inspected every six months in order to ensure that

they maintain their engines properly. However,  at

the  headquarters of the Registry of Vehicles,  we

see  policemen  on the look-out  for  taxis.  They

invariably  cause  taxis  to  go  into   the   ROV

compound.  This  causes loss of earnings  for  the

taxi drivers because they are asked to bring their

taxis  to  the  ROV for inspection  before  it  is

actually  due. I would urge the Minister  to  look

into this matter and to direct that department and

the officers in that department to comply with the

relevant laws and not to abuse their power. I hope

the  Minister would give special training  to  law

enforcement   officers  and  to  see   that   they

familiarise  themselves with the laws before  they

carry out their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in principle, I support this

Bill because it will result in a reduction of road

accidents and road fatalities. But I hope that the

law  enforcement officers could be fair  in  their

attitude  towards  the  motorist,  especially  the

professional drivers.



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

view  of the very sad state of discipline  on  the

roads today, a matter on which much has been said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



in the last few weeks, and in view of the frequent

display of disregard for lawful behaviour  on  the

roads, no sensible person, I think, has any  other

alternative  than to support this Bill completely.

And  I  rise  to voice my unqualified support  for

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is interesting to note that

this debate on the Second Reading of this Bill  is

being  conducted actually during a period in which

a  campaign has been launched and is very much  in

the  process of implementation. To my mind and  to

my  personal  and great satisfaction, I  interpret

this  as  highlighting the role of legislation  in

continuing public education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, may I just recapitulate a few

points that have been raised during this campaign,

because   while   there  has   been   debate   and

suggestions outside Parliament, I think the  final

arbitrating forum is Parliament itself. So let  me

just make one or two points, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Points Demerit System. Instead of

considering  this system as drastic or  Draconian,

maybe we should extend it to include even the less

grave offences. It may not be quite inappropriate,

today  particularly,  for me  to  resort  to  some

religious imagery. There are, Sir, mortal sins and

venial  sins.  Perhaps what has been  incorporated

administratively in the Points System may  be  for

mortal  sins,  but I think we ought also  to  give

one, two or three points for venial sins. If I may

just   enlighten  this  House  further   on   this

religious  matter,  may I say that  no  amount  of

venial  sin  can equal one mortal sin. But  venial

sins  lead  to mortal sins. So I think  we  should

also  attempt to penalise those who infringe  even

in minor matters, just to bring to their minds the

possibility that through their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



carelessness  they may infringe  seriously.  So  I

would   appeal   both   to   the   Minister    for

Communications as well as to the Minister for Home

Affairs to consider implementing the Points System

on the basis of one, two or three points for other

minor offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring up, Mr

Speaker, Sir, is that when a licence is taken away

from  a  person  for six months or  for  a  longer

period  by  a  court order, it is not  correct  to

allow  a person to resume driving just like  that.

You  must remember, Sir, that this person has  had

his licence suspended because he has infringed the

law gravely. He has been a danger to life and limb

of  other people. In fact, he might have been  the

cause  of dangerous injuries to other people.  And

yet  after  a  period  of six  months,  at  least,

without  any driving, he is allowed to go back  on

the  road without any assurance that he indeed can

drive  well and with responsibility. Therefore,  I

think  that  when  a person has  had  his  licence

suspended,  he  should not be  allowed  to  resume

driving  unless  he has undergone another  driving

test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to another point which I would

like  to bring up, Sir, and that is the very  high

rate  of  failures of those people  who  take  the

driving  test.  The Minister's own  officers  will

confirm that three-quarters of those who take  the

test fail. The average rate of passing is only  25

per cent. What does this signify, Mr Speaker? Does

it  signify that people go for the test on a tikam

tikam  basis:  just try your luck  without  really

preparing  yourself  for  the  test?  Or  does  it

signify  that any Chang San and Lee Ssu can  teach

his brother, sister or friend to drive, and expect

this  person to rush off into a test? On the basis

of  this  high rate of failure, perhaps we  should

seriously  consider that those who wish  to  teach

people to drive ought to be specially licensed  to

do so. This matter has cropped up before, I think,

with  the  Ministry of Communications. Perhaps  we

could be enlightened as to why this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



has  not  been implemented. There must  have  been

good reasons, but I would suggest that this matter

be given further consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that - perhaps

I  may  be  imagining -there seems to be more  "L"

licence  holders among the motor-cycle  fraternity

in  Singapore than those who have actually  passed

the  test. Anyway, there seems to be too  many  of

these  motorcyclists with "L" plates. I have  been

informed  that they evade tests by renewing  their

provisional licences again and again, so  that  we

have on the roads quite a number of people who  do

not feel competent to take their motor-cycle test.

Perhaps some limit should be placed on the  length

of  time during which they can be allowed to renew

their  provisional licences, so we can be  assured

that   in  view  of  the  fairly  high  motorcycle

accident  rates efforts are being taken by  motor-cyclists to use their vehicles safely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is a pity that the Minister for

Education   is   not  here.  I   would   like   to

congratulate the Minister for Education for coming

out  in  such solid support for the principle  and

for  the  spirit of this educational  campaign  by

instructing  schools - oh, yes, the  Parliamentary

Secretary  is  here - to support  this  "accident-free" campaign. I think this support has to be  on

the basis of the entire Government, not merely  of

one  or  two Ministries. All Government Ministries

should  support  this campaign  in  various  ways,

principally by seeing that their own vehicles obey

the  laws.  I  may  mention to  the  Minister  for

Communications  that  I  saw  one   of   his   own

Ministry's    vehicles    committing    a    minor

infringement. Perhaps that driver deserves one  or

two  points! Again, I have also seen the  Ministry

of the Environment's vehicles on the wrong side of

the road - one sampah lorry was going up a one-way

street in the wrong direction. These infringements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



are  setting bad examples to others.  So  I  think

Government  departments  should  particularly  see

that  their own vehicles proceed correctly on  the

road.  And  I  am very glad that the Minister  for

National Development is here now because  I  think

the  condition of our roads requires  his  serious

consideration!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I have no irreconcilable

objections  to  the Bill. To me  the  Bill  merely

reflects  a  kind of problem that  the  Government

will  face  as  we  reach a stage  of  growth  and

affluence and where so many bodies wish to live in

order and comfort within a very limited area. This

situation  requires empowering the  administration

of  the Ministry with authority to regulate social

conduct. It appears to be an unavoidable course of

action.  Nevertheless, I think in  the  growth  of

governments  the  world over,  it  is  a  striking

feature  that  as  social  problems  expand  in  a

society, the more does it become necessary for the

administration  or the Ministry  to  be  empowered

with  executive action to regulate social conduct.

This  is the kind of situation that we are leading

to.  I  do wish to say that, although unavoidable,

empowering the Ministry with executive  powers  is

regrettable. Therefore, it becomes very  necessary

for  the  officials concerned to ensure  that  the

application of this authority is done in the  most

just  way possible. In our case it is not a matter

of  choice or convenience. In our case I think the

option is a necessary one if we are to prevent our

roads  from  becoming a bloody  scene  of  damaged

bodies  and  injuries. Nevertheless, I  think  the

absorption  of executive power by the Ministry  or

by  the  administration  must  be  explained  very

clearly   by   the   Ministry  or  administration,

illustrating to the people that the alternative is

social  disorder which we must all try  to  avoid.

That is the point I wish to make in respect of the

first section of the Bill, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to make one observation on the

Demerit  System that is envisaged in the Bill.  It

struck me that the system envisaged is negative in

approach. The system appears to me to say  to  the

motorists: "Don't drive fast, because  if  you  do

you  will  receive so many bad points", or  "Don't

drive  carelessly,  because if  you  do  you  will

receive so many bad points". And at the end  of  a

period, the Bill says: "Now that you have  got  so

many  bad  points, you should not  be  allowed  to

drive  at  all for so many months." I am wondering

whether  or  not  it is possible  to  construct  a

system  which  has a positive approach,  a  system

which  awards points to motorists for good driving

-  a  system which perhaps at the end of the score

will  be  able  to award privileges  to  the  good

motorist, such as a year's free driving licence or

a  rebate in road tax. I am sure it is not  beyond

the  ingenuity of the Ministry's officials to  try

and  think  of a positive approach to the  problem

because I think that such an approach will  induce

the  motoring  public to raise their standards  of

social  conduct on the roads, rather than  confine

them to a low level which at best becomes only  an

effort in driving without accidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I wish to make a few comments on this  Bill,

but  it  may appear to be a bit too late  at  this

stage; but it is better late than never.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on the point made by the

Minister  of State for Communications relating  to

pedestrians.  He  said that the  intention  is  to

educate rather than to punish jaywalkers.  We  all

know that quite a number of serious accidents were

caused by jaywalking. On the introduction of  this

Bill,  jay-walkers are let off very lightly.  This

will not help to reduce the number of accidents on

our  roads.  The Minister of State also  mentioned

that  for enforcement to be effective, there  must

be  enough teeth given to the Traffic regulations.

It appears that in so far as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



jaywalking is concerned, we are merely giving  the

regulations   false  teeth.  Especially   at   the

junctions  of  North Bridge Road / Stamford  Road!

Bras  Basah Road, you can see hoards of jaywalkers

crossing the roads when the traffic lights  favour

the motorists. As a result many motorists have  to

play  hide and seek with such careless pedestrians

and   run   the  risk  of  running  down  innocent

bystanders. All these careless pedestrians  should

not  be  let  off so lightly for their negligence,

which  however is the case with this Bill. I  feel

that   the   provisions  against  jaywalking   are

inadequate, and this will not help to  reduce  the

number of accidents that occur every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Sembawang, has

pointed  out that certain provisions of  the  Bill

are  too drastic against professional drivers, and

he  mentioned the case of bus and taxi drivers. He

says  that  if  a bus driver or a taxi  driver  is

suspended  from  driving for six months,  it  will

more  or  less  affect  his rice  bowl.  I  wonder

whether my colleague has given some thought to the

problems of the victims of such reckless driving -

those  who die on the roads through the negligence

and  recklessness of bus drivers, taxi drivers and

lorry  drivers.  Who will be responsible  to  look

after their families? I would like to quote a  few

instances where accidents were caused by negligent

bus  drivers, as this will probably help to change

his mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Toa Payoh alone there were so many accidents

involving  bus  drivers. A  bus  overturned  while

rounding a circus in Lorong 7, Toa Payoh. Luckily,

nobody was injured, other than causing a fright to

the  driver.  Two buses on going out  of  the  bus

terminus ran into a drain. We had one instance  in

which  a bus attempted to go over the flyover  but

crashed into the railings instead. Here again,  it

was  fortunate that it caused only a few injuries.

In  another case in Toa Payoh Central,  two  buses

collided head-on, causing injuries to 22



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



people.  In another accident in Dunearn Road  only

two months ago, a bus ran into the path of another

bus  and  15  persons were injured. In  Queenstown

there were about 20 to 30 bus commuters waiting at

a  bus stand, and there came along a bus which ran

into  them  and  knocked down the  bus  stand.  In

another  case in Punggol, a bus attempted  to  run

beyond  Punggol  Point! We have yet  another  case

where a bus ran into the car of the Honourable the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education.  All  these instances are  examples  of

negligent driving of bus drivers, and I feel  that

if no adequate punishment is meted out to such bus

drivers, we can never hope to reduce the number of

accidents and fatalities on our roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support all the provisions in the Bill except

the provision covering pedestrians, and I hope the

Minister  will  consider introducing  more  severe

penalties for jaywalking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  Singapore  today  I  find   it

difficult to drive around and I find it even  more

difficult to walk around. Although I support  this

Bill, I feel that it is not quite so effective. It

is like leaving a headache to cure itself, or when

your  foot aches you treat it yourself. If we want

to  reduce the number of accidents we will have to

reduce the number of vehicles and drivers. I agree

with  Members that the minimum age for  holding  a

driving licence should be raised to 21 years. This

is a correct move. If we do not allow more drivers

on  the road, the Government can easily reduce the

number of private car ownership. This will lead to

a reduction in the number of accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not against the introduction of the

Points  Demerit  System. It is only  a  medium  to

treat the symptoms of a permanent ailment. It does

not  cure  the pain fundamentally. In  the  Points

Demerit System many different points of view  have

been  given. Some Members think that we should  be

even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



more  strict,  but the Member for Sembawang  feels

that it is already too strict for the professional

drivers. I am in full sympathy with him. The  case

for  these professional drivers is just  like  the

Chinese  saying  that if you go  to  the  mountain

often enough, chances are you will be eaten by the

tiger.  Therefore,  I think the Government  should

give some consideration to this point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

for  any  law  to  be  effective,  there  must  be

enforcement. But as far as the management of  road

traffic  is  concerned, we seem to have  a  rather

peculiar  situation where the law is made  by  one

Ministry,  but  without  any  control   over   its

enforcement.  We have the Traffic  Police  in  the

Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  taking  care  of  the

enforcement  of  this  Bill  introduced   by   the

Ministry  of  Communications. To me  it  would  be

logical  either for the Minister for Home  Affairs

to  take  charge of administering the Road Traffic

Act,  or  for the Traffic Police to be transferred

to    the   portfolio   of   the   Minister    for

Communications.  I  really  cannot  see  how   the

present system can be effective. I think what  one

Member  has just said is quite true, that this  is

one  of the most inherent weaknesses in our entire

system of road traffic management.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I fully support this Road Traffic (Amendment)

Bill.   In  fact,  this  Bill  should  have   been

introduced a few years ago. Many innocent  persons

have  died or seriously injured by the actions  of

inconsiderate  drivers  who  drove   their   motor

vehicles recklessly and dangerously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the pamphlet on the Points

Demerit  System,  six points  will  be  given  for

reckless or dangerous driving. I think this is too

lenient  a punishment for such a serious  offence,

as  a reckless and dangerous driver could kill  an

innocent person. I would request



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister of State for Communications to  give

serious  consideration to immediately suspend  the

driving  licence of a driver for a period  of  six

months  if  he  is  found guilty of  reckless  and

dangerous  driving.  This is more  effective  than

giving  him six points for the offence,  which  is

too lenient a punishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to

answer  first in Mandarin to the points raised  by

two Mandarin-speaking Members of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the

Member  for Sembawang mentioned the Points Demerit

System.  According to him, the system of  awarding

points  is  too drastic. If you commit  a  traffic

offence  three times, you would reach the  maximum

of  12 points, that is, if you get four points for

each  offence, then after three offences you  will

reach the maximum of 12 points allowed to you  and

your  driving licence will be suspended for up  to

six months. In his view, this is too drastic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have heard the Member for Toa Payoh

saying that this system is not strict enough as we

should  consider  the plight of  the  families  of

victims  of  such accidents. He has also  given  a

number  of  instances  of  negligent  driving   by

professional drivers to support his point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as this system is new, I do not think

the  professional  drivers need be  over-concerned

about    it.   Whether   the   effects   of    the

implementation of this system will be  as  bad  as

what  the Member for Sembawang thinks, we will  be

able  to  know only after some time. He  has  also

recommended  that the period of suspension  should

not  exceed  one  week. Of  course,  he  is  quite

justified  in being concerned about the plight  of

professional drivers as, if I am not mistaken,  he

is  the  adviser to the Taxi Drivers  Association.

But  I  think we will have to wait for  a  certain

period to see the full effects of this new Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also brought up the question of the ticketing

system, and added that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



officers  should not abuse their powers.  I  think

every  one  with any conscience - every Government

official,   every   civilian,  every   Member   of

Parliament,   and   every   law-abiding    citizen

-believes  in  this.  But  what  is  an  abuse  of

authority,  or  what  constitutes  an   abuse   of

authority? This is rather ambiguous and cannot  be

defined clearly. However, if the Member does  come

across instances where such abuse has taken place,

I  shall be pleased to know more about the details

of  the particular case so that I can try my  best

to investigate and see what can be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah mentioned that the Bill

is  only a means of treating the symptoms  and  is

not  a  fundamental solution to the  problem.  The

provisions of this Bill are new, but we know  that

in  many  other countries similar provisions  have

already been effectively implemented. Let us  wait

for some time before assessing the effects of this

Bill and come to the conclusion whether or not  it

is sound or effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned the point about reducing the

number  of  vehicles as the basic and  fundamental

solution to the problem. He further mentioned that

the  minimum age of drivers should be raised  from

17  to  21 years. On these two points, of  course,

the  reduction in the number of vehicles will help

to  reduce accidents because, in theory at  least,

if   there  are  fewer  vehicles,  the  number  of

accidents  should  correspondingly  decrease.  But

this  is  not something that we can do immediately

because reducing the number of vehicles may affect

the  livelihood of many people. The policy of  the

Government is very clear. In the last few  months,

we have repeatedly announced our policy in respect

of  this problem. We will try our best to restrict

the  number of unnecessary vehicles on our  roads.

On  the question of the age of the drivers,  there

are  several  conflicting points  of  view.  Young

people, of course, feel that the age should not be

raised.  There  are  some  young  people  who  are

reckless or who are not so careful. But up to now,

we  have no concrete and positive evidence to show

that drivers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



in this age group of 17 and 21 years are accident-prone. We know that young people today learn a lot

of  skills,  and they learn various skills  at  an

early  age. Of course, they would like  to  obtain

the skills at an even earlier age. And driving  is

one of the skills they would like to acquire at an

early  age.  So for the time being, I cannot  give

him  a  very satisfactory answer because  I  think

time  is  needed to see the development  of  these

events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English) Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may now answer

the other Members of Parliament in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the support of the Member for

Katong.  He  raised the point on the  re-issue  of

driving licences. He 3pecifically maintained  that

a  re-test should be given to those whose licences

have   been  suspended,  and  not  just   re-issue

licences  to  them  on expiry  of  the  suspension

period.  We all know that our driving test centres

are unable to cope with new drivers right now.  So

if  we  are  going to implement his suggestion,  I

think  the  queue will be even longer.  `There  is

merit in his suggestion, but it takes some time to

see whether it can he worked out administratively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about "L" motorcyclists. The

Ministry of Communications has recently introduced

administrative action to ensure that an "L" motor-cyclist  should try to pass a riding  test  within

three  years or else he has to re-sit the  Highway

Code test before another "L" licence can be issued

to  him. This is, in fact, one administrative step

ahead  to persuade "L" riders to sit for the test.

The  large number of these "L" motor-cyclists that

we see on our roads is partly due to the fact that

the  majority of them just do not bother to  apply

for  a  test  because the fee for an  "L"  driving

licence  is  just  twice the fee for  an  ordinary

driving licence. But with the introduction of this

new ruling, I am sure the number will be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding his comment on Government vehicles, I

can only assure him that Government vehicles enjoy

no privileges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Serangoon Gardens, I thank him

for  his  support of the Bill. He mentioned  about

the   positive  measures  instead  of  the  Points

Demerit  System  which, he says,  is  negative  in

approach.  Legal action by itself is negative.  It

is   only  by  educating  our  people,  the   next

generation,  to be better educated, that  I  think

the  approach  through education will  be  a  more

positive one. As for awarding privileges  to  good

drivers,   I   doubt  this  could  be  implemented

administratively  because  it  will   become   too

complicated an issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh has suggested that

jaywalkers  should not be let off so lightly,  and

he  commented  that  the  penalties  provided  for

jaywalking  are  not enough.  I  mentioned  in  my

speech  that initially the penalties are meant  to

educate  the jaywalkers, hut if we find that  they

persist  in jaywalking and their accident rate  is

still high, then the existing law has provision to

increase  the  penalties. It  is,  therefore,  not

necessary to provide heavy penalties to deal  with

them  at  this  stage. The existing law  is  quite

adequate, and because it is something new  I  feel

that  initially  jay-walkers  should  be  given  a

chance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Jalan Kayu's comment that

the  law  is made in one Ministry and enforced  by

another,  I have listened to it with deep interest

and I have no comments to offer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee supports the Bill.

He  has  specifically pointed out that the penalty

of   six  points  for  dangerous  driving  is  too

lenient.   The  Points  Demerit  System   can   be

administratively  changed. If it  is  subsequently

proved  that six points are not adequate  to  deal

with  this group of reckless drivers, perhaps they

can  he increased. I hope I have answered all  the

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

In  his reply to my suggestion that those who  are

suspended need another test, the Minister of State

stated  that there are so many people waiting  for

tests  that  this is not feasible. Is he  implying

that it is more beneficial to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



let  a suspended driver off without a re-test than

to  keep  a  few other people waiting?  Or  is  he

expecting  so  many people to have their  licences

taken away that his officials have no time to give

another test?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a little

puzzled  by his "no comment" reply because  either

you  agree  or you do not agree. By not  giving  a

firm  answer, he has given me the impression  that

perhaps  he  agrees, but for political reasons  he

does not want to offend his colleague.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may follow up on the

Member for Jalan Kayu's comments. He has raised  a

most  interesting point on the question of traffic

problems  and  its  solution, that  is,  the  Road

Traffic   Act   comes  under   the   Ministry   of

Communications but its implementation falls within

the  purview  of  the Traffic Police  which  comes

under   the   Ministry  of  Home   Affairs.   This

unfortunately has been the position  for  quite  a

long  time. It is a matter which we have  referred

to the Management Services Unit of the Ministry of

Finance to look into especially the reorganisation

of  the  Registry of Vehicles. After  a  study  of

about  eight months, they produced a report  which

recommended that an Authority for Inland Transport

be  established to bring into it the  Registry  of

Vehicles, the Roads Department of the Ministry  of

National  Development, the Car Parks Division,  as

well as the Traffic Police of the Ministry of Home

Affairs. That was the suggestion put up if we  are

to  make  an  effective contribution  towards  the

resolution of traffic problems as a whole. Arising

out  of  this, as was stated in the Second Reading

speech  of the Minister of State, a Road Transport

Action Committee was formed in November last  year

comprising  five Permanent Secretaries  from  four

Ministries,  that  is to say,  the  Ministries  of

National Development, Communications, Home Affairs

and two Permanent Secretaries from the Ministry of

Finance, one from Budget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



and  the other from the Development Division. That

is  why over the past one year, i.e, from November

last  year  until  today, there  has  been  a  co-ordinated  effort  to  resolve  the  problems   of

traffic  in  general, and I  think  we  are  going

places  now  with this large, all-powerful,  high-powered co-ordinating committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the present amendments to the Road

Traffic  Act  were initiated by my colleague,  the

Minister  for Home Affairs, the group of officials

from   the   various  Ministries  and  departments

involved  in road traffic had to come together  to

produce  these  two  systems, the  Points  Demerit

System as well as the Ticketing System. This is  a

means  towards an end, and we believe  that  these

two  measures will contribute a great deal towards

a  rationalisation  of  our traffic  problems  and

should  be able to reduce considerably the  havoc,

the  carnage  of human lives that are  being  lost

every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the only problem that is being

tackled  by  the Road Transport Action  Committee.

There  are other measures. In fact, there  are  as

many  as  ten measures going on simultaneously  at

this  moment. Various traffic management  measures

are  in  force  or will be introduced  that  would

completely change the pattern of traffic as we see

it today.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Katong's other

question has not been answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. There is also

a valid point raised by the Member for Katong when

he  talked of mortal sins and venial sins.  It  is

true  that under the Points Demerit System  points

are  awarded for very serious offences.  In  fact,

the  aim  of  the  Points  Demerit  System  is  to

identify  and  remove dangerous drivers  first  so

that  the  less dangerous drivers will  be  looked

into  later. The idea is that we should first deal

with  those  with serious sins. Those with  venial

sins,  the minor ones, we will come to them  after

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



system  has  been  fully  implemented.  It  is   a

question  of  a  step by step approach.  The  more

serious  ones come first, to be followed later  by

the less serious ones when points will have to  be

awarded for minor offences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, would the Minister like to

touch  on  the  point regarding the suspension  of

licence and the necessity for a test? I have asked

the   question,   "Are  we   expecting   so   many

suspensions that the testers would not be able  to

attend to them; or i5 it more beneficial to keep a

few  people  waiting than to get these people  who

had  their  licences  suspended  to  come  for   a

retest?"



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Since the Member for Katong is

so  persistent, I will say this. After having  had

his licence withdrawn for six months, I think as a

first  penalty he would be cautioned  to  be  more

careful when he gets back his licence. We can give

it a trial.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> But he has not driven for six

months!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That is all right. There are

people who have not driven for six years, and  yet

they are still careful when they drive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> But this one is not a careful

driver.

executing the office of Lord High Admiral, of  the

United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and  Northern

certain rights over portions of the foreshore  and

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will recall that Government made a

policy statement on the 10th of September last

year and announced certain measures which it

proposed to take to curb excessive speculation in

land and property and to check the steep rise in

their values. One such measure was that all

planning approvals granted but on which no attempt

had been made to get on with the work would be

cancelled unless there was a firm contract for

construction work between owner and building

contractor signed on or before the 10th of

September last year or the owner/developer had

signed binding contracts for the sale of

residential properties with purchasers. In order

to implement the above decision, it was necessary

to cancel all planning approvals granted before

10th September, 1973, under section 9 of the

Planning Act. These would otherwise be valid for a

period of two years by virtue of subsection (8) of

section 9 of the Act. There were, in all, 329

cases of development affected by this policy.

Planning permission for 270 cases have since been

restored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to treat as cancelled all

planning permission granted before 1st February,

1960, under section 61 of the Singapore

Improvement Ordinance, and those granted between

1st February, 1960, and 12th December, 1965, under

the 1959 Planning Ordinance if no work had been

carried out by 10th September, 1973. Although

sections 10 and 11 of the present Planning Act

empower the Competent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



Authority to cancel such planning permission,

there was no provision in the Singapore

Improvement Ordinance or the 1959 Planning

Ordinance to allow planning permission to lapse

automatically after three years if no development

took place. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill provide

for cancellation of any planning permission

granted before 11th September, 1973, including any

granted under section 61 of the Singapore

Improvement Ordinance if no construction work had

commenced before that date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides for the exemption of certain

categories of planning permission from

cancellation, such as minor alterations and

additions to existing buildings and housing

development involving not more than four

residential units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 empowers the Minister to restore in his

discretion any permission cancelled upon such

conditions, as he sees fit to impose. It is

necessary to make the Act operative as from the

11th day of September last year. This is so

provided in clause 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, I have from time to

time  sought  the  approval of  this  House  under

section 4 of the Foreshores Act for the Government

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



construct public works along the fore-shore or in

the sea-bed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4 of the Act as it now stands requires

Government to seek the approval of Parliament  for

the  reclamation of the foreshores or  sea-bed  as

well  as  for  the construction of  public  works,

including   wharves   or   jetties,   along    the

foreshores.  In order to expedite the construction

of  public  works, the Bill now before this  House

seeks  to  amend section 4 of the  Act  to  enable

Government  to construct such public  works  along

the  foreshores  or  in the  sea-bed  without  the

necessity of seeking approval of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to authorise the Government

to reclaim the foreshore or sea-bed without having

to  seek the prior approval of this House  if  the

area to be reclaimed does not exceed 20 acres  or,

if the area to be reclaimed is within port limits,

10 acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill further seeks to delete paragraph (b) of

subsection  (4)  of section 9  of  the  Act  which

implies  into a lease of the foreshore or  sea-bed

certain covenants and provisos with regard to  the

construction and use of any works to  be  made  or

done   thereon.  It  is  considered   that   these

covenants  are  not  necessary  in  the  light  of

present-day requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken to amend subsection (6)

of section 3 of the Act to provide that section 3,

which imposes restrictions on the construction  of

sea and river walls and buildings on the banks  of

any port, river or channel, shall not apply to any

statutory   body   as   the   Minister   may,   by

notification in the Gazette, appoint.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members of the House will recall that

in my Budget Speech early this year, among the tax

concessions  which I announced  was  one  for  the

relief  from  estate  duty  by  a  combination  of

exemption  and  remission.  The  reasons  for  the

relief were explained fully at that time and I  do

not, therefore, propose to repeat them here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only say that this Bill seeks to provide

the  relief announced by amending the Estate  Duty

Act  (Chapter 137 of the Revised Edition)  to  set

higher  limits  of  exemption of  estate  duty  at

$50,000  of  the  principal value  of  the  estate

passing on or after 1st April, 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that a Remission Order will be

made  also  to  take  effect  on  the  same  date,

remitting estate duty at a progressively declining

rate,  by 10 per cent for every $20,000 in  excess

of the principal value of $50,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends subsection (1) (g) of section 6

of  the principal Act to provide for assessment of

an  estate  passing on or after 9th August,  1965,

and  before  1st  April, 1974,  at  the  graduated

scales  set  forth in the Fifth  Schedule  to  the

principal  Act. It also adds a new subsection  (1)

(h)  to  provide for the assessment of  an  estate

passing on or after 1st April, 1974, at the  rates

given in the Eighth Schedule to this Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 makes an amendment to the Fifth Schedule

so  that  in the case of an estate passing  before

1st  April, 1974, the estate duty rates  given  in

this Schedule shall continue to apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 introduces the new Eighth Schedule which

provides for exemption of estate duty on the first

$50,000 of the principal value of the estate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Customs Act (Chapter

133  of  the  Revised Edition) to  strengthen  and

improve  customs  enforcement  and  administrative

procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to amend section 18 of the Customs

Act  to  empower  the Comptroller  of  Customs  to

refund  composition fines which have been overpaid

or  erroneously paid. At present, all applications

for  such  refunds  have to  be  referred  to  the

Minister  for Finance. This amendment is  intended

to facilitate administrative procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 proposes to amend section 20 of the

Customs Act to render customs duty payable at  the

time  instead of, as presently provided,  "on  the

day"  of  the  removal of the goods  from  customs

control.  The  amendment  is  intended  to  enable

immediate changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



of  duty to be imposed at any time of the day, for

example, at 3 p.m, instead of only at midnight, so

that   the   revised  rates  will  be  immediately

effective upon removal or release of the goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21(8) (c) of the Customs Act provides

that  the rate of exchange for assessing the  duty

on  imports shall be based on the rate existing at

the  time  the goods are removed from a Government

warehouse, licensed factory warehouse or  licensed

warehouse.  Clause  5  substitutes  for   this   a

provision merely that the rate of exchange for the

assessment of import duty shall be the rate at the

time  customs  duty  is paid.  This  amendment  is

introduced  as,  in  practice, goods  are  removed

often  not from licensed warehouses but  from  the

Free  Trade Zone or at the point of entry such  as

Woodlands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Act at present is deficient in

provisions  for  the  control and  supervision  of

dutiable   goods   in   transit.   Despite    this

limitation,  Customs  has  exercised  control   by

requesting ships which call at the port to  supply

lists  of  such goods. Clauses 6,  7,  10  and  12

propose to amend sections 29, 34, 39 and 43 of the

Customs   Act  respectively  to  give  legislative

sanction  to  the  existing  practice  in  customs

control  and  supervision  of  dutiable  goods  in

transit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 seeks also to amend section 40 of the

Customs  Act to empower the Comptroller of Customs

to  hold the master, owner or agent of the vessel,

or  the pilot, owner or agent of the aircraft,  or

the   station   master  of   a   railway   station

responsible  for  dutiable goods  found  short  or

missing on board a vessel, aircraft or train. This

is  intended  to  prevent smuggling  and  to  make

masters  of  vessels more cautious when  endorsing

manifests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 proposes to amend section 61 of the

Customs Act to ensure that a licence is taken  out

before  intoxicating liquors imported in bulk  are

bottled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing provisions in the Customs Act do not

require  a wholesaler to obtain a licence to  sell

beer or a retailer who sells beer in bottles which

have  not  been  opened from Customs  control  for

consumption elsewhere than at the place  of  sale.

In  practice,  consumption often  takes  place  at

retail beer shop premises. Clauses 16, 17, 18  and

19 therefore seek to amend sections 64, 65, 67 and

70   respectively  of  the  Act  to  provide   for

licensing the sale of beer by wholesale or retail.

A  licence  will now be issued only  when  health,

police and customs requirements are met. This will

enable a more meaningful and manageable control to

be exercised over the licensees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 22, section 84 of the Customs Act is

amended  to empower the proper officer of  customs

to require a person to give information or produce

documents   at  a  specified  customs  office   or

station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 seeks to amend section 91 of the Act to

enable  the Comptroller of Customs to charge  such

fees  as  may  be appropriate for  the  supply  of

customs documents or for rendering services to the

public.  These  services include  supervising  the

operations in a factory or warehouse, attending to

the  destruction of dutiable goods, and overseeing

the  packing and sealing of cases and packages  of

duty-paid  goods for re-export under the draw-back

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, at present, no provision for customs

officers  to  search  premises  of  importers  for

documents  in  connection with  under-declarations

and  revenue  evasion.  As such  searches  are  an

essential  part of Customs preventive and  revenue

evasion work, it is proposed in clause 24 to amend

section  94  of  the Customs Act  to  specifically

empower  customs officers to search  premises  for

this purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of the new section 99A under clause

27  is to legalise the setting up of road barriers

by  customs officers in the course of their  duty.

This provision is to protect customs officers from

any  claims arising out of any accident caused  by

these road barriers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 28, a new section 109A is included

to  provide  that  any report  from  a  Government

chemist  on  any  matter  submitted  to  him   for

examination may be used as prima facie evidence by

the  prosecution in any proceedings for an offence

under the Customs Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum fine for making incorrect

declarations or falsifying documents  as  provided

under  section 119 of the Customs Act  is  $5,000.

Clause  30  seeks to increase this  limit  to  the

amount  of  Customs  duty  payable,  if  the  duty

exceeds  $5,000.  It  also seeks  to  make  it  an

offence  for  any  person  to  omit  any  material

particulars in a Customs declaration which  he  is

required to disclose. The proposed amendments  are

aimed at deterring evasion of customs duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Customs Department has to rely on

the Police for action under the Minor Offences Act

against  persons  who  abuse  its  officers.   The

penalty  as  provided in the Act  is  a  fine  not

exceeding  $50.  Clause  31  proposes  to  empower

Customs  to deal with such an offence, and  clause

32  increases the penalty from $2,000  to  $3,000.

This  will  enable Customs to prosecute  offenders

expeditiously and is intended to be  an  effective

deterrent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are either consequential or

are designed to tidy up procedural matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning the development of the Jurong

industrial  estate,  the aim of  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  is to see it evolving  into  a  self-contained new town. As part of the plan,  low-cost

flats  have, therefore, been built so that workers

may stay near their places of work. So far, 14,440

units have been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with Government's policy to encourage

home  ownership, the JTC has been selling some  of

its  low-cost flats since December, 1969. To-date,

3,461 units have been sold. It is hoped that  such

sales   will  encourage  more  workers  to  settle

permanently  in  Jurong  and  that  there   would,

therefore,  be  added stability to  the  workforce

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JTC sale of flats has been on terms and

conditions similar to those applied by the Housing

and  Development  Board,  and  elaborated  in  new

sections  36  to 47 introduced under clause  7  of

this  Bill.  Under  these  terms  and  conditions,

strict   conditions  to  prevent  flats  sold   on

instalments  from  falling  into  the   hands   of

speculators and profiteers have been imposed. Such

stringent conditions apply also to executive flats

built in Jurong for middle management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flats may be sold only to those buying for their

own  occupation and owning, by themselves or their

spouses,  no  other residential property.  A  flat

purchased   on  false  pretences   will   not   be

registrable  and  will revert to  the  Corporation

without any refund of payments already made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the new sections as contained

in  clause 7 of the Bill also simplify formalities

for  registration of sale, mortgage and  discharge

required under the Registration of Deeds and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



Land  Titles  Acts.  These  provisions  will  help

purchasers,  who would otherwise be  put  to  some

inconvenience and high legal costs.  Transfers  on

the  death of the owner will normally be  allowed.

However,   should  the  Corporation  refuse   such

consent,  it is required to buy the flat back.  If

the   price   offered   is   considered   to    be

unsatisfactory, the party involved may  appeal  to

the Minister, whose decision shall be final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is empowered to require owners of

flats  to form management corporations to maintain

their  flats.  If the Corporation's  direction  in

this  regard  is  ignored, it  may  authorise  any

company  to  exercise  the functions,  duties  and

powers   of   a   management   corporation.    The

Corporation  may  also  perform  these   functions

itself.   The   costs  of  such   management   and

maintenance services will have to be met  by  flat

owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has also been taken in this Bill to

make   other   amendments  to  the   Jurong   Town

Corporation Act. The present membership of  15  is

considered unwieldy and is to be reduced to  nine,

including  the  Chairman and the Deputy  Chairman.

The   quorum  required  for  a  meeting   of   the

Corporation is accordingly reduced from  eight  to

five members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 4, the Corporation's functions are

extended so that in the sale of its flats  it  may

provide loans on mortgage at such interest as  may

be prescribed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 repeals sections 20 to 23 of the

principal Act. It also re-enacts, with amendments,

parts  of  section  20  of the  principal  Act  by

placing the responsibility of keeping the accounts

of  the  Corporation in a Chief Financial  Officer

instead  of a Financial Officer. This is necessary

because  of  the redesignation of  the  post.  The

amended  section  20  also  sets  out  the   other

responsibilities of the Chief Financial Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New provisions relating to the appointment and

powers of the Corporation's auditor have also been

introduced. The Chief Financial Officer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



is  also  required to prepare and submit  annually

financial statements to the Corporation's  auditor

who shall audit and report on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further new provisions are introduced under

clause  5 requiring the submission to the Minister

of  annual financial statements and a copy of  any

report made by the auditor which the Minister will

present  to  Parliament.  Provision  is  made  for

scrutiny  of  these reports by the Auditor-General

at  the  same  time as they are submitted  to  the

Minister, where the Auditor-General has  not  been

appointed to be the auditor of the Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill repeals sections 29 and 30

and  re-enacts  section 29 which  deals  with  the

submission of the Corporation's Annual  Report  to

the  Minister by the 31st of March each  year  and

the  submission of the Report by the  Minister  to

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 2 by introducing a

definition of a "flat" which has hitherto not been

defined in the principal Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir,

I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Loan Act, 1972 (No. 6 of 1972),

authorises a sum of $2,000 million to be raised by

way  of  loan  for the purposes of the Development

Fund. To date, a total of $1,585 million has  been

raised under the provisions of the Act, leaving  a

balance   of  $415  million  only  to  be  raised.

Although the Government will continue to  seek  as

much in the way of external loans as possible from

the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the

international  money markets to help  finance  its

development  programme, the need  will  remain  to

mobilise domestic resources by the issue of  local

stock or bonds. In order to meet the needs of  our

development  financing, it is possible  that  more

than $5,000 million may have to be raised over the

next five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which is now before the House is

necessary as new legislation since the Development

Loan  Act,  1972,  cannot be suitably  amended  to

increase  the  amount of loans to be  raised.  The

Bill  follows substantially the provisions of  the

Development  Loan  Act,  1972,  except  that   the

maximum sum to be raised under the Bill is  $5,000

million  instead  of  $2,000  million  under   the

Development Loan Act, 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have only

two  points  to  raise. The first point  is  this.

According to the Explanatory Statement,  the  cost

of  servicing the loan will amount to something in

the  region of $675 million per annum. That  works

out  to  13.5 per cent of the principal sum.  This

appears  to  me to be rather high. I  wonder  what

sort  of investments we are going to put our money

into,  and  whether the returns will be sufficient

to cover what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



appears to be a rather high cost of servicing  the

loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that, as notice of the Third

Reading  of the Bill has been given, there  was  a

press  report  of Government's intention  to  pass

this  Bill. I think it did cause quite  a  bit  of

alarm  publicly  -  that this is possibly  another

measure  to further squeeze local credit. But  the

Minister has just indicated that this amount could

be raised in the course of the next five years.  I

am  just wondering whether this, in fact, would be

used as a sort of a credit squeeze measure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the

Member  for  Jalan Kayu and this  House  that  the

intention of the Development Loan Bill is  not  to

impose  a  credit squeeze upon the economy.  I  am

quite  aware that there has been some  anxiety  in

the  past, whether or not this Bill, in fact,  has

that intention. But this Bill is quite clearly  of

the same nature as the Development Loan Act, 1972,

which  enables  us to raise money for  development

purposes.  The idea is that we will  require  this

amount of $5,000 million over the next five  years

on  the basis that we will want to keep the growth

rate  of the Singapore economy at over 10 per cent

per  annum,  which I hope it will be  possible  to

achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point has been raised that the cost of

servicing  is on the high side. 1 should  like  to

explain  that this includes not only interest  but

also  repayment of capital. Most of our loans  are

of  five years' duration and also of longer terms,

so  that  if the interest rate is of the order  of

six  or  seven per cent, then the balance is  only

about  six  or  seven per cent which represents  a

repayment of capital over the period of the loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL POLICE CADET CORPS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Cadet Corps movement was established

in  1961  when the Police Cadet Corps Act (Chapter

77  of  the  Revised Edition) came into operation,

under  the  auspices  of  the  Ministry  of   Home

Affairs. In 1963, the responsibility for  all  the

four  cadet corps, namely, the Police,  Army,  Sea

and  Air  Cadet  Corps,  was  transferred  to  the

Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Singapore became an independent nation in

1965,  the  need to expand the cadet  movement  in

schools  to revitalise and re-orientate our  youth

in  schools  became  a  matter  of  necessity  and

urgency.  Members may recall that when moving  the

Second Reading of the National Cadet Corps Bill in

November, 1972, it was indicated that steps  would

be  taken to update the Police Cadet Corps Act  to

bring  it in line with the main provisions of  the

National  Cadet  Corps Act.  Hence  this  National

Police Cadet Corps Bill before this House today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This updating of the Police Cadet Corps Act to

place it on the same footing as the National Cadet

Corps is necessary in the interest of the Corps as

both   these  organisations  are  playing  equally

important  roles in imbuing their members  with  a

sense  of  loyalty  for  the  establishment  of  a

national identity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the updating of the Police Cadet

Corps  Act  is  necessary to remove  the  existing

anomaly  where there appears to be a dual  control

of  the  organisation  by  both  the  Ministry  of

Education and the Police. The establishment  of  a

Council,  with three nominees of the  Commissioner

of  Police  as members, one of whom shall  be  the

Deputy Chairman, will enable the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



Police  to continue to play an equally significant

role  in  the  administration and control  of  the

Corps  as  has been hitherto the case.  And  quite

rightly  it  should  be so,  as  the  Police  will

continue   to  provide  manpower,  logistics   and

training  support  for  the  furtherance  of   the

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the National Police Cadet

Corps Bill, the Corps will gain in status, stature

and  strength and will no doubt continue to strive

for  better  service to our youth and  attain  its

aims at their highest level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reasons for the Bill are to be found in

the recital in the Bill itself. The Bill seeks  to

incorporate the Titular Roman Catholic  Archbishop

of Singapore as a body corporate with perpetual

succession and a corporate seal and with powers to

acquire, hold and dispose of movable and immovable

property,  to sue and be sued and to  perform  all

such  acts and things as bodies corporate  may  by

law perform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will vest in the corporation all the

movable   and  immovable  properties  situate   in

Singapore  which were conveyed or assigned  to  or

vested  in  The Titular Roman Catholic  Bishop  of

Malacca  incorporated  under  the  Roman  Catholic

Bishop   Ordinance  (Chapter  314  of   the   1955

Edition).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will repeal the said Roman Catholic

Bishop  Ordinance and also make provision for  the

transfer   of   the   rights,   obligations    and

liabilities  of The Titular Roman Catholic  Bishop

of Malacca to the corporation.

Kechil and Pulau Bukom Besar as shown coloured blue, brown (marked `Q', `R', `5',

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Messrs. Shell Eastern Petroleum (Pte) Ltd.

is  embarking on a $600 million expansion  project

at  Pulau Bukom Besar and Pulau Bukom Kechil.  The

project provides, inter alia, for the construction

of  a  Chemical  Complex to  manufacture  aromatic

chemicals,   i.e, benzene,  toulene  and   xylene

together  with storage and loading facilities.  It

will be undertaken in two phases over a period  of

three  years and is expected to provide employment

for  some  3,000  workers and on  its  completion,

permanent employment to some 200 persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the magnitude of the proposed complex and

the   limited  land  area  available  on  the  two

islands,  it  is proposed to reclaim approximately 77.70  acres  around Pulau Ular as shown  coloured

orange and marked `Z' on the plan marked as  "LAND OFFICE  REXCLAMATION PLAN NO.  4/74",  a  copy  of

which  is  displayed in the Library of this  House

for  the information of hon. Members. Pulau  Ular,

located  north-west  of  Pulau  Bukom  Besar,   is

actually a submerged reef with two visible  islets

as  shown coloured green on the plan. One-third of

the  fill  for this reclamation will  be  obtained

from  hillocks  in  Pulau Bukom Besar  whilst  the

remaining  two-thirds and granite blocks  will  be

obtained  from Pulau Ubin. The reclamation,  which

is  scheduled to commence in mid-1975  and  to  be

completed  in January, 1978, is expected  to  cost

about  $15 million. Ancillary to this reclamation,

three  fore-shore structures - a bridge connecting

Pulau  Ular  with Pulau Bukom Besar, `a  jetty  to

berth  tankers at the northern end of  Pulau  Ular

and  a  material ramp will be constructed at Pulau

Ular. These structures are shown coloured blue  on

the plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the recommendation of the Head, Anti-Pollution

Unit,   an  impounding  basin  to  provide   anti-pollution  measures on both Pulau Bukom Besar  and

Pulau Bukom Kechil (in view of the large crude oil

storage capacity on these islands) was constructed

on an urgent basis in Pulau Bukom Kechil by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



reclaiming about 20.60 acres of the fore-shore and

seabed  at the island as shown coloured  pink  and

marked  `P'  on  the plan. It is now  proposed  to

reclaim  another 28.04 acres of the foreshore  and

seabed  at  Pulau Bukom Kechil as  shown  coloured

grey  and  marked `Y' on the plan  for  siting  of

additional  oil  tanks. Fill for this  reclamation

will  be  obtained  from site clearings  on  Pulau

Bukom  Besar. The reclamation which will  commence

at  the end of this year is expected to take about

a  year  to complete at an estimated cost of  $2.2

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, due to the need to provide

urgently  essential ancillaries  to  the  refinery

operations,   the   following   structures    were

constructed  on  Pulau Bukom Besar  without  first

obtaining  Parliamentary approval under section  4

of the Foreshores Act: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Vehicle Landing Ramp (marked `Q' on the plan);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Pipe tracks from Wharf 3 to Wharf 6 (marked `T');



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Second Bridge between Pulau Bukom Besar and Pulau Bukom Kechil (marked `R');



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Materials Jetty Landing Ramp (marked `S').



<br>Covering approval of this House is now sought  for

the construction of these structures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, the reclaimed

land   will  be  proclaimed  as  State  land   and

alienated to Shell on terms and conditions  to  be

agreed with the Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4  of  the  Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves

the reclamation of those portions of the foreshore

and  swampland  at Pasir Panjang  Road/West  Coast

Road  containing an approximate area of  98  acres

and  122 acres respectively as shown edged red  on

the  plan marked as " LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN

NO.  5/74", which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may recall, Sir, that the reclamation of

about 228 acres of foreshore at Pasir Panjang  has

so  far been approved by this House. A plan marked

as  "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 5/74", which

is  displayed in the Library of this House for the

information  of  hon. Members, shows  the  various

phases of the reclamation. As an extension of this

reclamation, the Housing and Development Board now

proposes  to  reclaim  another  98  acres  of  the

foreshore  and  122  acres of swampland  at  Pasir

Panjang  Road/West Coast Road  8 1/2  m.s, as  shown

edged  red on the plan. The proposal will complete

the plan for reclamation at Pasir Panjang and link

it   up   with   Jurong  Town  Corporation's   own

reclamation  at  Jurong. It will also  enable  the

early  construction of a new coastal road  linking

Pasir Panjang Road at about 5 1/2 ms, to Jurong.  The

proposed reclamation is estimated to cost about $7

million including earth works, and will be carried

out in late 1974 or early next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



year  in conjunction with the proposed development

of  the  Clementi  New Town to  the  north,  using

surplus  earth  therefrom as fill.  The  reclaimed

area  north  of  the  proposed coastal  road  will

probably be used for public housing as part of the

Clementi New Town, while that to the south between

the  coastal  road  and  the  new  foreshore  will

probably be used for marine industries or for port

use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the final use of the reclaimed land will

be  decided by the Master Plan Committee after all

claims  of  the  relevant  authorities  have  been

studied.  Clearance  and  resettlement  of   those

affected  by  the  proposed  reclamation  will  be

undertaken  by  the  Resettlement  Department   in

accordance with its current policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4  of  the  Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves

the reclamation of those portions of the foreshore
