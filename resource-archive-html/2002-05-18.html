<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [17th May, 2002],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Yeo Guat Kwang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, first, I want

to  take  up what the Manpower Minister said yesterday  about

the proposed CPF cut for workers above 40.  He argued that it

should  not be viewed as introducing age discrimination.   He

pointed out, rightly, that the CPF rate for workers above  55

was already lower than the rate for younger workers.  This is

true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if I recall correctly, the main reason why the CPF

rate  was  lowered  for  workers above  55  was  because  the

Government wanted to extend the retirement age from 55 to 60,

and  then  to  62.  It would be raised to 67 eventually.   At

that  time,  55 is considered the age when all workers  would

stop  work  and  retire, with zero employment  income.   And,

therefore,  it is at this age that they can start withdrawing

from  their  CPF for retirement purposes.  In  this  context,

reducing  the  employer's  CPF rate  to  keep  these  workers

employed past



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



55  was  considered  reasonable,  and  does  not  offend  our

sensibilities.   But this is not the case for  workers  below

55.   Many  in their 40s are still in their prime, and  still

saving  for their retirement years.  To cut the CPF  rate  of

workers between 40 and 55 is to send the unintended signal to

the  market  that this group of workers can be  discriminated

against.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many unemployed people above 40 say that they find

it  very  hard  to  re-enter the job market  because  of  age

discrimination at the hiring process.  This is a very serious

issue  for  middle-aged  and older workers,  a  barrier  that

cannot  be  removed  simply  by  offering  more  job-matching

schemes  or excellent training programmes.  Older job seekers

who  cannot find work because their wage expectations are too

high  can learn to reduce their expectations.  Those who lack

the  required  skills can retrain.  In both cases,  they  can

adapt  and  find  work.  But in the case of an  age  barrier,

older  job  seekers have no recourse, no matter  how  willing

they are to adapt.  If this problem is not addressed, it will

become  even more severe in time, as our population continues

to age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just last week, an employer came to see me to seek

my  help  in  getting 20 work permits for foreign workers  to

work  at his food stalls all around the island.  He asked  me

to  write  to the Ministry of Manpower.  I dutifully  did  so

but,  at the same time, I also grilled him about why  he  did

not  employ Singaporeans who are out of work.  I told  him  I

have  many  residents who do not have a job and asked  if  he

would consider them.  I asked him what were the criteria  for

the job.  Is there an age limit?  He said, yes, below 45.  He

said that frying over a wok requires a lot of energy.  I  was

not  persuaded.  It so happened that the very  next  resident

who came to see me was looking for a job, any job.  He looked

strong,  he is able, but he is 48.  I dashed out  of  my  MPS

office,  grabbed the employer, who was on his  way  out,  and

made him give an on-the-spot interview to this resident.  The

employer was not obliged to hire this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



older  worker, but I think I registered my point with  him  - older Singaporeans should be given an equal shot at the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth will not take care of the situation

completely,  as  it has to do with employers' perceptions  of

the  elderly.  And it is particularly during a downturn  that

older  workers need extra protection.  Is there  a  mechanism

for  the Ministry to ensure that employers who apply for work

permits do so only after they have trawled from MOM's bank of

jobless  workers who can do the same job?  It  is  true  that

even  this  will not mean that older workers will  be  hired.

But  it  will send a strong signal to employers that we  take

seriously  our  mission  of creating jobs  for  Singaporeans.

This  is  not to discourage employers from hiring  foreigners

that  they need to run their businesses.  Rather,  it  is  to

encourage them to give Singaporeans an equal chance to get  a

job.  There is a difference in nuance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister earlier said that the Ministry had received

only  a  few  complaints  from older  workers  regarding  age

discrimination.   He said that in 2000 and 2001,  there  were

four and five complaints respectively.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time is running out, Ms Ng.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  how  these cases were resolved.  The  only  way  to

fight age discrimination, short of legislating it, is to make

clear that our labour mechanisms do not tolerate bias against

older workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, there are many

advantages  of flexible work arrangements.  Through  flexible

work arrangements and flexible working hours, other than pro-family   and   enhancing   the   employees'   welfare,   more

importantly,  such arrangements can actually  strengthen  the

company's competitiveness and workers' employability.  On the

part  of  employers, however, it seems that they are  pushing

for  flexibility  more on the basis of cost  savings.   As  a

labour  MP, my view is that, while there may be cost savings,

they need not necessarily come from wage cost.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good example is ST Aerospace. ST Aerospace had,

with  the  endorsement of the MOM, implemented  a  scheme  of

compensatory time-off.  The exercise involved the union  very

early in the development.  It also incorporated safeguards to

check  against abuse, eg, half yearly reviews to see  if  the

scheme  could be improved further.  At the same  time,  there

was ample communication to ensure that all workers understood

the  implications  of  the changes.  Under  the  scheme,  the

company  releases  employees on full pay when  they  are  not

needed  at work.  These employees make up the credited  hours

and time off from their future overtime. The workers continue

to receive regular pay while having flexibility in their time

schedules  and enjoy more leisure time.  The company  is  now

able   to   improve  its  competitiveness,  with  a  manpower

deployment plan that was more aligned with the job  schedule.

This  enabled  it to free up its resources so that  it  could

garner more jobs.  The gains in profits arising from this new

arrangement were also shared amongst the staff.  I  am  aware

that  KK Hospital is another good example that also has  good

flexible work arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, todate, the examples I have cited are the

exceptions rather than the norm.  Does the Ministry have  any

plan to amend the legislation to facilitate greater workforce

flexibility?  I urge the Ministry of Manpower to do  more  to

encourage  companies  to  adopt flexible  work  patterns  and

flexible working hour arrangements that will strengthen their

competitiveness  and  enhance their employees'  employability

and welfare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement will support flexi-work

arrangements,  provided  certain fundamental  principles  are

adhered  to.  For example, it should not solely  be  a  cost-cutting  measure.   Rather, it should make the  company  more

productive and the gains must be shared with the workers.  We

do  not  want  to  see a significant swing  in  the  workers'

income.   Clear guidelines must also be given.   I  urge  the

Ministry  of  Manpower to do more to encourage  companies  to

adopt flexible work patterns and flexible working hours  that

will strengthen their competitiveness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, over the last few

days,  we  have  heard quite a number of  points  made  about

workers being fussy about jobs.  Yesterday, the Minister said

that  there  are  jobs in the marine and hotel  sectors,  for

instance, but there are no takers because workers are  fussy.

That  may be one perspective.  On the other hand, I  want  to

offer  another perspective, ie, basically, it is the way  the

jobs are designed that makes it very difficult for workers to

work  in  these sectors.  We seriously need to look  at  this

area  of how to redesign jobs for three reasons: one, is  the

aging  workforce; second, the negative image of some sectors;

and, third, the need for flexibility to accommodate different

life cycle needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just elaborate on the first point, ie, the

problem  of  an aging workforce.  If we were to look  at  the

median  age of workers, we will notice that it has  increased

from 33.6 years in 1991 to 37.8 in 2001.  The pool of workers

aged  40 years and above has also increased by 90%, from  31%

in  1991  to  43% in 2001.  Clearly, if jobs are still  being

structured and designed in a way that only take care  of  the

needs of a younger workforce, the older workers will find  it

very difficult to do the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example of a resident who came to see me.

She is in her 50s and she is working in a hospital.  She told

me  that her job involves having to take care of 7-8 patients

in a day, cleaning them up and bathing them.  She feels that,

very  soon, she will not be able to do that job and she  will

be  sacked,  because she will not be able to  perform  up  to

standard, as it is a very physically demanding job.   In  the

course of my work, I also came to know of another worker  who

works in a factory producing TV mainframes.  Her job requires

her  to  move  the  mainframe from one workbench  to  another

workbench  for  a  minimum period of eight  hours.   She  had

worked for 10 years, and she said that she does not think she

can continue working in that way anymore, because it requires

her  to  stand and to carry these heavy mainframes  from  one

workbench to another.  She is really looking forward  to  the

day when she gets retrenched and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



gets her retrenchment benefits, and she can take a break  and

look for a lighter job more suited for her age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not believe that such jobs cannot be

redesigned to make it easier for people to work.   If  we  do

not  look  at this issue, and then we make it very  difficult

for  Singaporeans to work and allow employers to tap into  an

everlasting pool of young foreign workers, there will  be  no

incentives  for them to redesign jobs to meet  the  needs  of

older Singaporean workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of image, this is a serious problem

because, if we were to look at jobs in the marine sector,  it

is  usually categorised as jobs that attract the three  Ds  - demanding,  dangerous and also dirty.  Sir,  I  do  not  know

whether any Member in this House has gone to a shipyard.  But

if  you  have gone to a shipyard, you will really  understand

what  working in a shipyard means in the marine sector.   Can

we  imagine a worker coming for a job interview in a shipyard

and, for the first time, looking at the work in the shipyard?

Most  definitely,  the worker will get  very  frightened  and

worried.   So  there  is clearly a need for  us  to  try  and

improve  the image of jobs in these sectors which workers  do

not  find  attractive at all.  For instance, we can say  that

the   safety  record  in  the  marine  sector  has   improved

considerably, so there is no fear for people to work  in  the

shipyards.  Safety is taken care of.  There could also be  an

orientation programme, etc, to get them acclimatised to  work

in  a shipyard.  We really have to do a lot more in order  to

enhance the image of jobs in these sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is about flexibility - flexibility to

take   into   account  the  needs  of  people  in   different

lifecycles.   We  have heard what the Deputy  Prime  Minister

said  a  few  days  ago.  He said that we  are  very  much  a

patriarchal society.  Women have to perform certain tasks and

we  see a lot of women staying at home.  But there are  still

many  women who want to come out to work.  As the jobs become

more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



intermittent  and there is less job security,  we  will  find

that  a lot more women will have to come out to work in order

to  supplement the family income.  If we look at  the  survey

done by the Ministry of Manpower about two years ago, it says

that  40% of those women who wanted to go back to work  could

not go back to work because they said that there was just not

enough part-time work.  That means that if there is more part-time work available, then, obviously, they would want to come

out  to  work.  And it is not just a question of them  coming

out to work in order that they can buy more ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, could you complete your

third point, please?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> My point is that there must be a

definite  attempt and there must be serious efforts  made  to

redesign jobs.  And we need to redesign jobs to take care  of

these  three  areas:  one, the aging  workforce;  second,  to

redesign jobs to take care of the poor image in some sectors;

and, third, to redesign jobs to enable more women to get into

the  labour  market and, therefore, to supplement the  family

income.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, workers are badly affected when

they  are  retrenched.  To help them tide  over  a  difficult

situation, it is necessary to give the affected workers  some

form  of  retrenchment benefits.  Recently, our  retrenchment

benefit  system  has  come  under scrutiny.   Are  there  any

weaknesses  with the present system?  I think the  answer  is

yes,  there are.  While the law states that those  with  more

than   three   years   of  service  can  claim   retrenchment

compensation,  the  payment  of  such  compensation  is   not

mandatory,  neither is the sum.  Indeed,  we  know  of  cases

where  workers  are retrenched without compensation  in  non-unionised companies.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system is unfunded, which means no funds are

set aside for retrenchment.  When the time comes, the company

looks for money to pay for these retrenchment benefits.  This

causes a drain on the company's financial resources, and even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



endangers the jobs of the remaining workers. For example,  it

is   possible  that  a  company  is  able  to  pay  all   the

retrenchment benefits to the workers who are laid off  first,

but  yet  still  finds  that  it is  not  viable  and  ceases

operation.  The workers who remain after the first  round  of

retrenchment, who may be the better lot, end up with  nothing

at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, as business cycles become shorter, if we stick

to  the  approach that workers with less than three years  of

service  are not entitled to claim any retrenchment  benefits

at all, we will have problems because there will be more such

workers  who are under this category, as the job market  will

get more volatile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible suggestion put forward by some of the union

leaders  is an enhanced bonus system.  Under the system,  the

employers and employees put aside a certain amount of  money,

say,  from the performance bonuses when the company is  still

doing  well and in good health.  The money is vested in their

employees' names over a period of time.  It could be  in  the

form  of  unit  trust.  Over the years, it will be  gradually

built  up. Then, when the worker is retrenched, the fund  can

help the worker to tide over financially until he finds a new

job. Such an arrangement does not add to the financial burden

of  a  company during retrenchment, and it is portable.   The

fund can be built up as the worker moves from job to job.  In

the current system, service with a previous employer does not

count for retrenchment benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I - and I am sure many workers - would like to know the

Ministry's  thinking with regard to our current  retrenchment

benefits   system,  and  the  practices.  Does  the  Ministry

acknowledge   these  weaknesses?   What  is  the   Ministry's

thinking on how we are going to improve the system?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, it looks like the

days  of  full  employment  are  over.   Like  all  developed

economies,  we may have to accept that there will  always  be

some  form  of structural unemployment, because  there  is  a

mismatch between the skills of laid-off



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



workers and the skills requirements of new job openings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it has been forecasted by many economists that

the  longer  term natural rate of unemployment  in  Singapore

will  rise  to  about  4%-5%.  Sir, if  this  rate  stays  or

increases  in  the  long run, there could  be  an  increasing

burden on society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible way out is to look into having some form of

unemployment  insurance  for  workers  or  for  employees  in

general.   This would help the unemployed workers  tide  over

temporarily,  whilst  they  seek  retraining  or  alternative

employment.   Sir,  for the private sector  to  run  such  an

unemployment scheme alone without it being made compulsory by

law  for  all  employees may not be economically  viable,  as

there is a lack of economies of scale and the problem of what

is   often   called   in  the  insurance  industry   "adverse

selection",  in that only those most at risk  would  take  up

this  form  of  insurance.  Those who have relatively  secure

jobs, like in the civil service, would not take up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme could be similar to the concept of Medisave

or medical insurance where individuals may be mandated by law

to contribute, say, 2-3% of their CPF contribution towards an

unemployment insurance scheme.  Since all employees will have

to contribute on their account to this scheme, it can also be

administered  privately, instead  of  being  State  run.   An

unemployed  individual  may draw on these  balances  and  the

insurance  for a period of time to help him meet his  or  her

financial obligations during this period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could prevent abuse of the scheme by, say, tying

the  payment of unemployment benefits during this  period  to

skills  training or retraining and/or active job search.   In

this  way, we could avoid inadvertently promoting the welfare

state mentality and the disincentives to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see the introduction of this kind of unemployment

insurance as a possible extension of our CPF scheme,  ie,  to

expand the coverage of our social security to meet unforeseen

unemployment circumstances.  This is also in line with our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



plan to encourage greater self-sufficiency and responsibility

for individuals, whilst catering for a real and possible need

in  the  future,  in view of globalisation and  our  changing

domestic economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister if his

Ministry  has conducted any studies on unemployment insurance

and,  if so, whether he would consider introducing some  form

of  unemployment  insurance scheme, similar to  the  Medisave

scheme, through the CPF.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the global economic

slowdown  has played havoc with the lives of our  people.  As

several of my fellow hon. Members had earlier recounted, many

of  the  residents, like those of mine, lost their  jobs  and

came to seek our help to find another job, and to tide over a

very difficult and traumatic period in their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all of them were doing low-skilled work, a group

whose  plight many of my fellow colleagues have  focused  on.

Some  were  holding  skills  and technical  positions,  while

others held managerial positions. While their immediate needs

-  feeding their family and paying household bills are indeed

pressing  - what I am equally, in truth, more concerned  with

is  whether  the jobs that were lost would ever return,  even

when  the  economy recovers.  Some will never return,  having

permanently  migrated  from our shores.   New  jobs  will  be

created. But, at the same time, some skills would have become

redundant and obsolete.  How are our people going to cope  in

a world that has changed so abruptly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to join my fellow hon. colleagues to ask

the  Minister  the following questions.  How many  jobs  were

lost  since  2001 when the slowdown began?   If  we  were  to

classify the jobs that were lost as low-skilled, skilled  and

technical  and managerial, how many would there  be  in  each

category?   How  many  of the jobs that were  lost  are  lost

permanently?  What are the job prospects for this year?   How

many new jobs will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



created?  Finally, how many of the new jobs will be filled by

Singaporeans  or permanent residents?  What  is  holding  our

people from the rest of the new jobs?  What is being done  to

help our people to overcome the obstacles to these jobs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir,

providing  assistance to residents to look for  jobs  is  the

most  important  talk of the CDC at present.  Our  experience

shows  that  it is not an easy task.  Many are still  waiting

and  hoping  for  assistance but they are disappointed.   The

number  of those who are assisted has been increasing but  is

still  under 20%.  This is a serious problem and  MOM  should

continue  to  help with greater effort.  I  have  found  that

there are many more job mismatches than job matches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Mr Chairman, I would like to give

two examples that I had experienced.  A 45-year-old father of

two  school-going children used to receive a salary of $4,200

and  did  not  want any other job except in the manufacturing

sector.  We had suggested that he work in the IT sector  with

a  salary  of $3,500 but he refused because he said he  liked

the  experience  and the skill that he had  learnt  from  the

manufacturing  sector. The job that he had  lost  will  never

come back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person, an Eurasian who used to get $3,600 had

been  retrenched.  He tried to apply for many  jobs,  by  the

hundreds  but was not successful.  Finally, he said  that  he

was  a  victim  of discrimination because he  came  from  the

"others" group.  I have always heard many Malays saying  that

they  were discriminated against because of language or race,

but  this  is  the first time that I heard of a person  being

discriminated for being under "others".  Actually, he  had  a

colleague  at the same place, a Chinese, who did not  get  an

alternative  job.  I convinced him that his case  was  not  a

question  of  discrimination because his Chinese friend  also

faced the same problem.  Finally, he and his friend agreed to

attend  a  diploma course on Freight Management with  funding

under the Northeast CDC's surrogate scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still the problem of people being too choosy in

finding  jobs  but  there are still employers  who  are  also

choosy  in  selecting workers, especially those 45 years  and

above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chairman, in the past, you could still get

hawker  stalls.   Presently, there is no such opportunity  as

everything  is  done by tender.  The opportunity  to  open  a

stall  in the school canteen is also lesser. So what  is  the

fate  of such individuals?  It is true that the only way  out

is  to  go for training and retraining.  But I must say  that

this process takes a long time and it is a difficult task due

to  the mindset of the workers and the employers.  As we  try

to convince others to go for retraining, MOM should cooperate

with  ENV  to find out ways to provide new job opportunities,

which  include  hawking and setting up small  businesses  for

more  workers who have been retrenched and might be difficult

to be retrained in the short-term.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Sir, Members have expressed concern regarding the welfare of

our  workers especially in this downturn.  We also share this

concern.   Mr Hawazi was worried that employers, in  view  of

their  difficulties, might be quick on the  mark  to  dismiss

their  workforce.  Sir, the law, specifically the  Employment

Act,  protests  against unfair dismissal, and MOM  reiterates

that workers who have been unfairly dismissed or denied their

benefits  should  inform my Ministry.  We  will  investigate,

seek appropriate remedies and compensation.  Nevertheless, Mr

Hawazi  will  be heartened to note that unfair dismissals  in

the  last  three years, at least those reported to MOM,  were

stable - 32 last year, compared to 29 in the year 2000 and 33

the year before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked what about the plight of

retrenched  workers.   In this regard,  let  me  applaud  the

unions' efforts.  Our data shows that many retrenched workers

in   unionised  companies  were  paid  reasonable   sums   of

retrenchment  benefits,  while those who  were  non-unionised

were  reported  to  have received little or  no  retrenchment

benefits.  Mr Yeo suggests an enhanced bonus system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



where a proportion of the company's profits is put aside  and

built  up  over  the years to be utilised  when  workers  get

retrenched.  It is a good idea, but may be better  encouraged

on   a   voluntary  basis,  rather  than  through  Government

intervention.  Unions and employers could negotiate for  such

arrangements based on individual circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since employment will be more disruptive, should we

protect  and  provide even more in the form  of  unemployment

insurance,  as  suggested by Mr Chew Heng  Ching?   He  asked

whether  MOM  has studied this.  Yes.  Other  countries  that

have  instituted unemployment insurance have regretted  doing

so.   As  expected, there were abuses.  In Japan,  the  claim

rate  in  a recession is so overwhelming that the scheme  has

become  a severe financial burden to the state.  There  is  a

moral  hazard inherent in unemployment insurance.  In Canada,

'brunching'  occurs  - brunch, between breakfast  and  lunch.

Workers  abuse and game the system by working for the minimal

qualifying  period and then resign to claim the  unemployment

insurance   benefits.    The  well-intentioned   unemployment

insurance system deteriorates into unemployment handouts.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the counter argument of those who say that

having  seen  and  presumably learnt  from  the  mistakes  of

others, we can craft our own version to avoid the pitfalls by

tying  up  unemployment insurance with job search,  training,

etc.  This argument is enticing, but we should remain wary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds me of the latent alcoholic who rationalises

that  since  most alcoholics are addicted to hard liquor,  he

would  remain immune if he stuck to fine wines.   The  latent

alcoholic   would  be  quite  wrong,  and  with   devastating

consequences.  Once introduced, unemployment insurance  would

be  difficult  to roll back.  MOM's view is  that  we  should

avoid introducing unemployment insurance at present.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have quite rightly pointed out that we need to

enhance the employability of older workers.  I agree with  Mr

Seng  Han  Thong,  Ms  Irene Ng and Mdm  Ho  Geok  Choo  that

negative attitudes towards older workers are unwarranted  and

unjustified.   Mr  Seng remains puzzled  about  how  the  age

barrier  for a mature worker got shifted from 60 to  50,  and

now rests at 40 years old.  I am equally puzzled and I am not

sure  how the age 40 cropped out.  I thought perhaps  because

we  started our People-for-Jobs Traineeship at that age.  But

we  chose that age 40 barrier to compensate in part  for  the

seniority-based  wage system, where older  workers  found  it

harder  to  compete  with younger counterparts  commanding  a

lower  salary.  We certainly did not mean to send the message

that  at  40 your brains go ga-ga and your body goes goo-goo.

This myth flies against the face of reality where, as Mdm  Ho

and Ms Irene Ng rightly pointed out, many workers because  of

their  skill  sets, experience and networking, peak  at  that

age.   Sir, at this juncture I have to confess that I have  a

vested  interest in supporting this argument.  But I am  sure

that  if  I put the motion to this House that life begins  at

40, the ayes will have it.  Many here, who are above 40, will

confidently attest that they are better now than they were 10

years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more serious note, no single remedy will quite work

as  the difficulty for older workers finding re-employment is

multi-faceted.   To quote my Minister, there  is  "no  single

magic  bullet'  and  we  will have to approach  this  problem

holistically.   To alleviate the problem,  we  will  have  to

address  the issues relating to disparity in skills sets  and

the  seniority based wage system.  Ms Irene Ng asked:  should

we  move  by way of legislation?  Other countries which  have

tried  that  have realised that there were severe  rigidities

introduced, such that the overall pie shrank.  We do have  in

place,  for example, certain policies which actually  protect

against  age  discrimination.  I talked about this  yesterday

when  replying to Mdm Halimah in terms of anti-discriminatory

practices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong and Mr Seng suggest that we should further "ring

fence"  certain  public  sector contracts  or  vocations  for

locals,  or  tighten  foreign  manpower,  to  protect  mature

workers.   I would like to inform the House that our workers'

policy does have in place a dependency scheme.  If we use the

example  that Ms Irene Ng brought up, where one had to  apply

for  20  foreign  workers, he would have  to  hire  about  50

Singaporeans  in  order to get the 20  foreign  workers.   So

there  are  some measures in place.  Should we  further  ring

fence it?  Should we further tighten foreign worker policies?

It may solve one problem, but would create many more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we introduced the People-for-Jobs Traineeship

Programme.  As at April this year, about 2,000 workers  above

40  have jobs under this programme.  It is premature,  and  I

think  unwise,  in  this recession to judge  the  success  or

failure of any programme.  We will have to wait till when the

economy  recovers and with a tighter labour market  to  gauge

the level of discrimination against older workers and at what

age  that  discrimination is most apparent.  We will  monitor

the  situation closely and introduce more measures,  if  need

be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do though agree with Mr Seng and Mdm Halimah that we

should be looking at work redesign.  Some cited McDonalds  as

a  model  that others can emulate as to how they successfully

integrated a more mature workforce.  MOM is now working  with

SPRING to identify specific industries for redesigning  work,

whether it is for elderly or females.  We have been trying to

change  the  image  of  certain industries,  as  Mdm  Halimah

suggested, for example, in the marine industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that the solution to unemployment is a

vibrant  economy.   Can  we  facilitate  this  through   more

flexible  wage and work arrangements, asked Mr Gan,  Mr  Heng

and  Mr  Yeo.   I  think this is a more enlightened  path  to

pursue.  I agree with Mr Gan and Mr Heng that the CPF cut for

the  purpose of helping companies to reduce cost is  a  blunt

instrument.  The National Wages Council has recommended  that

the Monthly Variable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



Component  be  part  of  our wage  structure.   How  is  this

proceeding?    Some   34%   of   unionised   companies   have

implemented, but for non-unionised companies only  3.4%  have

implemented  this.   The current recession  has  impeded  the

progress of implementation.  The ERC is studying further ways

to enhance its progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM also agrees with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that greater

flexibility  in  work  arrangements  will  help  our  overall

competitiveness and increase jobs.  The ERC is  studying  the

issue  of  "Quarterly work hours scheme"  to  help  companies

adjust  to peaks and lulls due to seasonal demand.   We  will

study  this  carefully,  as he has advised,  to  ensure  that

workers'  interests and health are still  looked  after  with

respect to overtime, rest days and safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Dr Tan Boon Wan's specific queries, we

had  about 26,000 workers who were retrenched in 2001.  About

41%  were  production and related workers, another  39%  were

professionals,  managers  and  executives,   and   19%   were

clerical, sales and service workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to change mindsets. We will

continue  to help Singaporeans adjust.  This will take  time,

but our efforts will continue unimpeded.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, my question was not

answered,  whether there is a mechanism for the  Ministry  to

ensure that employers, who apply for work permits, do so only

after  they  have gone through MOM's bank of jobless  workers

who can do the job.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, it was indeed answered, and this is

the  question of ring fencing, however you call it.  In other

words,  can we introduce certain barriers before they applied

for work permits?  I said that if we did that, we could solve

one  problem, but probably create more problems.   There  are

other  mechanisms that we can use.  I think we will  want  to

move  slowly on that because, it will be onerous  on  certain

industries  and we might end up reducing the overall  pie  to

satisfy one sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister to let

me  know  how  many  of  the jobs that were  lost  were  lost

permanently,  because this is a reflection of the  structural

unemployment?  If the Minister does not have the figures now,

perhaps at some other time the figures could be released.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, certain sectors that have moved out

may  not  come  back.   For example, yesterday,  I  mentioned

Philips and Hitachi.  Certain production operations that have

moved  out  of Singapore may find it not cost competitive  to

come  back to Singapore.  The overall picture will take  time

to  emerge.  I think the lesson is that we have to be nimbler

and  respond to training, again the point that I  brought  up

yesterday.   We  will have to monitor the situation  and  see

which  skills  sets are more relevant and  help  our  workers

transit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, with the Minister's

indulgence, I asked a question about whether we can  look  at

those who are not trainable, and whether we can recreate some

of  the older jobs like small businesses and stalls, and  for

the  Ministry  of Manpower to work with the Ministry  of  the

Environment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, it is indeed an option that we have

explored.  The question is: can we create an informal  sector

formally?   We  have  gone through  the  arguments.   We  tie

ourselves in knots.  It will be a difficult exercise, but  we

will  continue  to  work on training,  trying  to  adapt  our

workers, trying to change some flexible work arrangements, to

increase  the  overall pie before we move  on  that.   It  is

something  that we want to look at, but we will  look  at  it

carefully.   It is not that we do not want to do it,  but  it

creates so many distortions that we are not sure how it  will

move.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, although

our  unemployment  rate has gone up, we  should  continue  to

attract and retain foreign talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of Warring Kingdoms, the Kingdom of

Yan often suffered defeats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



in  the hand of the Kingdom of Qi.  So the King of Yan  asked

his  cabinet minister, Guo Wei, how he could recruit  talents

to  help  build  up the country to fight the Kingdom  of  Qi.

Minister  Guo  Wei told him the story:  "Once  upon  a  time,

there was a King who wanted to find a horse which can race  a

thousand miles - Qian Li Ma.  When he heard of one such  Qian

Li  Ma, he quickly dispatched his most entrusted official  to

go and bid for it.  However, when the official reached there,

the  horse was dead but, nevertheless, he paid 500  taels  of

gold  to  buy the dead horse.  As expected, he got a scolding

when he went back to the King with a dead horse.  He replied,

"If  a dead horse could be worth 500 taels of gold, how about

a  live Qian Li Ma?"  True enough, when the news spread, many

Qian Li Mas were brought in front of the King.  King Yan Zhao

took the message and started treating his talents well and in

no time, his Kingdom was able to beat the Kingdom of Qi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking our Minister to go and buy a dead

horse.  However, we need international talents more than they

need us.  Talented human resources are globally mobile.  Even

China  is trying its best to woo back its outflow of talented

Chinese.  Our Malaysian neighbour is courting our talents  as

well.   I  understand  there  are a  number  of  Singaporeans

working in the tech park in Penang and elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with our current unemployment situation, we should

continue to attract them to Singapore, to enhance our limited

human  capital, and to treat them well.  This will  send  out

the right signal to the global talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must not stop here. For our country to

benefit maximally from these talents, we must help them  sink

roots and become an integral part of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans view foreign talents with mercenary

suspicion that they are here only for economic self-benefits.

I  believe some of them are.  But we are partly to be  blamed

if we deal with foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



talent  purely  on an economic basis.  That being  the  case,

when we pay well, they work for us.  When someone, somewhere,

pays better, they move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to retain them, we have to make them feel at home,

give  them  a  strong sense of belonging, and integrate  them

well into our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote the Prime Minister who said this

during the debate on Singapore 21 on 5th May 1999:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To sustain our economy and to let our society flourish,

we  need to import foreign talents and offer some of them  PR

and   citizenship.    Our   population   will   become   more

cosmopolitan.   The  city  will  become  more  international.

Newcomers every year have to be integrated into our  society.

We  have to create in them the same strong sense of belonging

to Singapore as the thoroughbred Singaporeans."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singaporeans working overseas miss our "char kway

teow" and "roti prata", our foreign colleagues here are human

too,  and miss the creature comforts, their friends  and  the

environment that they grew up with.  Therefore,  it  is  very

important to help them feel at home and feel as if  they  are

part of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has many things to offer. As a society, our

core  values  of  "meritocracy,  equal  opportunities,  clean

government  and racial/religious harmony" are  attractive  to

many of them, including our Senior Minister of State, Mr Khaw

Boon Wan and hon. Member, Ms Irene Ng.  This is the soft side

of selling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the practical aspect, we should make life easier for

them.   For  instance, I propose that the  Manpower  Ministry

could  perhaps  set  up a one-stop agency to  assist  foreign

talents  relocate.  The agency could help  in  the  following

areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Visa applications for spouse and dependants;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Housing problem; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Education for children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After helping them settle in, we could have a programme

to  systematically integrate them into our community such  as

joining in the grassroots activities.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



should also encourage them to join in national events such as

National  Day Parade.  For example, a contingent  of  foreign

talents  or  a performance by them would be a recognition  of

their  contribution  to Singapore and render  them  a  strong

sense of belonging.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): For

the  last  three  years, foreign workers have  made  a  great

contribution to our economy in sectors such as manufacturing,

shipbuilding,   the  health  service  and  the   construction

industry,  thus  playing a significant role in  our  economic

development and in enhancing our productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these workers go overseas to earn a living, they

invariably  have to cough up huge sums of money  to  pay  for

their  passage.   Some of them told me that a skilled  worker

has  to pay more than $10,000, while an unskilled worker  has

to  fork out at least $2,000, depending on which country they

come from.  Besides, when they leave their native villages to

go  to  a strange land to make a living, they have to  endure

much  emotional  trauma.   For  them,  this  is  an  enormous

challenge.  Hence, whenever I come across stories about their

being  swindled and cheated of their hard-earned  savings  by

unscrupulous persons here, I feel sorry for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, there have been a spate of newspaper

reports  about some unfortunate incidents which have happened

to  these  foreign workers.  Such reports are quite sensitive

and  will, in the long run, impair the image of our  country,

as  they would create the impression that it is not safe  for

foreigners  to come here to work and they would  be  unfairly

treated.   Currently, more than 600,000 foreign  workers  are

being  employed in Singapore, and only less than 1%  of  them

are  alleged  to  have been ill-treated by  their  employers.

Going  by  press reports, one would be misled to  think  that

employers  in Singapore are a bunch of immoral crooks.   This

is  far from the truth.  As a matter of fact, there are  many

good  employers who provide suitable accommodation, amenities

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



welfare  for their workers.  However, these go unreported  in

the media.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our press should make it a point to highlight such good

behaviour on the part of the employers and not lay out a  few

unscrupulous  and  unprincipled  employers  in   their   news

reports.  We have in our midst bad employers just as we  have

bad  foreign  workers  here.  As I  mentioned  earlier,  many

foreign  workers  had to incur huge debts to  pay  for  their

passage  to  come here to work.  Many of them are  unable  to

earn  enough  to pay back their loans.  Hence, they  have  to

moonlight  or resort to some illegal activities to make  more

money.   When they are found out, they would just  disappear.

This  results  in  many  law-abiding employers  having  their

deposits  forfeited.   This is very unfair  to  most  of  the

employers.  So I hope when such cases are being dealt with by

MOM,  there  should  be  some kind of flexibility  and  human

touch.  While I fully support Government's firmness in  going

after  employers  who  ill-treat and  exploit  their  foreign

workers,  we should also take equally stern measures  against

those foreign workers who bunk off without any reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are morally bound to look after the interest of these

foreign  workers and we would not like to see them march  and

protest  in the street, because this will cause very  serious

damage  to our country.  Therefore, I would urge the Ministry

to  formulate some measures to make sure that foreign  worker

agencies  follow certain rules and regulations.  They  should

have  enough  financial resources to pay for  their  workers'

salaries for at least 2-3 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are more than 1,000 foreign worker

agencies.   We  see  a  lot  of newspaper  advertisements  on

foreign  worker  agencies.  We ought to have  a  very  strict

evaluation  system to verify whether these  agencies  operate

under  basic  ethical standards.  Otherwise,  their  licences

should  be  revoked.   This will act as a  deterrent  against

errant agencies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is morally bound to look after the interests of

all  foreign  workers.   Foreign workers  who  work  in  some

shipyards and in the construction industry have opted to join

trade  unions  to safeguard their interest.   They  are  also

entitled  to  join  various  training  courses  and   welfare

benefits  provided  by the NTUC.  I would urge  the  relevant

departments, especially MOM, to continue exercising stringent

control  over employers and foreign worker agencies  to  make

sure that they maintain basic ethical standards.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have three

different  issues  to raise.  First, is on  the  issuance  of

employment passes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many companies, especially the smaller ones, face a

dilemma  when  they  try  to bring  in  foreign  talent  into

Singapore, especially from developing countries.  Good people

from these countries have many capabilities, sometimes better

than our locals, but do not demand very high salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, many start-ups cannot afford to pay

high  basic salaries, even if the employee deserves  it,  but

instead  they  issue  stock options or variable  compensation

like  bonuses, commissions or profit sharing as  alternatives

to make up for lower salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both cases, with our restrictive employment pass

issuance  practices, we create great problems  for  companies

hiring  such  people  from overseas.  The  issue  is  one  of

minimum  salary  requirement for employment  pass  approvals.

The  Ministry should exercise flexibility, in my opinion,  to

give  the benefit of doubt to the companies when they declare

that  such people are indeed talented, despite the fact  that

they  are  paying lower basic salaries.  Currently, to  cover

all  eventualities, the rules have become very tight.  I hope

the Minister would consider this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on the termination of employment

passes.   When employment pass holders lose their  jobs,  and

they have to leave Singapore, they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



only  given about a couple of weeks, I believe, two or  three

weeks,  to leave.  In the last few years, there are  quite  a

number  of them who have lost their jobs.  Many of them  have

been  in  Singapore for many years too and have families  and

children comfortably studying in our local schools, and  they

have  other  commitments in Singapore.  Giving  them  a  very

short time to wrap up, pack up and leave the country is not a

fair  and humane thing to do.  It does not give a good signal

to  future  potential  talent whom  we  want  to  bring  into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Ministry work with the Home Affairs

Ministry  to  issue  such people with a six-month  Transition

Visa, so that they can either look for alternative employment

or have enough time to organise themselves before they leave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is on work permits for non-domestic

workers.  We have a few levers to control this.  The first is

the  quota  system  and the other is on the  levies.   Can  I

suggest  that,  for  the sake of employers  who  cannot  find

enough local employees and for the sake of reducing cost,  we

have  a multi-tier system of levies?  Because we already have

quotas to control foreign workers, perhaps for the first  50%

of  the foreign workers, we could issue a lower levy.  And as

they  hire more, we can gradually increase the levy.  In this

way,  companies will still be compelled to hire locals first.

The  cost  of  business will be kept low, and  we  can  still

control  the  number  of foreign workers by  controlling  the

quota.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support that we should hire local workers first.

But the truth of the matter, as many Members have brought up,

is  that there are some jobs which are not attractive enough,

especially  those  that  require shift  work  or  those  that

require  employees to work in clean rooms, and the reason  is

of  discomfort.  I would like to qualify myself that  I  have

always  believed in hiring locals first in all the  companies

that I have worked in.  My own record is that I have hired  a

66-year  old retiree, a drug addict, who despite 200-300  job

applications, no one wanted to give him a chance, and I hired

him.  I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



hire locals.  I also have the opposite experience with locals

who, after taking the job and working for a few days, because

of  the discomfort that I mentioned earlier, left in a hurry.

For  the  sake of employers being able to carry  on  business

here, I hope that the Minister will consider this request.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Heng Chee How is not here. Mdm

Halimah.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, first, I would like to commend

the  Government  for ratifying Convention 182  on  the  Worst

Forms  of Child Labour last year.  This year, based  on  what

the  Minister  had  announced  at  the  International  Labour

Conference last year, the Singapore Government is considering

ratifying  Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration for  Work  of

Equal  Value.  These are very important conventions and  will

send a very strong signal about our Government's stand on the

eradication of child labour and gender inequality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International labour standards provide an important

benchmark  against which countries can measure  their  labour

legislation  and practices on key areas affecting  rights  at

work, conditions of employment and health and safety.   As  a

member state of the ILO, there are certain obligations  which

we  are expected to fulfil.  Since 1998, with the adoption of

the  Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights  at

Work,  there has been mounting pressure for states  to  adopt

the  eight  core  conventions covered under the  Declaration.

This  being  the  case,  I  certainly  look  forward  to  our

Government ratifying more ILO conventions as a signal of  our

commitment  to  the  ILO  and  to  show  that  we  take   our

obligations seriously.  I am not suggesting that just because

we  are under pressure internationally, therefore we ought to

ratify  conventions, but rather that if we feel our standards

and  practices are up to par, then we ought to  ratify  those

conventions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, Sir, Singapore is rated well, because of the

tremendous  improvements that we have made to workers'  lives

and also because of our huge investments in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



human capital, which is often cited - I am proud to say -  in

many ILO publications.  In many ways, we are looked upon as a

developed country that can act as a role model for others  in

the  region.   I  have  sometimes heard criticisms  that  our

labour  standards  and practices are pro-employer,  and  that

they are more beneficial to employers rather than to workers.

I  have also heard criticisms that the laws make it difficult

to  organise and do not provide basic protection to  workers,

in  terms  of  security of employment and in terms  of  their

basic terms and conditions of employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I have two points to make and two questions I would

like  to put to the Minister.  One, I would like the Minister

to  inform  the  House  as to whether our  labour  standards,

labour  laws  and practices are up to par and  in  line  with

international labour standards and conventions,  despite  the

fact  that  we  may  not  have  ratified  all  the  key   ILO

conventions.  Secondly, I would like to ask the  Minister  to

share with us the Ministry's long-term plans on ratification,

and  whether  the  Ministry  will consider  reactivating  the

tripartite  committee  that  was  previously  established  to

further study this matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hawazi Daipi is not speaking. Mr Yeo

Guat Kwang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, last year, the

number  of  fatal  industrial accidents in Singapore  was  52

cases,  ie, an average of one per week.  The total number  of

accidents has also gone up to 3,790 cases last year.  I think

we have to work harder to bring this figure down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of our tripartite cooperation, we have

already raised safety consciousness among our workers in  the

work  sites  and  much improvement has been achieved  in  our

occupational health and safety standards.  But I think  there

is  still room for further improvement.  MOM should have more

comprehensive  plans  to  prevent industrial  accidents  from

happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we read in the newspapers that there are a

number of workers falling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



to  their death from a height, and there seems to be a rising

trend in this type of cases.  MOM should also do something to

find remedies to prevent such incidents from happening again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the work environment is so different from the

past.  Work site is not confined to factories, and many union

leaders have pleaded with us to raise the issue with  MOM  to

change  the  definition  under the relevant  legislation,  to

extend  the coverage of occupational health and safety beyond

the confines of the factories to cover all workplaces.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether  he  will  consider  reviewing  the  income

ceiling  of  $1,600  that is stipulated under  the  Workmen's

Compensation Act and also under the Employment  Act.   As  we

know, the Workmen's Compensation Act provides for payment  of

compensation to workers who are injured in the course of work

or who suffer from occupational diseases.  The Employment Act

provides for the basic terms and conditions of employment  of

workers.   But both Acts only apply to non-manual workers  if

their salary ceiling does not exceed $1,600 per month.  As we

know,  the  ceiling was reviewed in 1996, and it  was  raised

from  $1,500 to $1,600.  The ceiling of $1,600 is  pegged  to

the  median wage of workers in Singapore.  Today, the  median

wage of workers in Singapore is $1,874.  Therefore, there  is

a  need  for  us to look at reviewing the ceiling; otherwise,

the number of people covered will be significantly less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which I wish to raise concerns the

definition   of   "earnings"  found   under   the   Workmen's

Compensation  Act.   The Workmen's Compensation  Act  defines

earnings  to  include  overtime  payments  or  other  special

remuneration  for  work  done,  whether  by  way  of   bonus,

allowance  or otherwise.  In other words, the $1,600  ceiling

under  the Workmen's Compensation Act is based on gross  pay.

This  is disadvantageous to the workers and deprives quite  a

significant number of workers from the protection of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



Workmen's Compensation Act.  It is also a definition that  is

not  in  line  with the Employment Act, which has  a  similar

salary  ceiling  but which excludes overtime payments,  bonus

payments  or allowances.  In other words, the Employment  Act

salary  ceiling  of  $1,600 is based on basic  pay,  but  the

Workmen's  Compensation Act ceiling of  $1,600  is  based  on

gross  pay.  There is clearly an anomaly here.  Because  what

would  happen is that we could have a worker who  is  covered

under the Employment Act, but because the term "earnings"  is

defined differently under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the

same  worker who is covered under the Employment Act  is  not

covered under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  So if we  have

a  clerk  in  a  shipyard earning $1,600  and  he  does  some

inspection  work,  he  is still covered under  the  Workmen's

Compensation  Act.  But if he is injured, he is  not  covered

under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  So there is an anomaly

there.   And  I really hope that the Minister can  look  into

rectifying this anomaly and to bring the Act in line with the

Employment Act's definition, that means, the gross ceiling of

$1,600  should be based on basic salary and not on the  gross

salary.   And secondly, I would also like to ask the Minister

to consider reviewing the ceiling of $1,600 under both Acts.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Just following up on

Mdm Halimah on anomalies, this is the point that I had raised

in  my  speech  in  the debate on the Budget,  which  is  the

difference in the legislation to the Employment Act employees

and non-Employment Act employees as far as maternity leave is

concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Act allows for paid maternity leave of

two  months and protection against termination of employment.

This   covers   all   employees  except  for   professionals,

executives,   managers,  and  those   in   the   confidential

positions.  For the Employment Act employees, they  also  get

protection for the third child under the Children Development

Co-Savings Act. For women though, who are not covered by  the

Employment Act, they do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



not  get this protection for the first and second child  but,

oddly  enough, they get it for their third child and that  is

because  the  legislation used there is  a  tool  for  social

engineering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to ask the Minister whether he would

consider  correcting this anomaly by extending paid maternity

leave and protection against termination to professionals and

women  in  executive  positions for their  first  and  second

child.   There  are  two reasons.  One, it will  achieve  the

objective  of having more babies.  But, secondly,  and,  much

more importantly, just for humane reason, because having gone

through  what  they have to go through for nine months,  they

are  tired  at  the end of it and I think they do  need  that

rest.  So for humane reason, I think it is important.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constitutency Member):</b> Sir, like Mdm Halimah and Ms Indranee, I would also like to

talk  about protection for mothers and also about the $1,600.

Currently,  the  labour laws provide for  the  protection  of

pregnant  employees from being dismissed or  retrenched  from

the  company on condition that she is not under probation and

that  she  earns less than $1,600 per month.   What  help  is

there  from  the  Ministry  for pregnant  employees  who  are

earning  higher than $1,600?  In today's economy, where  many

women are highly educated and earning higher salary, I wonder

if  this amount is considered too low.  Can the Minister look

into reviewing this matter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge that pregnancy is a very

stressful  and difficult time, as what Ms Indranee  has  also

said.   There  could be hormonal swings or morning  sickness.

Employees  may  be on more frequent medical  leave  and  work

performance   may  be  affected  during  this  period,   thus

affecting the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the company is small and cannot afford the luxury of

personnel disruptions or employing more additional employees,

are  they  allowed to dismiss these pregnant  employees?   Do

they need to give reasons for such dismissal?  In view



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



of  the difficult economy that we are facing, it is important

to  reassure mothers-to-be that their jobs will be protected.

Can  the  Minister explain what kind of help can  a  pregnant

employee obtain?  And who can she turn to for help?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Irene Ng is not present. Mr Heng Chee

How  is  also not present.  Mdm Ho Geok Choo, you could  take

all your three cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I refer to the

mission statement of the Ministry of Manpower on page 381  of

the Main Estimates, which reads, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To develop a globally competitive workforce and foster

a highly favorable workplace environment, in partnership with

workers and employers, to achieve sustainable economic growth

for the well-being of Singaporeans."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it currently stands, the mission statement is indeed

a  commendable one; one which has served Singapore  well  for

many  years. However, in view of the knowledge-based  economy

that  we  find ourselves currently in, I wonder  whether  the

statement has missed out a critical sector of our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the mission statement makes reference to

"workers  and employers" alone, while leaving out the  entire

segment  of  our  workforce  that constitutes  professionals,

executives  and managers (PEMs).  In light of the  critically

important  role  played  by  this workforce  segment  in  our

increasingly sophisticated knowledge-based economy, would  it

not  make  better sense to reflect their importance  in  this

mission statement?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for MTI has explained in defence for the

change  of  names  of  three statutory boards  as  to  better

reflect  their  evolving and changing roles  in  the  current

operating  environment.  Similarly,  since  the  Ministry  of

Labour changed its name to MOM a few years back, the role  of

MOM  has to evolve and change to reflect its relevance in the

operating environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by MOS Ng Eng Hen's acknowledgement of

the need to pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



more  attention to PEMs, in view of their growing numbers  in

the  workforce, constituting something like  40%.   Since  we

need  to  forge a close synergistic relationship between  the

principal  actors of the workforce, it is important  for  the

Ministry  of  Manpower to also incorporate the  concerns  and

contributions of our professionals, executives and  managers.

By  acknowledging  their  role  and  contributions,  we  will

certainly be able to better engage their commitment to propel

Singapore in a global competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this, Sir, I beg to propose that the mission

statement takes on a more global tone to read something  like

this:  "To  develop a globally competitive workforce  and  to

foster   a   highly   favorable  workplace  environment,   in

partnership    with   workers,   employers,    professionals,

executives  and  managers,  to achieve  sustainable  economic

growth for the well-being of Singaporeans."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my second question, Sir, I refer to Code Head S of

the  Main  Estimates on page 384 of Paper  Cmd.  3  of  2002.

Looking  through  the  estimates of the  Ministry's  Manpower

Development  Programme, I note that the amount earmarked  for

the  operating  budget  for the next fiscal  year  is  $47.65

million.   I suppose that most of that amount would be  spent

on   the   Skills   Redevelopment  Programme   and   on   the

implementation   of  employment  assistance  and   retraining

programmes for the unemployed under the Manpower Action Plan.

I  am  given  to  understand that these  two  programmes  are

basically intended to retrain blue-collar and manual  workers

who  have been retrenched, or who need to upgrade their skill

levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, I proposed setting up the Higher

Education  Endowment Development (HEED) Fund for PEMs  as  we

have  done  so for workers.  Today, I would like to  ask  the

Minister,  in respect of our Manpower Development  Programme,

whether  there are funds that are specifically  earmarked  to

help  upgrade the skills and education of our executives  who

have been displaced through company retrenchment exercises.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be unreasonable to suppose that many of

these  displaced executives need help either to update or  to

re-orient   their   skills.   As   an   example,   with   the

liberalisation of our banking sector, there is an urgent need

to  upgrade  some  of  the  knowledge  and  skill  levels  of

professionals in this sector so that they come up to par with

their counterparts in more developed financial centres.   Are

there  funds from the Manpower Development Programme to  help

people  like them make that critical switch up the  knowledge

ladder?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also note in the same page of the Main Estimates

that  $54.56  million have been earmarked  for  the  Manpower

Augmentation  Programme.  As outlined in the estimates,  this

programme   is   primarily  meant  to  attract   and   manage

international  talent into this country.  I  have  no  qualms

about  the  amount spent on the attraction and management  of

international talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I like to raise, though, is, if there is

provision in the Manpower Development Programme, then whether

there are other types of grants earmarked for the development

of  PEMs,  particularly those who have  been  displaced.   If

there are indeed such grants set aside for the development of

PEMs,   are  they  specifically  targeted  at  our   domestic

managers, professionals and executives, or are they also made

available to the foreign talent in our midst?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, while the emphasis given to the attraction

and  retention of international talent is not wrong, I  think

that  more can be done to nurture our own domestic talent  by

allocating   more   funds  to  the  training   of   our   own

professionals, executives and managers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my third question, Sir, I note that on page 384 of

the  Main  Estimates  the Ministry has  set  aside  some  $75

million  for  the development of a new NTUC Building  at  the

Marina  South  New  Downtown.  Sir, I  like  to  applaud  the

Government  for setting aside this sum of money to  subsidise

the  upgrading of the physical infrastructure of  workers  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the workforce also constitutes a fairly high

proportion of professionals, executives and managers and with

increasing  levelling up of the workforce  to  the  ranks  of

PEMs, we must also begin to accord support to PEMs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last May, the Singapore Professionals, Executives

Cooperative  (SPEC)  was  registered  as  a  co-operative  to

facilitate mutual self help for professionals, executives and

managers who have been displaced.  Today, SPEC has about  750

members  from  across the industry.  Being relatively  young,

SPEC's  mainstream  of revenue is from subscriptions  of  co-operative  shares of members.  SPEC is also today engaged  in

some   recruitment,   training  and   consultancy   services.

Nonetheless,  these activities have not earned  enough  gains

for  SPEC to be able to afford expanding resources on  office

space.   At  this  point, Sir, I would  like  to  declare  my

interest in SPEC, being one of the founders of SPEC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, SPEC is being hosted and housed in the

premises of the Singapore Human Resources Institute which  is

already  bursting at the seams.  As this new co-operative  is

envisaged to be an on-going concern, it needs to have  access

to  a  more  permanent  place to house  its  activities.   By

allocating some space for their use in the NTUC Building, the

Government and union movement will be sending a strong signal

to   PEMs   that   their  needs  are  being  recognised   and

acknowledged.   I  would  like to request  the  Minister  for

Manpower and the Chief of the NTUC to consider setting  aside

some  subsidised  rental space in the new  NTUC  Building  to

house this co-operative.  I urge MOM to do more to help PEMs,

in  terms of initial seed funding or subsidy in their  search

for a roof over their heads.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



he  made  was  that, despite the economic  downturn  and  the

increase in unemployment, we still need international talent.

And I thank him for supporting this position because there is

always  the tendency when you are faced with some  crisis  or

difficulties, for instance, rising unemployment, people  will

think  that  that  is the time to shut the door  and  try  to

preserve  jobs  for our own citizens.  We have  explained  on

many other occasions why in fact we should not do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in this age of globalisation, capital and talent

do  not  recognise  any borders and boundaries.   For  us  to

succeed  in  this  more competitive, global  environment,  we

really need to supplement our domestic talent, our home grown

talent,  with  those that we can recruit  from  the  flow  of

talent  in the international labour market.  There is an  ebb

and  flow of talent going around.  And our mission at MOM  is

to  try  to  attract  and  recruit  a  fair  share  of  these

international  talents to Singapore.  They  can  help  us  to

become  more competitive.  They can help us to reach  out  to

new  opportunities.  They can in fact create jobs for  fellow

Singaporeans.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong emphasised that there is a need for us, apart

from  just bringing them here, to try to help them to  settle

in  quickly.   He  proposed that we should  have  a  one-stop

agency  to help these international talents when they freshly

arrive  in  Singapore.  I am glad to inform Dr Ong  that,  in

fact,  we do have such a facility, we do have such a service.

This  is  our  Contact Singapore.  Contact  Singapore  has  a

network of offices in the world and they do offer advice  and

assistance to international talents who are keen to  come  to

Singapore to take on jobs.  They also offer a wide  range  of

settling-in  services, once the international talent  arrives

in Singapore.  Contact Singapore has a local office here that

will  provide assistance to international talent.  The  local

Contact  Singapore  office  also works  with  other  economic

agencies  to organise events to help international talent  to

network with Singaporeans, to get to know more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans since they are total strangers here, and also to

build  up  contacts with members of their  own  community  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At MOM, we also work in partnership with other

Government  agencies,  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Community

Development and Sports, the People's Association and  various

other  organisations of foreign nationals  here,  to  provide

opportunities   for   foreign  talents   to   interact   with

Singaporeans  and for them to also participate  in  community

work.  This is a point that Dr Ong also mentioned, that  they

should be involved in community life, so that they can  start

to  sink roots in Singapore and, hopefully, more of them  may

be persuaded to stay on for good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, we do hold regular get-together,

dialogue sessions and feedback sessions for the international

talents,  who  are  here  on  employment  passes,  to  better

understand  the  issues  that they face  when  they  come  to

Singapore,   and   to  help  them  overcome   some   of   the

difficulties, if there are any.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to turn to Mr Inderjit Singh's points

on  the  dilemma faced by some of the smaller companies  when

they  apply  for employment passes.  We welcome international

talents,  regardless of who in Singapore is trying to  employ

them.   Employers  in Singapore, whether they  are  large  or

small,  if they recruit well-qualified international  talent,

they   will  find  that  the  application  process  is  quite

straightforward.   The  processing  time  is  actually  quite

short.   For hon. Members' information, more than 90% of  the

applications  for "P" employment passes, ie, for  top-quality

international  talents, are processed and approved  within  a

week.   Although  salary  is an important  criterion  in  the

overall assessment, it is not the only criterion that we  use

to  decide whether an employment pass should be issued to the

international   talent.   We  also  have  to   consider   the

applicant's  background, as well as  the  background  of  the

company.   But  let me assure the Member that we  are  always

flexible and, if employers feel that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



they  have  a  very special case, they have  a  very  special

person  whom they should bring in, who warrants exception  or

deviation  from  the rules to be made, let me assure  Members

that  we are prepared to consider such appeals.  And we have,

in  fact, made such exceptions and deviations, on appeal from

various employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, however, I have to caution Members

that  while we are prepared to make exceptions, we must  also

guard against abuses by some employers.  Some companies  make

false declaration either as to educational qualifications  or

salaries  in  order to bring in foreigners of  a  work-permit

calibre masquerading as international talents.  They do so to

circumvent  the  restrictions on  the  entry  of  low-skilled

foreign workers of the work-permit holder type.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of employment pass holders investigated for

employment pass abuses went up by more than 55%, from 247  in

2000,  to 384 in 2001.  The majority of these abuses  involve

false  declaration of salary, followed by forged  educational

certificates,   and  illegal  employment  or  deployment   of

employment  pass  holders.  A total  of  152  companies  were

involved in these abuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent recession showed that lower-skilled

Singaporeans  are  most  adversely affected  in  an  economic

downturn.  If we make no effort to check those who abuse  the

employment  pass  system  to  bring  in  low-skilled  foreign

workers  masquerading as international talent,  then  we  are

only doing a disservice to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A barrier-free system means that more Singaporeans are

going  to  face unfair competition for jobs.  So,  while  our

rules and procedures should not obstruct companies in need of

genuine international talent, we will always need some checks

and  balances.  Since our present system already sees 90%  of

the  "P"  pass applications being approved within a week,  we

feel  that the system is adequately serving the needs of  the

vast majority of employers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also brought up the problem of employment

pass  holders whose employment passes are terminated  or  not

renewed,  that  they are given a very short period  of  stay,

currently  about two weeks, to settle their  affairs  and  to

wind  up.   Let me first point out that if the  pass  is  not

renewed,  very  often the employment pass  holder  will  know

about it well in advance.  The company does not just spring a

surprise  on the employment pass holder because, if they  are

not  renewing their contract, they will have to let them know

in  advance  so they will have a chance to make arrangements.

Nevertheless, if the employment pass holders need  more  time

to  settle  their  affairs in Singapore, we are  prepared  to

consider.  They just have to let us know.  We are prepared to

even  grant an extension up to six months for them to  settle

their affairs here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on Mr Inderjit Singh's point on work permit,

suggesting that since we have a dependency ratio or  a  quota

system,  we  should  consider lowering  the  levies  for  the

foreign  workers, or have multi-tier levies, to reduce  costs

for  the employers.  I would like to point out that the quota

or  dependency  ceiling system is in place  to  prevent  over

reliance  on  foreign  workers.  Levy,  on  the  other  hand,

although  it  will moderate demand on the part of  employers,

also  serves another useful purpose, ie, to narrow  the  wage

gap   between  work  permit  holders  coming  from   low-wage

countries and Singaporean workers who are basically doing the

same  kind of job.  Therefore, we have to maintain a balance,

so as not to result in increasing replacement of Singaporeans

by low-wage work permit holders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do recognise that levies add to the cost of

employers.   That  is  why, during the economic  downturn  in

January  1999,  we reduced the levy across the board,  except

for  the construction sector, and these lower levies will  be

maintained  until  December this year, as  announced  by  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister and Minister for Finance  during  the

Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Inderjit Singh's point about having a multi-tier

levy system, we already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



have  such a system in the manufacturing sector.  There is  a

two-tier system.  If the employer employs foreign workers  up

to  40%  dependency ceiling, he pays a lower levy.   When  he

exceeds  40%, for additional foreign workers employed between

40%  and 50%, which is the maximum allowed presently, he pays

a higher levy.  So we have such a system.  When we review the

levy  system  towards the end of the year, we  will  look  at

whether  this multi-tier system should remain  as  it  is  or

should be refined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Ong Ah Heng, also on work-permit

related matters.  His concern is that employers whose foreign

workers  abscond  or run away will result  in  the  employers

losing  their security bond, ie, the security bond posted  by

the employer will be forfeited if the employer is not able to

repatriate  the foreign workers.  I understand this  concern.

Employers say that they cannot be 100% responsible for  their

foreign workers while they are here, and some of them do  run

away.   They  are  not in a position to monitor  the  foreign

workers' activities round the clock.  This is true.   On  the

other hand, if we do not have a requirement that the employer

who  brings in the foreign worker gives this undertaking that

he  will  repatriate the foreign worker at  the  end  of  the

contract, or when the work permit is terminated, we could end

up  with  a  situation where there would be large numbers  of

foreign  workers  brought in to work and then  end  up  being

abandoned by the employer on the streets of Singapore.   That

is  why  the security bond is important.  It serves a  useful

purpose.   There  is a hold on the employer, that  he  cannot

abandon  these foreign workers and leave them  to  their  own

devices, find their own way around, and then he goes off  and

recruits some other foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bond makes sure that the employer knows that he

stands  to  lose a substantial sum of money if  he  does  not

repatriate  the  worker.  In the process, it means  that  the

foreign worker would receive better welfare, better treatment

from  the  employer, because the employer does  not  want  to

jeopardise his bond by ill-treating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



the  foreign worker to the point that he will run away.   The

result  speaks for itself because, over the last 10 years  or

so,  if  I remember correctly, we have only about a thousand-odd  cases of employers who lose their bonds, which works out

to  about  a  hundred-odd cases a year.  This is for  foreign

domestic workers who absconded and caused their employers  to

lose their bonds.  So the numbers are not large, which should

mean  that,  in  fact, the bond system does work.   The  vast

majority   of   employers  are  conscientious   about   their

undertaking  to the Government, and they do repatriate  their

workers at the end of the period of working in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also expressed concern about the employment agents,

and  whether they have treated the foreign workers fairly  or

not.   Here,  I would like to make clear that there  are  two

sides  to  the coin, because while the foreign workers  claim

that  they  pay  enormous sums of money to agents,  they  are

referring to the agents in their own country who extract huge

sums of money from people wanting to leave their home country

to work in Singapore.  These agents' activities are obviously

beyond our control.  They are outside our jurisdiction.   But

for  the  employment agents that are in Singapore, of course,

we  do  license  them and we do regulate their activities  to

ensure  that  they serve the interests of both the  employers

and the foreign workers who are here to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the Member that my Ministry is

working  with CASE to introduce an accreditation  system  for

employment  agencies, especially those  that  deal  with  the

placement of foreign domestic workers.  More than 80% of  the

foreign   domestic  workers  who  come  into  Singapore   are

currently employed through employment agencies.  We feel that

if  we  have an accreditation system, it will help to upgrade

the  professionalism  and  the  ethical  standards  of  these

employment   agencies,  and  also  provide   employers   with

information  that they need to make decisions when  they  are

selecting the employment agencies for their services.   Under

the accreditation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



system, the employment agencies will be assessed on a  number

of  factors,  including  adopting fair  and  ethical  trading

practices,  having  well-trained  staff,  providing  accurate

information on the foreign workers, the nature of the foreign

workers' training, and providing after-placement services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of this accreditation system will be

announced  by CASE in due course.  The scheme initially  will

start  off  as a voluntary scheme.  So employment agents  are

welcomed  to  participate,  to  have  themselves  graded  and

evaluated.   But  my Ministry intends to eventually  make  it

compulsory for all employment agencies that deal with foreign

domestic  worker placements to be accredited when they  renew

their  licence.  We hope that through such a system we  will,

over  time,  be  able to raise the ethical standards  in  the

industry.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mdm Halimah Yacob who asked whether our

labour  standards are up to par.  Let me assure her that  our

labour  standards  are  up  to  par.   In  fact,  our  labour

legislation has been rated quite highly every year by BERI in

its assessment of our labour force.  The fact that our labour

legislation  is rated highly must mean that we  have  a  good

framework for managing or regulating the labour market.  I am

quite  confident that our labour standards will stand  up  to

scrutiny by any international organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what are our plans for ratifying more

Conventions.   At  the moment, we have ratified  a  total  of

three  out  of the eight core Conventions, namely, Convention

29  on  Forced Labour, Convention 98 on the Right to Organise

and  Collective Bargaining, and Convention 182 on  the  Worst

Forms of Child Labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have announced that we will ratify Convention 100 on

Equal  Remuneration.   We  will  convey  the  Instrument   of

Ratification  at this year's International Labour  Conference

in  June.   With  this  latest ratification,  we  would  have

ratified a total of 22 ILO Conventions, including four of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



eight   core  Conventions.   I  think  this  compares   quite

favourably to many countries, including some of the developed

countries.    We   will  continue  to  evaluate   the   other

Conventions and consider ratifying those that are relevant to

us.   In  the  process, we will consult both the trade  union

movement and also the employers' federation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has raised some questions on

occupational  safety and health at the workplace.   He  noted

that the number of fatal accidents had dropped, but the total

number  of  accidents had, in fact, increased.   But  over  a

longer  period of the last 10 years, the number of  accidents

in  factories had in fact declined quite significantly.  This

improvement can be attributed to measures that were taken  by

my  Ministry,  such  as  the  implementation  of  the  Safety

Management  System  for construction, shipbuilding  and  ship

repair industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced other measures to inculcate and

instill  greater awareness of occupational safety and health.

For  instance, we have a debarment scheme for contractors  in

the  construction  industry.  If they fail  to  meet  certain

standards,  they could be debarred from tendering for  public

projects.   We have also introduced safety training  for  all

levels  of personnel and also, last but not least, through  a

range  of stringent enforcement exercises.  I think  we  have

brought the point home to many of the employers, so they  are

paying  much  more  attention to this  area  of  occupational

safety  and  health.  Our experience shows  that  the  Safety

Management System is an effective tool in improving safety in

factories.   Hence,  last  year,  my  Ministry  extended  the

implementation  of  the Safety Management System  to  process

plants,  wafer fabrication plants and metal working factories

employing more than 100 workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Yeo's concern about fatal accidents

resulting  from a fall from heights, this is a concern  which

my  Ministry also shares.  In fact, two of the main causes of

fatal  accidents are due to workers falling from heights,  or

being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



struck by falling objects.  These accidents usually arise  at

the  edge  of  buildings under construction, or in  shipyards

where  scaffoldings have to be used in the  course  of  their

work.  My Ministry will introduce regulations to ensure  that

scaffoldings  used  at  workplaces  are  safe  and  of  sound

construction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have informed this House in the last Parliament, my

Ministry  is  planning to amend the Factories Act  to  extend

coverage  to  more  workers  at  other  workplaces.   In  the

process,  we  have embarked on an extensive consultation  and

feedback  programme from the affected workplaces.  Our  staff

have  met  with  organisations, such as the Singapore  Dental

Association,  National Healthcare Group,  Singapore  National

Employers'  Federation,  Singapore  Hotels  Association,  the

Restaurants   Association  of  Singapore  and  also   several

Government departments.  This feedback is being considered in

finalising  the draft Bill to extend occupational safety  and

health  protection  to more workers at different  workplaces.

This process of consultation and gathering feedback has taken

more   time  than  expected,  because  many  employers   have

expressed  a  lack  of  understanding  about  how   the   new

legislation  will  impact  on them and  have  raised  certain

concerns  which  my  Ministry  is  addressing.   Hence,   the

timeframe  for  introducing the Bill to Parliament  has  been

delayed.    We   hope  to  complete  this  whole   cycle   of

consultation  and addressing their concerns and feedback  and

finalise  the Bill and introduce it in Parliament later  this

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to Mdm Halimah's request on the income

ceiling  under  both  the Employment Act  and  the  Workmen's

Compensation Act is yes, we will review the salary ceiling in

these  Acts.  We  will  also rationalise  the  difference  in

definition  between the Workmen's Compensation  Act  and  the

Employment  Act in terms of salaries or the earnings  of  the

workers concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we will have to implement a new ceiling at a

point in time when the economy has sufficiently recovered  in

order to be able to absorb this additional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



cost  on employers.  We will review and find a suitable  time

to introduce this new ceiling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On anomalies, again as Ms Indranee has mentioned, on

maternity leave, there is a segment of the workforce that  is

not  covered, mainly the managers and the executives who  are

excluded from the Employment Act.  But it does not mean  that

female  managers or executives, who are not  covered  by  the

Employment  Act, do not receive the maternity leave  benefits

that  are received by those who are covered by the  Act.   In

fact,  in  Singapore, the employment terms of managerial  and

executive  staff, who are not covered by the Employment  Act,

are generally equal, if not better than those who are covered

through  a  process  of individual contract  negotiations  or

through the market forces at work.   Even though they are not

covered,   they  have  been  able  to  arrive  at  individual

contracts that provide equal or better benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia also raised the same point. We are able

to  assist  those  who  feel that  they  have  been  unfairly

dismissed  by  the  employer or their  employment  terminated

unfairly as a result of pregnancy.  If there are such  cases,

he is free to inform us or advise the employees who feel that

they  have been unfairly dismissed to appeal to the Ministry.

We will certainly look into their case to help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next turn to Mdm Ho's comments on our Ministry's

Mission  Statement.  Yes, we use the word  "workers"  in  our

Mission  Statement.  But when we use the word  "workers",  we

were not thinking of blue collar workers. We were thinking of

workers  in a wider sense, perhaps workers as being equal  to

employees.   It was not meant to be workers in the  way  that

she  defines  it  where we have excluded  the  professionals,

managers, executives and the technicians.  That was never the

intention.  We will certainly take note of her comments.   If

there  is this implication, if there is this perception  that

we have excluded this group, my Ministry is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



actually  in the process of reviewing our Mission  Statement.

It  was  crafted  sometime ago when we were transformed  from

Ministry  of Labour to Ministry of Manpower.  I think  it  is

timely for us, in the light of these few years of experience,

operating as the Ministry of Manpower, to review our  Mission

Statement.  We will certainly take note of her comments.  But

let  me  assure her that it was not the intention to  exclude

this group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, in fact, when she asked whether there is

any specific fund under the Manpower Development Programme to

assist the professionals, managers and executives, the answer

is  yes.  We do have programmes that are designed to help the

PMEs,  especially  those who have been retrenched.   We  have

programmes,   such  as  the  Strategic  Manpower   Conversion

Programme,  where we can help professionals to  be  retrained

for  redeployment in a different sector.  Not only are  there

programmes  in the MOM's Manpower Development framework,  but

there  are  also  programmes  in  EDB,  Infocomm  Development

Authority  (IDA) and in MAS where they have seed funds  which

are  targeted  to  help develop professionals,  managers  and

executives   within  their  particular   area   of   economic

activities.   There are quite extensive programmes  available

to  help  the PMEs.  It is not as if that MOM had  overlooked

this group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme was

designed to be able to reach out to the younger group of PMEs

because  we crafted the salary support, 50% of the salary  of

anybody  who  is aged over 40, at the level of  $2,000,  that

means   anyone  earning  $4,000  can  benefit.   The  middle-management group, who is earning around $4,000, and  who  has

been retrenched, can perhaps benefit from the People-for-Jobs

Traineeship  Programme.  When they get a  job,  the  employer

will  receive  50% of his salary for six months offsetted  by

the Government.  It will help them get jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced a Work Skills Training Programme

to help executives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



equip  themselves with better career planning and job  search

skills   so   that  they  can  cope  with  this   period   of

difficulties.  We have even introduced a programme  of  self-employment  training so that retrenched  PMEs,  who  want  to

start  up a new business, can sign up for this programme  and

learn how to start up a small business on their own and  make

use  of their past working experience to start up a business.

We do have programmes that are focused at meeting some of the

needs of the PMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mdm Ho asked whether SPEC, which is a

cooperative  of  professionals, managers and executives,  can

also share the space at the new NTUC Building.  May I suggest

that  she  put  her  proposal directly to  NTUC  because  the

Government has subsidised the building of a new NTUC Building

at Marina South Downtown, in recognition of the contributions

made  by  the trade union movement in helping us to  mobilise

our  workforce, participating in workers' training and  also,

generally,  looking after the welfare and well-being  of  our

workers.  This is a very important contribution that has made

a very significant contribution to strengthening our economic

competitiveness.  In return, the Government  has  given  NTUC

this special recognition.  We have alienated land for them to

build  a  new  headquarters and we have also  subsidised  the

construction of the NTUC portion.  If SPEC wants to co-locate

its operation/premises with NTUC, I think SPEC should make  a

proposal to NTUC to see whether this is feasible or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I think I have addressed most of the

concerns.

NTUC   group  of  cooperatives  has  stretched  itself   very

aggressively  in  the  last  two  decades,  into   too   many

diversified  commercial  activities.   Consequently,  it  has

edged  out  many local business persons and small shopkeepers

and  endangered the viability of many more.  As we all  know,

the  small  business enterprise plays a very  large  role  in

keeping  Singaporeans employed.  Can the Minister  look  into

this  matter and see how it can restrain the NTUC's ambitious

commercial  empire,  so  as  not to  cause  greater  business

difficulty and unemployment in the small business sector?

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Does the NCMP mean

that  NTUC  Fairprice and other cooperatives should  withdraw

and give way to the small shopkeepers?  Does he know that, in

fact,  the  cooperatives also provide employment  and  better

services?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>



And  third, NTUC Fairprice and other cooperatives,  in  fact,

help  workers to stretch their dollar and, even at this point

of time, help to absorb GST.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Does the hon. Member suggest that

MNCs like Carrefour should take over?

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I am stating what I have

observed  as  a  problem among the SMEs.   I  am  asking  the

Minister what kind of solution can be given.  I am not saying

to  let Carrefour come in and take over, or that NTUC is  not

giving employment.  Yes, they are giving employment, but  the

SMEs,  the small shopkeepers, are actually having a lot  more

employment,  and if NTUC is coming in aggressively,  it  will

cause   these  small  businessmen  to  close  shop  and   the

unemployment figure will actually go up.  So I am asking what

kind  of  solution can be given.  Maybe it is a  question  of

balance, rather than stopping them totally.  It is a balance,

an issue which I would like the Minister to address.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Steve Chia sees NTUC as part of the

problem.   Many others would see it as part of the  solution,

particularly as other Members have rightly pointed  out  that

NTUC   has  gained  considerable  goodwill  from  their  past

practices.  Recently, they said they would absorb next year's

increase in GST for one year.  Mr Chia seems to suggest  that

if  NTUC  moves out of the way, then our SMEs would  survive.

That is clearly not the case.  The competition will come, and

in  the  form  of competitors who would likely charge  higher

prices,  and  who are not likely to pass on  the  rebates  to

their  members.   I  think the record  for  NTUC  speaks  for

itself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I am not saying that NTUC

should close shop or reduce their size, but rather a balanced

approach  may  be taken and maybe considering limiting  their

growth  and  expansion aggressively to let the  SMEs  have  a

chance to grow.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, Mr Chia assumes that NTUC is a

bigger fish compared to SMEs.  But I put across the point  to

him  that when NTUC moves out of the way, a bigger fish would

come along.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few years ago, the factories in Singapore had

difficulty recruiting workers.  They had to offer  all  sorts

of incentives to attract workers to work there.  But now, the

situation is reversed. It was reported in the newspaper  that

someone  has  claimed  to  own a factory  which  manufactures

handphones  and pagers, and placed an advertisement  inviting

job-seekers to go for interview at a HDB flat.  A few hundred

applicants  actually went to the HDB flat and found  that  it

was a hoax.  In the past, if you asked job-seekers to go to a

HDB  flat  to be interviewed for a factory job, nobody  would

fall  for  it.   Yet, in this instance, a few hundred  people

were  fooled.   It  just shows that they were  desperate  for

jobs, as jobs are hard to come by nowadays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to hear cases of employment agencies cheating on

foreign workers, but now even our own local workers are being

fooled.  I hope the Ministry of Manpower would look into  the

matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, actually I want to raise my

concern  about  the quality of service of maid agencies,  but

the  answer  was given by the Minister just now  and  here  I

would  like  to  thank the Minister for giving the  assurance

that  the service quality of maid agencies will be accredited

through the system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, Mr Seng Han Thong brought up a

relevant  point.   MOM empathises with those  who  have  been

cheated.  There are currently, as Mr Ong Ah Heng pointed  out

earlier, 11,000 licensed employment agencies in Singapore, of

which  the  majority, about 700, deal with  foreign  domestic

workers.  My Minister has made the point that we are going to

strengthen that particular sector by working with CASE on the

foreign  domestic workers.  In terms of the other  employment

agencies,  we  will  continue  to  increase  our  enforcement

agencies, as well as to facilitate these agencies to  improve

their performance.  But I think a word of caution is required

for  the public.  There will always be companies who will try

to  capitalise on aspirations and hope, especially  when  the

downturn is severe.  I think the public will have to be  wary

because sometimes these fly-by-night operators can do it very

quickly  and  you get cheated.  If there are instances  where

the  public  feels that they are cheated, they  can  approach

MOM.   We  will conciliate, we will also refer  them  to  the

Small  Claims  Tribunal,  but I  think  they  would  have  to

exercise   substantial  caution  when  dealing   with   these

agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Concept Plan 2001 has put forward a vision to

make  Singapore  a dynamic, distinctive and delightful  city.

To



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



be  a  global city, we must provide more flexibility  in  our

land  use  planning  so  that  we  are  able  to  make  quick

adjustments to better fulfil the development requirements  of

future  industries and aspirations of our people.   High-rise

and  high-density office and housing are planned to cater for

future  needs.   This  will  indirectly  exert  pressure   to

demolish existing low plot ratio developments.  One  area  of

concern  is a loss of identity and heritage when we transform

housing estates and commercial developments into skyscrapers.

We  must make efforts to retain our identity and heritage  so

as to build a sense of belonging among our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek the following clarifications from

the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What are the key performance indicators to measure

the achievement of the vision in the Concept Plan 2001?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What are the specific strategies and plans for

preserving our heritage and identity?

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, Concept Plan 2001 has

identified  the  need  to focus on the  identity  of  places,

neighbourhoods which are of distinct character or centres  of

social and commercial activity.  This is a welcome move.   It

is  a  clear  acknowledgement of the fact that  Singaporeans'

sense of ownership, rootedness to this place derives not just

from  kinship  ties and other experience of growing  up,  but

also from the physical relief or landscape of our country.  I

know  that  this  is  a  challenge, especially  in  an  urban

context.   We do not have large natural reserves or mountains

and valleys, and yet we seek to at least capture some element

of nostalgia and the history of our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that being said and acknowledging the good

intention embodied in the Concept Plan, there are a  few  key

questions that have been raised.  They fall into three  broad

categories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is criteria. The question really is what

qualifies a neighbourhood as, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>



quote  the  URA,  "a one of a kind neighbourhood",  which  is

worthy  of  such preservation.  The URA has identified  Jalan

Leban in Upper Thomson and Anak Bukit, Beauty World area,  as

examples  of these "one of a kind" neighbourhoods.   Yet,  we

have  also  seen places like, say, Taman Serasi, being  ruled

out  as  worthy of conservation.  And yet it could be  argued

that   those   areas   have  similar   emotional   ties   for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what is the criterion in identifying

such neighbourhoods?  If it can be made more transparent,  it

would  be  helpful for all Singaporeans in  having  a  common

level   of   understanding.   That  would  also   help   them

participate more meaningfully in the process, which brings me

to  my  next point - how are Singaporeans able to participate

in this process, to be meaningfully involved?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The URA has done a good job in terms of consultation on

its  Master Plan, Development Guide Plans, Concept Plan,  and

so  on,  through various channels (feedback sessions  and  so

on).  But it could be argued that Singaporeans feel left out,

partly  because these macro plans do not quite resonate  with

Singaporeans.   We  do not really think in such  big  picture

terms,   in  general.   We  worry  about  what  is   in   our

neighbourhood,  in  our  immediate  locality,  what  we   are

comfortable  with.  At the same time, it could also  be  said

that  this is a rather intimidating way of seeking legitimate

views on what people consider to be worthy of preservation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what can we do, in terms of process, to

enhance  the involvement of Singaporeans - active citizens  - who  would like to preserve certain nostalgic neighbourhoods,

because   they  think  that  would  add  to  the   collective

experience of Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, there is a question of what will happen

after  we  have identified such neighbourhoods.  I think  the

fear  in  the  hearts  of  many is  that  in  the  Government

departments,  there is a rather clinical perspective  of  the

term "preservation".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>



Once  a  place  has been identified as an  area  we  want  to

preserve,  we  clean it up, we white-wash the  buildings,  we

sanitise the place, and in the process we render it devoid of

the  very  character perhaps that it had, which  merited  the

treatment of it as a special place.  And that is the question

that  needs  to  be  addressed clearly, which  requires  some

stoicism  on  the part of the URA officials  to  be  able  to

tolerate some level of messiness in the environment, so  that

we can still carry on and enjoy messiness, which is a part of

the character of these neighbourhoods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know, therefore, how we are going to be

able to preserve that character and what sort of measures are

in  place  to  ensure that we do not lose that charm  in  the

process of identifying and preserving old neighbourhoods.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Amy Khor, you have got two cuts. You

can take them together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the Government

owns   an  estimated  90%  of  land  in  Singapore  and  this

proportion is set to grow due to reclamation and acquisition.

In  this  light, the Government's Land Sales (GLS)  programme

has  been a crucial tool of the macro-economic management  of

Singapore's property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLS has been frozen for the past one year in

recognition  of weak market conditions.  When announcing  the

freeze  in  GLS last year, the Ministry also implemented  the

Reserve  List system which allows developers to apply  for  a

site  on the list by indicating a price.  If this price meets

the  URA's reserve price, then the land would be released for

tender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should be commended for the Reserve List

which  has proven to be a very effective and efficient  tool,

where the market dictates when a site is to be released,  not

unlike  the  HDB's build-to-order system.  The  Reserve  List

allows  supply to be triggered by demand and is thus  a  more

responsive system of land allocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It thus injects flexibility into the GLS programme which

hitherto has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



largely  rigid  and lags behind fluctuations  in  the  market

because  the  programme is underpinned by  prior  assumptions

about   market   demand  which  may  not  materialise.    The

consequences of a demand and supply mismatch are most clearly

illustrated in the more than 16,000 private residential units

which have been launched or are ready to be launched and have

not been sold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how the Ministry

intends to determine the supply of land for each use  in  the

immediate future when it resumes its GLS programme next  year

and  in  the medium and long term.  I would also like to  ask

the Minister what form the GLS is likely to take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the supply of State land for various

uses, it is important for the Government to take into account

all land and real estate that will be put into the market  by

the  various Government agencies, such as JTC, HDB,  SLA  and

LTA, besides URA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "infamous" Turf City project, which drew much flak

from developers and retailers in the area, as well as the One

North  project and most recently the Ang Mo Kio  Centre  site

which  was  directly allocated to the SLF,  are  examples  of

major  projects  launched  or  announced  recently  that  are

outside  the  GLS  programme, but  which  constitute  a  very

significant supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to coordinate such releases and include

such projects into the URA's published statistics to give  an

accurate picture of supply conditions.  These numbers  should

also  be  taken into account in the GLS programme.  The  Turf

City  project, for instance, added approximately one  million

square feet of retail space into the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by the Prime Minister recently in a press

interview with Asian editors, there is a need for a more  and

even  better statistics on real estate so that investors  and

developers do not overbid for property thinking that there is

strong demand and/or lack of supply, and then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



contribute  towards not just inflation but over-inflation  in

property prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, I would like to suggest that all land

supply   allocation  policies  be  coordinated  by  a  single

Government body, at least for each major property sub-market,

for  instance, URA for housing and commercial,  and  JTC  for

industrial.  This will yield a more coherent policy for  each

property  sector, better accountability, more  certainty  and

transparency  on  total supply from both private  and  public

sectors  and  allow for quicker responses to changes  in  the

specific markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in determining the form that the GLS

programme will take when it is re-launched, I would  like  to

suggest to the Ministry to consider enlarging the role of the

Reserve List system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, the Reserve List should rightly be considered

as  actual  land  supply  since the sites  on  the  list  are

available for sale at any time as long as there is  at  least

one  interested party willing to pay at or above the  reserve

price.   The Reserve List is useful as it injects flexibility

into  the GLS programme by allowing demand to be directed  by

the   market.   The  Reserve  List  should  thus  remain  and

complement the GLS programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the largest land owner in Singapore, the

Government is for good or ill the single most dominant player

in  the property market.  The GLS programme is the key  means

by  which the Government supplies land to the private  sector

and thus must be managed carefully, so that volatility in the

property market can be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go on to my second cut, Sir. Before I forget,

which  I  did  earlier, let me, first, declare  my  interest,

because I am actually in the property industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's system of selling land via tender

or   auction,  with  a  minimum  reserve  price,  has  always

attracted   much   attention  from   investors,   developers,

businessmen and the public alike, and has been the  brunt  of

much criticism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>



This  is  not  surprising, given that the Government  is  the

single  largest  land owner in Singapore  and  also  the  key

supplier of land, as I had noted earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, much attention has again been given in the

press  and  in this House on the Government's land  sale  and

pricing policies.  These policies have been much maligned  as

the ultimate cause of high costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fellow MP, Mr Inderjit Singh, had on Monday

identified  the  Government's  land  sales  policy  and   the

approach  of  reserve pricing as one of the three  Government

policy  levers that has created a vicious cost  circle,  with

the  high  cost  of owning properties driving  the  need  for

higher  wages, which add to business costs.  This is  also  a

common  refrain among many businessmen, especially SMEs,  who

feel  that the recent tax measures do not help them  if  they

are  not making a profit and that they are being squeezed out

by high costs, including land costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not fully subscribe to Mr Singh's argument

but,  nevertheless, think that the Government's land  pricing

policy  formula  should be revised.  Under  the  Government's

land tender system with reserve prices, the land is generally

not   awarded  unless  it  hits  the  predetermined   minimum

threshold  price,  which the URA has said is  15%  below  the

reserve   price.   This  reserve  price  implies   that   the

Government   is   setting  a  benchmark  for   land   prices.

Businessmen often question why the land cannot be awarded  to

the  highest bidder as long as there is more than one bidder.

The  reply, as I understand it, has been that the State land,

being  a  scarce resource, should be optimally  utilised  and

awarding the site at less than reserve price (within the  15%

margin)  is  fiscally impossible.  Why should the  Government

let  the  private  sector gain at the expense  of  the  State

because he gets it for a "song"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, developers and investors have also

commented that the Government should be more transparent and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>



reveal  the reserve price at the outset, which is already  in

place for many private land tender and auctions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would thus like to ask the Ministry if it would be

refining  its  land  tender  system  in  response  to   these

concerns.   I  would like to suggest that  as  a  first  step

towards  more transparency and efficiency, as well  as  avoid

unnecessary  waste of resources, the Ministry could  consider

having and publishing reserve prices for the sites under  the

GLS  programme when the sites are launched for  sale.   After

all,  developers  would already have  an  indication  of  the

reserve  price  of a site under a Reserve  List  when  it  is

launched  for sale upon a successful application.   Moreover,

as  noted  earlier, reserve prices are also largely in  place

for private land tenders and auctions.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Minister could also adopt a more

flexible policy and widen the band around the reserve prices,

say, from 15-25% particularly for sites which serve strategic

objectives  and where there is more than one bidder  so  that

actual supply will not be stifled and developers will not  be

denied  the opportunity to earn their rewards for  taking  on

risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that this has already been done in

the case of the two sites at Marina South that have been sold

by tender.  I would therefore urge the Minister to adopt this

as a more sustained policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, the Singapore property

market  has  declined significantly over the last  few  years

from  its  peak.   Many owners who had bought their  property

during  the  few  years  before 1996  are  now  saddled  with

negative equity.  There is concern that prices should not  be

allowed to fall further as this would affect the net worth of

all  home  owners.  The relevant Government agencies  -  MND,

SLA, URA, JTC, HDB and CPF Board - must therefore be cautious

not  to  trigger  another  drop from  these  levels,  thereby

bursting  the property bubble and bringing about a  prolonged

downward



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>



spiral and asset deflation, like in the case of Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the word "bubble" is meaningful. It is not a

balloon where one can let out air when it is too inflated and

let in air when it has room to grow.  One cannot say, let  us

lower property prices by 30% and be certain that prices  will

come  down  30%, and no more, no less.  A bubble is  fragile.

There  is a real danger of this bubble bursting in our faces.

But  being  cautious does not mean the Government  should  be

paralysed from acting for fear that the property bubble  will

burst.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property prices are still relatively high. High land

prices  will translate into higher costs for everything  that

is  related to land, add to our business costs and erode  our

competitiveness.  The issue we have to tackle is  how  do  we

ensure that the stability of the market is maintained and yet

introduce  lower  cost land use so as to  bring  about  lower

usage cost.  For one, URA can be more flexible on the use  of

space  and have a lighter touch on its rules and enforcement.

We  should also study other countries, like the United States

and Hong Kong, to see how they use space flexibly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our planning norms need to be changed. We need

to push as far to the margins as possible to maximise the use

and  the returns on our land resources.  High land cost is  a

real  concern.  I think we can slice this problem in a number

of  ways  and come out with creative ways to solve  it.   The

Executive  Condominium concept was a brilliant  solution,  at

that  time,  to  bridge  the  gap  between  HDB  and  private

condominium.   It  means buying an apple  now  and  10  years

later,  when  the restrictions are lifted, it turns  into  an

orange.   There  is an element of subsidy.  By modifying  the

restrictions  and the title of the land, the  Government  has

sold  a piece of land, which physically is the same property,

for  lower price by artificially imposing man-made rules  and

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for his views on the

present state of the property market and whether his Ministry

has any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>



policy  or  plans to bring about better and more  competitive

usage of land.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my key point is one of keeping

property prices affordable.  There have been recent calls  by

some  section of our society to allow property prices to rise

again, particularly, developers.  The Government on its  part

has  been party to trying to keep the property prices  higher

than  necessary by, first of all, slowing down  the  sale  of

land  and, secondly, by lifting the anti-speculation measures

first  put  in place after the property bubble of  the  1990s

became untenable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-speculation measures were a good move. The

intention  at that time in 1996 was to remove the speculative

element  in property prices and allow market forces to  rule.

I  was  therefore  disappointed when the Government  got  the

'cold  feet'  and  went on to remove all the anti-speculation

measures  in an attempt to prop up property prices.   As  the

phrase  "prop up" indicates, it is an artificial measure  and

by  propping,  it  does  not  allow  true  market  forces  to

determine and settle property prices.  I have dealt at length

on  the  impact of the asset enhancement policy of the  1990s

and  will  not repeat it again.  I am afraid that removal  of

the  measures seems to indicate that the Government  has  too

short a memory of the property bubble problem of the 1990s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not denying that, in land scarce Singapore, prices

of  land  and properties have to go up, but in our  case  the

prices went up a little too much.  The Government has all the

levers  to fix the problem.  The first lever is the  rate  of

release  of land for development; the second is the price  of

new  HDB  flats; the third is the limit on the proportion  of

CPF  that  can be used for investing in properties;  and  the

fourth   is   putting  in  place  permanent  anti-speculative

measures.  For the last lever, the Government should stick to

its  original  objectives and that the  fundamental  strategy

should be to curb speculation in the property market, whether

times are good or bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply to the Member's questions on the use of CPF

for housing, the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>



for Manpower highlighted that some Singaporeans over-invested

in  properties for the purpose of speculative gains  (and  he

used the words "speculative gains" when he replied) and it is

this  category of people who are now in real difficulties  as

their property values have decreased.  I therefore wonder why

the  Minister for National Development has once again created

a   "death  trap"  for  Singaporeans  by  lifting  the  anti-speculative measures.  There seems to be a disconnect in  the

Government's thinking on this issue.  I urge the Minister  to

relook  at  the whole issue and put in place once  again  the

relevant  anti-speculative measures  so  that  we  can  avoid

getting  into  the same problem again down the  road.   After

all,  speculation  is undesirable for any situation,  or  for

anything that we do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, let me, first of all, address the Members' concerns

about  the Concept Plan and our land use policy.  Then  after

that, I will deal with the issue of property prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, let me explain the purpose of the

Concept Plan and what the Concept Plan is all about.  It is a

strategic  land use plan that helps us to map out  the  long-term  physical development of Singapore.  By long term, I  am

talking about 40 to 50 years, and it will affect, to a  large

extent,  how  Singaporeans live, work and play.   Because  of

this,  when  URA prepared the Concept Plan, it  undertook  an

extensive part of the consultation exercise in preparing  for

this plan.  In addition to this, there were also considerable

inputs  gathered from professionals, both locally as well  as

overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Concept Plan is not an exercise in forecasting

the  future.  We cannot forecast the future.  Rather it is  a

kind  of  road map that guides us as we move into the future.

So as the road takes unforeseen twists and turns, so too must

we  adjust.   This is the reason why we say that we  have  to

review  the Concept Plan every 10 years, and the last  review

was done in 2001.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having completed this Concept Plan review, the next step

is  to now proceed to review the Master Plan.  Let me explain

what the Master Plan is as opposed to the Concept Plan.   The

Master  Plan is reviewed once every five years.  And what  it

does  is  that  it  translates the strategic  vision  of  the

Concept  Plan  into a specific actual land use plan  for  the

whole of Singapore.  And this is not for 40-50 years, we  are

talking  about the immediate as well as the medium term.   So

from  the Concept Plan, we break it down into land use  plans

for  the various districts in Singapore and we call this  the

Master  Plan.   And  this Master Plan is revised  every  five

years.   The last one was done in 1998.  So the next  one  is

due next year, 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the Master Plan is of considerable interest to

the  general  public  and,  in particular,  to  the  property

owners.  Because if you are a property owner, from the Master

Plan you will be able to establish what you can use your land

for,  how intensively you can develop that land and also  the

kind  of land use in your neighbourhood so that you will know

what is going on around you.  As Members have noted, URA,  in

preparing   the   Concept   Plan,  underwent   an   extensive

consultation exercise and it is going to do the same for  the

Master  Plan  review,  in  other words,  consult  the  public

extensively so that the Master Plan can take the interest  of

various parties into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably, in the course of consulting the public, what

is  going  to  happen is that there will  be  many  different

points   of   view   that  will  surface  between   different

individuals and different groups.  For example, an owner in a

landed  housing estate wants to have a higher plot ratio  for

his  land.  In fact, we constantly receive many requests from

landed  property  owners  asking  for  plot  ratios   to   be

intensified.  But his neighbour may not agree, his  neighbour

may  not  want  to  have  a  taller  building,  changing  the

character of his estate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the point that Mr Ong Kian Min brought up about

change of use, this is a common issue.  Many small businesses

want to convert, they want to use residential properties  for

commercial use, etc,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>



so  they  ask  for flexibility in their land use,  with  good

intention.  Because what they want is to be able to keep  the

costs  of  business  down.  But, inevitably,  there  will  be

complaints  from  neighbours.  It causes  disamenity  to  the

estate.  It brings more traffic into the estate, and  so  on.

So  there  is always this constant tussle between  one  group

wanting  one  thing and another group wanting  another.   One

group  may  lobby strongly for conservation.   They  want  to

preserve  the social memory of the place, they want to  leave

everything untouched.  But the owners of the property may not

be  interested in conservation and preserving  memory.   What

they want is to be able to redevelop their land, to bring  in

more activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these examples go to show the dilemma that

confronts  URA  when we review the Master Plan, particularly,

when  we  have  many diverse interests which are conflicting.

After  considering all these views, URA must make a decision,

and  this  decision  has  to strike a balance  between  these

diverse  views in as fair a manner as possible  and,  at  the

same  time, assure that the needs of competing land uses and,

of   course,   the   national  interests   are   taken   into

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I come to a point raised by Mr Iswaran on

the  question about identity, how do we preserve heritage and

identity,   how   do   we  choose,  how  would   Singaporeans

participate  in the process and what happens  after  we  have

identified  various areas.  Do we run the risk of  making  it

overly  clinical,  rendering it devoid of  character,  as  Mr

Iswaran  mentioned just now?  I am pleased to inform both  Dr

Teo  and Mr Iswaran that the new Master Plan 2003 will  place

its  greater  emphasis  on the issues  of  identity  and  the

quality of our living environment.  Let me elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, on the identity plan. Yes, I agree that,

as  Singapore develops, as Singapore grows into a world-class

city,   we  need  to  establish  certain  things  which   are

distinctive and unique to Singapore, familiar places,  places

which represent our shared identity and our social memory.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the Master Plan Review 2003, an island-wide identity plan is being prepared which will take stock of

all  such  significant roads across the  island.   Guidelines

will  be proposed to reinforce the existing character so that

whoever  develops these areas must ensure that the  character

of  these places is not inadvertently eroded.  Some of  these

areas  naturally spring to mind: Anak Bukit is one  of  them,

along  Bukit Timah Road.  Those of you who are familiar  with

Anak  Bukit will know that this is a place which is  rich  in

local  identity  and significance.  It is  a  little  village

centre, a little kampong for people living in the Upper Bukit

Timah area.  It has got a sizable cluster of shophouses.   It

has got many popular eating places, many retail shops.  It is

also a place where many of Singapore's older shopping centres

are.  So URA is proposing to retain the character of the area

by  retaining  the low-scale developments and  allowing  more

space for outdoor dining.  Hopefully, this will reinforce the

liveliness of the area.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking at similar plans for other areas, such as

Katong, and Jalan Leban along Upper Thomson Road.  Mr Iswaran

asked  how  do we choose such places.  Why not Taman  Serasi?

Why  not,  indeed?  If there are other places which can  lend

themselves  to  such  efforts, by  all  means  surface  them,

because  the process does not start and stop with  URA.   The

identification of these places is not the end of  the  story.

What we want is to be able to create more vibrancy, more buzz

in these areas, while retaining their existing charm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, yes, I also agree with Mr Iswaran that we must be

mindful  that we do not, as he put it, be too clinical  about

it  such that we render these places devoid of character.  We

will  be  mindful that we do not overdo it, that we will  not

over-plan,  and that we will not destroy the very essence  of

the place that we are trying to preserve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also explain to the House what else we are doing,

in terms of trying to enhance the quality of our environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



There   is  a  Parks  and  Waterbodies  Plan  that  will   be

incorporated as part of the Master Plan review, and  this  is

now being prepared, the idea being to make our existing parks

more  accessible  and  also to open up previously  unexplored

areas  for recreational activities.  I remember Dr Teo making

this  point earlier about how inaccessible some of our  parks

are.  That is a valid point.  To the extent possible, we will

try  to  open  up  more of our existing  parks  but,  equally

importantly, there is an opportunity for us now  to  open  up

previously  inaccessible  areas.  For  example,  the  Central

Catchment  area.   One  proposal is to open  up  the  Central

Catchment area by introducing more trails through the forests

and  boardwalks along the waterfront.  There will  be  a  new

canopy  walk,  which  we constructed  to  offer  a  different

experience  of  the Central Catchment area.  Of  course,  all

these  plans  will  have  to be discussed  with  the  various

relevant  agencies,  to  make sure  that,  for  example,  the

environment of the Central Catchment is protected,  in  order

not  to  compromise our water quality.  There will  be  other

parks being planned.  Woodlands will see a new regional park.

In  Sengkang, along Sungei Ponggol, there will be a  riverine

park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are trying to create different types of parks to

cater  to  different interests and with different facilities.

As  these  plans  are intended to reflect  the  character  of

places that are meaningful to our people, I assure Mr Iswaran

that  URA  will  consult  widely.  It  will  consult  a  wide

spectrum  of Singaporeans when we put together this  Identity

Plan and the Parks and Waterbodies Plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April this year, URA has begun seeking inputs from

advisers  and  grassroots  leaders  in  preparing  the  draft

proposals.   But, as we are well aware, such  things  can  be

very subjective.  Things like social memory and identity mean

different things to different people.  It has to depend  very

much  on individual experiences.  So what we are going to  do

is  to  prepare  the  draft plans and,  thereafter,  we  will

exhibit these plans sometime towards the middle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



or  later part of this year, and people will be encouraged to

come  and visit these exhibitions and to give us their  views

and  inputs.  This public feedback that is gathered will then

be  incorporated into a Draft Master Plan.  This Draft Master

Plan  will then be exhibited, region by region, because as  I

explained  earlier, these are rather detailed plans.   So  we

are  going to exhibit them, region by region, probably in the

first half of next year.  This is another opportunity for the

public  to  offer their views.  After all this is  done,  URA

will  finalise the Master Plan, and that will be towards  the

end of next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can see, Sir, that this is a rather lengthy but

important, worthwhile and necessary process because,  through

this process, I hope that the final plan can truly be a joint

project of the URA and its stakeholders.  By stakeholders,  I

am  talking of course of Singaporeans, people who live,  work

and play in these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the comments made by various Members

about  the property market and, particularly, about the  role

of the Government in the property market.  Mr Inderjit Singh,

in  particular, suggested that changes be made to  Government

policies in order to lower land and property costs, so as  to

boost  our  economic competitiveness.  He said  that  if  the

Government  has all the levers in place, it will be  able  to

control property prices.  Can the Government control property

prices?  On the surface of it, the answer is yes.  One way is

for  us to flood the market with land, and prices will  react

immediately.  We may even bring property prices down by  30%,

as suggested by Mr Inderjit Singh as being a desirable target

to achieve.  However, as Mr Ong Kian Min rightly pointed out,

is it going to stop there at 30%?  But that is another story.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the outcome of this, if we were to do

that,  assuming  we wanted to do that?  Some businesses  will

benefit  in  the short term from lower property  prices,  and

those  who  are  not property owners currently will  rejoice.

But many existing land and property owners will face a sudden

drop in the value of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>



their  assets,  with  serious  financial  consequences.    Mr

Inderjit  Singh, I think, acknowledges this.   But,  just  to

give  a  rough  idea  of  what I mean  by  serious  financial

consequences.    I   did   a   rough   back-of-the   envelope

calculation.  If we just take HDB flats, for example.   There

are  800,000 flats and, very conservatively, we value it  at,

say,  about $200,000 per flat.  There are 3-room flats  which

are about $150,000, 4-room flats, about $200,000-250,000, and

5-room   flats,  $350,000.   But  if  I  just  take  a   very

conservative $200,000 per flat, for 800,000 flats, a 30% drop

in  prices means that we wipe out $48 billion worth of value!

And that is not a laughing matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the end of the story. Because land is

limited  in  Singapore, no matter how much we  reclaim  land,

even with all the current reclamation that we are planning to

do  and,  if possible technically, we can reclaim  even  more

land. [Interruption.]  Even if we were to be able to do  that

and  -  if Mr Low has any good ideas, he could let me know  - eventually,  our  limited land supply will mean  that  prices

will  start  moving up again as the supply is used  up.   And

what  do we do then to bring down land prices, if indeed that

is  the  key  to  our competitiveness?  Mr  Inderjit  Singh's

suggestion is a well-intentioned one.  His point is  that  if

we bring down land prices we will regain our competitiveness.

But I suggest to him that his medicine will probably kill the

patient before he cures him.  Sir, we need to be mindful that

we  are  a  nation  of homeowners.  90% of  Singaporeans  own

homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with Mr Ong that it is very important that we

maintain a stable property market in Singapore and, in  order

for  us  to  do  so,  we  need to have  a  right  balance  of

Government measures to achieve this desirable objective.  The

question then is: what are these measures?  What role can the

Government play in the property market?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been very specific comments made by various

Members,  Dr  Amy Khor particularly, about the  GLS  and  the

reserve  price, the use of the Reserve List,  etc.   I  would

like to address some of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



issues  now  when talking about what role the Government  can

play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let us start from basics. What is the

objective  of  the  Government?  The  key  objective  of  the

Government  surely  must be to sustain economic  growth.   In

this  regard, our land policy must be to make available  land

for  development through the Government Land Sales programme,

such  that we are able to sustain economic growth and not  to

just control property prices.  Dr Amy Khor asked how land  is

supplied  under  the  Government Land Sales  programme.   The

Government Land Sales programme seeks to ensure that there is

a  steady supply of land to meet the demand for various parts

of the economy, for various uses - commercial, industrial and

residential.  How do we determine the supply?  We  take  into

account  factors, such as household formation rate, potential

supply  in the pipeline, and the average take-up rate.   And,

if  we  have  a  sufficient and steady supply of  land,  then

prices will not escalate sharply, and the market will be more

stable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all realise, there will be circumstances when the

Government  may  have  to intervene.  These  are  exceptional

circumstances when there are abnormal trends in  the  market.

For  example,  in the mid-90s, when speculation became  rife,

the  Government introduced anti-speculation measures in 1996,

because we recognised that it is not healthy when speculation

causes  a  property bubble to build up.  After  the  property

bubble was pricked, some of these measures were removed.  Why

were  they removed?  For the simple reason that there was  no

longer  any  evidence of property speculation and  there  was

ample  supply  in the market.  By releasing sufficient  land,

and  by  intervening when necessary, the Government  aims  to

provide  a  stable property market environment for businesses

to   operate  in.   And  some  of  the  desirable   operating

conditions for businesses are stability and predictability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we recognise that it is difficult to determine

demand accurately because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



market  is  dynamic.  This is why we introduced  the  Reserve

List  system last year, in order to enable the GLS  programme

to  be more responsive to market demand, as Dr Amy Khor said.

With  this system, reserved sites will be released  for  land

when developers apply for them.  So our GLS system allows the

market  the flexibility to adjust the amount of supply  which

it  can  readily absorb.  Dr Amy Khor did allude to the  fact

that  we  should  expand the Reserve List.   I  am  not  sure

whether  she  meant  getting rid of the Confirmed  List.   We

already  have a substantial Reserve List, but we would  still

like  to  keep the Confirmed List, because it is not  just  a

matter of supplying land through the GLS programme.  The  GLS

programme is also a tool for the Government to steer  private

capital to achieve certain specific development objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one example: the new Downtown. It is our

intention  to  expand the existing Central Business  District

into the new Downtown area in Marina South.  In so doing,  we

want  to develop Singapore into a business and financial hub.

We  have put in a lot of infrastructure into the new Downtown

to  support this expansion.  For example, the common services

tunnel  has  been laid, the MRT is going in there,  and  many

other  services are going in, in order to allow  us  to  move

development into this area.  So, the Confirmed List will help

us  to steer office development towards the new Downtown, and

that  will  align  it  with  our plans  for  a  business  and

financial hub in the area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to manage the overall supply through both

the Confirmed List and the Reserve List.  I do agree with  Dr

Khor when she says that when we have allocations of land, eg,

Turf  City  as well as the SLF land in Ang Mo Kio, we  should

take  these into account in our overall land supply.  I would

like  to  assure  her  that we do.  The  SLF  land  has  been

allocated because the Government wants to redevelop  the  Ang

Mo  Kio Interchange area.  There is a lot of quantum which is

being provided for the unions to use.  Whatever is left  over

is being used by the private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>



sector, but that quantum is minimal.  Even then, that quantum

is  being adjusted and taken into account in the GLS.  So  we

will do this in order to make sure that the market knows  how

much  land is available.  Giving you another example, we have

indicated  that we are looking into the release  of  a  large

site for an integrated development at the new Downtown.   The

details  are  still being worked out by the  Economic  Review

Committee.   But  I can say that we will not be  implementing

the  project this year but when we do, again, the supply from

this development will be factored into the GLS programme.  It

will take into account the floor space that is generated from

this  integrated development.  We will, of course, also  make

sure  when  the  project is implemented,  that  it  will  not

destabilise the property market.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the reserve price. Dr Khor

commented  that  the  GLS  does  not  give  us  an  idea   of

Government's reserve price and that, to a certain extent, the

reserve  price  system has caused prices to go  up.   Let  me

explain  why we set a reserve price for our land  sales.   It

again goes back to the fundamental principle that State  land

is  an  asset that belongs to the people.  As a custodian  of

the people's assets, the Government has the responsibility to

ensure that land is disposed of at its true market value  and

this means setting a reserve price to ensure that our land is

not sold off for a song.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But reserve prices are not cast in stone. They change

with  market conditions. So when the economy goes up,  prices

go  up,  and when the economy is not doing well, prices  come

down.   I think she is aware, for example, that when we  sold

two  sites  in the new Downtown, one was sold in March  2001,

the  price was $3,100 per square metre of floor area.   Then,

just earlier this week, we awarded the second site for $2,400

per  square metre of floor area.  In other words, the  market

recognises  that  prices  have  come  down.   Similarly,  the

reserve  price has also come down and this is the reason  why

we were able to award both these sites.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor also proposed that perhaps we should not have

just  one  reserve price - we should have a  band.   This  is

already  being  done.  We recognise that the  Chief  Valuer's

reserve price is not an absolute figure, it is not absolutely

precise.   This  is the reason why we have a  band.   If  the

tender  price  is above 85% of the Chief Valuer's  price,  we

will  award the site.  This 15% band is considered to  be  an

acceptable range by valuers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by assuring the House that the

Government  is  fully  conscious  of  the  need  to  maintain

Singapore's economic competitiveness.  We will make sure that

there  is sufficient land to meet the demand from all sectors

of  our economy.  To ensure that we remain price competitive,

we  regularly  benchmark  our  property  values  and  rentals

against other major cities.  Just to give you an example.  In

the case of commercial properties, there was a survey done in

January this year and Singapore ranked 31st amongst the major

world  cities in terms of cost of office space.   Our  office

rentals were cheaper than several major Asian cities, such as

Tokyo,  Hong Kong, Taipei and Beijing.  Admittedly,  we  were

more expensive than Shanghai, Delhi and KL.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore will never be as cheap as some other

countries which have a large land mass, and we cannot compete

on  property prices and those alone.  We have many  strategic

competitive advantages. We have a stable political and social

environment.  We  have a world-class business infrastructure.

We   have   a   highly  trained  workforce  and   unsurpassed

connectivity to business opportunities regionally and beyond.

At  the  same  time, we have a Government that is responsive,

pro-business  and willing to change, whether it is  reviewing

our  tax regime or attracting high value-added industries  or

facilitating   business  opportunities,  both   locally   and

overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a lot going for us. It is not necessary to

deliberately  depress  the  true market  value  of  land  and

destabilise the property market and it is not in our interest

to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, can I seek some clarification?

I  would  like to ask the Minister whether he is now  willing

for  a  speculation to once again take place in the  property

market  since he says that it is no longer an issue  and  all

the  measures have been lifted, and whether he is willing  to

wait for another bubble to build up before doing something to

moderate future prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, if and when such a development

takes place, the Government will act appropriately.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, our present HDB housing policy is

too rigid and lacks flexibility to promote family members  to

stay  together.  The Registration for Flats System  does  not

give  home-buyers  much choice to select a  flat  near  their

parents or siblings. The five-year minimum occupation  period

prevents  home-owners to sell their new flats when they  need

to  move  near  their  family members.  The  10-year  minimum

qualifying period does not allow parents to upgrade and  stay

with  their children applying for new flats.  There are  many

other  restrictions which do not facilitate families to  stay

near one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to review our housing policy to make them

more family-friendly.  If families were to be a pillar of our

society,  we must facilitate Singaporeans to stay  within  or

near  their  family members. This will be  crucial  when  our

population ages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What percentage of HDB dwellers is staying within

two kilometres of their family members?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the long-term plan of HDB to facilitate

families to stay near one another?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will HDB provide more flexibility for families to

convert their flats to accommodate multi-tier family living?

high percentage of public home ownership, there is a need  to

re-evaluate some aspects of our housing policy which may have

become  less  relevant.  The increasing recognition  that  an

entrepreneurial culture is needed for the new  economy  would

also  make  it desirable to separate the investment component

of  home  ownership from the utility component of a  dwelling

house.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While home ownership helps to give a sense of

rootedness,  asset enhancement policies, which emphasise  the

investment   component  of  home  ownership,  may   encourage

speculation.   Put differently, why bother to work  hard  and

take  risk  in  business when one can potentially  make  more

money  punting  on  properties, like punting  on  stocks  and

shares?  This was a phenomenon we witnessed in the run-up  to

the  1996 boom when even HDB flat owners sold their flats  to

unlock cash and then purchased another flat with CPF monies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would thus like to propose two specific

recommendations for the Minister to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the role of HDB. The role of HDB needs to be

reviewed.   Towards this end, I am pleased to note  that  the

Ministry  has already announced that it would be  undertaking

this.  I would thus like to urge the Ministry to undertake  a

comprehensive and thorough review of the role of the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB was created in the sixties with the noble aim of

housing the masses.  Indeed, it has more than fulfilled  this

mission,  with  some 86% of the population living  in  public

housing.   Since its inception, its reach and influence  have

grown.  In fact, it has scope-crept from low cost housing  to

middle income housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, building flats, particularly to house over 80%

of  the  whole population, is exceedingly onerous  since  the

HDB,  like  everybody else, can never perfectly forecast  the

market.   There  are constant risks of the HDB over-building,

such as the 17,500 unsold flats in non-mature estates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



reported  at  the  beginning of the year, and under-building,

such as in 1997 when the queue swelled to 146,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, HDB currently has a labyrinth of rules and

regulations,  such  as  the single  scheme,  extended  family

scheme, walk-in selection, BTO, resale levies, contra  rules,

and  so  on  and  so  forth.  It would  probably  not  be  an

exaggeration to say that the HDB rule book must be about  two

inches  thick!  As at 2nd March 2001, the HDB has  more  than

8,000 employees.  Such a large bureaucratic organisation  may

not  be ideally suited for the rapidly shifting economic  and

social landscape.  Hence, it would be appropriate for HDB  to

re-look at its role and streamline its operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While HDB's role as a provider of affordable mass

housing remains relevant, it should perhaps shrink its target

market at the higher end.  It could, for instance, sell  more

Executive Condominium sites as a step towards increasing  the

proportion  of this housing type.  It can then  re-focus  its

mission  and  efforts on low-income housing.  It  could  also

extend the qualifying criteria for renting its flats so  that

the  needy  do  not  fall through the gaps.  To  redress  the

current   imbalance  of  over  investment  in   housing   and

complaints  about high accommodation costs, it could  perhaps

also  look  at offering flats with shorter lease tenure,  not

unlike the granny HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next recommendation, which is tenure

choice.   The tenure of public housing has an effect  on  the

concept  of the home as an investment.  The 99-year  standard

housing term, while giving security of tenure, encourages the

treatment  of  housing  as  an  investment  more  than  as  a

consumption good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of shorter tenure homes will provide

more  housing  choice  at  different  price  levels  to  suit

different  income  households. There are already  precedents.

For  instance, like I mentioned earlier, HDB's  granny  flats

have  a  15-year old tenure, renewable for another 15  years.

Elsewhere  in Hong Kong and China, 50 or 70-year  leases  for

housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>



are  common.   Hence, shorter tenure, especially  for  public

housing,  should be considered as an option to  increase  the

housing  choice  and  help  to decouple  the  investment  and

consumption function of housing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman,

Sir,  in  order  to understand the single persons'  need  for

housing,  I  have  carried out a survey  among  the  ordinary

citizens, professionals, and even Members of Parliament.  The

result of the survey is as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.6% of those surveyed knew their girlfriends or

boyfriends while they were schooling, 17.6% at the  place  of

work,  and 28% through introduction by friends and relatives.

As  to the ages at which they knew their partners, from  ages

16  to  20:  16.5%, 20 to 30: 80.2%.   It would  appear  that

between  the  ages of 16 and 30 is the best  time  for  young

people to get to know their future spouses.  As for those who

are  still unattached after the age of 31, the vast  majority

of  those  surveyed remarked that they were  too  preoccupied

with their work that they had no time to court or be courted.

In  the  process, they missed the boat - the  love-boat,  and

hence have to remain single.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to create more opportunities for the

single  persons to socialize, to fall in love and to  set  up

families,  I suggest that HDB work out a scheme whereby  each

single person would be allowed to apply for a flat, say, a 3-room  or 4-room flat, and subsequently when two single  flat-owners get married, they would sell back one of the flats  to

HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single residents can also set up some social clubs

on  the  void deck, like the Residents' Committee Centre,  so

that  the  young people could inter-mingle among  themselves,

with  the prospect of leading to future development,  thereby

reducing  the number of singles in our society.  I  hope  the

Minister would consider my suggestion.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> I would also

like to ask about the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



role  of  the  HDB.  The HDB has done well  to  provide  good

quality  homes to Singaporeans.  But I think there is  now  a

decrease in the demand of new purchase flats and also  rental

flats.   In  fact,  in  the recent  offer  of  new  flats  in

Sengkang,  I  am told that there was a low take-up  rate.   I

believe HDB is now scaling down its development of new flats,

and  for  many of the projects, like Main Upgrading Programme

(MUP) and Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP), I think a number

of these projects have been farmed to the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of these developments, I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether he envisages a new  role  for  HDB  in

providing  housing to Singaporeans.  And, in this connection,

if  the  HDB  is  to be downsized, I would like  to  ask  the

Minister for an assurance that the well-being of the  current

HDB staff will be adequately looked after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, affordability of HDB homes. I believe one of the

main reasons for the decrease in demand for HDB flats is  the

pricing  of the new flats.  Many are concerned that  the  new

flats  are  moving  beyond  their affordability.   While  the

property market is softening, the prices of new HDB flats are

steadily increasing.  So I would like to ask the Minister  to

clarify  the pricing policy of the new HDB flats.   Sir,  not

all  Singaporeans are able to purchase their own flats and  I

would  like to ask the Minister to ensure that the  HDB  will

continue  to provide sufficient rental housing, up to  3-room

flats.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, the strong aspiration

for  Singaporeans towards home ownership and  the  increasing

wealth  of many Singaporean families in land-scarce Singapore

over the past few decades, have resulted in an escalation  of

home prices, in the view that the home is an investment whose

value  will increase with time.  The Asian financial  crisis,

followed  shortly  by  the  global economic  recession,  were

instrumental   in   making  many  Singaporeans   review   the

aspiration  to  buy new flats or upgrade their  homes.   With

uncertainties  in the disposable income of families  and  the

downward



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>



pressure  on  home  prices, queues for  public  housing  have

virtually  evaporated, and the visit to  the  Meet-the-People

sessions  to  appeal  for early allocation  of  HDB  flat  is

virtually unheard of now.  Buying a public flat is no more an

investment with guaranteed increase in the value of the flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highly illiquid nature of homes and the high

percentage  of  home ownership present new problems.   In  an

economy  where  many have lost their jobs and are  unable  to

service  their  loans, the absence of a  pent-up  demand  for

public housing, and the presence of a glut in public housing,

presents  an  opportune time for the housing policies  to  be

reviewed.  There are a few areas I would wish the Minister to

consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, reviewing the role of HDB. HDB was created to

meet  the housing needs of Singapore during its early  years.

It  no  longer builds 1- or 2-room flats, but has now evolved

to  build public flats, which are not too far in quality from

that  of  private flats.  This is most evident in  new  towns

like  Punggol  21.  With the queues for public  housing  fast

disappearing, and most Singapore families owning a home,  HDB

has  to  ask itself what is its role in this current economic

and social milieu.  HDB should focus on becoming a regulatory

body, ensuring that the supply, standards, quality and design

of public flats are both in keeping with the aspirations of a

modern  Singapore  family, and to accommodate  the  needs  of

family  units which have become smaller.  It should focus  on

providing  affordable housing for those  who  need  it  most,

including young and low income families.  It should  consider

hiving most of the development and building of high-end flats

to other entities or the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, making public housing more affordable. The

boom  years  of  the mid-1990s, coupled with the  demand  for

bigger and newer flats have resulted in the escalation of the

prices  of public housing flats.  Families which have  placed

bookings for flats find that the flat prices



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



have  escalated by more than 50% by the time they  reach  the

front  of  the  queue, but their incomes have  not  increased

correspondingly.   In  the  past  few  years,  the   battered

Singapore economy has seen significant job layoffs.   It  has

also seen significant depreciation of flat prices.  Over  the

last  year, I have had many new flat owners coming to see  me

because  they  were  unable to service their  housing  loans.

Many  of these families have breadwinners who have lost their

jobs.   They  are in a quandary and are unable to sell  their

flats because they have not met the 5-year occupation period.

They have difficulty meeting their mortgage payments, utility

bills,  conservancy  charges,  and  even  school  fees.   The

problems of these families cannot be resolved so easily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for HDB to review its policy to make public

housing more affordable.  For many of these once proud  home-owners,  their  homes  have become a millstone  around  their

necks.   The  house  which has been their largest  asset  and

their largest investment has now become their largest burden.

To  address this, HDB should consider making available  flats

with  a shorter tenure for these lower income families.   HDB

should  perhaps consider 30-year leases, with  an  option  to

renew  for  another 30 years, for lower income  families  and

lower-middle  income families.  30 years would be  about  the

time  when  flats  might  be suitable for  consideration  for

Selective  En-bloc  Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).   This  will

make the cost of housing much more affordable.  Replacing the

99-year  old  tenure with a shorter tenure can  perhaps  help

these families retain their homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB should also review its policy of not allowing owner-occupied flats to be sold in the open market within five

years.  Those who are in dire financial straits, and who  are

unable to meet their mortgage payments, should be allowed  to

sell  their  flats  in  the open market  and  be  allowed  an

allocated rental flat upon sale of their flat.  Forcing  them

to keep their flat will result in further default in mortgage

payments  and repossession of the flat, which will  be  worse

off  for  the family.  HDB will need to take a major paradigm

shift to meet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



the challenges of the new economic and social environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, making housing available for singles. While we

advocate  marriage, there is an increasing number of  singles

who  are unmarried or who have divorced.  Not all of them can

afford a private home.  While our policies are pro-family, we

cannot  ignore  that  the  changing social  milieu  has  made

singles a significant minority in our population.  Given  the

slack  demand for public flats, it is time for us to consider

the  needs of this group, many who are highly mobile and  are

also  important  contributors to  our  economy.   HDB  should

consider  making available smaller flat units for singles  to

meet this demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the rental market. HDB has a stringent policy

for rental flats.  HDB should review their rental flat policy

to meet the needs of families who have lost their homes as  a

result  of financial reasons, or families which have  had  to

sell  their  flat because of court ordered sale of  the  flat

following  a divorce.  For these categories, HDB  should  not

put a time bar on them, as their public flat was not sold  to

make  a  profit, but because they have to do so.   We  should

recognise  that  while home ownership is  actively  promoted,

there  will  be  some families who will be  better  off  with

rental flats in the interim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no better time than now to review our public

housing  policy.  We must make bold changes.  I do  not  fear

for those who can buy private homes, but I worry for those on

the  lower end of the social ladder, who find that their once

prized asset has now become their greatest burden.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, a review of the public housing

policy is timely and I think the Minister has announced  this

recently.   There  are many reasons for this.   I  think  key

among  them  is,  first,  by  and large,  the  public  policy

objective  of  home  ownership has  been  achieved.   85%  of

Singapore's   resident  population  are   in   HDB   estates.

Secondly,  there are questions about whether we are  spending

too much on housing.  A recent NUS study suggests



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>



that  Singaporeans spend about 37% of their household  income

on  property  and insurance, property tax and  other  related

expenses, compared to about 15% for the US and about 12%  for

Germany.   This in turn has an impact on incentives  to  take

risks and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, we have been reminded by the Finance

Minister  on our funding constraints going forward, and  what

would be available in the way of money for building new flats

and  upgrading existing flats.  So, that being the  case,  in

going forward, clearly there are several issues that need  to

be dealt with and I would like to raise a few key points upon

which  I hope the Minister would be able to give some insight

on the Ministry's thinking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is on whether we should decouple the role of the

developer from the role of the planner with the oversight  of

the   public  housing  market.   Both  these  functions   are

encompassed within the HDB today, and there is some merit  to

the argument that this should be separated.  A Public Housing

Authority, for example, could be established which would have

oversight  on  issues such as supply, demand, price,  quality

and other policy objectives, which might emanate from time to

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is whether we could create a

competitive market for public housing development.  In  other

words, the Public Housing Authority could create a tender  or

a  bidding  system, where parcels of land are opened  up  for

various  developers, private or public, to then bid in  order

to develop certain types of housing.  The nature of the flats

and the type of mix to be offered can all be specified in the

process of inviting the bids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third, is whether we can retain HDB as a core

developer,  a developer who can focus on certain  aspects  of

the  housing  range, perhaps at the lower end  certainly,  in

terms  of  rental and in terms of 3-room flats, perhaps,  but

also  because  we want to harness HDB's vast experience  over

the  years  as  a developer.  And we want to make  sure  that

there is a certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



quality  assurance and price stability in  the  market.   One

could  draw  an  analogy, say, with the cooperatives  in  the

context  of grocery business, and so on.  So I think we  need

to   seriously  consider  retaining  HDB's  role  as  a  core

developer in any revised public housing market going forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this score, in relation to a subsequent cut I

have,  I just want to make one important point, echoing  what

Mr  Othman Haron Eusofe has said.  I am an Advisor to the HDB

Staff  Union and I have received feedback that the staff  are

quite  concerned,  largely because of uncertainty  about  the

future  of HDB's role, and then, of course, on the impact  it

will  have  on their own livelihood.  I think it is important

that  we address the issue reasonably fast, and we give  them

some  level  of assurance on, first the future of HDB's  role

and,  at  the  same  time,  on  how  their  welfare  will  be

addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, whether we could move away from subsidies to

the  developer,  in this case, HDB, towards  a  voucher-based

system in our public housing.  Once we have got a competitive

public  housing  market, where various  developers  might  be

involved  in the process of building and offering new  units,

then   perhaps  what  we  ought  to  be  doing  is   offering

Singaporeans  vouchers which they can then  use  in  deciding

which  houses  they  want to buy, done by  which  developers.

That  would also give important feedback, it seems to me,  to

the  Ministry on the quality and type of housing Singaporeans

desire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that in bringing up these points, there is a

risk of being somewhat simplistic about a very complex issue.

But  I  have a healthy regard for the calibre of the Minister

and his team, and I know this is a matter that has been under

heavy  discussion in the Ministry for quite some time  and  I

would appreciate some clarity on the matter.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah:</b> I would like to ask the Minister if

the Ministry would consider a review on housing policy, vis-a-vis,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>



singles.   At  the present time, of course, one  cannot  rent

unless it is under the Joint Singles Scheme, which means that

they must find somebody as a partner, and also be over 35.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, singles cannot purchase unless they are 35 and

above, and this is for resale flats.  This policy ignores the

changing demographics, and therefore the changing aspirations

in  our  society and, in some cases, actually causes hardship

where there is genuine need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Lim Boon Heng did mention that there may be

over-housing in Singapore.  That may be true in  some  cases,

and  there  may also be cases where people buy for investment

or  speculation.  But there are other cases where there is  a

genuine  need  for housing for singles.  Let me give  Members

three examples which I have encountered in my MPS cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a man, over 50, with a low level of

education, primary education, I think, and he cannot  find  a

place to live.  He needs a place to live but he does not have

a  family and so he needs to have a flat.  He cannot just  go

into  the  street and ask some man or woman to come and  live

with  him.  Not everybody needs a house as well, but he needs

one.   So he is in a very difficult position.  I have written

on his behalf and I hope something would come out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second case is a woman, who has been divorced. Her

mother  is dead, the father would not let her back  into  the

house  because he did not approve of the marriage.  She earns

something  between $700-800.  She cannot go and  get  private

housing.  Where is she to go?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third case, unmarried mother, primary 6 education. She

is  estranged from the family.  Mother is also dead,  and  we

begin  to  wonder, after a while, whether there is  a  common

element  here, about not being let back into the family  home

where the mother is not there.  The father would not let  her

come back because he does not approve of the fact that she is

an  unmarried  mother.  She is estranged from  her  siblings.

She needs to look after her



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>



son.   Where is she to go?  Where is she to live?  She cannot

afford private housing either.  She has been told by the  HDB

that  there  is  another policy which is because  she  is  an

unmarried  mother,  she  cannot  get  a  flat.   And  it   is

difficult.  We say we want to be a gracious society,  but  to

be a gracious society, sometimes we have to show grace.  So I

anticipate  the  answer from the Minister will  be  that  for

exceptional  cases, we can always write in for  a  waiver  of

policy.   Well,  my colleagues in this House know  all  about

waivers  of policy.  The Minister will forgive me  if  I  say

that  sometimes, I think, with a certain lack of originality,

it is easier for the camel to pass an eye of a needle than to

get a waiver of policy.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us go back to the issue of policy itself. Why

this  policy?   The Minister will say that it  is  subsidised

housing,  we must be careful because it is taxpayers'  money.

I  understand that.  But the singles will also say that  they

pay  taxes  too.  So they are not quite sure why they  cannot

benefit  from  this.  If the second reason  is  to  encourage

people  to  get  married,  then the policy  is  not  working.

Because  the number of singles is growing and the birth  rate

is  falling.   If  the objective of the  policy  is  to  give

priority to married couples, then, no problem.  By all  means

give them priority because a family unit would have a greater

need.  But then we have a surplus of housing.  So the singles

do  not  understand why, because there is a surplus but  they

still cannot get their hands on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are rental flats. Because not all married

couples  want rental flats, there are obviously rental  flats

available.   But  when you apply for it,  you  run  into  the

policy, and so you cannot have your rental flat.  In truth, I

do not blame the civil servants or those in HDB because their

hands are tied by the rope of policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I will only take another 30 seconds. We

come  back to the original thinking of the need for  housing,

the  raison  d'etre  for the HDB, which  is  that  we  wanted

housing so that Singaporeans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



could  have a stake in Singapore.  The singles think or  feel

that they are Singaporeans.  They too are entitled to a stake

in  Singapore and they do not understand why they  should  be

discriminated against.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would just ask for a review on allowing rentals

for  people above the age of 21 and perhaps reviewing the age

at  which  they  can  purchase HDB  flats  and  consider  the

question of subsidised housing for singles.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia is not moving. Mr Iswaran

is also not moving.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, as of end March

this year, I learn that 19,400 households have not paid their

HDB  mortgage loans for three years or more.  Two years  ago,

there were some 12,800 households having this problem.  Also,

I  learn  that there were 18,200 Singaporeans who applied  to

HDB  for financial assistance.  My question is: is this trend

a  result of the pricing of our HDB flats, ie, pricing it too

high?   As  brought up by Mr Othman and Dr Michael Lim,  they

also suggested that the pricing of new HDB flats is extremely

high.   Of  course, they can always blame it on  the  current

downturn  as a cause for not paying their mortgages,  but  it

could  be both.  Or is it because these flat dwellers  bought

bigger flats than they required during the good years, hoping

to  cash in on profits should they decide to sell and are now

caught in this property downturn?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those who are having their mortgage problems,

is downgrading a problem?  As HDB has stopped building 3-room

flats,  will this restrict their choice to only 4-room flats,

which may still not be affordable to them?  Does the Minister

see  a return to building no-frills 3-room or even 2-room HDB

flats  in  the  future,  to make sure  such  flats  are  more

affordable for those who are downgrading and for those  cases

brought up by Ms Indranee in her speech just now?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim has also touched on rental flats as

another  option for those downgrading.  So I would not  dwell

on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, in view of the

surplus  of  16,900 flats, I commend the Ministry  in  taking

firm  and  decisive action in introducing the  build-to-order

programme,  that is, to build based on a certain demand,  and

also  taking  the  opportunity to  review  HDB's  role.   The

surplus is due to the mismatch of supply and demand of flats.

Would  the  Ministry also take the opportunity to review  its

machinery to assess the future demand of flats and see how it

could  promptly  respond to changes in the demand  of  flats,

although it is difficult to determine the demand in  view  of

the dynamic market situation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past trends have indicated a slowness in the

machinery in HDB in detecting the future demand of flats, for

example,  the large number of surplus of 5-room and Executive

flats, and the slow response in cutting back the construction

of  flats, in view of the low numbers in the registration  of

flats.   The  cutting back of the tender award  of  flats  to

11,000 was only done in FY 2000/2001 when the registration of

flats  had  already  dipped sharply in FY  1997/1998  and  FY

1998/1999, ie, from 67,000 to 24,800, to 7,160.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Ministry is reviewing its role of HDB in the

supply  of flats, I would like to urge the Ministry to retain

the two primary pillars in the supply of HDB flats, which  is

mainly  for  the lower and middle-income families.   Can  the

Ministry  assure  the  people that it  will  still  have  the

capacity to meet the possible upsurge in demand of flats  and

give  a  definite acceptable time period from application  to

getting  the keys?  Over the history of HDB's application  of

flats,   this   stated  period  is  a  roller-coaster   ride.

Sometimes  it is two years, three years, or even  five  years

during the peak demand in 1994.  Can the Ministry also assure

the people to continue to give good and affordable quality of

flats to meet the aspirations of our people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the Ministry ensure that the design-and-build

flats achieve the design or buildability and have well-chosen

building  materials  and features and fittings  to  ensure  a

lower cost of construction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



and  also  subsequent maintenance?  This is important  as  it

would lead to lower affordable flats for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue is on spalling concrete of HDB flats. In

August  1995 and July 1998, there was a three-year  programme

where HDB assisted a total of 17,600 households in the repair

of  spalling concrete of flats.  This constitutes only 2%  of

the  total  flats that we have now.  There are about  900,000

flats  presently, half of which, 450,000, are about 20 years'

old.  There is a large number of demand now for the programme

to  be  reactivated.  Can the Ministry again reactivate  this

programme  for all the flat lessees so as to assist  them  in

the  repair  of  spalling concrete, especially  families  who

could not afford it would have the danger of falling concrete

over  their  heads?  It could end up as a quiet home  killer.

If  this  is  not possible as a separate programme,  can  the

Ministry  consider including this work under the IUP,  as  it

would  target  the  older flats where  the  concrete  quality

specification is poorer when the flats were built?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, because of the

economic downturn, the number of purchases of resale flats in

the  open market  has reduced significantly.  During my meet-the-people  sessions, some residents told me  that  they  had

applied   for  new  4-room  or  5-room  flats,   to   upgrade

themselves.  Now that they were allotted the flats  they  had

applied  for,  they  were  unable to  get  buyers  for  their

existing  flats.  They are now having difficulty raising  the

cash  required to meet the 20% downpayment. Many of them  had

to cancel their applications for the new flats which they had

been waiting anxiously for the last few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, HDB introduced a buy-back scheme for 3-room

flats. This was extremely helpful to the upgraders.  The  HDB

can also sell these 3-room flats to the other people who want

to  downgrade,  particularly to those affected  by  the  SERS

scheme.   This  was  a good policy, but it was  unfortunately

terminated  in  the  year 2000.  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether  HDB  would reconsider  the  flat  buy-back

scheme in view of the present situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Mah, you have got less than 20 minutes

before "guillotine" time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I do not think I would be able to

cover all the points in 20 minutes.  So I will take the  main

ones first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, first of all, touch on the review of public

housing  which has been a concern of many Members who  spoke.

First  of  all, I would like to reiterate that home ownership

is  the  cornerstone of our public housing policy.   HDB  has

been  the principal agency responsible for implementing  this

policy.   The result has been quite remarkable, if  you  take

the 40 years of the history of HDB.  In 1960, for example, 9%

of  the  population lived in public housing.  Today,  86%  of

Singaporeans are HDB dwellers.  So, from a time when  we  had

9%  or 10% of Singaporeans living in HDB flats, today we have

a  situation  which  is  a  reverse  where  actually  10%  of

Singaporeans do not live in HDB housing.  Of those  who  live

in  HDB  houses, 96% own their own flats.  Sir,  this  is  an

achievement  that is unmatched in any other country,  whether

you are talking of a developed or a developing country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have met our objective of providing

affordable housing for the vast majority of Singaporeans,  as

many  Members  have pointed out, it is now  time  for  us  to

review  the future direction of public housing and  also  the

role  that  HDB should play in the future.  When  we  do  the

review,  we will have to have certain fundamentals  in  mind.

And  two  basic considerations will guide us in this  review.

Firstly,  we  will have to be more responsive to the  housing

needs  and aspirations of a new generation of Singaporeans  - more  discerning,  better educated.   Secondly,  we  need  to

utilise our limited financial resources wisely and prudently,

so that we can meet these future challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Iswaran pointed out just now, this is something

that  is  going to become more and more critical because  the

physical  needs of Singapore in the years ahead are going  to

become much more demanding.  Our population is aging;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



global  economic competition is increasing.  So  we  have  to

determine  what  is the right balance between expenditure  on

housing and expenditure on health care, education, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress at the outset that the Government is

committed  to  providing affordable  public  housing  to  the

masses.   I  think that is something that we  will  not  lose

sight  of.   More new households are being formed each  year,

not  all of them can afford private housing, as Dr Tan  Cheng

Bock  pointed  out.  We also need to ensure  that  low-income

families continue to have access to housing.  By this,  I  am

talking about rental housing as well as sold housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I elaborate on the review, let me address some of

the comments that have been made by Members about our current

stock of unsold HDB flats.  HDB started selling its stock  of

17,000  flats  in the non-mature estates since  January  this

year, first of all, to the 11,000 applicants who were in  the

Registration  of  Flats  System (RFS)  queue,  which  is  the

current  queuing system, and then subsequently to members  of

the  public  through the walk-in selection system.   To-date,

HDB  has sold more than 5,000 flats, and I expect that  there

will  be  more flats that will be taken up in the  months  to

come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current overhang is a temporary phenomenon. We

should  not try to, because there is an overhang, change  our

rules in order to generate artificial demand for these flats,

for  example,  through the buying back of more  3-room  flats

from the open market, as Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested just now,

in order to help the flat owners to upgrade.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened, as a result of the overhang, is

that  it  has  highlighted the need  for  us  to  review  our

allocation  system, particularly, the Registration  of  Flats

System  (RFS).  This system, called the queueing system,  has

worked well, especially when the demand is high.  It provides

applicants  with  greater  certainty,  as  Mdm  Cynthia  Phua

mentioned just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



now, you know exactly when you get your flat.  It may not  be

as  fast  as you would like it, two years, three years,  four

years,  even five years.  But it does provide some  certainty

when  you  apply.  But it is not sufficiently  responsive  to

sudden  changes  in  demand.  For  example,  when  the  Asian

economic  crisis broke out in 1997, followed by the  economic

slowdown  in the last few years, many people dropped  out  of

the  queue.   The queue was 146,000 in 1997.  It  dropped  to

8,800 recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB planned its building programme based on this queue.

As  a  result of this, despite the reduction in the  building

programme, since 1998, the unsold stocks continued  to  build

up  because of the contracts that were already tendered.   Of

the  8,800 applicants, some 3,300 have been in the queue  for

five  years or more,  majority of them are upgraders and they

have  many opportunities to select a flat.  But, I guess,  as

to  be  expected, because there is a lot of choice, the  more

choices  you  have,  the more choosy you  become.   And  many

people, when they are given many flats to choose from, decide

not to select any.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I received a complaint from an applicant who

was  on  the queue.  He was asked to select a 5-room flat  in

Punggol.  He decided that none of the 700 flats that were  on

offer to him was suitable for him.  700 flats, none suitable.

Because  he wanted one on the higher floor.  So he  said,  "I

don't have a flat available that I like, I would like to  get

my  registration  fees back.  If in three months'  time,  you

cannot  allocate me a suitable flat, I want a  refund."   But

that  is  not  the  end of the story.  More interesting  part

comes  now.  He said that we should accord him a  flat  on  a

priority  basis, priority over other Singaporeans because  he

travels frequently overseas on business and, therefore, since

he  is a cosmopolitan Singaporean, HDB should favour him over

others.  I guess he thinks he is doing a national service for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just give you this example to illustrate how choosy

people can become.  It is quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



understandable.  If you are talking about choosing your dream

home, you can be a little bit choosy.  But I think we have to

bear   in  mind  that  public  housing  is  subsidised,   and

subsidised housing has enabled Singaporeans to own their  own

homes  and for Singapore to be a home-owning nation.  But  we

have  to  ask  ourselves how far the Government  can  go  and

should go in trying to meet such demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to review our allocation policies, as Mdm

Cynthia  Phua  suggested, and how we assess  the  demand  for

flats.   Last  year, as Members will recall, HDB piloted  the

Build-To-Order (BTO) system to better tailor  supply  to  the

preference of the applicants and also to better manage change

in  demand.   Under  this system, applicants  indicate  their

preference  for  certain sites which HDB is  launching.   HDB

will  then call tenders for construction but only when  there

are sufficient applicants for the flats.  In other words,  if

the  number of people who want to book these flats reaches  a

certain threshold, then HDB will let out the tenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot project was successful. Of the four contracts

offered, one was dropped because there was poor demand, so we

did not build.  And 92% of the flats in the other three sites

were  taken up.  So we proceeded with the other three  sites.

We dropped one site and we proceeded with three sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the current supply-demand situation for

HDB  flats,  we  have decided to suspend the RFS  system  and

switch  over  to  a  BTO system from next year,  2003.   With

immediate  effect, HDB will stop accepting  new  applications

under the RFS. And those who are on the queue now can opt for

a  flat  under the Walk-in Selection System, or the balloting

exercise for flats in mature estates.  He will also be  given

one  more  chance to select the remaining unsold  flats  that

have  not  yet  been  released under  the  Walk-in  Selection

System, in other words, before these flats are offered to the

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is demand for 4-room flats in certain areas,

HDB will offer about 1,300



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>



4-room flats in Punggol and Sengkang in the fourth quarter of

this  year under the BTO system.  Applicants of the RFS queue

can  choose  to participate in this offer and  they  will  be

shortlisted, according to their queue position.   After  this

offer,  the  queue  will  be expunged.   Those  who  are  not

interested  in  any  of the offers, or who  are  successfully

shortlisted, will have their fees refunded.  HDB will release

more details in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans who are not on the queue now and who

would  like  to purchase a flat, they have got  quite  a  few

choices.   These options include applying under  the  Walk-in

Selection Scheme, or the regular balloting exercises, or they

can  wait  for  new  contracts to be offered  under  the  BTO

system,  and  of course they can also opt for  resale  flats.

HDB  will  continue to monitor the sale of  flats  under  the

various  modes of sale before deciding if it should start  to

build  any  new flats in 2003 and, if so, how  many  of  such

flats to build.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now take the questions raised on rising

prices  of HDB flats and the related issues of affordability.

I  believe this was raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Mr  Iswaran,

Dr Michael Lim, Encik Othman Haron Eusofe and several others.

Let  me, first of all, reiterate that affordability has  been

and will always continue to be a primary consideration in the

pricing  of new HDB flats.  We have publicly stated that  the

Government  will  price  new  HDB  flats  such  that  90%  of

Singaporeans can afford at least a 3-room flat  and  70%  can

afford at least a 4-room flat.  In other words, when we  talk

about  affordability,  this means that the  maximum  mortgage

instalments that a family has to pay to buy either  a  3-room

or a 4-room flat will not exceed 40% of its monthly household

income.   This  is  the  guideline that  HDB  uses  which,  I

believe,  is  a prudential norm which is also used  by  other

institutions.  But in actual fact, even though we use the 40%

rule as the norm, in reality, most buyers of our flats today,

the  4-room and 5-room flats, do not use more than 25-26%  of

their  household  income.  So it is not 40%,  but  25-26%  of

their  household income.  In other words, they are well  able

to service their mortgage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>



instalments  just using their CPF alone because  the  current

CPF  rules  allow them to use up to 26% of their salaries  on

housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, last year, for the typical 4-room and 5-room

applicants,  they  needed  to use only  about  15%  of  their

household  incomes for the monthly mortgage instalments.   So

Members  will realise that, in terms of the price  that  they

pay  for  their flats and in terms of the ability to  service

their  mortgage, it is well within their means.  And this  is

what  we  mean  by  pricing HDB flats  to  be  affordable  to

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when we are talking about pricing, we also

have  to  take  into  account certain  micro  features,  like

individual attributes of the flats, facing, floor level,  and

so  on.  We also take into account one very important aspect,

which  is  the resale flat prices.  And finally, we  have  to

take into account the potential impact of new flat prices  on

the HDB resale market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take you back to the time when property prices

shot  up in the mid-90s as a result of excessive speculation,

as  Mr  Inderjit Singh pointed out just now.   When  property

prices shot up in the mid-90s, HDB new flat prices lagged the

market,  in  other words, it increased more slowly  than  the

market.   Between 1992 and 1996, resale flat prices  tripled,

went  up  by more than 200%, while new flat prices  increased

less  than 50%.  While the resale prices were going  up  like

that,  the  HDB increased its new flat prices by  much  less.

Why?  Because it wanted to ensure that flat prices would  not

rise beyond the reach of the people, to keep them affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, now that the property market has

softened,  HDB prices are also being adjusted downwards,  but

more  slowly than the market.  If you go back to the peak  in

1996,  and you compare with today, resale prices have  fallen

by  about  30%,  but  new  flat  prices  have  been  adjusted

downwards, on an average by about 10-15%.  So prices  of  HDB

flats  are coming down, they are not increasing, as Mr Othman

suggested just now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to pricing of HDB flats has served us well

so  far  because, in the process, we have helped to stabilise

the  property market and we have helped to preserve the value

of  the assets of the majority of Singaporeans.  But, Sir,  I

must admit that this policy and this approach does not please

everybody because those who have not yet bought a flat,  they

want us to reduce prices even further, even faster.  You have

such  a big overhang, why do you not slash prices and have  a

cheap  sale, lelong.  That is for those who have  not  bought

the  flats.   But  those who have already  bought  the  flats

earlier were extremely unhappy when we reduced prices.   They

start  to compare the prices that their neighbours have  just

paid  with what they paid.  Then, they go and approach  their

MPs to ask HDB for a refund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have tried to explain why we have to raise prices

when the market goes up, but not as fast, and why we have  to

lower  prices  when the market comes down, but again  not  as

fast.   In  the process, I suppose somebody would be  unhappy

with  this  policy.  But it has served us well  and  we  will

continue with this policy.
