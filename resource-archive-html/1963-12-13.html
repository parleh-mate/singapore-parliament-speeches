<div align="center"><h4>MAIN ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR 1964</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

Supply [2nd Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 17-



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on Head 17 - Ministry of Health. Mr Poh Ber Liak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker. Sir, I would like to take the two

amendments* together. Can I have your ruling,

please?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendments standing in the name of Mr Poh Ber Liak read as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 17 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the total sum to be allocated for Head 17 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well. Will the Member formally

move both amendments before he proceeds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

I accordingly move the amendments* standing in my

name as shown on the Order Paper.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put in the amendments because I am not

satisfied with the Government's effort in  respect

of  the  Ministry of Health. We are familiar  with

Press   reports  nowadays  about  all   sorts   of

infectious  diseases and epidemics. We  have  read

reports of doctors resigning from the service  and

patients  not  well  looked  after  because  of  a

shortage  of  doctors.  There  is,  therefore,  an

insufficient number of doctors to look  after  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the poor people living in outlying areas have

to go to Government clinics, they have to spend

money on transport,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



and  for treatment at certain City Council clinics

they  have to pay fees. If these clinics  are  too

far  away  from  their homes,  they  have  to  see

private doctors and the fees are a burden on them.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There seems to be a

breakdown in the translation system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Another reason

is   that  on  Sundays  and  public  holidays,  or

sometimes  in  the  night, there are  insufficient

doctors  in the hospitals to go on shift  duty  to

attend to serious cases like accidents, where  the

patients  have  to  wait  for  a  long  time   for

treatment.  This  causes  the  situation   to   be

serious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few months we could not find any

improvement  in  the food served to  patients  and

they, of course, cannot recover quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point we would like to clarify is this:

there  have been two outbreaks of cholera.  Is  it

due  to  water  rationing? If  it  is,  then  what

measures  is  the  Ministry of  Health  taking  to

improve the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on dental care. This is also insufficient in

aided   schools.  Government  schools  are  better

looked  after  than aided schools.  Although  some

students  from Chinese schools were  recruited  as

nurses, they were actually not well trained.  What

measures  can  the Ministry take  to  improve  the

situation?  How many more regional  hospitals  can

the  Government set up to provide medical care for

the  people? At the moment, the provision of drugs

and  medicines  and maternal care at  the  Thomson

Road Hospital during the night is also inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also learn that the Cleansing Department

intends to extend the hours of water rationing  in

certain  areas  so that there will  be  a  greater

supply  of water in other areas. This is  for  the

purpose of cleaning the drains. The extended  time

of water supply in these areas is still not enough

because certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



markets  in these areas cannot be cleaned  properly.

Can  the  Department think of better ways  to  clean

these  markets  and  so  help improve  the  sanitary

conditions generally?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health is asking for an increased

provision of drugs and medicines but this  has  been

turned  down by the Minister for Finance. We do  not

think  this is proper. This is not a good policy  of

economising.  Money should be spent on buying  drugs

and  medicines  for the welfare of  the  people.  In

several hospitals and clinics patients have to queue

up  for registration for treatment. Can the Ministry

devise  any method of making it more convenient  for

the patients to register so that they need not waste

so  much of their time queuing up before they can be

treated at these clinics?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Ministry is still unable

to  look after the welfare of the hawkers. There are

about  50,000  to 60,000 hawkers in  Singapore,  and

they    have   formed   themselves   into   hawkers'

organisations.  These organisations can  look  after

the hawkers but the Government have not been very co-operative  with  them. On the  contrary,  they  have

banned  some  of  these  organisations.  They   have

adopted certain measures which are better than those

of  the  Lim Yew Hock Government, but we are of  the

opinion that these measures are not adequate enough.

Adequate shelters and hawking space should be  given

to  the hawkers, but the Government are levying high

licence fees for their stalls, and in certain places

there  is  little hawking space as these places  are

very crowded.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, the Member

is  making  unusually extensive  references  to  his

notes.  It amounts to almost reading from a prepared

text.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have had occasion to rule on this

before. I will indicate once again I am prepared  to

allow  him to read from his text at least for  these

few sittings. Please proceed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): These points are

made from the general outline. So in order to make a

speech,  I  have to refer to my main points  in  the

outline. This is necessary in the course of making a

speech   in  order  to  be  able  to  give  a   more

comprehensive  picture. I  am  not  reading  from  a

prepared text.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the relevant Ministry of the

Government  to provide adequate protection  for  the

hawkers  and the general public. This will help  the

hawkers in their business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another instance. The hawkers in Geylang

Serai  are not very well looked after. In  the  day-time there are hawkers' stalls at certain bus stops.

At night they do some other odd jobs. The Government

have  not  been  able to look after  these  hawkers.

There are several eating stalls in Geylang Serai. As

from  last  March  they were asked  to  leave  their

places.  But  since then they have not  been  looked

after  by  the  Government. They, therefore,  cannot

carry on their business and make a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am mentioning all these matters in order to

point  out that there is inadequacy in the  services

of the Ministry of Health. Since the P.A.P. have now

come into office, can the Government from now on try

to  do something better in order to improve the  lot

of the hawkers as well as the general public?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tampines has talked

at great length just now. I would like to ask him  a

question.  Did  he say that patients are  not  being

properly   treated  by  doctors  in  the  Government

clinics   and  that  they  have  to  go  to  private

practitioners  to  get  treatment?  I  am  wondering

whether he did say this or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  the  time  for  Opposition

Members  to  ask the Minister for Health  questions.

Instead  of  that,  the Parliamentary  Secretary  is

asking questions. He has not listened properly to my

colleague. We are asking the Minister,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I rule that the Member for Thomson

is  out  of  order. The Parliamentary Secretary  has

been  replying  to the Member for Tampines.  In  the

course  of  the debate he has asked questions  which

the  Member for Tampines may or may not answer.  The

Member  for Thomson is right when he says that  this

is  the  time for Members of the Opposition  to  ask

questions. But surely in the debate Members  on  the

Government side can retaliate with questions. Please

proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker,  may  I suggest, in future, if  any  Member

stands  up and queries on a point of order, that  he

quote  which provision of the Standing Orders he  is

referring to?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please proceed, Mr Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We have all

listened  to what the Member for Tampines  has  said

just  now.  He was very querulous and his  arguments

were  very  tedious.  He has  not  made  any  proper

criticism.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is now quite close again

to  personal attacks which I will not have  in  this

Assembly.  Otherwise  these  attacks  will  lead  to

replies from the Opposition and we go on and on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When I said that

he  was  querulous,  I did not mean  to  attack  him

personally.  He was beating about the bush.  On  the

third  point, he said that patients who  go  to  the

Government clinics are not properly treated and that

they  have  to  go  to  private  practitioners   for

treatment. Can he give a clear explanation as to how

this state of affairs has come about?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

the  question which I have raised just now is  meant

to elicit an answer from the Minister for Health.  I

wonder   whether  the  Parliamentary  Secretary   is

another Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Tampines is now

personally  attacking  the Parliamentary  Secretary,

which is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



exactly   what   I  have  asked  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  not to do. Please refrain from  attacking

personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  hope  the Minister for Health will give  a  clear

answer to my questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I think the Member for  Tampines  has

ranged  right  through  the Ministry  of  Health,  I

believe, over thirteen points. It is a very  unlucky

number,   Sir   - like   the  13   Barisan   Sosialis

Assemblymen. That is their trade mark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started first by talking about the resignation

of  doctors. I believe a similar question was put to

the  Central Government at Kuala Lumpur, and it  was

the  Prime Minister who answered to the effect  that

unfortunately quite a number of doctors  spent  some

time  in  Government service and then suddenly  they

appeared  to  be bitten by the money  bug  and  they

decided  to resign from Government service  arid  go

into  private practice. That unfortunately  is  also

the  situation  in Singapore. But this  shortage  of

doctors is not typical only for Singapore or for the

Federation. It is worldwide. This is because  people

are  now  getting more accustomed to  employing  the

services of doctors for their illnesses and ailments

and there is a crying need for medical attention. It

is,  therefore, a world-wide shortage from which  we

ourselves suffer. May I, however, say that Singapore

can  consider  itself  lucky because  the  ratio  of

doctors to population is fairly good in our case. It

is  one  doctor  to about 2,200 of  the  population.

whereas  I  believe in Malaya it is  one  doctor  to

7,000 of the population.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Indonesia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think we do not get

statistics   from  the  heartland  of  our   Barisan

Sosialis  Assemblymen. There has  been  very  little

information from that quarter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have a little over 700 qualified

doctors  in  Singapore,  of  whom  one-half  are  in

Government  service.  The  remaining  half  are   in

private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



practice. There have been resignations in the  past.

But  since  I assumed office as Minister for  Health

for  the  last two months, there has been  only  one

resignation of a doctor who is a temporary  officer.

She  is  an  expatriate who is leaving Singapore  to

join  her husband elsewhere. So I think it is pretty

difficult  to try to remedy the shortage because  it

takes  at least six years for a doctor to go through

university training and an extra year as a  houseman

before  he is permitted to practise. So I am afraid,

for  that reason, there is no solution in sight. But

we  can  remedy the situation somewhat by  making  a

greater   effort  to  recruit  and  train  auxiliary

medical personnel. By that, I mean junior staff like

laboratory    technicians,   hospital    assistants,

assistant nurses, dental nurses, and so on. I  think

it  is  possible  to  increase the  recruitment  and

training  of  these personnel within the  forseeable

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the second point mentioned by the Member

for  Tampines is this. He was referring to the hours

during  which our out-patient clinics  are  open  to

look  after  the  people throughout  the  State.  As

stated  in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,

we  have  unfortunately  expanded  in  this  respect

faster than we were able to get doctors to man them.

May  I  read this particular paragraph of the speech

of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in Hansard  of  29th

November, 1963, column 124:



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The shortage in doctors is being slowly overcome,

but  the extension of Government clinics and  health

facilities  has  been  at a  higher  rate  than  the

recruitment    of    new   doctors,   Administrative

efficiency and tightening of "referrals" from  these

clinics to the hospitals are essential if the strain

on the medical staff is to be checked,'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat the word "strain". It means

that  we  have less doctors and staff than we  would

like   to  have  to  man  these  clinics,  be   they

outpatient  clinics  or maternal  and  child  health

centres.  I  say this and this is what  our  Finance

Minister  in  his  Budget  speech  on  the  28th  of

November, 1963



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



- I refer to Hansard again col. 97 - said



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The expansion in outdoor medical service brought

about  a  severe  strain  on the  available  medical

staff,  and nurses and doctors had to work long  and

punishing hours to maintain the enlarged services,'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a limit to human endurance. May I

say,  therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  I  wish  in

this  Assembly to pay the highest tribute  to  those

few  but loyal and dedicated doctors and nurses  who

are  serving  our  people, be they  hospitals,  out-patient  clinics  or maternal child health  centres,

and  trying  to cope with the tremendous demand  for

medical  services required by our people.  Far  from

wishing  to  complain against them, I seek  the  co-operation  of  Opposition Assemblymen to  understand

the situation ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak:</b> Point of order. (In Mandarin) I

do  not have any complaint against the doctors. What

I  am complaining is that the time is very short  at

the out-patient clinics. The whole situation is as a

result of the Government's policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. That

should  have been a point of clarification  and  the

Member should have asked the Minister to give way to

him.  Please  proceed, Mr Minister  - [Interruption]

Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Tampines chooses

not  to understand; he chooses to misunderstand.  He

was  complaining that doctors will not be  available

for a sufficiently long period of time to look after

sick  people.  I  have explained  that  doctors  are

human.  There are too few doctors and too few nurses

to  meet  the thousands of cases that come to  them.

You  do not want the doctors and nurses to fall flat

and  have  a  nervous breakdown, because then  there

will  be  no doctors and nurses to look after  them.

That  is  why I say, be understanding and human  and

not  act  irresponsibly. That is  what  the  Barisan

Sosialis people are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As for transport expenses, we

have endeavoured to spread these clinics and centres

throughout the island. I hope the Barisan  Sosialis,

especially   the  Member  for  Tampines,   are   not

expecting a clinic and a health centre at his  house

for  every  one  of  them. That  sort  of  senseless

argument which is being persisted ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Minister, please leave

the Member for Tampines alone. He did not ask for  a

clinic  in  his  own  house.  Try  to  refrain  from

personal attacks. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Very well, Sir. The third

point,  I believe, is about the conditions  in  Woodbridge  Hospital. Yes, there is overcrowding  there,

and there is also a committee studying the situation

in  Woodbridge Hospital. But I can assure you,  Sir,

that  there are lots of people in this Assembly  who

could find a place in this hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point - that on Sundays, public holidays

and  at  nights  there  are not  sufficient  doctors

available  - I  believe that point has  already  been

covered  when  I explained that unfortunately  there

are  not  enough doctors in Singapore that Singapore

would  like to have, and therefore certain  services

have to be reduced, and doctors, nurses, attendants,

clerks, hospital attendants, etc., being human, must

also  have their days of rest before they  can  look

after sick people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point - poor food in hospitals. It is

quite  easy just to pick on that. Even in university

hostels,  food can be considered bad. It is  a  very

simple complaint. It should be put right, of course,

but  there  will always be complaints  however  much

effort may be made in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to cholera. It is unfortunate that

there have been two outbreaks of cholera within  the

last  six months in Singapore, in fact, in the whole

of  Malaya. But I must say that there are  perpetual

outbreaks  in other countries like the heartland  of

the   Barisan   Sosialis,  be  it   Indonesia,   the

Philippines  or the China mainland. I  think  it  is

reasonable  to suggest that the water  shortage  and

water rationing has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



some  part to play in these outbreaks. But what  are

we  to  do if there is no adequate rainfall  and  we

have  to have water rationing? We can only hope that

if  the Assemblymen from the Barisan Sosialis  would

pray  hard enough, there would be more rain for  all

of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh point referred to the school health

service  and  an allegation that students  in  aided

schools  are  not as well looked after as  those  in

Government  schools. There are  in  all  only  seven

doctors  in the school health service to look  after

416,000 pupils. I ask the Member for Tampines to  do

a little bit of mental arithmetic to see how and why

it  is  almost impossible for those few  doctors  to

look after 400,000 pupils. The allegation that aided

schools   are  being  ignored  is  entirely  untrue.

Because of the few doctors that are available,  what

is  now  possible is only the examination of  school

pupils when they enter school at Primary I and  when

they  are  at  Primary VI, and again when  they  are

about to leave secondary school. Of course, we would

like  to be able to expand the school health service

to  make  it  possible for our children  to  receive

medical  attention throughout the year. But I  think

it  will take a very, very long time before we  will

be  in  the position to have adequate staff to  cope

with   the   tremendous  increase  in   our   school

population over the last few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth point, Mr Speaker, Sir, was on the

question  of  recruitment of staff like nurses  from

other  than  English schools. Never, I  think,  have

there  been  attempts to recruit nurses  from  other

than  English schools in the past and we were  quite

happy. I believe, in 1960 to make the experiment  to

second  two  teachers from a Chinese  school  and  a

Malay  school  to  be attached to  the  Ministry  of

Health  in  order  to  recruit school  leavers  from

Chinese and Malay schools. They received my approval

and I can assure the Member for Tampines that I hope

to be able to do more than what was done a few years

back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that since almost everything is done

in  English,  there are difficulties  in  trying  to

bridge this language gap. But it is a problem which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



I  hope  I  will  be able to improve upon  if  given

adequate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's ninth point refers to hospitals.

According to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, we

have   already  indicated  that  the  Thomson   Road

Hospital will become the second General Hospital  in

a  few  months' time. It is not possible for  me  to

anticipate further than this because the speech only

refers to 1964 and the second Five-Year Plan 1965-69

is now in the process of being drawn up. Perhaps the

Member  for Tampines will be patient enough to  wait

for  the  publication of this second Five-Year  Plan

when the question of a third and, possibly, a fourth

general hospital to be established in Singapore will

be revealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenth point referred to the recent relaxation

of  water rationing by the Public Utilities Board to

cope  with  the  cholera  situation.  If  our  water

situation  improves - I think it  is  improving  now,

probably  thanks  to the prayer of  the  Member  for

Tampines; it is raining outside - there will not only

be a further relaxation of water rationing but maybe

water rationing will not be necessary, and then this

extension of two hours from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. may be

improved. As regards timing, well, it could  be  one

way  or another. I think we have to accept the  fact

that we are lucky to be able to have a relaxation in

the  water  rationing, so that there  are  two  more

additional  hours for our city cleansing workers  to

clean  up  not only the drains that are choked  with

rubbish  over  a long period of time,  but  also  to

cleanse our markets all over Singapore.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eleventh allegation was that my colleague, the

Minister  for  Finance,  has  been  very  unkind  by

cutting  down  requests for drugs and  chemicals.  I

think the Member for Tampines would be raising  this

subsequently  and  so  I shall not  anticipate  this

question and will deal with it when the time  comes.

All  I can say is that what he said is not true. But

I  will  give  him a full answer if the  Member  for

Tampines will raise it subsequently.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelfth point refers to patients queuing up

for attention. Well, if there are only a few doctors

and  more patients, that is to be expected. We would

like to have more doctors, and therefore there would

be  shorter queues. But that will take a long  time.

[Interruption] Yes, my colleague, the  Minister  for

National Development, says that our clinics must  be

very  popular and so they are prepared to  queue  up

like queuing up for the cinema.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Have

you anything like that in Indonesia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> His thirteenth and last

question - hawkers. He alleges that there are  50,000

to   60,000   hawkers.  I  think  the  figures   are

exaggerated by 50 per cent. I think there are  about

40,000 hawkers in Singapore. Here again, there is  a

question tabled by him which will come up for answer

tomorrow. I shall not anticipate the question and  I

shall give him the answer in due time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech was quite

clear  at  column 124 where we came forward  with  a

statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the Public Health side, the Ministry is

planning  a  reorganisation of  the  City  Cleansing

services,'



<br><br>I will skip a few lines and go on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... and the ... huge increase in the number of

hawkers, inadequate methods of supervision resulting

in lack of discipline in the work force, complicated

by  secret  society  elements in their  midst,  have

brought  about  an  increase in rubbish,  flies  and

mosquitoes.  All  this can and will  be  put  right.

Reorganisation can succeed once these  factors  have

been dealt with,'

<br><br>This  hawker  problem  is part  and  parcel  of  the

reorganisation which the Government  will  put  into

operation  and  I  think  the  best  part   of   the

reorganisation is the banning of the  two  Singapore

hawkers'  unions which were the front  organisations

of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have been able to answer all the 13

questions put up by the Barisan Sosialis to the best

of  my ability and I assure them that reorganisation

is  coming. I do hope that I will get the support of

the  Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen in putting matters

right for Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

notice  that  the  Minister in  his  reply  did  not

mention  "Communism" or "Communists". This  is  very

rare  indeed. But it cannot be denied that  although

he  has  given fair answers, he has also made  other

allegations against us. I will say something on  the

views he has expressed and on his allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is about the shortage of doctors. The

Minister has said that many doctors in Singapore  as

well  as  those  in Malaya resigned from  Government

service in order to practise privately for pecuniary

reasons.  That  was his excuse for the  shortage  of

doctors. As has been admitted by the Minister,  half

the   doctors  in  Singapore  are  employed  in  the

Ministry  of  Health. If there is still  this  large

number of doctors employed, why did he say that more

doctors  resigned from the Government to  make  more

money  in private practice? I would like to  have  a

better explanation from him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Health will be able to

recruit  more doctors to serve in the hospitals  and

clinics.  If  the  doctors are not  satisfied  with

their  working  conditions, the Minister  should  be

patient with them and hear their views so that  they

will  be  content  to remain in their  jobs.  Nobody

wants  to  be  ill but if a person  falls  sick,  of

course,  he  will  have  to see  a  doctor.  If  the

Government  will not accommodate the  views  of  the

doctors  on their working conditions, then naturally

there  will  be a shortage of doctors. The  Minister

alleged that many doctors resigned because they were

not satisfied with their terms of service. There are

clinics as well as the Thomson Road Hospital and the

General  Hospital which are under-staffed. There  is

also  a shortage of nurses. As a result of this,  an

indisposed person will find it difficult to go to  a

clinic  or  a hospital to see a doctor or  a  nurse.

Therefore,  I hope the Minister will try to  recruit

more  nurses for the various clinics and  hospitals,

otherwise the people might think that the nurses are

unwilling  to serve them. They might not  know  that

there  are insufficient nurses. We all know  that  a

small  number of nurses cannot look after  too  many

patients.  Of  course, it is a very  good  thing  to

recruit nurses from all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



schools  of the four streams, otherwise many school-leavers will be unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot agree with the Minister that

we should pray to God for more rainfall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is raining outside.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Today we have to

pray.  In the past, the Government tried: to  create

artificial  rain with very little success.  I  would

urge  the  Government to speed up the  Johore  River

project.  The  sooner the project is  completed  the

earlier  the people of Singapore will be  free  from

water  rationing due to water shortage. If it  is  a

question   of  shortage  of  funds,  it  is   really

unbelievable,  as  the Government have  spent  about

$100  million on T.V. alone. If they had spent  this

sum of $100 million on the Johore River project,  we

would not be experiencing a water shortage today and

the incidence of disease and epidemics would be very

much less.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Sneaker, Sir, just now the

Minister  for Health has explained to the Opposition

Members  that the shortage of doctors is  riot  only

confined  to  Singapore  or,  for  that  matter,  to

Malaya,  but that it is a universal problem.  It  is

not  an easy matter to recruit doctors, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  They  must  be trained for a number  of  years

before  they  can be considered as capable  doctors.

The Minister says one doctor caters for 2,000 people

and  it  will take a lone time to achieve  this.  We

have  doctors in Singapore but most of  those  whose

sympathies  are  with the Barisan Sosialis  resigned

from  Government not because they wanted to go  into

private  practice but because they wanted to  encage

themselves in political activities. I think if these

doctors  were to discharge their duties as  doctors,

it  would  be  of greater benefit to the  people  of

Singapore.  On the contrary, they have not  attended

to the sick but they have spread malicious political

propaganda  as  a  result of  which  the  people  of

Singapore are more sick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members opposite talk about the shortage of

water.   They   say  that  if  the  Government   had

accelerated the Tebrau



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



River  and  the Johore River projects, we would  not

have  experienced the present water shortage. I wish

to emphasise that although we have expended millions

of  dollars on the Tebrau River and the Johore River

projects, the purpose will be defeated if  there  is

no rain. The water for Singapore depends on how much

rainfall we get.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  first point I want to make is that when I  gave

notice  of  the two amendments I did not attack  the

doctors  in the Ministry of Health. I am sympathetic

towards these doctors and I hope the P.A.P. will not

sour  up  the relations between the doctors and  the

Barisan Sosialis because all along the doctors  have

maintained good relations with the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The reason why the

doctors  resigned from Government  service  is  that

they   were   not   satisfied  with  their   working

conditions.  They  had to work  very  hard  and  the

Government could not solve their problems  and  meet

their  claims. That is why there was  an  exodus  of

doctors  from Government service. This was  admitted

by the Minister for Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we can see that many doctors go into private

practice.  How can you say that there is a  shortage

of doctors in Singapore? The reason for the shortage

is  that  they  do not like to work  in  Government.

Since  it  is so, why do the Government not  improve

the   working  conditions  so  as  to  attract  more

doctors?  The  money in our coffers is derived  from

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Government Members allow

the  Member for Tampines to proceed with his speech

and  keep  silent?  I must mention  again  that  the

Member  is  speaking in Mandarin and I am trying  to

follow  the  English translation.  It  is  difficult

enough  trying  to  follow that translation  without

Members from the Government side adding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



to the confusion. Please proceed, Mr Poh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Nothing is more

valuable  than  life.  But the Government  disregard

giving  medical attention to the people in order  to

fill  up  their  coffers. Why do the Government  not

solve all these problems? If I can increase the vote

by  $1,000  or  $10,000  I  am  willing  to  do  so.

[Interruption] If you are competent,  we  can  argue

point by point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards public holidays and Sundays and at

nights, I agree that nurses and doctors should rest.

But what will happen to emergency and serious cases?

[Interruption] You have not listened properly to the

speech  made  by your Minister. This is  ridiculous.

The Government should see to it that there are extra

doctors to replace those doctors who are off duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of water rationing, it seems that

the Minister has admitted that water rationing has a

part  to  play in the outbreak of cholera. It  is  a

very dangerous situation and we must see that it  is

eliminated. What steps will the Government  take  to

eliminate this dangerous epidemic? Some people  have

died  of cholera. Do the Government want to see more

and more people die of cholera?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Get inoculated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): You ask the people

to get inoculated. When the people contract the

disease, they are about to die and do not have

enough time to get inoculated. You have caused the

water shortage and you have asked them to go for

inoculation when it is too late. This is all

nonsense. [Interruption] Barking? I hear the word

"barking" coming from the opposite side. Coming back

to my point, since water shortage is the great cause

of the cholera epidemic, why does the Minister not

do anything in advance?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the queuing up of patients in hospitals and

clinics, the Minister has mentioned the shortage of

doctors.  What measures is the Minister  taking  to

remedy  the situation? Is he contented to  let  the

situation carry on like this and see people die  of

cholera?  The Government are so very interested  in

blaming   the   Communists   and   so-called   pro-Communists. They have spent so much money for their

own  benefit  that  they are not prepared  to  look

after  the  patients, hawkers, and  the  people  in

general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the hawkers, they have formed their

own  organisations  to look after  themselves.  The

P.A.P. have ignored the interests and  welfare  of

the  hawkers. They are not prepared to  look  after

the  hawkers  and  yet  they  will  not  allow  the

hawkers' organisations to look after themselves. In

addition  to  banning hawkers'  organisations,  the

P.A.P. have  smeared these organisations.  If  the

P.A.P. had the courage to take up the challenge, we

would  be  prepared  for a  public  debate  to  see

whether the hawkers are supporting us or the P.A.P.

Let  us  see  on  which side the  hawkers  are  on.

[Interruption]   Let   me   tell   the   Government

Backbenchers not to bark. Fanatics, maniacs  always

behave  like you. The three doctors in the  Barisan

Sosialis   were  not  satisfied  with  working   in

Government  service  and in order  to  better  look

after the interests of the people, they resigned.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The debate may now range over all

the six amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

first amendment is that in the Estimates for  1963

the  provision for this item was $723,000, but the

provision  for 1964 is $691,930 only. There  is  a

reduction  of $31,070. It is not right  to  reduce

the money provided for drugs and chemicals because

it means a reduction of drugs and chemicals, which

are  very  important in the treatment of patients.

This  is  a  very  important  item  and  yet   the

Government has reduced the provision for it.  This

will lead to very bad consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is in regard to the Out-patient

Services.  In  the  1963  Estimates   the

provision was $507,830, whereas the Estimates  for

1964   show  $442,830.  Therefore,  there   is   a

reduction of $65,000. This is detrimental  to  the

treatment of patients.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment is in regard to the Out-patient

Services. In 1963 the provision for  drugs

and chemicals was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



$71,000,  whereas  the  estimates  for  1964  show

$68,500.  This is less than what is  provided  for

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment is in regard to drugs,

materials   and  maintenance  at  Kandang   Kerbau

Hospital.  Last  year the provision  was  $155,000

whereas  this  year it is only $146.000.  This  is

another reduction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth amendment is in regard to medical and

surgical   equipment  and  stores   at   Middleton

Hospital. The provision for last year was $22,000,

whereas  the  provision  for  this  year  is  only

$20,000. This is a reduction of $2,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth amendment is in regard to drugs and

chemicals  under  the Social Hygiene  Branch.  The

provision  for last year was $72,500, whereas  the

estimates provided for this year are only $70,580.

This is another reduction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sc in the estimates for 1964 the Government have

provided more money for those items which  do  not

affect  the  livelihood  of  the  people.  On  the

contrary, the Government are providing less  money

for  those  items  which  are  essential  for  the

welfare of the people. This is not right.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As I have indicated just now, the

debate  will range over all the six amendments  as

shown on the Order Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think a very good point has

been  raised by the Member for Tampines  regarding

the  reduced  votes  for drugs  and  chemicals  in

respect of all the six hospitals mentioned. What I

would  like  to  say is this. For the  last  three

years  provisions for drugs and chemicals for  all

the hospitals were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



really much higher than actual expenditure. For 1963

- there is still about a month to go - we have made  a

projection of the estimated expenditure, so  perhaps

I will just quickly run through the figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the General Hospital for this year, we have a

provision  of  $723,000, but I think we  will  spend

only  $673,480.  Therefore, the  1964  provision  of

$691,930  should be adequate. I think it goes  right

down  all  the hospitals in a similar way. The  only

one  is  Middleton Hospital where we had a provision

of   $22,000  and  our  anticipated  expenditure  is

$21,000   for  this  year  because  of  the  cholera

epidemic  which  occurred twice, and  for  1964  the

provision  of  $20,000 may not be  adequate.  But  I

understand  the Treasury has always been  reasonable

and whenever there is a request for additional money

to purchase drugs, it never says no. So I can assure

the  Member for Tampines that the Ministry of Health

would be able to get adequate money to purchase  all

the  drugs  and chemicals that will be  required  to

maintain  efficient medical services. I myself  will

be  worried  if I cannot get the money.  But  I  can

assure  him  that  it has been the practice  of  the

Treasury to provide the money if we can make a  case

for the purchase of drugs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  could see that the attitude of the Minister  for

Health   towards  the  medical  services   is   more

reasonable than that of the other Ministers.  If  we

could maintain this kind of reasonable attitude ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member must not attack again or

make  comparisons  between  one  Minister  and   the

others.  That  is an indirect attack  on  the  other

Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since the Minister

has  assured us that there will be sufficient  drugs

and chemicals for the treatment of patients, we hope

that  this assurance will be implemented. Apart from

the  provision  of adequate drugs and chemicals,  we

also hope that other facilities will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



adequate in the hospitals and clinics. I would  like

to withdraw these amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Member for

Tampines  wishes  to withdraw these amendments.  Can

the Member confirm that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

explanation and the assurance given by the  Minister

for  Health  - and  I  hope this  assurance  will  be

implemented  - I  would  like  to  withdraw  all   my

amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $34,781,000 for Head 18 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 19-



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will now proceed to the next

Head,  which is Head 19 Public Health Division.  Mr

Koo Young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 19 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the rationing of water, the health

services in the town and in the rural areas are  not

adequate.  For example, in the markets  and  in  the

areas where there are a lot of hawkers, rubbish  has

been  piled  up and has not been cleared away.  Many

people  have complained that the public toilets  are

dirty.  Is the Minister for Health prepared to  take

steps to improve health and sanitary conditions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. There are many drains,

especially  in the rural areas, which, because  they

are  blocked, create stagnant pools of  water.  This

condition  breeds mosquitoes. In the past, personnel

from the Anti-Malarial Department would go round and

spray  chemicals  to  kill the mosquitoes.  Has  the

Minister  for  Health taken into  consideration  the

work  that has been done by this Department? Is  he

thinking of any step to resolve this situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

already  partly dealt, with the question  of  public

health.  In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech  it

has already been indicated that it is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



intention  of the Ministry of Health to reorganise

the  City  Cleansing  Service  which,  of  course,

includes  looking after the rural areas. Singapore

is  so  small now and with the integration of  the

City Council with Government, it really means that

the  Ministry of Health is now looking  after  the

whole  island State of Singapore. So the  work  of

clearing  rubbish,  drains  with  stagnant  water,

flies  and mosquitoes - all that has been  accepted

by  the Government, and it is our intention to get

down to tackling this problem. But the Member  for

Thomson will recognise the fact that I became  the

Minister  for Health only two months  ago.  It  is

only  last month that we had the cholera epidemic,

so  it was important that I should look after  the

cholera  epidemic first. There is  only  one  week

more  to  go for the mass inoculations to  be  put

through. At present I am glad to say that  700,000

of   the  people  in  Singapore  have  had   their

inoculations.  Before the second mass  inoculation

cholera   campaign  started,  I   held   a   Press

conference but it was only reported in full in the

Chinese  Press,  which I am sure  the  Member  for

Thomson  reads. I indicated then that I  would  go

into  various  drives, e.g., the fly extermination

campaign  in  March, Why March? It is  because  it

takes time first to organise properly. Secondly, I

want  to  get the schools to participate  in  this

movement  because the half million of  our  school

children,  if they really get interested  in  this

movement, can influence their parents; and whether

they  are in the city areas or in the rural areas,

they will be able to look after their own rubbish.

Up  to a point, there will be people who would  go

around to clean the drains whether in the city  or

in the rural areas. So there are plans.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it takes time for the plans to get into

motion.  I  can  assure  him  that  once  the  fly

extermination campaign gets started for one  month

in  March,  then it is our intention to raise  the

standard of health education for all - not just for

school children and parents, but also for hawkers.

I think all of us accept the fact that, because of

the  huge  number of hawkers in Singapore  - it  is

partly because of the unemployment situation in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



Singapore that they turn to hawking as a means  of

livelihood - we have in Singapore more rubbish than

usual and sometimes unfortunately hawkers so  hawk

that it is not possible to clean up their pitches.

We  hope  we  will be able to get  hawkers  to  be

conscious  of  the  fact that  they  are  as  much

responsible for the public health in Singapore  as

other people. In fact, our Prime Minister when  he

outlined  the four tasks ahead for the  Government

for  the  next five years, did indicate  that  the

fourth   target  would  be  to  raise  the  social

standards  of our people. There was one  reference

where he said - I am quoting his words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I wish to emphasise higher standards of public

and social conduct. This can be brought about by a

sustained process of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was inevitable that with new forms of popular

and  representative government, hawkers, squatters

and other social problems increase. But slowly  as

social    standards   and   civic    consciousness

correspondingly  increase,  hawkers  for  instance

begin to understand that they must stay out of the

main  traffic routes and that they must for  their

own sake maintain certain standards of cleanliness

and hygiene. Litter, rubbish, flies and mosquitoes

are  not  only the job of the Health Ministry  and

the  workers in the Cleansing Department, but  the

social responsibility of all.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All - every one of us. So I can assure the Member

for Thomson that I will not spare efforts to raise

the  standard of health education for everyone  in

Singapore,  and when I get started I hope  I  will

receive full co-operation from our friends  across

the Floor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On the public health

in  Singapore, firstly, the Government should bear

the  responsibility. I am very glad  to  hear  the

assurance  from  the  Minister  for  Health  that,

although he has just taken over that portfolio for

two months, he will be able to do good work later.

I  think  if any health education movement  is  to

happen  in  future,  the Government  must  take  a

realistic  attitude to proceed with this  sort  of

movement,   so  as  to  achieve  the   anticipated

results.  I  hope this is not just propaganda.  If

they  are  going to just do propaganda, they  will

not  achieve any good results. I hope the Ministry

concerned  will  carry out what the  Minister  has

assured us.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Thomson

indicate   whether  he  wishes  to  withdraw   the

amendment or have a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young:</b> I withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $24,383,000 for Head 19 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 24-



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We now proceed to Head 24

- Contributions  and Charitable  Allowances.  There

are  four  proposed amendments. We will  take  the

first one in the name of Mr Poh Ber Liak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 24 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must preface my speech by mentioning one thing,

otherwise  I will be misconstrued. This  is  about

the building of a memorial to the civilian victims

of  the  Japanese Occupation. We have no objection

to it at all. We agree to it. We need to keep them

in  our  memory and the imperialists and  Fascists

will  be  the objects of our hatred. So that  this

memorial  will  also enable us to look  towards  a

better  and  peaceful future in  order  to  ensure

peace and happiness for all. What I would like  to

know  is,  what about the attitude of the  P.A.P.?

Are  the  P.A.P. pro-Japan or not? On the question

of  atonement,  we  will condemn  the  P.A.P. for

having  betrayed the people. If the  P.A.P. allow

the Japanese to delay and delay on the question of

atonement,  I  would like to ask the  P.A.P. what

steps  they  are going to take to deal  with  this

matter?  They  must not think that  if  the  Prime

Minister just shouts and gives some talk  on  this

topic,  the matter will be resolved. It is not  so

simple  as  that. I am talking about the  $375,000

being allotted for the memorial. I would point out

that  on  the question of blood debt, we have  not

seen  any  compensation forthcoming. At  the  last

conference  of  all the representatives  from  the

various   races,   it   was   decided   that   the

compensation  would  be  used  in  the  fields  of

education and other social services. Up  till  now

we have not seen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



anything  done  by the Government  in  respect  of

securing  the funds. We have enly seen the  public

donating to the ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order. This

House should not anticipate. As the House knows, I

will  move a Bill in this House on the 18th  on  a

Certificate  of  Urgency regarding  the  funds  of

unions.  I  would suggest the Member refrain  from

discussing  this matter and keep his  views  until

that date.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are discussing contributions to

the cost of a memorial to the civilian victims  of

the  Japanese Occupation. I think the hon.  Member

for  Tampines should confine his remarks  to  this

memorial and nothing more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now, when I said

the   Government  froze  the  funds   of   certain

organisations,  I meant that the public  had  been

contributing to this fund and yet the P.A.P. have

not  done  anything in the past in  this  respect.

Since  the Speaker has directed me not to continue

in  that  trend, I will now talk  on  the  sum  as

provided here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the P.A.P. are sincere and active and are

willing   to  carry  out  their  work  of  getting

compensation  from Japan and having  the  memorial

established,  they should have  done  so.  On  the

other  hand,  the  people  themselves  are  making

contributions.  The P.A.P. should have  shouldered

their    own   responsibility   in   making    the

contributions and also getting the atonement  from

Japan. This only goes to show that the P.A.P. are

rather irresponsible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What the Member

for  Tampines has said is laughable. He is  making

himself a laughing stock ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I had occasion to rule before that

I  do not want any personal attacks. Please do not

start  off by saying that he is making a  laughing

stock of himself. If the Minister wishes to reply,

he  should  reply  to the subject  matter.  He  is

talking  on  the contribution to the cost  of  the

memorial  to the civilian victims of the  Japanese

Occupation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I did not say that the Member

for Tampines was making a laughing stock of himself.

I  said  that he misrepresented his views  and  that

this  misrepresentation made  the  people  laugh.  I

think you got the wrong translation.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps, Mr Minister. But I am

guided  by the translation which I get. If  that  is

the  case, please proceed, but keep in view  what  I

have said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was saying

that the speech given by the Member for Tampines was

ridiculous. He indulged in irrelevancies.  This  sum

is  actually a provision by the Government  to  help

towards  the  building  of a  memorial  to  civilian

victims  of  the Japanese Occupation. In  July  this

year,   the  Government  agreed  with  the   various

Chambers  of Commerce in Singapore to take  part  in

activities in various parts of Singapore to set up a

memorial. The land for this memorial was donated  by

the  Government,  which is near the sports-field  of

Raffles Institution at Beach Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the memorial is expected to amount to

$750,000.  The  fund  is to be  contributed  by  the

Chambers  of  Commerce in Singapore  through  public

donations. The Government proposes to contribute  an

amount  equal  to half the fund, i.e.  $375,000.  So

this fund has nothing to do with atonement from  the

Japanese,  but  provision has  to  be  made  in  the Budget,   whether   or   not   such   atonement   is

forthcoming. It does not mean that there will  be  a

reduction of this sum provided here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines accuses us of delaying the

settlement  of the blood debt issue with  Japan.  He

has  been indulging in irrelevancies. If he had paid

attention  to the discussions between the Government

and  the  Chambers of Commerce, he would have  known

that  we on the Government side have tried our  best

to  help  to liaise between the Chambers of Commerce

and  Japan.  The  Member for Tampines  can  ask  the

members on the Blood Debt Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 25th August this year at the Padang, a mass

rally  was  organised. Before that  we  allowed  the

Chambers the use of the Padang and the City Hall for

organising  a rally, and even broadcasts  were  made

through Radio Singapore.



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broadcasts urged the people to attend the

rally.  We also sent members of the Work Brigade  to

help  put up posters and do other work. On the night

of  the  mass  rally, we mobilised  the  whole  Work

Brigade to maintain order there. We wanted the rally

to  be a success. We wanted to help the Chambers  of

Commerce  to  press for atonement. The Barisan  boys

and  their  unions  not only refused  to  help,  but

instead  created  trouble and  disturbances  at  the

rally.  When the people of Singapore wanted them  to

show  their strength in this common cause, they sent

their  boys to disturb the rally. And they now  talk

of  their  concern in this matter! Are  they  really

concerned about this matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk about the blood debt. Any matter

relating to foreign countries is now in the hands of

the  Central  Government. Since the subject  of  the

blood  debt comes under foreign relations,  it  also

comes   within  the  jurisdiction  of  the   Central

Government.   In  the  past  month,  the   Singapore

Government  have been negotiating with  the  Central

Government  on  this  question  of  blood  debt  and

atonement.  We  are waiting for the results  of  the

discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines also talked about peace

and  war.  He  said  that they  are  a  peace-loving

people.  They were shedding crocodile tears.  It  is

they  who want war. They want to create hostilities.

The  Member for Thomson said that I was war-like  in

my   attitude.  I  have  never  given  any  war-like

speeches.  What I have said is that we have  only  a

few  thousand  troops while our neighbour  has  many

more.  So  how can we go to war with our  neighbour?

Our neighbour has more than 30 jet planes ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour is not talking

on the amendment but is talking on something else.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): You only insist

on  the  right to talk. But when I talk, you do  not

allow  me  to talk. You want to be Ministers.  Well,

you can be Ministers provided you win the elections. [Interruption]

saying  that those who win will be kings  and  those

who lose will be slaves or robbers. This saying only

shows  that  if  you want to be the  Government  you

should  get  the  support  of  the  people  and  get

elected.  We received the support of the people  and

that is why I was returned to office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member said that I was war-like and

belligerent. Since we do not have any modern armoury

or  even  an army, how are we going to war? If  they

are  really  interested in peace and the welfare  of

the people, they should not be shouting about war or

accusing us of preparing for war. If they understand

the political situation and the balance of power  in

this part of the world today, then they will realise

the    seriousness   of   the   present   situation.

[Interruption]  I  do  not need  your  tuition.  You

actually  need  our tuition since you  do  not  know

anything.  [Interruption] We do not have  to  arrest

you.  Of course, there are people to deal with  you.

We have not arrested the Member opposite.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  for Labour has said that we are not  clear

on  the issue of a memorial for the civilian victims

of  the  Japanese Occupation and on the question  of

the  blood  debt. It is because of  the  blood  debt

issue that there is this question of a memorial. Had

there  been  no blood debt issue, there  would  have

been  no such question of a memorial to the civilian

victims  of  the Japanese Occupation.  What  is  the

situation  now  in  regard to the atonement  of  the

blood  debt? We have not heard any further  news  on

this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget we see that the Government is

making a provision of $375,000 for the building of  a

memorial.  We  fully agree on the  establishment  of

this memorial.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not disapprove of this vote. What we do not

want  is this. We do not want the P.A.P. to go  back

on  their word. This issue was brought forth by them

during  the  pre-election period. Is it because  the

purpose for which this issue was raised, that is, to

win  the  election, that they are not interested  in

this  blood debt any more? We have some evidence  in

the  newspapers.  There is a photograph  of  a  mass

rally in this newspaper which was taken on the night

of  25th  August.  It was attended by  over  100,000

people of Singapore. That night the people requested

the  Government and the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce

to  press  home the issue of the atonement with  the

Japanese  Government. Three resolutions were  passed

during  the  rally. They were, first, to unite  with

all   the  people  of  Sarawak,  Sabah,  Malaya  and

Singapore  to press for the blood debt.  Second,  if

the  question of the blood debt is not  settled,  to

initiate  a  campaign of non-co-operation  with  the

Japanese. Third, to urge the Government to  prohibit

further  visas  to Japanese who wish to  enter  this

region.  I would like to know whether the Government

have   done   anything  in  regard  to   the   three

resolutions which were passed by the 100,000 people.

The   Government   have   not   done   anything   in

implementing  the  resolutions.  The  Minister   for

Labour has been ---



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a

point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): We are now discussing the

contribution  to the Memorial Fund. The  Member  for

Tampines is debating matters outside this Assembly.

He is talking about foreign relations with reference

to the Central



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



Government.  The Barisan's Member of Parliament  who

has gone to the Malaysian Parliament should have put

up  such  a  question  there.  If  it  is  just  put

superficially, they will keep quiet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> The Member was giving an

illustration  of these relations with  reference  to

this  amendment.  I  think it is  relevant.  He  may

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government are

very  scared of this issue. This is their sore spot.

They  dare  not talk about it. Why is  it  that  the

P.A.P. did  not invite the Tunku to the rally?  Why

should  he speak about the rally? Why is it that  at

that  time they forgot about the Central Government?

When the Prime Minister was invited to the rally, he

went up the platform and made a speech. At that time

they did not remember about the jurisdiction of  the

Central Government. Why is it? We are of the opinion

that  these three resolutions are correct. We demand

that  the Government should implement what they have

said.  As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister  said

at  the  rally, "No doubt we are very indignant.  We

are  full  of  anger, but we are at  the  same  time

civilised  people. We must adopt civilised  methods.

Since  we  have given our pledge, we must carry  out

our pledge. Otherwise no people will trust us." That

means  to  say,  since the Government  have  allowed

Japanese nationals to come to Singapore, they should

not  ask them to leave on account of the blood debt.

The  Prime Minister said that since he had  given  a

pledge,  he  must implement it. But as  regards  the

three   resolutions  which  were  approved  by   the

Government, why is it that they have not implemented

it  by adopting action with the Federation and North

Borneo to press for the claim by initiating a non-co-operation  movement against the Japanese?  Why  have

the  Government  not  prohibited Japanese  nationals

from coming into Singapore? This is also one of  the

resolutions.  I  shall read further  another  speech

made by the Prime Minister. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Tonight's rally is totally different. The rally

tonight is being held in a very solemn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



atmosphere.  The Government had considered  it  very

carefully  before  it  organised  this  rally.  This

decision  is  very  significant. After  passing  the

three resolutions at tonight's rally, it would  mean

that  the Government's attitude towards the Japanese

Government will change. Once we adopt this  resolute

stand,  we  must  insist that  reasonable  agreement

should be reached. The resolution tonight calls  for

non-co-operation with the Japanese Government. After

this  resolution  has been passed, people  from  all

walks of life and the Government must adopt a non-co-operation  movement  until  we  arrive  at  a   very

reasonable  settlement. This decision  is  momentous

and full of significance.'



<br><br>What  has  happened to this decision?  It  has  been

forgotten by the Government. We have good reason  to

doubt  that in carrying out this blood debt campaign

the   Government  were  not  motivated  by   sincere

intentions.  It was not motivated by the  desire  to

press for compensation for the victims and for those

people who died during the Japanese Occupation.  The

campaign  was solely directed at gaining votes  from

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 27th August, it was reported in the Sin

Chew  Jit  Poh  that  a spokesman  of  the  Japanese

Foreign  Ministry said that the Singapore Government

had no status to resume negotiations on the question

of  a  blood  debt and that the Japanese  Government

would  not  agree  to  the  big  sum  asked  by  the

Singapore  Government. But it  said  that  it  would

agree  to  a certain gesture of atonement. When  the

Prime  Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, visited Japan  in

May  last  year,  the  Japanese Government  and  the

Singapore  Government had agreed that  the  Japanese

Government  would  build a park in  Singapore  as  a

gesture of atonement for the war-time victims.  Have

the P.A.P. Government denied that the Prime Minister

went  to  Japan  in May last year and  that  it  was

agreed  that the Japanese Government should build  a

park in Singapore as a gesture of atonement? That is

what   the   P.A.P.  Government  want.  The   P.A.P.

Government are only contented with building  a  park

and a memorial. They are forgetting the question  of

the   blood  debt  and  are  trying  to  shift   the

responsibility on to the Central Government.  It  is

easy  to do this because the P.A.P. Government  have

been  doing  that  all along. The P.A.P.  Government

have seen fit to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



blame   the   Barisan  Sosialis  for  the  so-called

disturbance  at  the rally. What evidence  can  they

produce to prove it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I shall give you a news item in the newspapers to indicate our stand and our attitude on this issue. We have made a statement that we fully support the claim for a blood debt. This statement was published on the 25th August in the Sin Chew Jit Poh. This statement says that the Barisan Sosialis

had  written  to  the  Chinese Chamber  of  Commerce

explaining  the attitude of the Barisan Sosialis  to

the  question  of the blood debt. It says  that,  in

principle, we fully support the demand of the people

of  Singapore for compensation for those victims who

were  murdered by the Japanese Military  during  the

Second World War. The letter also expressed its wish

that  the rally would be a success. This letter  was

published  on the day the mass rally was  held.  The

Barisan  Sosialis attitude is very clear.  We  fully

support the demand for compensation. But the  P.A.P.

in  order  to  monopolise the whole issue  tried  to

create  tension  before the rally. They  spread  the

rumour  that  some  people might sabotage  the  mass

rally.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was done when the people were going to attend

the rally. At the same time, the Government issued a

statement.  There  is  no need  to  read  the  whole

statement because it will be a waste of time. I will

only  read  the  caption  which  says  "The  Barisan

Sosialis  only  opposed Malaysia and was  trying  to

create  trouble at the intended rally."  Before  the

rally was held, the Government was spreading rumours

that  the  Barisan Sosialis was trying to wreck  the

rally. Now, when people have not done anything,  how

can  you say that they have the intention to do  so?

How could the Government accuse the Barisan Sosialis

of  trying  to  wreck  the mass rally?  The  Barisan

Sosialis  and  some  of  the unions  understood  the

P.A.P.'s  intention, and therefore we exposed  them.

In  their  anger, they said we wanted to  wreck  the

rally.  We exposed the fact that the P.A.P. did  not

have the real



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



intention  to  press  for  the  claim  against   the

Japanese  Government.  What  they  wanted  was  only

political   capital.   [Interruption]   The   Member

opposite  can only indulge in abusing other  people.

We  want  to  challenge them to produce evidence  to

show  that  we had intended to wreck the rally.  But

they  could  not do so. When they were bitten,  they

wailed like a dog.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, we are sincere in our hope. We sincerely hope that not only should the Government provide $375,000 to build this memorial, but we also hope that they should not shirk their responsibility because they are in power and they have forgotten all their pledges and promises. They

should open fresh negotiations with the Chambers  of

Commerce and start anew. They should spare no effort

to achieve the goal in conjunction with the Chambers

of  Commerce.  We  feel that  if  we  can  get  this

compensation, it will do a lot of good to the people

of  Singapore. At the same time, it will do good  to

the  P.A.P. Government. At least the P.A.P. can make

use  of  this money on education and not use it  for

their own party purposes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, one thing

about the Barisan is that we know not only what they

think, but we know what they think before they think

it. You will notice, Sir, that the amendment relates

to  a  memorial  to  the  civilian  victims  of  the

Japanese  Occupation. But we were  quite  sure  that

they  were not going to talk on this, but that  they

were  going to bring up another question  about  the

blood  debt.  You can see, Sir, the  gentleman  from

Thomson  brought newspapers not to  deal  with  this

question ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young:</b> It is a fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- but another question which is

within  the  purview  of the Central  Government.  I

understand a leader of their Party is now  in  Kuala

Lumpur. But he has not got the guts to bring  it  up

there but these gentlemen bring it up here. Why? Why

does their leader, who has not been in this Assembly

for the last one week, not bring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



up the question in Kuala Lumpur? Because he knows if

he  brings  it up there, he will be in more  serious

trouble than these gentlemen would be by bringing it

up  here. But this question has been brought up, and

you,  Mr Deputy Speaker, have allowed them to  deal

not  only with the question of the memorial  to  the

civilian victims - to which incidentally, may I  say,

Sir,  the Government are contributing $375,000;  the

people of Singapore will contribute their share - but

also with the question of blood debt. But let it  be

understood   that  by  the  time  the  memorial   is

established, I am quite sure it would be a  memorial

not  only  to  our  people who were  killed  by  the

Japanese, but also the victims of their friends, our

people  who  will  be killed by their  friends  when

confrontation starts. So it also becomes a  memorial

to  the victims who are going to be killed by  their

friends. I hope, Sir, that the Barisan Sosialis will

contribute  generously towards this  memorial  as  a

memorial which will be to the victims of traitors in

our country. ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Traitors!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So let them be quite clear, Sir,

that  this  memorial would be something  which  they

will  regret.  Let them support it because  it  will

stand  for  something much more important than  they

think it is. It is a memorial for all our people who

have  and  would  be killed by the enemies  of  this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, why have they brought up the other

question  of blood debt? They are not interested  in

compensation  for the poor victims of the  Japanese.

For  years the Communist Party has been here. It  is

now  operating  through the Barisan  Sosialis.  They

never  brought up this question. The  war  ended  in

1945.  The  question came up in 1962. What  was  the

Malayan Communist Party doing then? Why did they not

bring  it up? Why did the Barisan Sosialis not bring

it  up?  But they know any opportunity for mischief,

any opportunity that will work up public feelings,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



any  opportunity  to create  disturbance  and

riots the Communists are there, just like rats in  a

rubbish  heap.  The Communists are always  around  a

rubbish heap. That is why they are bringing up  this

question,  not  because they are interested  in  the

sufferings   of   the  victims   of   the   Japanese

Occupation.   For  15  years  they  had   not   been

interested. But just before last year, when somebody

else  brought it up, these gentlemen, just like rats

gathering  around a rubbish heap, were  there.  When

the  blood debt question came up - in fact, Sir, may

I  remind them, since they have brought it  up  here

Mr  Ng  Aik Huan told them to shut up. He  did  not

want their help. He did not want their assistance in

this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat to them the advice given to them by one

of  the leaders of the Chambers of Commerce who  are

trying to collect money. They said, "For God's sake,

please  shut  up.  By the time you have  fought  the

cause,  the cause is lost." So, therefore, they  are

not  going  to get any thanks by poking their  noses

into  a  business in which I am quite sure they  are

not  really  interested. They are not interested  in

the  people who died during the Japanese Occupation.

Nor are they interested in the hundreds of thousands

of  our people whom the Communists bumped off during

the  emergency.  I  am  quite  sure  the  people  of

Singapore,  even  if they read tomorrow  the  speech

given  by  the Member for Thomson, are not going  to

believe that he is really spending sleepless nights,

shedding  tears in his room because of the thousands

of people who had been killed before he was born.  I

do  not  know  how old he is, Sir. But these  people

were  killed and I am quite sure neither  today  nor

tomorrow nor since he was born, has he been shedding

tears over the Japanese victims. But let me say this

as far as the memorial is concerned. It is clear the

Government  is  quite prepared to do  its  share  by

contributing half the cost. The Chambers of Commerce

will get money to complete the project. There is one

thing  about  the Barisan Sosialis.  Their  line  is

this. Not only here, Sir, but earlier in the debate.

We do the thinking. We are going to build the Tebrau



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



Works.  They  say,  "Oh  good.  But  please  do   it

quicker." We are going to put a hospital. They  say,

"Please put up more hospitals." We are going to have

more  doctors.  They say, "Please  have  still  more

doctors."  All  they  do is to sit  there  and  say,

"Please  have more of everything." If they  want  to

get a little bit of free publicity by saying, "Well,

you  know..."  I  am sure, Sir, there  is  a  famous

saying  about  the cock which always  boasted,  "You

know,  I am very powerful because every day  when  I

crow the sun rises." That is what they are trying to

do.  We  will do our job. This Budget is no fun.  We

have thought it out and we will do what is possible,

what  is  practical, regardless of what the  Barisan

say. So let them crow. But whether they crow or  not

the sun will rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So similarly, Sir, as regards the memorial, we do

not  need  their  advice, their exhortations,  their

denunciations to say what we should do,  because  we

have  already  decided to do  it.  The  Chambers  of

Commerce have decided. They do not want their  help.

In  fact, they spurned their help. They said,  "Shut

up,   please.   Do  not  bring  this   question   up

yourselves. We will do it." But they are  coming  in

purely because they know confrontation is here, "How

can we start trouble? A few more riots; something to

work  up  public  feelings. Maybe a riot  over  this

blood debt issue. Maybe we could work up some riots.

Probably the Japanese firms in Jurong, steel  mills,

let  us go and burn them up." That is what they want

- riots,  trouble - just like school  kids.  Any  time

they  want to have trouble - and I notice one  thing.

Sir; any time there is going to be trouble, anything

involving  violence, the leaders of the Barisan  are

not  in  front. A couple of months ago,  a  pregnant

woman  led demonstrators. Mr Chan Sun Wing operated

the  whole  show  from the safety of this  Assembly.

They allowed pregnant women to risk their lives  and

limbs.  Fortunately, Sir, there cannot  be  pregnant

men, so I am quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



sure  these  people are not going to be in  trouble.

But  these Barisan people, the Communists, let  them

realise  this. The days are over when they can  fool

the  people. They know what the Communists stand for

and  what the Barisan stand for. They know they  are

out  for  mischief. They know they  want  to  create

trouble,  chaos, violence in this country  and  they

know  today,  after the last three or four  days  of

debate,  that these gentlemen are out for even  more

serious trouble, to create more serious consequences

for  Singapore by playing around with foreign powers

who  have made it quite clear that they are  out  to

destroy this country. Because of that, they want  to

create  this  atmosphere  of  tension.  Nothing  has

happened, Sir. They have made speeches for the  last

four  days. I am told, Sir, that even, the newspaper

readers  are  getting fed up of reading  these  long

chunks.  I am told that some of these speeches  were

handed  to  the  newspapers who  were  told  another

thrilling instalment ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

order.  Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Culture

is  irrelevant. He is not directing his  remarks  to

the subject under discussion. He is accusing us ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> I think the Minister has  spoken  on

matters  which  are  not  quite  relevant   to   the

discussion  in hand. Would he please  stick  to  the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> With due respect, Sir, I am first

talking  about  the  relevant question  the  Barisan

Sosialis,   their   motive   in   bringing   up   an

irrelevancy.  Sir, the item under  consideration  is

- "Contribution towards the cost of Memorial  to  the

Civilian  Victims  of the Japanese Occupation."  The

Member for Thomson brought newspapers, handed to him

by  his advisers to come and speak about some  other

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out to you the tactics of the

Barisan  Sosialis. One thing about  us  is  that  we

understand their minds far better than they  do.  We

know what they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



are  going to do tomorrow, even though they  do  not

know  themselves what they are going to do tomorrow.

But we know. That is why they landed in trouble.  On

Monday, when the other subjects for debate come  up,

we will tell them what is in store for them. For the

time  being, Sir, it is relevant to the extent  that

they   have   brought  up  an  irrelevant  question.

Therefore,  I  am dealing with an irrelevant  matter

simply  because for the last 15 minutes, the  Member

for  Thomson has been talking about a subject  which

is not connected with the matter in hand.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is five o'clock now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I propose to suspend the

sitting until 5.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>5.00 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 24 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2."



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

said  all  that  need to be said on the  subject  of

blood  debt except this, that the whole attitude  of

the Barisan Sosialis in this respect shows that they

are  not really interested in the blood debt  or  in

any  other  issue. As the Minister  for  Labour  has

indicated,  their attitude is like  that  of  a  cat

which  is moaning for a mouse. What they are  really

interested  in is to find some issue with  which  to

work  up the feelings of the people and create  some

tension,   especially  in  view  of  the  particular

political objective that they have at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that as far as both

the   blood   debt  and  the  memorial  issues   are

concerned, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



can  leave  them to the Government which  have  been

pursuing  them fairly effectively, consistently  and

sincerely for quite some time. Whatever the  outcome

may  be,  they  can  be quite  sure  that  the  four

Chambers  of  Commerce which  have  taken  up  these

issues  are  quite  capable  of  dealing  with  them

because even the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen cannot

query   the  sincerity  and  determination  of   the

Chambers  of  Commerce which have been  carrying  on

with  this work, both in regard to the memorial  and

the  blood debt issues. And regardless of  what  the

Barisan Sosialis Members may say here, we are  quite

confident  that the Chambers of Commerce will  press

the  issue  to  as  successful a  conclusion  as  is

practically possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, on

the  question  of  the memorial,  the  Minister  for

Culture   talked   at  length  on   Communists   and

Communism. From his speech, we can learn  very  much

about his achievements in the study of Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the Minister for Culture makes a speech,

he points at us, and accuses us of being Communists.

Mr  Speaker, of course, we do not have to take  him

seriously, because he has been here in Singapore for

quite  a  long  time and we have  been  hearing  him

telling stories about Communism for quite some time.

It  is  possible that in the United Nations  and  in

America,  such  speeches  may  have  some  use.  The

American  President may give him  a  medal  for  his

speech ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

order. Is the hon. Member a Communist or not? If  he

is  not, then why is he now defending the Communists

here?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. Before

I  ask the Member for Paya Lebar to continue, can  I

ask   him   to  come  back  to  the  subject   under

discussion,  which is the "Contribution towards  the

cost  of  Memorial to the Civilian  Victims  of  the

Japanese  Occupation," and forget about the Minister

for Culture?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, a

little  while  ago  under the  chairmanship  of  the

Deputy   Speaker,   the   Minister   shouted   about

Communists just like a dog barking ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, the Standing

Orders  prevent  any Member from  referring  to  any

other  Member  in abusive language. The  Member  for

Paya  Lebar  is now alleging that the  Minister  for

Culture was barking like a dog.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid the translation had not

reached me when you interrupted. Please proceed. Mr

Kow, and forget about the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, of

course I do not mind very much what the Minister for

Labour  feels in his heart about me. I only consider

that he is arguing unreasonably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the memorial and the blood

debt.  On this matter, the Government has said  that

the Barisan Sosialis created a lot of trouble during

the  mass  rally.  They have also alleged  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis and their trade  unions  tried  to

wreck  the rally. Who were actually responsible  for

disturbing  the order of the rally? I would  say  it

was the P.A.P. who were afraid of the success of the

rally.  If the rally had been successful, the people

of  Singapore  would have wanted the  Government  to

take  up  the  matter  of the blood  debt  with  the

Government of Japan, because this is a matter  which

the  people of Singapore cannot forget.  This  is  a

fact,  because of the Japanese atrocities that  were

committed  here  in the last war.  The  people  here

demanded retribution for the atrocities committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. indulged in white terror to frighten

the  people away and they tried to make use  of  the

rally  for  their own purposes. They have  therefore

shifted the blame for the disturbances that occurred

during  the  rally on to the Barisan Sosialis.  This

has always been the practice of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what happened at the rally? 120.000 people of

Singapore  passed  a  resolution  to  ask  Japan  to

compensate  for  the blood debt.  The  Minister  for

Labour has just now said that this is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



matter   within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Central

Government.  I  would  like  to  warn   the   P.A.P.

Government not to shift their responsibilities on to

the  Central  Government for whatever mistakes  they

have  made  against  the  people  of  Singapore.  Of

course,  we  know that in certain fields the  powers

have  been  handed  over to the Central  Government.

Then  why  are  the P.A.P. Government  now  shirking

their responsibilities after having handed over  the

powers to the Central Government? We know that  this

is  a matter in the hands of the Central Government,

but this Government is a Government of the people of

Singapore.  Therefore,  the P.A.P.  Government  will

have  to  implement the resolutions  passed  at  the

rally which was attended by hundreds of thousands of

the people of Singapore ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> On a point of order. The Member

for  Paya Lebar is not talking on the subject  under

debate,  which is "Contribution towards the cost  of

Memorial  to  the Civilian Victims of  the  Japanese

Occupation". He has been leading himself ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> He is talking about the blood

debt.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I disagree, Mr Fong. I believe the

Deputy Speaker had occasion to rule previously  that

the  blood  debt was related to the  matter  of  the

memorial.  The  Member  for  Paya  Lebar  is  merely

alleging  that  the  Government are  shifting  their

responsibilities  on  to  the  Central   Government.

Surely that is relevant. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker.  What I have said just now is to show  that

the P.A.P. Government have not done those things and

that  is  why I have found it necessary  to  mention

them  here.  The  Minister has also  said  that  the

booing  at  the rally had been done by  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  I would like to ask why the people  booed

the  Prime Minister. It was because the hundreds  of

thousands of people who attended the rally  and  who

hated the brutality and atrocities committed by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



the  Japanese heard the Prime Minister speak on  the

platform  about  P.A.P. politics.  This  was   what

offended the people. The crowd naturally resorted to

booing him when he made such speeches there. He said

that those people who booed him were Communists  and

members  of Communist unions and that they did  this

to  disturb order at the rally. I would like to  ask

the P.A.P. whether it is wrong for the people to ask

for  payment of compensation for the blood  debt  by

Japan  and  to attend the rally to pass resolutions.

Hundreds  of thousands of people attended the  rally

because  they  felt very deeply about  the  Japanese

atrocities  and the delay in the settlement  of  the

payment  of the blood debt. And yet the P.A.P. made

this  an excuse to ban seven trade unions and freeze

the funds of certain unions in the banks.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Paya Lebar is now

going  off the track. He is going on to the question

of  unions which is not the subject matter  of  this

debate. I believe he will have plenty of opportunity

for a debate on that matter in the very near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker,  for your direction. I only mentioned  that

in  passing  because these things  happened  at  the

rally.  Therefore,  on  the  question  of  demanding

payment  or  retribution for  the  blood  debt,  the

P.A.P. have not done anything to show to the people

of  Singapore  to what extent they have  implemented

the  three  resolutions passed  at  the  rally.  The

people  of  Singapore,  of  course,  know  it   very

clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that it is a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Central Government. Now, we are waiting to see the Government implement the resolutions passed by the people. If the P.A.P. Government are unable to do anything for the welfare and in the interest of the

people:, then the Minister should not try to absolve

himself  from  blame and shirk his  responsibilities

and  say that they are the responsibilities  of  the

Central Government. It is very wrong for the  P.A.P.

to do so.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if we

attend a picture hall once in a while we will see a

character called Charlie Chaplin.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have had occasion yesterday and

today to ask Members to refrain from making personal

remarks.  The Parliamentary Secretary just mentioned

Charlie  Chaplin and before he goes  on  further,  I

must stop him.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

not  alleging  that any Member of the Opposition  is

like  Charlie  Chaplin.  I  am  merely  saying  that

Charlie Chaplin has ways which are humorous  and  we

have  been  tickled  by  the  way  Members  of   the

Opposition have put their case to this House. If  we

study  carefully the speeches of the Members of  the

Opposition on this subject, there are two  or  three

main  points they have dwelt on. They have tried  to

take  the  main part, to replace the part played  by

the  Chambers  of  Commerce  of  Singapore,  because

people  who  are  above  18  years  of  age  can  be

sensitive   about  the  atrocities   and   cruelties

committed  by  the Japanese during the  three  years

they  occupied this country. The people who suffered

under the Japanese are now advanced in age and  they

fully  supported  the  Government  during  the  last

election. But those youths who are below the age  of

eighteen  and who concern themselves only  with  the

question  of Chinese education want to remind  their

elders  of  the  atrocities of  the  Japanese.  This

matter  is  brought  up again while  we  are  facing

confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not even four months now since the rally took place on 25th August. A mother needs nine months before she can give birth to a baby. A baby that is only conceived in four months is still-born. So it is too early for the Opposition Members to challenge the Government on the action to be

taken  by them. They bring up this question so  that

the  Government of Malaysia will be faced with worse

problems  in  the midst of confrontation.  They  are

merely  instigating us to arouse  people's  feelings

and  to worsen the effects of confrontation on  this

country.  If  I remember correctly, the  Member  for

Tampines has challenged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



the  Government to say what they have done.  We  are

against  not only the Japanese who were our enemies,

but  we are more against all those who wish to bring

suffering to the people. These are our real enemies,

even  if  they are Communists. It is their  ideology

that  we  are  against. We know their tactics.  They

will  use any possible opportunity to advance  their

cause,  to bring about the downfall of our  economy.

These  are  the  ruses they employ to aggravate  the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier the Member for Thomson talked about the Prime Minister during the rally and one clear point which strikes me is that we should not be foolhardy in whatever we do. If we retaliate in a foolhardy manner, it will bring about our own ruin. We must negotiate and continue to negotiate

until fruitful results are achieved. The way they go

about  it is to aggravate the confrontation. We  and

the  four Chambers of Commerce are together  in  our

efforts to forward the same demand. We can read this

from the papers and the matter of blood debt is  now

in  the  hands  of  the Central  Government.  As  my

colleague, the Minister for Culture, has  said  just

now,  we can foresee what the Barisan intend to  say

or  do.  They are merely trying to make use of  this

opportunity to aggravate matters. I see these people

as  true  patriots  who hate atrocities!  If  it  is

within  my  means,  I  would  ask  the  Chambers  of

Commerce  to  put  up their statues  there  as  true

patriots.  The  matter is now in the  hands  of  the

Chambers of Commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bring up this question in order to confuse

the  people. Are they truly the people who love this

country?  We are now facing confrontation  and  they

request   the  Government  to  bring  about  another

confrontation  with Japan. Is this true  patriotism?

The  loyalty  of  any  patriot is  towards  his  own

country  and  for  the welfare of  his  country.  We

should adjust ourselves to different situations. We

must  be  loyal  to  the country  of  which  we  are

citizens. The Opposition claim that they are sincere

in their opposition. But do they not realise that we

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



given our assurance to the Chambers of Commerce that

the  Government will contribute half the cost of the

memorial lest we forget the sufferings of the people

during the Japanese Occupation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, to me, the tactics of the

Members of the Barisan Sosialis are like this  Malay

proverb,  "We  can tell whether a fish  is  male  or

female merely from its glint in the water".



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  have  already dealt adequately  with  this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> The Member for Jalan Kayu

has been reading a newspaper all this while. I think

that is not in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Surely that is a matter for me to

decide. Please proceed, Mr Jek.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  have already taken some time to deal  with

this  matter, and unfortunately it seems  that  this

time has been wasted. We have been playing music  to

cows  who never appreciate good music! We have  been

explaining again and again, and they still  fail  to

understand the explanations.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already said that the amount of $375,000

has  nothing  to do with the blood  debt.  It  is  a

contribution  from the Government side  towards  the

building  of  the memorial. Whether  blood  debt  is

forthcoming or not this amount has to be  shouldered

by  the  Government. They now say that we are trying

to  make use of the public funds thus causing people

to  forget about the blood debt. From their talk, we

can  see that they fail completely to understand the

problem  and the present situation. As a  matter  of

fact, we are using this fund for the construction of

the  memorial,  but before the negotiations  on  the

question of atonement are finalised, we just do  not

know  how  much  we are going to  get,  but  we  can

promise  them that whenever the money  is  paid,  we

shall  make use of it for social uses. They  can  go

and   ask   the   Chambers   of   Commerce   whether

negotiations are now under way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



As  a matter of fact, this question of atonement has

been  raised by the Chambers of Commerce and not  by

the   Government  in  the  first  place,   but   the

Government  are  assisting in the  matter.  So  they

cannot say the Government are fully responsible  for

the matter. They are talking nonsense all along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the leaders of the Chambers of

Commerce  in  carrying  out this  work  will  surely

achieve something finally, and we believe that  they

are  capable  of  achieving something  and  even  in

persuading  and  getting the Central  Government  to

solve  this matter as early as possible. We  believe

that  the  leaders of the Chambers of  Commerce  are

capable  of settling this matter to the satisfaction

of  everybody, particularly those relatives  of  the

victims during the Japanese Occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Paya Lebar has said

something to the effect that the Prime Minister  was

not  welcomed  at  the  mass rally  because  he  was

talking something different and not in keeping  with

the  spirit  of the meeting. But I want to  ask  him

whether  they  knew  that  the  Prime  Minister  was

invited by the sponsors of the rally to speak at the

rally.  I  want to ask them whether they  know  that

some members of the Barisan Sosialis attempted to go

up  to  the stage to speak, but were stopped by  the

sponsors. Actually they wished very much to go up to

the  stage  to  speak, but they were not  given  the

opportunity.  So they say that the grapes  are  sour

and   that   the  Prime  Minister  was  talking   on

irrelevant matters at the rally and that was why the

crowd booed him down. This is just like saying  that

the  grapes  are sour. This kind of talk is  totally

irrational and meaningless. They also say there  was

nothing wrong in attending the mass rally. It is not

a  crime to attend this mass rally. I say there  was

nothing wrong at all. In fact, it was the Government

who  assisted in the organisation of the rally. They

gave radio and television facilities to the sponsors

to enable them to appeal to the people to attend the

rally.  In  fact, the Government also provided  free

bus  rides to the people. Now, these are the  grapes

we  gave  to the people. But because they could  not

enjoy them, they say they are sour. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



was work supposed to be done by the sponsors, and we

were  helping them on the other side. Now  the  work

has  been  taken over by the Central Government  and

the Chambers of Commerce. Of course, we will get  in

touch with the Central Government with regard to the

negotiations to be initiated. All that  we  did  and

were required to do was to help in the rally and  in

its  organisation. We said that we had sent  members

of  the  Work Brigade to paste posters and  to  make

appeals  to  members  of the public  to  attend  the

rally.  Now,  have they done anything to  this  end?

Have  they  helped in getting more people to  attend

the  rally? We helped in all ways in order to ensure

that the mass rally would actually and truly reflect

the  will and wishes of the people. But instead  the

Barisan  Sosialis tried to sabotage the rally.  They

carted loads of workers and other Barisan members to

boo down the Prime Minister at the rally. Because we

knew  what they were going to do, what they were  up

to,  we had some police and some members of the Work

Brigade to maintain order there. They put up posters

with  anti-Malaysia slogans and other slogans having

anti-merger meaning. We were all there to talk about

the  blood  debt and the atrocities of the Japanese,

but  they  were  there  to talk  about  their  anti-Malaysia and anti-merger sentiments. It is they  who

brought  irrelevant and extraneous  matters  to  the

mass rally, and not we. [Laughter] What is there  to

laugh  at? I do not have to consult anybody  in  the

use  of Chinese idioms. I know what idiom I am using

and I know its meaning.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Minister got anything more

to say on this subject of a contribution towards the

cost  of a memorial to the civilian victims  of  the

Japanese Occupation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They have the

look  of slaves all right. As a matter of fact, this

matter of blood debt involves the sentiments of many

people. It is actually quite an emotional matter. So

if anybody can make use of this matter for political

purposes,  he  will  do  it.  We  know  the  Barisan

Sosialis have all along been trying to make use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



of  the issue of blood debt for their publicity  and

propaganda. They tried very hard to go into the  pro

tem  committee of the Chinese Chamber  of  Commerce,

but  they were given the cold shoulder. Mr  Ng  Aik

Huan  told them that they were not welcome. If  they

want  to  know more, they can go and see  him.  This

again  is  another instance in which  they  say  the

grapes are sour because they cannot enjoy them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Chambers of Commerce were registering

civic  organisations which were desirous  of  taking

part  in the mass rally, the P.A.P. did not register

themselves, but instead the S.A.T.U. group and their

unions  attempted to have themselves registered  for

the  rally.  There was no need for  us  to  register

ourselves.  The  fact  that  you  wanted   to   have

yourselves registered shows that you wanted to  make

use of the rally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister said

"you" pointing at us. He was saying "you, you,"  all

the time.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is no harm in saying "you" as

long as he does not condemn you. There is no harm if

he says "you" provided he does not condemn you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Why should you

be  trying to split hairs? You do not understand. We

can  see very clearly that they try to make  use  of

the  mass  rally for their propaganda and  political

purpose. Now, they turn round to ask us why  we  did

not take part. The answer is very simple. We had  no

intention to make use of the rally. That is  why  we

did  not take part, but you did and that is why  you

attended  and  took  part in the  rally.  The  Prime

Minister  was invited by the sponsors to  go  there.

You tried to go there without being invited. You are

thus  like  the frog trying to eat the meat  of  the

swan.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> At the rate at which the Minister

has been going into the motives which do not seem to

be the subject matter under discussion, he will take

up a lot of time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They want to

enjoy  the meat of the swan but they cannot.  It  is

impossible. So they talk nonsense here and it is for

us  to  tear their speeches to pieces, to tear  away

their  masks so as to show them up. We also want  to

expose their ignorance and shame in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, as Opposition Members we have the duty

to  reveal  how  the Government spend public  funds.

This  is our obligation and duty and today we  raise

this  question  on the vote for this  memorial.  Why

should  there  be such a memorial? This  is  because

during the Second World War the Japanese murdered  a

lot  of  civilians here. In the past few months  the

people  in  Singapore have pressed for  compensation

for this blood debt, and after some time of struggle

- this struggle is a popular struggle - the Government

have  also  pressed  for the  claim.  As  Opposition

Members, we have the right and the responsibility to

contribute our bit, and the reason why we raise this

question  is  to urge the Government  to  fight  for

compensation, But the explanation of the Minister is

not  satisfactory and has caused me much  doubt.  If

the  Government say that they want to press for  the

claim, there will not be such a heated debate today,

but  they seem not to be interested in fighting  for

the compensation. Instead, they make use of this  to

further their political ends. Since they abuse  this

as an instrument to further political use, they have

no more interest in it.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister has tried to shift the

responsibility on to the Chambers of Commerce.  This

reminds  me  that  many Members  have  in  the  past

condemned the Japanese atrocities and the Government

pro-Japanese  attitude.  I  have  merely  given   an

account  of what took place in the past. I  seem  to

remember  that Mr Marshall raised a question  about

the   Japanese  advertising  tower.  He   said   the

Government  had  something to  hide  about  it.  The

engineer  originally did not permit this  particular

firm  to  put  up  the advertising  tower,  but  his

decision was overruled by the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an oil refinery beside the Pasir Panjang

Power Station which is owned by Japanese. Some  time

ago  a  Japanese  firm applied to  set  up  a  ship-breaking yard here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, what has all this

got to do with the memorial?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What has what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> This matter of ship-breaking

yard  has  nothing  to do with the  subject  we  are

discussing.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Except that he is talking about the

Japanese,  I  do  not think it is  relevant  to  the

subject matter. Please proceed. Can the Member  come

back to this memorial?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  have  the  impression that  the  Government

Ministers seem to have very good relations with  the

Japanese.  Had  it not been so, then the  Government

should have actively pursued the issue of blood debt

and   they   should   not  have  attacked   us.   In

parliamentary  democracy the duty of the  Opposition

Members is to see that the Government exercise  some

care and caution in spending public money. It is our

duty  to guarantee that the money should be properly

and  wisely spent. We urge the Government to  pursue

the  claim and press for compensation. It  is  right

and  proper. They should not say that we are  stupid

or  ignorant. Why should they talk like that? Saying

that  we  are  stupid or ignorant. Our criticism  is

motivated  by our desire to see that the  people  in

Singapore benefit. Now, if the Japanese oil refinery

explodes --- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will hon. Members on that side

please stop interrupting the Member for Jalan  Kayu?

They  had their say; they had the Floor for half  an

hour. Please continue, Mr Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, we as Members of the Opposition do not have the

intention  of  utilising this issue as something  to

further  our  political ends. We are merely  voicing

the feelings of the relatives of the victims. We are

not  trying to play politics in this matter. We  did

not, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



you  have  said, attempt to speak at the  rally.  We

have  a  mass  following and among us  many  of  our

relatives  were  also victims of the  Japanese.  The

brother  of Miss Fung Yin Ching was also  killed  by

the  Japanese. So the question of the blood debt has

touched  us  very  much. Why should  you  create  an

atmosphere   of  terror,  spreading   rumours,   and

mobilising  the police and military to  terrify  the

people? You were trying to intimidate the people and

prevent  them from attending the rally. I urge  them

to  go and attend the rally in spite of Government's

attempt  to  intimidate  them.  It  shows  that  the

Government  wanted  to use this  to  deal  with  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and the Left-wing  organisations.

The  rally  on  that  night was properly  organised.

There was no trouble. The Chairman of the rally also

spoke  highly  of  the rally. If you  work  for  the

benefit  of the people, then we are willing  to  co-operate with you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Chairman, I feel

very  interested  today to hear  all  this  heckling

across the Floor, and to know that the confrontation

by the Communist Barisan is still on. I do not think

the  blood  debt  will create another  confrontation

between  Singapore  and  Japan.  We  know  that  the

Communist   Barisan  always  take  the  opportunity,

whenever  they  can, to exploit  the  situation.  If

their  speeches are to be published  in  the  papers

tomorrow. I think the Internal Security forces  will

reinforce   their  police  to  guard  the   Japanese

Embassy. Sir, this is quite serious - kicking up  the

dust. I want to ask Members across the Floor whether

they  want  to  teach the highest authority  of  the

Chinese  organisation, that is, the Chinese  Chamber

of  Commerce, the way how to insist on the  Japanese

paying  the  blood debt. I think they  are  old  and

experienced enough to deal with this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to deal with the mass rally, all the

heckling, and how the Prime Minister was booed  when

he  stood up to speak. As I have said just  now,  at

every opportunity the Communists try to exploit  and

to  intimidate. They tried to boo the Prime Minister

at  the  mass  rally, but when the  spotlights  were

directed at them, this group of white



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



shirts  and blue trousers - well organised  Communist

puppets   - disappeared.  The   organisations   which

supported this mass rally and had turned up in  full

force  made  a  complaint against these unscrupulous

and irresponsible Communist puppets who were out  to

destroy the mass rally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This talk about reinforcing the police and scaring

away the people from attending the mass rally is all

bunkum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear! Hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> If the people are so afraid and

so  scared, why is it that 120,000 of them turned up

in  full force at the Padang in support of the blood

debt?   Sir,   this  is  the  motivation   and   the

machination  of the traitors and Communists  in  our

country. They must be properly dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> and <b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I cannot oblige both of you. Mr

Teong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  I  have  heard  a  lot  from  the  Barisan

Members. They have talked eloquently and at  length.

They  were  describing how the people  had  suffered

during  the Japanese Occupation. To sum  up,  it  is

only  political talk. The Member for Jalan Kayu  has

said just now, because the Government are pro-Japan,

therefore they are now not trying to press the claim

for   blood  debt.  I  feel  that  today  the  basic

principle  is to be on good and friendly terms  with

people  all over the world. Pressing for blood  debt

is  another matter. It does not mean that because we

want  to press for blood debt, we should not  be  on

friendly  terms with others. This matter  cannot  be

resolved   just  by  shouting  slogans   or   making

accusations  or attacking others. We should  try  to

resolve the matter reasonably and in a sensible way.

I would like to ask the Barisan Members opposite us.

They  have just admitted that the claim for  payment

of blood debt is a matter that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



concerns all the people of Singapore. Everyone has a

share in it. Since it is so, I would like to ask the

Members  opposite why they attempted to destroy  the

rally. It will only enable foreign countries to  see

that  among  us there are traitors. The  mass  rally

organised  by the Chambers of Commerce  and  various

other   civic   organisations  was   destroyed   and

sabotaged  by such people as those sitting opposite.

Can  they  deny  this? All their  eloquent  talk  is

nothing   but  propaganda.  There  is   nothing   of

substance. They should not think that by their  talk

they  can  deceive the people. They cannot make  the

people  believe that they are really for  them.  Mr

Speaker,  for  the past few days these Members  have

been making speeches in this House ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel that whatever the

Ministry of Labour has been doing all along has been

to  the  detriment  of Singapore. Members  of  seven

trade  unions  have been arrested and  trade  unions

have   been  banned.  The  Ministry  is  not   truly

concerned with the welfare of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now there was mention of the blood debt issue

and the mass rally organised in conjunction with it.

Certain  trade union members attended the rally  and

it  resulted in their being arrested and  the  seven

unions  being banned. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  P.A.P.

Government have cancelled the registration of  these

seven trade unions. On what grounds? I would like to

give  the  reasons for their action in deregistering

the  seven trade unions. This action of the Ministry

was  carried out only two days after the blood  debt

mass  rally,  when the Secretary of  State  for  the

Colonies, Mr Duncan Sandys, all of a sudden arrived

in  Singapore.  There seemed to be  some  connection

between  the  banning of the trade  unions  and  his

arrival.  The  Registrar of Trade  Unions  issued  a

statement saying that certain trade unions which had

taken  part  in the rally organised by  the  Chinese

Chamber  of  Commerce on the 25th of  August,  1963,

acted incompatibly with the rules and regulations of

trade  unions  and  had  carried  out  pro-Communist

activities.  On  account of this, the  seven  unions

were  banned. Now, this is very ridiculous.  And  it

also  goes  to  show how the P.A.P. Government  have

been using this pretext to deal with workers who are

now  in  favour of the P.A.P. and who do not support

P.A.P. policies. All those trade unions which do not

support the policies of the P.A.P. are banned.  This

is  very  clear to all. That is the way  the  P.A.P.

Government  treat trade unions and the interests  of

the workers. This is the only achievement the P.A.P.

Government can claim in its labour policy.  How  can

the  P.A.P. claim credit for their services  to  the

workers  when in fact they are serving the  interest

of foreign capitalists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers had gone on strike because of asking for

better working conditions and better wages, yet  the

Government  in  the  case of the Naval  Base  strike

turned round and said that that strike was illegal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



and  so they stepped in. Mr Speaker, during the few

days  of the strike, why did the Ministry of  Labour

not  tell the Naval Base Union that their strike was

not  legal? Why should the Registrar wait for  about

one  month? He mobilised police and troops to  break

up  the strike. For one month all the workers of the

Naval Base Workers Union had been solidly behind the

strike.  When  the P.A.P. Government  saw  that  the

workers  were very strong in their concerted action,

they  resorted  to action to break  up  the  strike,

calling  it  an  illegal strike. Even  the  N.T.U.C.

Secretary,  Devan Nair, had sometime ago  said  that

the strike was justifiable and that it was a genuine

trade dispute. In the end the P.A.P., in conjunction

with the authorities of the Naval Base, broke up the

strike. It shows that the P.A.P. Government had been

consorting with the British imperialists to break up

the  Naval Base strike. The workers there will never

forget  the P.A.P.'s collaboration with the  foreign

imperialists. I would also go further and  show  how

the  P.A.P. broke up the strike of the  Naval  Base

Union.  The P.A.P. used Singapore police and Federal

police to beat up striking workers in order to break

up  the strike. Singapore has autonomy in labour. In

the  case  of  the Naval Base workers'  strike,  the

P.A.P.  Government, with the abetment of the Central

Government, broke up the strike. Are the workers not

part  and  parcel  of  the people  of  Singapore?  I

remember  that the Prime Minister said sometime  ago

that certain powers will have to be in the hands  of

the Central Government, but in respect of labour and

education Singapore still has its autonomy. Where is

the  autonomy  in labour if the Federal  police  are

used  to  break up the Naval Base strike?  When  the

Central Government can send troops to break  up  the

strike,  so-called autonomy in labour  is  really  a

humbug. The police, maintained by our public  funds,

have  been  used to help foreign powers and  foreign

interests  and  to help the Federal police  to  come

here and break up the strike against the interest of

the  workers. What kind of labour autonomy is  this?

Is it not humbug?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Besar always mentions the

Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



This  matter is entirely within the jurisdiction  of

the   Singapore  Government  because  Singapore  has

autonomy  in  labour, so that there is  no  need  to

shift  the  blame on to the Central Government.  The

Member  for  Jalan Besar dares to  talk  in  such  a

trend. I hope he will not interfere further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me again come back to the Naval Base

workers' strike. The police have been maintained  by

us  and  we have also contributed to the maintenance

of  the  police in the Federation, and yet they  are

being  used  to  help foreigners,  to  help  foreign

powers  to  maintain  their  interests  against  the

interests of the workers. This is not wrong?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch upon the general strike on the

8th  and 9th of October. How did it happen?  I  will

give  details  as to how it all arose.  On  the  8th

October the general strike called for resulted  from

the  P.A.P.'s  barbarous action  in  cancelling  the

registration of trade unions of workers  which  look

after    their    interest.   Totally   disregarding

everything,  the P.A.P. Government  took  action  to

cancel the registration of these trade unions.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these trade unions and the workers belonging

to  them,  for  the sake of their organisations  and

also  in  order  that  their  future  interests  and

welfare  might  be looked after, had  come  out  to

protest against the unreasonable and barbaric action

of  de-registration. They had called for  a  general

strike  also  on account of their rights  and  their

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the Singapore Government deal with this

general strike? It adopted the tactic of breaking up

the  general  strike by alleging that  it  had  been

instigated  by the Communists. But the workers  knew

very  clearly.  How  could  they  allow  their   own

organisations to be broken up? Of course, they would

not  want  to  let the Government ban their  unions.

These workers are intelligent people. They would not

allow  the  Government to do such  things.  Had  the

Government  not  taken action in banning  the  trade

unions  and  arresting the workers, they  would  not

have taken such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



action,  and  there would not have been any  general

strike.  This is another instance to show  that  the

P.A.P. have been using the police to break  up  the

legitimate  strike of the workers.  And  the  police

have  resorted  to  atrocities  in  heating  up  the

workers.  There were four women workers in Lorong  3

who  were beaten up. This is in the records  of  the

Police Department. You cannot deny it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister for Education has alleged

that  their  strike was illegal. Does he  mean  that

only when the workers supported the interests of the

foreign  imperialists and capitalists and  supported

the authority of the Naval Base, would the strike be

legal? [Interruption] I remind the Government  Backbenchers not to interfere. I would urge them to talk

reasonably.   On   the  8th  and  9th   the   P.A.P.

fantastically made use of the police to break up the

legitimate  strike of the workers. This has  left  a

very  deep impression on the minds of the people  as

to the nature and the true colours of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the P.A.P.'s labour policies

in  regard to workers. Firstly, what the P.A.P. want

to  do is that all those trade unions which are  not

under  the  control of the P.A.P. will  have  to  be

banned. That is the first thing the P.A.P. would  do

in  its labour policy. All non-P.A.P. unions will be

dissolved. Secondly, through the Government's rights

and  powers,  the P.A.P. are recruiting stooges  and

lackeys  to  create trouble and to  control  certain

unions  in order to take them over. In this way  the

N.T.U.C. and  the Singapore Manual  and  Mercantile

Workers  Union were created. From this  we  can  see

what  the  P.A.P. have been doing in  the  field  of

labour and treatment of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to make is that in the

field of social welfare, the welfare of the workers,

the  P.A.P. Government have always been on the  side

of  foreign  capitalists. The P.A.P. have  construed

any  trade  dispute by trade unions not under  their

control  to  be Communist-inspired. The  Naval  Base

Workers' Union strike is a very glaring example.



The   Minister   for  Labour  has  told   us   that

legislation will be introduced in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



this House to amend the Trade Unions Ordinance and

we will definitely oppose its passing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order. Mr Jek?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I do not know whether the

translation has reached you now. Just now the Member

for  Paya Lebar has mentioned the freezing of  funds

and an amending Bill in regard to trade unions which

we  are  going to bring up on the 18th. I think  the

Standing  Orders  here  prevent  discussion  of  any

anticipated matters, and I think it is in order that

we should not mention anything about that.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister's point is in doubt.

Standing  Order 50 says that when the  Assembly  has

ordered  a Bill or any other matter to be considered

upon  a certain day, it shall be out of order for  a

Member  on  an  earlier day to discuss  the  subject

matter.  Here  the Bill has not been ordered  to  be

heard  on  the  18th. I understand the Minister  has

merely  given  notice. There is some doubt  on  this

point,  but perhaps I could ask the Member for  Paya

Lebar to reserve his remarks. When the Bill comes up

for  hearing, he will have plenty of time and plenty

of  scope  to  air his views. Could he proceed  with

other matters and leave that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  was  not talking about the Bill which,  as  given

out,  would  be  introduced. I was saying  what  the

P.A.P. intended  to do under its  labour  policies,

which  would be about how the P.A.P. were trying  to

do  things harmful to the workers and their  welfare

and  interests. The Minister for Labour, I feel,  is

only  trying to filibuster. His behaviour is like  a

dog. When his tail goes up, we know what he is going

to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I think it is wrong - it has  been

ruled in the past that no Member of the Assembly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



should  be  referred to as an animal or whatever  it

is,  and  I  think the Member for Paya Lebar  should

refrain from using such unparliamentary words.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister is right. Please

proceed, Mr Kow, and do not call each other  names,

otherwise they will call you something else  and  we

will go on forever.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, they

are  just trying to create trouble here and stop  me

from  talking  further, but anyway  we  will  forget

about   them.  We  will  continue  on  our  subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Jek, let the gentleman

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Be a gentleman

please.  Do  not  behave like the P.A.P. which  are

always  arrogant. Do not try to push matters to  the

Central  Government on the face of it  and  secretly

try to jeopardise the interests of the workers. This

is very ungentlemanly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, from the general strike on the 8th

and  9th  of  October, one can see that the  workers

went on strike to safeguard their own interests  and

to  safeguard and defend their own unions. There  is

no  smoke  without fire. If there is no fire,  there

will  not be any smoke. If there had been no  P.A.P.

banning the unions, there would not have been such a

strike. This is very clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government have done something against

their  interests.  So the workers should  not  allow

themselves  to  be  slaughtered  in  any   way   the

slaughterer pleases. The workers have their  brains.

They   will   never  allow  themselves   and   their

organisations to be jeopardised. They  must  have  a

reaction  towards Government actions. They  are  not

like  the P.A.P. which are always running away  from

facts.  So the workers stood up in defence of  their

organisation and they struggled for their interests.

But  the Government, thinking that these unions were

not under the P.A.P. control and were not likely  to

be led by the nose by the P.A.P., resorted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



to  various ways and means of dealing with them, and

so  they  found  the solution in Communism,  dubbing

these organisations as Communist and ban them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are many representatives and

leaders  of the trade unions in Singapore  who  were

arrested  after having been called Communists.  This

is  a fact known to everybody. And so we oppose  and

protest  very strongly against all the actions  that

the  P.A.P. have taken against the workers and their

leaders.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am tabling this amendment. I move it

in  order  to  air  my views on these  matters.  The

actions  of  the P.A.P. will always  remain  in  the

minds  of  the people. The people will never  forget

their  pro-colonial actions which are at the expense

of  the  workers.  They  will  always  remember  the

barbaric  and  repressive actions which  the  P.A.P.

took  against the workers, indeed, the workers  will

never forgive the P.A.P. for behaving in this manner

and bringing about greater misery among them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  just now the Member for  Paya  Lebar

said  that the P.A.P. Government used the police  to

break  up  strikes  and  so on.  We  know  that  the

Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union  were

sometimes involved with the police in their strikes.

We  know that before Malaysia took place, the police

were  under the control of the Singapore Government.

But   today  the  control  has  gone  over  to   the

Federation. Now, at that time, Mr Speaker, Sir,  we

also  saw  that  each  time a Minister  passed,  the

police  saluted them. But nowadays, sometimes  there

is  no  salute from the police. This is clear  proof - even if Charlie Chaplin were here, Mr Speaker,  he

would  know  this  - of a clear-cut policy  that  the

police are under the control of the Federation.  Mr

Speaker,  he  also mentioned that the  former  trade

unionists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



who  were arrested were called Communists and so on.

That  is  the  truth. Mr Devan Nair never  disputed

that  fact. He has openly claimed that at that  time

he  was a Communist. And so have the Barisan's three

friends   recently.  The  N.T.U.C. officials,   Mr

Speaker,  or  the  N.T.U.C. affiliate  unions,  have

never drawn sums in thousands of dollars for any  of

its advisers or politicians ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> They are not like the S.A.T.U.

which  we  know have drawn out thousands of  dollars

from their funds for their good friends. There is no

need  for me to mention their names. Members of  the

Central  Committee  of  the  National  Trade   Union

Congress are not all members of the People's  Action

Party.  They  are not like the S.A.T.U. unions,  who

echo  the Communist voices, and whose officials  are

all  members  of  the Barisan Sosialis.  Whilst  the

N.T.U.C. supports the P.A.P. Government's pro-labour

policy,   I  must  inform  the  Member  for  Charlie

Chaplin, I am sorry, Sir, I mean the Member for ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is the second occasion on which

the  Member has mentioned that word. Let us have  no

repetition of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Sir, I mean the Member for Paya

Lebar.  We  have not always agreed, and  that  is  a

fact. We can prove it. We have criticised the P.A.P.

Government  whenever it is wrong. But I  have  never

seen a Barisan union - when I say a Barisan union.  I

mean   the  affiliates  of  the  ex-S.A.T.U. union

- criticising  the Barisan Sosialis,  even  in  their

last political strike of two days. Mr Speaker,  the

S.A.T.U. cannot  criticise  the  Barisan  Sosialis

because  they  are birds of the same  feather.  They

know  what  it  means.  Out  of  the  11  candidates

selected   by  the  National  Trade  Union  Congress

standing for election in the last general elections,

nine  were  elected.  I do not  think  the  S.A.T.U.

unions  can  boast  of that. Surely  the  people  of

Singapore  who voted these nine trade union  leaders

into the Assembly know what they have done.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



Now,  if  the  S.A.T.U. unions think they  have  the

support of the masses, which the N.T.U.C. now claims

to  be  over 100,000, it reminds me of an old  story

which  I  read when I was a little boy. It  is  Snow

White  and the Seven Dwarfs. But now it looks as  if

Snow  White  is missing. Even now, Mr Speaker,  the

N.T.U.C. is helping to draft out the claims  at  the

Labour  Research Unit against its employers. I  want

to  state  quite frankly here that the N.T.U.C.,  as

has  been  claimed by the Member for Paya Lebar,  is

not  a  P.A.P. N.T.U.C. The N.T.U.C. stands for  its

rights. It will criticise the Government at any time

if  the  Government  is  proved  wrong,  unlike  the

S.A.T.U. which claims that it is anti-P.A.P. It  can

be anti-P.A.P. But I think, as far as the P.A.P. are

concerned, they are pro-Communist S.A.T.U.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Back Benches of the Government are very fond of talking

about  people like Charlie Chaplin and the  rest  of

it.  Sometimes  they refer to us as Charlie  Chaplin

and  Communists. Now, if we were to indulge  in  the

same  tactics when dealing with them, then we  could

call him `the fatty Member of the House'. But we are

not  doing  it because we do not want to insult  the

dignity  of the House. We just do not want  to  call

him names. This will be an insult to the dignity  of

the  House.  We are not like them. All that  he  has

spoken  just  now boils down to this,  namely,  that

even  workers of their unions clash with the  police

at  times. Now, this shows that we are right when we

pointed out that before Malaysia autonomy in labour,

which the P.A.P. was boasting about, is meaningless.

We  pointed out long ago that the so-called autonomy

in labour was but a humbug and a fraud. We have been

pointing  out  all along that as long  as  political

power  is  in  the hands of the Central  Government,

then  the  Central Government can, in  the  name  of

security,  take action against all those people  who

are  working  for the interest of the workers.  This

point is fully borne



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



out by the speech made by the Member just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to point out again that the workers have

the  right  to fight for their own interest.  In  so

doing,  they  are  entitled to take  strike  actions

which  are  wholly legitimate. As my  colleague  has

pointed out, seven unions were banned because  their

members   went  on  strike  to  defend   their   own

organisations.   The   Naval   Base    strike    was

precipitated because the workers wanted to  ask  for

wage  increases. That was very legitimate action  on

the part of the workers. But the P.A.P., because the

unions  who  went  on strike do not  belong  to  the

P.A.P. group, made use of the legal provisions  and

other  illegal means as well against  them.  In  the

meantime, the police were used. Some members of  the

Police  Force even went to the extent of  assaulting

the  workers on strike. After all this,  they  would

say  "Oh, police action is the responsibility of the

Central  Government, and it has got  nothing  to  do

with  the  P.A.P. now." Who will believe  all  this

nonsense?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to tell you that not long ago the reason why a general strike was called by the seven now defunct trade unions was that the workers wanted to safeguard their own organisations. The next day of the strike, the P.A.P. realised that the strike was quite successful and so they said the

strike was illegal. So they went into collusion  and

collaboration  with the Central Government  to  take

police  action  against  the  workers  who  went  on

strike. In Lorong 3, Geylang, I think, there was  an

incident  in  which  members  of  the  Police  Force

assaulted members of the unions on strike. This took

place  in a rubber factory in Lorong 3. The  factory

is  known  as the Yam Hong Rubber Factory.  All  the

workers in this factory - they number about 200 - went

on  strike. Because the P.A.P. Government called the

strike illegal, there were a lot of policemen around

the  place  on  the second day of  the  strike  with

instructions to disperse the workers on strike.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



I  think, Mr Speaker, you will appreciate that when

a  person or an organisation takes certain action to

defend  itself  and such action is interfered  with,

then there will be a reaction. Of course, there will

be  resistance as well. So what happened? The police

took  action to disperse the strikers. In the course

of  such dispersal, some workers sustained injuries.

Others  were assaulted by the police. Some  of  them

were  even  sent to the General Hospital. These  are

facts which nobody can ever deny. If you really want

to  know  these facts, you can make an investigation

in  the  General Hospital. Now, this action  against

the workers -why should there be such an action?  Do

you  call the strike illegal? No, you cannot because

they  went  on  strike  in  defence  of  their   own

organisation.  In the history of trade  unionism  in

Singapore, there are many instances of such strikes.

But  what, is  the  result in connection  with  the

recent strike? Now, because the newspapers are under

the  control  of the P.A.P. mud because  the  P.A.P.

have  control over the radio as well, there  was  no

news  concerning the assault. On the other hand,  it

was  reported  that  it  was the  workers  who  were

rioting,  by their surrounding the riot  squads  and

the  red  vans. Now, Mr Speaker, if you were  there

and  if  you were one of the strikers, I  think  you

would  have a very strange feeling in you.  This  is

precisely  what  the PAP, arc doing  and  have  done

against  workers  and unions which  do  not  support

them,  that  is, assault them first and  smear  them

later.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is more vicious than this action and

behaviour? All that they dare say is Communists  and

pro-Communists. They say so in this  Chamber  or  in

their air-conditioned rooms, but they will never  go

out  to say this publicly. And they will never  dare

say this even in court.



Mr  Speaker,  the  Prime Minister  has  said  that there are only 300 Communists in Singapore. We  know that  this  figure  comes from  the  Prime  Minister himself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



Now,  because  the P.A.P. are against the  Left-wing

movement ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order? If not,

please keep quiet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister can

explain later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the P.A.P. have deviated from the Left-wing

movement two or three years ago, Singapore has all of

a  sudden become Communist! Singapore has gone  Red;

everybody in Singapore who is against the P.A.P. is

a  Communist.  That is their argument.  If  a  trade

union  does lot support the P.A.P., then it is  Red.

Because  the  unionists do not support  the  P.A.P.,

they  must be Red. For example, students who do  not

support  the  P.A.P.'s education policy  are  called

Communists. Similarly the term "Communist" has  been

applied to many other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ministers or Government Backbenchers cannot

quote  facts  to  refute our  arguments,  then  they

always resort to calling us Communists. It is  under

such  circumstances  that progressive  trade  unions

have  been  persecuted and oppressed and banned  one

after  another.  On the other hand,  the  Government

have  the cheek to turn round and say that they  are

pro-labour and are working for the interests of  the

workers.  But how do they go about safeguarding  the

interests  of  the  workers?  They  liquidate  trade

unions  whose  leaders  do  not  agree  with   their

policies, and then organise trade unions which  they

think will support them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, they even make use of the Central

Government against the workers and progressive trade

unions which do not support them. Therefore, who can

believe all this P.A.P. talk of the rule of law  and

the    so-called    democratic    trade    unionism?

[Interruption]  If you were to talk in  this  strain

outside this House, it would be unbecoming of you as

Minister for Social Affairs. [Interruption]  We  are

supported  by  the  people; we are  elected  by  the

people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it

is  becoming of this Assembly that we should prevent

the hon. Member from telling lies.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the Minister's point of

order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The point of order is this. It

should  not be the practice of hon. Members to  make

use  of the privilege of this Assembly to tell lies.

The  Member  opposite said that they  represent  the

people,  and  that the majority of  the  people  are

behind them. The fact is that in the past two years ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This is no time for debate.

The point of order the Minister has raised cannot be

found in the Standing Orders. The point whether  the

Member  for  Thomson is lying or  not  surely  is  a

matter of opinion. I do not know whether he is lying

or  not. As long as he does not call you a liar, he

is well within order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think that it is a matter of opinion. It is a matter

of a very cruel, painful fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister is completely out of

order! He has been ruled out of order. Does he  want

to  go  against my ruling? Now, when the Member  for

Thomson   speaks,  I  would  ask  Members   of   the

Government not to interrupt him so frequently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

from the attitude of the Minister for Labour towards

you,  we  can  see that they are very  unreasonable.

They    say    that    they    practise    democracy

--- [interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I ask the Member not to

interrupt? If he wants to interrupt, he should  rise

on  a point of order or on a point of clarification;

otherwise, he should keep quiet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

order  not  to fall into the trap of the P.A.P.  - so

that we will not have enough time to expose them - we

will ignore their interruptions. I want to raise two

points. Firstly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



they  say  that S.A.T.U. is not truly representative

of  the  workers'  unions. I  am  not  a  member  of

S.A.T.U., but I feel that even as a non-member I can

easily   find   out  whether  S.A.T.U. is   really

representing  the  workers.  The  question   whether

S.A.T.U. is  truly representative  of  the  workers

should  not  be decided by those who oppose  it.  It

should be decided by members of unions belonging  to

S.A.T.U.  Here is a fact - the two-day strike  action

conducted by S.A.T.U. was a success. If S.A.T.U. did

not   represent  the  workers,  then  whom  did   it

represent?  It is because it represents the  workers

that  the strike action was successful. That is  why

the  Government  said  that the  strike  action  was

illegal so that they could ban the unions and arrest

their leaders.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears to me that

Members  of  the  Opposition are beating  about  the

bush.  They harp on the subject again and  again  as

though they alone have the liberty to speak in  this

Assembly. They are merely beating about the bush.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the hon. Member is

beating about the bush. If he did, he was being  led

there by continual interruptions from the Government

side.  If  Government Members were to  hear  him  in

silence, I think he will make a much better job than

what he is doing now. Please proceed. Mr Young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker.  I  am trying to co-operate with  you,  but

Backbenchers on the Government side are not  willing

to co-operate with you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that S.A.T.U. is not representative of

the  workers, there is no need for the P.A.P. to use

their  State  organ to declare that S.A.T.U. is  an

illegal  organisation.  Moreover,  if  it   is   not

representative of the workers, then it  will  die  a

natural death. Why should the Government ban it? Why

not  leave  it  alone? It is because the  P.A.P. is

afraid  of  S.A.T.U.  It  is  because  S.A.T.U. is

representative of the workers. If S.A.T.U. continues

to exist, the N.T.U.C. will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



be   able   to  expand  and  recruit  new   members.

Therefore,  they  saw fit to ban  S.A.T.U.  This  is

common sense. Nobody will believe that P.A.P. banned

S.A.T.U. because it is not representing the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, is the N.T.U.C. a P.A.P. union?

Nobody  believes that the N.TU.C. is  not  a  P.A.P.

union.   Why  should  the  P.A.P. want  to   create

favourable conditions so as to allow the N.T.U.C. to

expand and to take over the members of unions  which

have  been banned by the Government? Why should  the

P.A.P. be  so concerned about the N.T.U.C.?  It  is

because the N.T.U.C. is the life-blood of the P.A.P.

Without  it, the P.A.P.'s deception of the so-called

democratic   trade  union  movement  will   not   he

achieved.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the many struggles that followed, the P.A.P.

have   created  opportunities  and  all   sorts   of

conditions  to allow the N.T.U.C. to expand  at  the

expense  of  other unions. As they are  selfish  and

they have a total disregard for justice, we dare not

believe that the N.T.U.C. is not a P.A.P. union.  Of

course,  the  so-called P.A.P.'s  pro-labour  policy

will  one day be exposed. There will come a day when

the  N.T.U.C. members will clearly see  through  the

P.A.P.'s pro-labour policy and will then see through

the P.A.P.'s mask.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, it appears to me that the Barisan Sosialis  are

trying  to  champion the cause of the  workers,  but

actually they are betraying them. It is they who are

responsible for instigating the people to go against

the  law.  The simple reason is that they  want  the

police  to take action against the workers  so  that

they can blame the Government. This is a betrayal of

the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Member speak a little away

from the microphone? Do not speak too close to it. I

cannot follow the translation because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



his voice is too loud. I am sorry to disturb him.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it

appears  to me that the Barisan Sosialis would  like

to  champion  the  cause  of  the  workers.  On  the

contrary,  they  are truly traitors. They  instigate

the workers to go against the law so that the police

will  take action and thereafter they can blame  the

Government.  They  are the people who  are  actually

behind all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that the labour policy of the P.A.P. is

good.  If  we  compare the labour  policy  that  was

carried  out by the Government of Tun Lim  Yew  Hock

with  that of the P.A.P., the labour situation under

the  P.A.P. is healthier. Because the anti-national

elements have broken away from the P.A.P., there  is

now  a  split among the workers. This is proof  that

the  Barisan Members are not sincere in working  for

the  interests of the workers. They use the  workers

for  their  own  political  ends,  as  in  the  last

elections   when  they  used  them  to  oppose   the

Government.  This  is  sheer  exploitation  of   the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also instigated the workers to go against the

Government in order to help Indonesia in its  policy

of  confrontation.  We  can  see  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis have carried out orders from the P.K.I. in

order  to  wreck our country and Malaysia.  This  is

what the Barisan Sosialis want. They are against the

interests of the workers and they are merely out  to

further the interests of Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member who spoke just now praised the  P.A.P.'s

labour policy and compared it with the labour policy

of  the  Lim Yew Hock Government. He said  that  the

P.A.P.'s labour policy is better. I think this trend

of  talk has been used by the Prime Minister, and it

therefore does not do the hon. Member any credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to repeat what I have said just now.

The  P.A.P.  Members  have said  that  S.A.T.U. and

certain  trade unions were banned because  they  had

been  carrying out Communist activities  detrimental

to the security of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



State. But we can clearly see through this argument.

Under  what  circumstances were these  trade  unions

banned?  I  believe you can conclude that the  seven

trade   unions  were  banned  merely  because  their

members  had  attended the mass rally in  connection

with  the blood debt. On the day following the  mass

rally, these unions were given notice to explain why

they  should not be de-registered. Of course, it  is

very  difficult  to  explain. The Government  should

give reasons why these unions had to be banned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister of Singapore and Tun Abdul

Razak  had a secret meeting which resulted in  their

taking repressive action against the workers and the

trade unions. It is not because these unions did not

receive the support of the workers, or that they had

carried  out  illegal acts, or that  they  had  done

anything  detrimental to the security of the  State.

But all this is deceitful talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have seen clearly what the

P.A.P. have done during all these years.  When  the

workers went on strike, the P.A.P. Government helped

foreign  interests to break the strike. The Minister

for  Labour  said that this is a matter  that  comes

within  the  jurisdiction of the Central Government.

Let  me  ask  him: where is our autonomy in  labour?

That  is  the basic question. Therefore,  we  should

know  the circumstances under which the trade unions

were  banned. The P.A.P. wanted all the trade unions

to  come under their control and all the workers  to

go  over  to their side. In wanting to do  so,  they

took action to ban the trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person dares to criticise the P.A.P. and

refuses  to  kow-tow to them, he will be sacked.  If

anybody  dares to criticise the Government, he  will

definitely be arrested. Mr Speaker, there are  many

members and representatives of the trade unions  who

are  in  Changi  Prison and Outram Prison.  S.A.T.U.

officials  were also detained in gaol. How  can  you

blame  the Central Government? Were it not  for  the

P.A.P. sellout,  would the Central Government  have

dared to take such action against the workers? It is

only  because  the  Lee  Kuan  Yew  Government  have

collaborated  with  the  imperialists  and  colonial

power together



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



with  the  reactionary Central Government  that  the

workers'  interest and welfare have been suppressed.

If  the  workers go on strike, the P.A.P. say  that

they are Communists, and they arrest them under such

a  pretext. Where is the justification for that? The

Minister  for  Labour has said that Singapore  is  a

country  which is enjoying the rule of law. If  that

is  so,  why  should such action  be  taken  by  the

Government? How is it that there are so many workers

in  gaol? The Minister has also said that because of

the  rule  of  law existing here, we have  not  been

arrested  and put in gaol and that we are given  the

chance  to  speak here. I would ask this  then:  Why

were   the  workers  not  brought  to  Court?  Those

arrested were not brought to Court to be tried,  but

they  were sent to gaol. All those unions which  did

not  support  the  Government were banned.  And  all

those  members of the unions which did  not  support

the  Government  were arrested.  If  the  Government

accuse  us  of  being Communists, then  they  should

bring  us to Court. This is a challenge to  them.  I

challenge them to take action against us in Court if

they want to brand us as Communists. We are speaking

on  behalf of the people. We are representatives  of

the  people.  We  will still continue  our  struggle

against colonialism and imperialism. We are not like

those people who hide under the table in the face of

imperialist suppression. I would, therefore,  advise

the Government not to raise this Communist bogey.  I

believe  that  if the Minister for Culture  were  to

refrain  from the use of the term "Communist bogey",

he would not have any further argument to refute us.

We  have heard him for the last few years using  the

word  "Communist", "Communist". To sum up,  all  his

arguments  are nothing but taking the anti-Communist

line.  If he is a Minister worth his salt,  then  he

should  not have done such things. He is doing  this

in  the hope of getting a medal from America as  one

who   is  an  anti-Communist  hero!  But  he  should

understand  that the people know where justice  lies

and who is right and who is wrong. [Interruption].



The  Minister  for Labour is right in  saying  that the judgment lies in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



hands of the workers and the people. Why should they

then  control  the  Press,  the  radio  - controlling

everything  - in  order  to  carry  out   their   own

political   propaganda  for  their  own  ends?   The

Minister has said that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is now repeating

himself. Can the Member go on to something  new,  if

he has something new? We have not much time left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  also know that there is not much time. But I have

to  repeat  it because in spite of your ruling  some

Government  Front-benchers are always  interrupting.

But anyway I will resume my speech. The P.A.P. Front-benchers   invariably  talk  about  Communists   and

nothing  more. Apart from Communism, what  more  can

they talk about? What else have they got to say?  We

must  allow  the  people to act as judges  in  these

matters. We must not allow them to make use  of  the

State  machinery, for instance, such publicity media

like  the radio, television and the newspapers,  for

their own ends.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not propose

to  give way. I will continue with my speech. But  I

think  I will allow the Minister some time to  speak

later  on.  We  have  to mention  all  these  things

because the Prime Minister has said that he  is  not

so  silly as the Lim Yew Hock regime, that is, he is

not  prepared to allow his hands to wear  the  dirty

gloves  of Tun Lim Yew Hock. But soon after he  said

this,  what  action  did the Government  take?  The

P.A.P. have taken even more drastic action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> My point of order is this. The

Member  for  Paya Lebar, having had  the  chance  to

speak twice on this matter, I think it would only be

fair if he would stop now somehow or the other.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order.

Members  have got up and spoken three or four  times

like  this. The Minister just now got up on a  point

of  clarification. The Member did not allow him.  He

has  now got up on another point which is completely

out  of  order.  The  Minister is only  interrupting

these proceedings without permission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

must thank you for your ruling. In spite of what the

Prime Minister has said, the P.A.P. Government  have

done  things in a cleverer way than did Tun Lim  Yew

Hock.  It  has  taken  action against  the  workers'

organisations.  Soon  after  their  victory  in  the

elections,  the  P.A.P. took  action  against  many

unions.  They have taken action against the workers.

Is  this not the same action which the Lim Yew  Hock

regime  and  the colonial masters took  against  the

workers?  We  have  experienced such  actions  being

taken  before. Now we are seeing such actions  being

repeated.  We  are  against the  P.A.P. today.  The

workers  are against the P.A.P. today. They are  the

same  workers  who  were against the  Lim  Yew  Hock

regime.  They  are  also the same workers  who  were

against  the  Japanese atrocities and  the  colonial

masters. They are the same workers. Now we  can  see

whether  the  P.A.P. are really  fighting  for  the

interests  of  the workers. I believe  that  if  the

workers are not supporting the S.A.T.U. group,  then

I  think  they will allow the unions to continue  in

existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the 2nd of February, various trade union

leaders  have  been arrested. Before  the  elections

many  of them were arrested and after the elections,

another  hatch of leaders were arrested. Responsible

officials  of the trade unions have been nabbed.  In

the  end, the trade unions are left without leaders.

And then the Government go on to smear them ---



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Again the hon. Member is

heating about the bush.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



With  due respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  not  a

concert.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have already ruled on a previous

occasion.  I  do not think he is beating  about  the

bush. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I again thank you

for  your ruling, Mr Speaker. But I do not  propose

to  take  up more time. As you can see, our  friends

opposite are interrupting from time to time although

they  will have their opportunity to speak. But they

can only talk about Communists and that is they have

to say --- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Jek.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

to  save  you  from further trouble, I think  I  had

better stop my speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think the time has now come

to  show  they  are  the real Communists  and  I  am

bringing  evidence, not from Members of the  P.A.P.,

but  from three former Barisan Sosialis Members  who

will tell you that they have been telling falsehoods

here. They are Communists, and the evidence is  from

Mr Woodhull, Mr Lim Shee Ping and Mr Puthucheary.

The proof is here - written statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First. Mr Lim Shee Ping, former Committee member

of  the Barisan Sosialis. None of them will say that

he  is  a stooge or a neo-colonialist. Sir, this  is

what he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the past I was enthusiastic about the possible

achievements of Communist China.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democrat? Communist. And he was the same man who

said "Communist bogey".



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we

are  talking  about  the matter of  labour.  If  the

Minister for Culture wants to talk about Communists,

I hope that he will touch on labour first.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think you are out of order, Mr

Minister. We are discussing the Ministry of  Labour,

not whether

Mr Woodhull or Mr Puthucheary is a Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are trade

unionists.  The Communists run the trade  unions  of

S.A.T.U. Mr Woodhull was their trade union adviser.

Let  me  say, Sir, it is very relevant. Because  for

the  last  three or four days, they got  very  angry

because they know now --- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We have three creditable witnesses

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have ruled that is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, with due respect

to you. Mr Woodhull is connected with S.A.T.U.

unions. We are discussing the merits of the S.A.T.U.

unions ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have ruled the Minister for

Culture out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have ruled you out of order, Mr

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that is the

case,  it will be impossible for me to answer  their

point  whether the S.A.T.U. unions are Communist  or

not. That is relevant ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not the point. We are

discussing the Ministry of Labour. Are you  prepared

to take my ruling or are you not, Mr Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> All right, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  go  on  to  another point to  prove  that  the

S.A.T.U. union  was banned for a good  reason.  The

issue  was brought up. The S.A.T.U. union was banned

because it was involved in treacherous activities in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



Borneo.  They  were banned because of that.  Because

they were preparing to involve Singapore in an armed

revolt and that has been admitted by none other than Mr Lim Shee Ping. He said in this statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In practice Communist activities in Malaya defeat

the very causes which they claim to champion.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Mr Lim Shee Ping. And he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I deplore the recent violence in Brunei and

Sarawak   which  causes  unnecessary  suffering   to

innocent people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Lim Shee Ping was closely associated with

the  S.A.T.U. unions, is this not an admission  that

the  Barisan  Sosialis and the  pro-Communist  trade

unionists were preparing to involve Singapore in the

armed  violence in Brunei, Borneo and Sarawak?  That

is why they were banned. Not because they were trade

unionists,  but  because  they  were  preparing   to

involve the workers of Singapore in the armed revolt

in Brunei and Sarawak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, Mr Woodhull said openly that he was

in   charge  of  unions  which  were  controlled  by

Communists. And I quote, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In pursuing my political and trade union

activities [and he was adviser to a great number  of

S.A.T.U. unions]  it is true  to  say  that  I  was

indifferent as to whether Communists were associated

with  me. I recognise that this has been helpful  to

the Communist cause ...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is saying it? It is not we. Mr Woodhull ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Vice-Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Vice-Chairman of the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He said, "I recognise that this

has been helpful to the Communist cause which I have

no desire to aid." He went on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I want to make it absolutely clear that I am

opposed to Communism. I believe that it is a  threat

to democracy and to the freedom I prize.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not the words of a neo-colonialist

P.A.P.,   but  of  Mr  Woodhull,  who  was  closely

connected with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Vice-Chairman and adviser to S.A.T.U. trade

unions. Mr Puthucheary ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Their gods and saints.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- adviser to the Barisan Sosialis.

What does he say?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says about the Communists:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Not to fight them [i.e. the Communists] would be

to  abdicate the right to help the country to  solve

her  economic and political problems. I believe that

Communist infiltration of trade unions...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is saying that? Their friend, who was adviser

to  the Barisan Sosialis and adviser to a number  of

unions, What does he say?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I believe that Communist infiltration of trade

unions   and   social   democratic   parties    has

contributed  to  their weakening  and  led  to  the

continuation of emergency powers.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do they now mean to sit here and tell us they

are  not  Communists,  that  these  unions  are  not

manipulated by Communists? Are they prepared to  get

up   now   and  say  that  these  three   are   neo-colonialists? Are you prepared? Are you prepared?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They are not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Are they stooges of the P.A.P.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Woodhull further says that they have done

more damage to the workers and so on. He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I believe that it is a threat...'---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

I  beg  to  report that the Committee of Supply  has

made  progress on the Main Estimates for  1964, and

ask leave to sit again tomorrow.
