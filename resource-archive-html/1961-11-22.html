<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Amendment [21st November, 1961] to Question [20th

November, 1961],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it has always been the avowed objective

of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve the

reunification of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya and to remove the artificial division created

by the British by their policy of "divide and rule",

third House affirms and declares that the first

objective of all true patriots of Malaya is to achieve

the reunification of these two territories in a merger

of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya."-( The

Minster for Labour-Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To leave out from "a" in the second last line to the

end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya, with Singapore entering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation as the twelfth state and with all  its

Citizens  automatically becoming Federal  Citizens  on

Merger Day".'-(Dr Lee Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

be left out, he left out."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  when I was saving that we were against  the

amendment  proposed by the Member for Queenstown,  the

adjournment  took place and that was that.  But  then,

unfortunately, over Radio Singapore, it  was  reported

that the Member for Cairnhill said that he was against

the  amendment  proposed by the Member for  Queenstown

for  a  genuine  merger making Singapore  the  twelfth

State  of  the  Federation and that  all  citizens  of

Singapore  shall  enjoy citizenship  rights.  That,  I

think,  Sir,  is a distortion. I said we were  against

the  amendment - and I say it again - we are against  the

amendment  proposed by the Member for Queenstown.  But

we  are not against a merger that is genuine, a merger

that  brings  Singapore  into  the  Federation  as  an

integral  part  of  the  Federation,  where  all   the

citizens of Singapore enjoy the same benefits  as  all

other citizens in the various States of the Federation

of  Malaya. We are against the amendment because  some

of  the  words  are redundant, others are tautologous.

and  the  motive behind the amendment is  nothing  but

political. Sir, the Barisan Sosialis, being a new star

that  has  arisen - before it arose it was  a  different

star - say they are for merger. Everyone says, "Merger";

"We  are for merger!" We all know what we mean by  the

word   "merger".  Merger  means  the  integration   of

Singapore  as a part of the Federation and the  rights

enjoyed  by  the  citizens of the Federation  will  be

conferred  on  the citizens of Singapore  when  merger

takes place. That is what we all mean by merger,  and

what  we all know. But unfortunately, because  of  the

political moves on the part of politicians, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister and his ex-comrades, merger  has  been

twisted  to mean something else. And that is not  what

merger  really means. Merger can only mean one  thing:

it  is  a  state whereby those that are separated  are

brought  together again into a happy family.  That  is

the  merger we know of. It is that state. But the form

that  this merger should take can be genuine or cannot

be  genuine.  All the attacks that the leader  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis has been levelling at the government

are towards the form that this merger should take, but

not towards the state of merger itself. The leader  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis made that  very  clear  in  his

opening speech. He said he was for it. If I may  quote

him,  he said, "the words of this motion moved by  the

Minister  for  Labour convey high and  noble  meanings

which  none of us can disagree." He does not disagree.

That  is  in the Straits Times, Sir; I am not  quoting

from it but I was just refreshing my memory about  the

words  he  said. It is not a quotation. I  thought  he

said,  "words that convey a noble sentiment with which

none  of  us  in  this Chamber can disagree."  It  was

clear.  He  said that, and he said again  earlier - and

this I quote from the Straits Times of 21st November:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"We would have supported this motion before the

House  100 per cent had it not been for the shameful

record of the Government in recent months."'



<br><br>It   was  clear.  The  Barisan  Sosialis  would   have

supported this motion .100 per cent, but as the leader

said,   because  of  the  twists  and  turns  of   the

Government in trying to present the negotiations  that

the Government has been having with the Government  of

the  Federation  of  Malaya, he became  unhappy.  That

caused  him  to focus attention on the fact  that  the

merger that the Government is trying to foist - I  think

the word was "foist" - on the people of Singapore is not

a  genuine  merger. And that caused  him  to  move  an

amendment. But surely he should not have moved it.  He

is  in  full support of the noble sentiments expressed

in  the motion moved by the Minister for Labour. I can

understand, Sir, why he was stirred into speaking  for

so long and so bitterly against the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  It  was  because the Minister for  Labour,  in

moving  a motion that is of the gravest importance  to

the livelihood and welfare of the people of Singapore,

had thought it necessary, in spite of the Government's

boast  of having a Ministry of Culture, to dare  their

ex-comrades  (the  Barisan Sosialis)  to  state  their

stand. And even if they say it is white, they will not

believe it. They smear. "No, it is not white. It could

be  black." And even if they say, "Black",  they  say,

"No,  it  could be white." How could they do that?  If

the  Government is sincere in getting a unanimous vote

on  a  motion  of such importance - and everyone  cannot

deny  it  is  a  motion of importance -  the  Government

should  not go out of its way and start casting doubts

on   their  own  ex-comrades.  That  is  the  P.A.P.'s

style - every time they stand up in this Assembly,  they

say,  "We couldn't care less how the Opposition vote",

and  yet they want a unanimous vote. That is the  kind

of culture they have been indoctrinating themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again, on a motion of such grave importance,

what  do  we  see? The P.A.P. Ministers  showing  such

levity - laughing,  and  laughing,   and   laughing   at

everything that the Member for Queenstown said. And it

was   then  disclosed  by  the  Minister  for  Finance

yesterday  that they laughed it off because  what  the

Member  for Queenstown said about them was  not  true,

and  that  was  the only way for them  to  show  their

contempt. That is their kind of culture. I am sure the

people  of  Singapore  do  not  relish  that  kind  of

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said that we oppose this amendment

because it is just so many extra words put in. I know,

and  as  I  have  endeavoured to explain,  the  Bansan

Sosialis leader has said that he is for the sentiments

expressed in that simple motion. "We all want merger."

Yes,  we  all want merger. How to achieve that merger?

What  form  that  merger should take  is  a  different

thing,  and a debate would have arisen when the motion

of  the  Prime Minister on Paper Cmd. 33 of  1961  was

moved.  But  because of the trend of the debate,  Sir,

you  have  ruled that we can speak on  the  other  two

related motions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what the Barisan Sosialis is against is the

form  of merger. Unfortunately they have got the wrong

end  of the stick. But they have been misguided by the

Prime  Minister in all his utterances in public,  over

Radio  Singapore, and even here. He calls  it  merger.

Sir,  the closer relationship that we are getting with

the  Federation of Malaya is not merger.  Let  us  get

away  from that word. It is not merger. Even the Prime

Minister of the Federation of Malaya says, "It is more

correct   to   describe   this   as   a   very   close

relationship." That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Association.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Association. We are getting closer

and  closer. It is not merger. So if the P.A.P. would

get  away  from that word "merger", then I  think  the

Barisan  Sosialis would have said, "All that  we  have

said  about  phoney merger, humbug merger,  would  not

apply." But it is because of the attempt by the P.A.P.

to try to claim political credit for something that is

not  of  their  own  making - they claim,  "Now  we  are

getting merger."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we oppose this amendment, it must not be

taken to mean that we are anxious to defend the P.A.P. -

the  P.A.P. in our eyes and in the eyes of the  public

stands  condemned. But we cannot, just  for  political

expediency,  support an amendment  moved  by  the  new

star, which came out of the old star, just because  we

are  in the Opposition. To us, Sir, and to the public,

the  P.A.P. means those that now remain of  that  torn

organisation and those that have come out, the  P.A.P.

on  that  side of the House, and the P.A.P. who  have

come  to  this side of the House. They are  still  the

P.A.P.,  no matter what they call themselves - Barisan

Sosialis, or whatever new star they want to claim  has

arisen  over  the  horizon. It  is  strange  that  ex-comrades have challenged their erstwhile comrades, the

P.A.P.,  to  resign  because  they  have  lost   their

mandate.  "Hold  a general election.  They  have  lost

their  mandate."  But, Sir, may I remind  the  retired

members  of  the  P.A.P., the new  star,  the  Barisan

Sosialis, that they were the P.A.P. too when they were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



elected to this Assembly? In fact, in 1959 all of them

were  fighting under one banner. All of them  were  so

united, presenting a united front, thereby getting the

public  of Singapore to work for them. Therefore,  the

Members  who are now on this side, forming the Barisan

Sosialis,  were  voted by the people of  Singapore  as

representatives  of the P.A.P. So if they  think  they

want  a fresh mandate in this House to show that  they

are no longer members of the P.A.P., but that they are

the  only  Party which can save the country  from  the

P.A.P., may I, therefore, suggest that if they keep on

talking of going out for elections and getting a fresh

mandate,  they  should get a fresh  mandate  from  the

electorate  which  returned them to  this  Chamber  as

representatives  of  the now,  to  them,  contemptible

P.A.P. if they do not do that, I hope they  will  not

come   and   claim   that   they   are   the   genuine

representatives,  the genuine opposition,  the  people

who  can give succour to the people of Singapore,  and

that  they are the only strong Opposition with a  good

number - 13. Sir, to us, those who remain on that  side

and  those  who have come to this side are  still  the

P.A.P. They are still people who, during the last  two

years, have caused so much damage to Singapore and who

have -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was hoping that the hon.

Member would come to the end of his peroration. We are

now on an amendment which suggests that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . .this House affirms and declares that the first

objective of all true patriots of Malaya is to achieve

the  reunification  of  these  two  territories  in  a

genuine  merger  of Singapore with the  Federation  of

Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation as  the

twelfth  state and with all its Citizens automatically

becoming Federation Citizens on Merger Day."



<br><br>Perhaps  the  Member  could  now  concentrate  on  the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I will have to touch on the point

raised by the Member for Queenstown when he moved  the

amendment. In moving that amendment he was  trying  to

say  that those who are left of the P.A.P. are  people

who  are  indulging in a sell-out, and that those  who

have come out of the P.A.P. are the people who are not

going to buy it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member does

know that the Member for Queenstown was compelled,  as

he  was  speaking on the main motion, to speak on  all

items touching on merger. That is, items 1, 3 and  4.

Therefore, he had to range over a wide field and  then

move  his  amendment. The procedure is  that  once  an

amendment  is  moved,  we  have  to  dispose  of  that

amendment first. That would not prevent the Member for

Cairnhill from coming back to his attack when we  come

back to the main motion, either as originally posed or

as   amended.  I  did  suggest  a  procedural   device

yesterday,  hoping  that  there  would  not   be   any

procedural barriers put up to Members. But in order to

enforce that device, I had to have it assented  to  by

all  Members. I think it was the Member for  Cairnhill

who  disagreed with that device. Therefore, I must now

insist  that  the  debate should be  confined  to  the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I bow to your

ruling.  Sir,  merger  has been,  shall  we  say,  the

platform  of every political Party in Singapore,  even

political Parties that are now defunct. Why is it  so?

Why is it that Parties that claim to be socialists and

Parties which are described as Rightists and all sorts

of  unkind names all think alike? Merger - they want  to

get  closer.  They  want to get  integrated  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya into one happy family.  We  all

want that, and I am sure there can be no opposition to

that  noble  sentiment flat has been expressed  inside

and  outside this Assembly: that we want to merge with

the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, if it can be said in this Assembly,

even  during  the first negotiations of the  Singapore

Constitutional delegation led by the Member for  Anson

in  London, it was suggested to the British Government

that   in   discussions  on  constitutional  evolution

Singapore should sit in with the Federation of  Malaya

so  that there could be one constitution for the whole

of  Malaya.  Even as far back as that. The unfortunate

thing  is  that the Government has tried  to  describe

something  which is not merger as merger, and  thereby

has caused this unhappiness in the minds and hearts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



of  many  people. I can sympathise with the leader  of

the Barisan Sosialis when he spoke so bitterly against

the  P.A.P. All I can say is that he has been  misled.

If he would just stand up and say that the arrangement

which  the Singapore Government has come to  with  the

Federation Government is not merger, everything  would

have  been  forgiven. Instead of which, we had  7½

hours of debate just talking about citizenship rights.

The  Barisan Sosialis now make out that they  are  the

biggest Opposition party and the only defenders of the

rights of the citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, Sir, in this hall, with humility, remind the

Barisan  Sosialis that it was the previous Government,

the  Labour  Front Coalition Government, that  brought

citizenship to the people of Singapore? Out  of  that,

three  of us still remain in this Assembly - the Member

for Anson, the Member for Geylang Serai and myself. We

can assure the people of Singapore and this House that

we  will fight tooth and nail to see that their rights

are  preserved, and to see that their rights  are  not

sold  down the drain. But what has been agreed between

the Singapore Government and the Federation Government

is not merger. Therefore, citizens of Singapore cannot

become citizens of the Federation of Malaya. There  is

no loss of rights at all of the citizens of Singapore.

I will touch on that later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one thing I would like to point out

now. The fact that the Member for Queenstown spoke for

7½ hours shows that he is a virile man. He is in top

form. He is quite a good cock that can crow. But. Sir,

merger  is  like marriage. It requires the consent  of

two parties. Even if a prospective bridegroom can show

how virile he is, how amorous he is, how fond he is of

that  union,  but if the bride says - or be  it  be  the

bride  or the bridegroom -  "Sudah lah, chakap terlampau

banyak", then that would be the end. There can  be  no

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the leader of the Barisan Sosialis has

forgotten is that it takes two parties to this merger.

It  is not left to what we say in this Assembly. If it

is just left to what we say. I do not know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



how  many  more will be saying about what  the  P.A.P.

Government  is, and that the sooner they get  out  the

better for all concerned. But it is something that has

to  do  with the other party not represented  in  this

House.  Let  us face facts. The other party  is  in  a

stronger  position. He is in a position  to  say  this

way,  that  way or sit still, because he is the  elder

brother.  Take  Malaya. In size,  it  is  bigger  than

Singapore.  In  population it  is  still  bigger  than

Singapore. Even in revenue. Therefore, we are  in  the

position  of  a  younger brother  going  to  an  elder

brother and saying, "Come on, let us live together. Do

not  let us have this separation which was forced upon

us  by the British." But no. The Member for Queenstown

seems  to think that the louder we shout, the more  we

run  down  our elder brother, the surer  we  will  get

complete  merger.  That  will  be  the  surer  way  to

frighten  the elder brother into saying, "Let  us  not

have  this  younger  brother who  is  going  to  cause

trouble in my household." Therefore, all what  he  has

said against the Federation, against the Government of

the  Federation is not going to help his Party or  the

people  of  Singapore to achieve  something  which  he

himself says is a noble sentiment. Let us get together

and live together again as one happy family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown found occasion

yesterday to criticise the Tunku, and I want to say to

this  Assembly  that  the  criticisms  which  he   has

levelled  at the Tunku are unjustified. He  says  also

that  he  is  new to politics, a student of  politics.

Because he is new, because he is a student, perhaps we

can  overlook that. But may I say a few things to  him

about  the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya,

and   how  important  it  is  to  Singapore  that  his

friendship,  his sentiments towards Singapore, should

be  properly  realised and appreciated by everyone  in

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will remember that the Singapore

Constitutional   delegation   went   to   London   and

negotiated.  The first one was not successful  because

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



insistence of the British on internal security resting

in their hands. But the second delegation, knowing the

stand  of the British Government, thought of a way  to

overcome that difficulty. It was left to me to speak to  my good friend, Tunku Abdul Rahman, from London on

the telephone and to seek, his agreement to sit in  as

a member of the Internal Security Council. To tell the

truth,  he did not quite like it. But because he  felt

that  as Malaya and Singapore were close together  and

as  Singapore was in need of help from the  Federation

to  get  a  new constitution, he agreed. Therefore,  I

want to say this in this Assembly. Without the Tunku's

consent  to  be  a  member of  the  internal  Security

Council,  there  would  have  been  no  self-governing

constitution for Singapore. There would have  been  no

43  P.A.P. Members taking office in 1959. In 1961,  26

are  left, So as far back as 1957, Tunku Abdul  Rahman

has  shown  that  he  is a good  and  true  friend  of

Singapore.  Today he is in London having  discussions,

with   the  British  Government,  and  he  is  getting

independence  for us. What we are more concerned,  the

socialists  particularly, is that we should  get  away

from the British colonial yoke. That is the first goal

to  achieve. The British colonial yoke will  be  taken

away  from our necks, and that is being done by a true

friend of Singapore, Tunku Abdul Rahman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in Tunku Abdul Rahman a very staunch

champion,  a  man  who  faces facts,  a  man  who  was

prepared,  even in the 1959 general elections  in  the

Federation, when there was trouble in the M.C.A. ranks

and  he was facing this trouble from the Chinese;  and

when  there  was  a  group  of  U.M.N.O. members  who

suggested  that they should tear away from the  M.C.A.

and stand on their own, but not Tunku Abdul Rahman -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did indicate that there are

procedural  barriers  and I  really  do  not  like  to

interrupt  too  often. But will the  hon.  Member  for

Cairnhill indicate how those statements relate to  the

amendment?  They, I think, will be very relevant  when

we  come to debate all three items on merger.  But  we

are now on the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Merger, Sir, surely means the

getting  together of Singapore and the  Federation  of

Malaya  and,  therefore,  the  leaders  in  these  two

countries  will  have to come up in  our  discussions.

What I am trying to point out to those who have spoken

bitterly  against  the Federation of  Malaya  and  the

Federation  Government  is  that  they  are  doing   a

disservice  to  Singapore, and that the attacks  which

they  are levelling are unjustified. They do not  know

that  the  man today who is helping Singapore  to  get

nearer towards merger is Tunku Abdul Rahman, and  that

is  the man who has come in for attacks by the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Cairnhill

has  brought  this  trouble  upon  himself.  When  the

procedural device was suggested which would have given

him a free hand, he objected to it, and therefore,  I,

as Speaker, am bound by the Standing Orders to try and

keep  Members  within  bounds.  We  are  now  on   the

amendment. The hon. Member is talking on merger, which

would  be  proper  when we deal with the  main  motion

which  merely  speaks of a merger. The amendment  says

that   they  want  a  genuine  merger  With  Singapore

entering the Federation as the twelfth state and  with

all   its   Citizens  automatically  becoming  Federal

Citizens  on  Merger Day. The meat of  that  amendment

seems  to  be  the question of citizens  automatically

becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us try and get on with the amendment. The sooner

we dispose of the amendment, the sooner we can go back

to  the  three motions. The hon. Member will  have  as

much  time  perhaps  as the Member for  Queenstown  to

develop his argument.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Sir,

on  a point of elucidation. Sir, I notice that in  the

amendment it states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'to leave out from "a" in the second last line to the

end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation as  the

twelfth  state and with all its Citizens automatically

becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day".'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see. Mr Speaker, it is not that I have come

to the defence of the Member for Cairnhill only, but I

think  to  the defence generally of all those  Members

who  wish  to  speak on this amendment. I  am  not  in

concord  with you. Mr Speaker, that all that  we  are

confined  to talking about on this amendment  is  this

bit   on  Singapore  citizens  automatically  becoming

Federal Citizens on Merger Day.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I never said that. I indicated that the

pith  of  the  amendment seems to be  that.  There  is

nothing  to  prevent  Members  from  saying  how   the

amendment  is wrong when they speak of genuine  merger

as  against merger, which, of course, the hon.  Member

for  Cairnhill  has  already touched  upon.  There  is

nothing to prevent Members from saying whether or  not

Singapore  should enter the Federation as the  twelfth

state.  What  I  am  trying to indicate  is  that  all

details  which will be properly debated on an  overall

picture of all three items should be reserved for  the

proper time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> On a point of order,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, since I find that

some  Members have difficulty in confining  themselves

to  speaking on the amendment, because the issues  are

overlapping and inter-related, why do we not ascertain

the views of Members whether to adopt the procedure as

you  suggested yesterday, which I think is better  for

all  of  us,  because  most of us  have  prepared  our

speeches  which  should cover all the  three  or  four

motions.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I, Mr Speaker, associate myself

with  the  gentleman who just spoke? It seems  to  me,

Sir, not a question of having prepared one's speeches,

but  we  must appreciate that when we are speaking  on

the amendment about genuine merger, the twelfth state,

we  must  balance what we mean by genuine merger  with

the  merger proposals of the P.A.P. which bring in the

White Paper. I have every sympathy, Sir, not only  for

you, if I may say with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



respect, but also for the hon. Member for Cairnhill in

seeking  to draw the line. I would like to accept  the

suggestion made by you yesterday in so far  as  it  is

possible for me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is exactly the trouble which I

anticipated  Members  would find  themselves  in,  and

which  the Speaker would find himself in, because  all

these  issues seem to be overlapping and  it  is  very

difficult  to  draw the line. It is not too  late  for

hon.  Members  to  assent that we  should  adopt  that

procedure, that is to say, that the debate will now be

again thrown completely open, which will mean that all

Members  other  than the Minster for  Labour  will  be

allowed  one speech and one speech only, and  then  at

the  end  of  the debate the Minister for Labour  will

reply and then votes could be taken, firstly, on  this

amendment, then on the main motion, and then  on  item

3.   That,  of  course,  will  then  get  rid  of  any

procedural harriers that might present themselves.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr

Speaker,  it  is  not  clear to me.  This  means  that

immediately after our having disposed of the amendment

and when we go back to the main motion, no one will he

allowed to speak on the main motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I thought I made myself clear. If the

procedural  device is accepted, then the  debate  from

now  on will range over all three items and will range

over the amendment which has been proposed. And at the

end  of  the debate after the Minister for Labour  has

replied,  the question on the amendment  will  he  put

just for the purpose of taking a vote. The question on

item  I  will be put just for the purpose of taking  a

vote; then on item 3 just for the purpose of taking  a

vote;  and when item 4 is reached, we will wait  until

the Address of Thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is

moved,  then we will put the amendment of  the  Member

for  Queens-town  to the vote if he  so  wishes.  That

seems to me a more tidy way of debating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



the  matter; that is, if Members agree. As  I  say,  I

cannot foist any procedural device on Members unless I

have their assent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, did I hear you say just now

something about an amendment to the amendment  by  the

Member for Queenstown?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point we are discussing now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No. I was wondering what would

happen to the procedure then if that ever occurs?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Amendment to the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I thought I heard you

mention just now something about an amendment  to  the

amendment by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I did not mention anything of that

sort.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Only one point of clarification.

Assuming   we   accept   this  procedure,   we   would

nevertheless he able to speak on other aspects of  the

speech  of  His  Excellency than that  of  merger.  We

dispose of the amendment by vote and then we can speak

on the motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I suggest, Mr Speaker, that you

suspend this Assembly for 10 or 15 minutes so  that  I

can discuss this with my colleagues.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, since the Member for

Queenstown has moved his amendment, two speakers  have

followed  him. The Minister for Finance yesterday  and

the Member for Cairnhill yesterday and today. You have

found  that it is quite difficult to keep them  within

the  confines  of this amendment. For some  reason  or

other,  perhaps because most of us have  prepared  our

speeches.  So  I  think  we  should  adopt  this   new

procedure  whereby we will avoid a lot of  repetitious

arguments  and  it will be easier for the  Speaker  to

guide the proceedings of the sitting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I suggest then that I suspend for

half  an  hour,  allowing Members  to  confer  amongst

themselves for a quarter of an hour, and then I  would

suggest  that the leaders of the Parties  come  to  my

Chambers and settle this procedural device? If that is

acceptable,  I  will  do so. Is that  acceptable?  The

Member   affected,  of  course,  is  the  Member   for

Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I agree.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I will suspend and take

this Chair again at a quarter to four.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="center"><b>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The procedural device I

suggested has been accepted by the Opposition  Parties

but  not  by the Government side. The original  ruling

therefore stands. But I think Members will agree  that

as  the matter we are discussing is of grave import to

Singapore  - and there should, I think to my  mind,  be

continuity  in  debate - I do  not  propose  of  my  own

volition to stop Members should they wander away  from

the  amendment. But that, of course, will not  prevent

Members who so desire from rising on, a point of order

when they consider that the Member who is speaking  is

irrelevant,  and  the Chair will  then  rule  at  that

stage. Tun Lim.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Queenstown  was endeavouring to impress on this  House

and  the public of Singapore that he is a very  virile

man, that he knows what the public wants, and that  he

is fighting tooth and nail to get what it wants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this merger, Sir, I said earlier that a merger is

just like a marriage, and a happy marriage cannot take

place  unless  there is some courting being  done, in

this  moment of courting - and this is like a moment  of

courting  because  we  are  not  yet  married  to  the

Federation   of   Malaya - I  would   suggest   to   the

prospective bridegroom or bride that the way  to  win

the  love of the other party is not to try to say  how

good or how clever one is and how bad or how ugly  the

other party is. It does not help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, during the time when I was in

office,  I  did  all  I could in  this  technique  of

courting.  I  went  up  to the Federation.  I  was  as

friendly  as  possible and I believe I had  made  some

headway.  There was very good understanding and  there

were  certain sentiments that had germinated  towards,

if  not  a marriage, then at least an engagement.  But

then at that time, Sir, it was the P.A.P. who were  in

the  Opposition.  What did the Prime Minister  himself

say  when he was the leader of the Opposition? "Huh,

look  at this disgraceful Chief Minister of Singapore

licking  the  boots  of  the  Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya!" He said such harsh  words  in

this  House.  And today, since the Malaysia  idea  was

made  known by the Tunku in May this year, he has made

so  many  trips  to the Federation. In fact,  on  17th

November, we saw him at the Airport and we  saw  some

pictures  of  him  in Kuala Lumpur. He  described  the

courting that I had been doing as bootlicking, but the

Barisan Sosialis say that the Prime Minister has  been

going  on  all fours. I think they are fond  of  using

such  words without thought, having come from the same

school.  I do not want to say that the Prime  Minister

of Singapore has been doing more than bootlicking! But

what  I  would like to say is this, that  if  all  the

overtures  of the Prime Minister are directed  towards

reunification  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of

Malaya, then I will wish him the best of luck.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But not so the Barisan Sosialis.

They  say the Prime Minister is crawling on all  fours

on  outstretched hands. Sir, we do not  graduate  from

that same school - the

P.A.P. school of culture!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown - the leader of the

Barisan  Sosialis - is for merger, according to what  he

said  in his speech. I do not say I doubt that. I  say

it is good that we should all wish for merger. But the

way he goes about trying to achieve this is wrong.  Of

course. I can find excuses for the ravings he levelled

at  the P.A.P. It was because he felt so strongly that

the  P.A.P. had been leading Singapore up the  garden

path  on  this question of merger. But he should  have

restrained  himself in his attacks on his ex-comrades.

in  fact,  I think he knows better. Having  been  with

them, he therefore knows the kind of smell that he  is

smelling. But he should not have indulged in an attack

on  the  Government  of the Federation  of  Malaya  by

saying  that it was bad and that the sooner we  had  a

general election on the question of merger the quicker

it would be out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had in Singapore a so-called Socialist

Government for the past two years, and the .13 Members

of   the   new  "Star"  were  associated   with   that

Government.  For two years, they were in office.  What

do  we see in Singapore today? They criticise the type

of  government in the Federation. May I  ask  them  to

take  just  a  trip  to  Kuala  Lumpur  and  see   for

themselves  the  vast progress that  is  taking  place

there  as  compared with Singapore? In Singapore, we

find comrades disintegrating; but in the Federation we

find genuine progress towards economic stability. Over

here,  the  Government  claims  that  it  is  a   true

Socialist, non-Communist Government - I do not know what

more  to  describe them - but it has done nothing  other

than playing party politics in the trade union field.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order. Sir. I think

we  are now on the question of merger. I think I  have

received notice that the Member for Cairnhill will  be

speaking  on  the  motion  for  adjournment  on  trade

unionism,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



and  if he now confines his remarks until he comes  to

the motion, I think it will be in proper order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Leader of the House is

thinking of the Standing Order on anticipation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Irrelevancy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Leader of the House rises on the

question  whether or not the Member for  Cairnhill  is

irrelevant   in  regard  to  the  amendment   we   are

discussing,  then  I  say  that  the  Member  is   not

irrelevant. Tun Lim, please continue.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the subject that I wish to

touch  on  will  be covered by me in a speech  on  the

adjournment on the 24th.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am trying to lead up to is this. Here is

a  P.A.P. Government that says in this negotiation for

merger,  "You know, we just gave away this,  that  and

the other; but we insisted on education and labour and

we  got  it." I was leading up to that - education  and

labour - when  I  was  talking  about  the  trade  union

movement.  As if they fought so hard that they  wanted

education  and  labour. Look at  the  kind  of  labour

movement  that is going on in Singapore. Look  at  the

sufferings  of  the workers in Singapore  today  as  a

result of political rivalry in the trade union field.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Look at the education problem

today - although the Government might want  to  hide  it -

when the students in the middle schools refuse to take

the   examinations  of the  Government  and  are  now

organising  protests.  Very  good  education   policy!

Everybody is in favour of it!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I was trying to say just now was to answer

the  charges levelled by the Barisan Sosialis  at  the

Government of the Federation of Malaya. They  kept  on

saying  that they are Socialists. But since they  used

the  word "genuine" merger, perhaps they should  apply

that   adjective   "genuine"   to   themselves - genuine

Socialism or their own special brand of Socialism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaya today, there is economic progress, but

Singapore is beginning to feel the pinch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like to talk about merger. Every

Party  that  exists today - and even every  Party  that

came  into  existence years and years ago,  and  every

Party  that  will  come into existence  before  Merger

Day - will  have  as  the first item  "Merger  with  the

Federation of Malaya". In fact, the P.A.P. played  on

that  line in the general elections in 1959, and  when

they  came  into  power they did say  that  they  were

pledged to merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to what I said a little while ago on the

courtship  that  I carried on with the  Federation  of

Malaya during the time when I was Chief Minister up to

1959 when the P.A.P. came into power, all the attempts

that  I  had  made had been totally  damaged  by  the

presence  of  the P.A.P. form of Government.  Although

they in 1959 said that they had nothing to do with the

Communists,  "We are non-Communists  and  we  hold  no

truck  with  the  Communists. We  are  clean.  We  are

Socialists,"  yet today they have admitted  that  they

have  been sleeping with the Communists who  have  now

left  them  and  are  now perhaps  sleeping  with  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  That is what they  say  now.  They

admit  it.  So it was because of the very presence  in

the  Party  and in the Government of people whom  they

now  describe as Communists, Communist-front men,  and

all  sorts  of  things, and whom they were  trying  to

defend  and trying to explain away - it was because  of

all  that  that  they could make no headway  with  the

Government of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, in the very first year of office, said, "Huh, we have thought of a wonderful scheme - a Common Commodity Market. The previous

Government  never  dreamed of it. A  grand  idea.  The

Common  Commodity Market will help industrialisation."

The  question of the Common Commodity Market is still

not  settled.  What  has  happened?  The  P.A.P. were

returned  on  their  pledge to  achieve  merger.  What

happened  to  the relationship between the  Federation

and Singapore? Further and further apart, drawing away

the whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



time, so much so that in the second year of office the

Prime Minister could not, in all honesty, stand up and

say,  "Merger  is on the way." He even gave  up.  "The

less  we  talk of merger, the less heartache."  So  he

would  not  talk of merger because he knew merger  was

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then in May this year the Prime Minister of the

Federation of Malaya came over here and, addressing a

luncheon  of  foreign  journalists,  touched  on   the

subject  of  Malaysia.  When the Singapore  Government

heard  that,  they were so jubilant that  they  almost

fell  down on their feet - I think they nearly  fainted.

They  said,  "Ah merger is on the way." At that  time,

there  was  the Anson by-election. So  they  thought,

"Huh, now that merger is on the way, let us cash  in."

But  they  knew at that time, from the speech  of  the

Tunku  to  the foreign journalists, that  it  was  not

going  to  be merger. In fact, if it had been  merger,

they would also have said the same thing -  merger, they

would  want merger. But because they knew it  was  not

merger but only something closer, their strategist  - I

do  not  know  if  he was a special tactician  in  the

Party - came  out with a new programme, "We, the  P.A.P.

will  work towards merger with the Federation. But  we

will see to it that we retain education and labour."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now coming to what I describe as the

misrepresentation of the true facts of  the  case.  If

the  P.A.P. Government had said at that time that what

was  possible  under the plan outlined by  the  Prime

Minister  of the Federation of Malaya was some  closer

association  whereby  the Federation  of  Malaya  just

wanted  external  affairs, defence and  security,  and

Singapore  could have everything else  in  which  they

were  not  interested, then that would have been  more

right.  Then  the people would know that  it  was  not

merger  in the true sense of the word "merger".  There

can  be  only  one  meaning  for  merger - complete   in

tegration. They straightaway said, "Merger", "Merger",

"Merger".  And  everytime they have to  retreat - "This

kind   of   merger  for  citizenship,  no.   Singapore

citizenship - does not qualify." Another time when  they

are   questioned,  "Oh,  but  don't   you   see,   the

Constitution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Federation of Malaya states that in a  merger

only  those born in the State can automatically become

citizens, but all the others have to apply." And later

on, all sorts of retreat - retreating the whole time. At

another  time, they say, "Oh, yes. They  could  apply.

110,000 out of the 350,000." Yet they knew the reasons

why  it  was  not a merger proposed by the  Federation

Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us try to trace back. We were all

anxious  for merger, but we must admit that trends  in

Singapore  and in the Federation were in the  opposite

direction.  We  in Singapore have a more sophisticated

electorate.  We  have the P.A.P. with  the  lightning

flash,  and  now the Barisan Sosialis. The  P.A.P. is

still here. And we have had the kind of politics where

even,  in  the  words  of  the  Government  today   as

enunciated  by the Minister for Finance, they  had  to

work with the Communists. So obviously you find in the

Federation  a  different form of government  that  has

been  waging war against the Communists for years  and

years  and  has suffered quite a lot at  their  hands.

Surely  they would be very, very careful now in taking

in  people  into  the family. They  have  to  be  more

careful now as a result of their bitter experience, to

see that what they take in is not going to damage what

they  already have. But then why this sudden  idea  of

Malaysia? I would like to say what I know about this,

although I must say that I stand to be corrected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said outside and inside this Chamber that

questions  have  been  asked of  me  by  Pressmen  and

foreign  correspondents, "Do I believe and do I  think

that  merger  will  take place?" I said,  "Merger  is

inevitable.  Merger will have to take place.  Even  if

the  two  Governments  do not  see  eye  to  eye,  the

developments in this area would be at such a pace that

it  would be in the vital interests of the territories

concerned to come together."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Therefore, much as the Tunku did

not  like it, much as the Federation Government  would

not like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



to have anything to do with Singapore, they came to  a

proper   appreciation  of  the  situation   that   has

developed in this part of the world. And therefore, it

was felt in the Federation that the only way to ensure

that  there  is  no complete split of  the  artificial

split that is now in evidence is to get together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they have to think of the form of getting

together.  There  are very, very grave  or  legitimate

objections  on  the  part of the  Federation  to  take

Singapore  into a complete merger. That, we all  know,

is  not the reason why all this talk about merger  has

been slapped down by the Tunku. At least for the first

time,  because  of the trends of political  events  in

this  part  of  the world. Singapore is  going  to  be

allowed  to  live  along  the  same  street   as   the

Federation  of  Malaya.  If we  go  by  the  heads  of

agreement reached between the Singapore Government and

the  Federation  Government,  we  have  not  yet  been

allowed  to stay in the same house as one big  family.

But we will now be living in the same street as really

close neighbours. That is what we are. Then why do  we

oppose  this  amendment? I would like  to  repeat:  we

oppose the amendment not because we do not believe  in

genuine merger. We want genuine merger. Everyone wants

merger.  But  merger  is merger. We  cannot  call  it

genuine merger or not genuine merger. A marriage is  a

marriage.  You cannot say that a marriage  between,  a

man  and a woman is not genuine. Merger is merger.  We

want  to see merger. And to us, and to everyone, I  am

sure,   merger  means  a  complete  reunification   of

Singapore  into the Federation of Malaya  as  one  big

happy family.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Therefore, we oppose the

amendment  proposed  by  the  leader  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  because  the  qualifications  of  a  genuine

merger  (note  the adjective) have never  before  even

been  thought  of by them years and years  ago.  Their

Four-Year programme, their Anniversary Souvenir -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification, if

the hon. Member will give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would he accept the amendment, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  if  for the word "genuine",  the  word

"complete" were substituted?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There can only be one form of

merger,  Sir, and that kind of merger is complete  and

satisfying. We -do not have to say "complete merger",

or  that  a marriage is a complete marriage as  it  is

still a marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, another reason why we object to that is this:

here we know - on the second part of the amendment - that

the fact that Singapore and Malaya cannot come into  a

merger  is because of the fears, if you want to  call

them  fears, that are in the minds -of the  Federation

vis-a-vis  the citizens of Singapore. That,  I  should

say,  is the main reason why merger cannot take place.

And  to focus attention, as does this amendment  here,

and  say  that there must be genuine merger, that  the

citizens  of  Singapore  should  automatically  become

citizens, is not to allay the fears of the Federation,

but  is going to make it worse. Why should it be'? Why

should  we  try to frighten away people with  whom  we

want  very  much  to  become  friends?  Therefore,  we

object  to  that.  And according  to  our  view,  the

amendment  proposed  by  the  leader  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is just political, and nothing else.  It  is

just  to tell the people of Singapore, "There you are.

We  are braver than the P.A.P. We ask for this. We ask

for  that."  Sir, in a matter that concerns  the  very

livelihood  and  welfare of the people  of  Singapore,

we - the different political Parties represented in this

Assembly - should not play party politics. We should, in

fact, show the people in the Federation of Malaya  and

in  London,  where today negotiations are  now  taking

place   between   the  British  Government   and   the

Federation Government, that there is one desire of the

people of Singapore as expressed in the unanimous vote

in this Assembly. We believe in and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



want  merger.  Instead of which, the newspapers  will

carry  headline  news when the vote is taken,  Barisan

Sosialis  for the amendment; some people  are  against

it, and the amendment is won or lost; whatever it  is

that  is  won  or lost is immaterial.  Lost,  and  the

P.A.P. starts their original motion, which is carried.

All  that is playing party politics. It does not  help

us  in  the  eyes of the people of the  Federation  of

Malaya, nor in the eyes of the people of Singapore. We

should  not  do  it.  In this  one, we  must  have  a

unanimous  vote. We should say, "Yes, we are  all  for

it.' Then when we come to Command Paper 33, of course,

the  Barisan Sosialis will be free to say  it - if  they

want, they  can say it: it is a sell-out.  Go  ahead.

Criticise the heads of agreement as much as they want.

Criticise  the form that the P.A.P. is now  taking  to

get a unanimous vote of this House. If that is the way

they  achieve merger, that is the way they can attack.

But on this important issue, we want to tell the world

in  the  strongest  possible terms  that  we  in  this

Assembly  want  merger, but not  to  start  having  an

amendment  to  cause split votes in this  House.  Then

again  on the Government side, somebody would  be  for

and others would be against. That is no good vis-a-vis

our relationship with the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the Barisan Sosialis, after more mature

thought, feel that they have stressed their point, and

that  all speakers after this will just touch on  Cmd.

Paper  33, call it by whatever name they like to  call

it;  say  that  it  is a sell-out or  not  a  complete

merger; that that is not the way the Government should

go  on,  carry  out  the  unanimous  decision  of  the

Assembly.  They are free to do so. But  on  this  main

motion  on  merger, let us all with one  voice  forget

politics,  forget whether they were in the  P.A.P. at

one  time,  or  out  of the P.A.P. now;  forget  their

personal  animosity; both sides are trying their  best

to  run  the other down. Forget all that in this  very

important  motion. Let us tell the world that  we  can

sink  our  political differences just once,  when  the

welfare of the people of Singapore, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



when  a  very  important matter  is  just  around  the

corner,  that we can all be united. I would  urge  the

Barisan Sosialis to think this over. In fact, I am  in

sympathy  with them on most of the attacks  that  they

have  levelled  at  the P.A.P. I am in  sympathy  with

them.  But  on the motion I would ask them  to  forget

politics - just to say, accept the motion as it  stands

and  then  take  the Government to task  on  the  next

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I would urge upon this House, and. I have

explained why I stepped in so early in the debate,  it

is  because I would caution moderation. Please, if  we

want  to achieve this merger, if we want to get closer

with  the people in the Federation of Malaya,  let  us

not  in  this  Assembly say anything  that  may  cause

misgivings  in  their  minds or that  may  hurt  their

feelings.  They are just as human as we  are.  If  the

Barisan  Sosialis feel that they must do all they  can

to  expose their ex-comrades, the P.A.P., go ahead, do

it  on another motion. Or even on this motion if  they

want,  say  anything they like. But do  not  bring  in

anything  that  can be said to the derogatory  of  the

Government  of the Federation of Malaya or the  people

of  the Federation of Malaya. Do not do it. If we want

to  be friends, let us show that we really mean to  be

friends,  and  that  it is not a question  of  gaining

political  kudos and saying, "You see,  we  fight  for

everything. We speak so much. We expose everybody.  We

are  for  the  people  of Singapore."  Remember  this,

Singapore cannot stand alone now, especially as - and I

will   just  touch  on  it  in  passing -  the   Borneo

territories  are  now coming into  the  Federation  of

Malaysia.  Singapore cannot stand alone.  Even  today,

with  all  the  overtures of the  Prime  Minister  for

closer relationship with the Federation of Malaya, we

were told at an earlier sitting that the Minister  for

Education  had  tabled  a  Bill  to  incorporate   the

University of Singapore. Before their time, there  was

a  University of Malaya, one university for the  whole

of  Malaya. In the time of the P.A.P. - University  of

Malaya, University of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



Singapore!   Radio  Malaya,  Radio  Singapore,   Suara

Singapore - that is the twelfth awful disclosure of  the

Prime     Minister - Suara    Singapore!     Even     on

industrialisation, how difficult it is  for  Singapore

to    industrialise,   especially   when   prospective

investors  come along to this part of  the  world  and

then  go  to  Kuala  Lumpur, and  they  see  the  vast

difference. And they always say, "It is better  to  be

in the Federation of Malaya than in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So talking of moderation of language again, I would

urge upon all speakers of the Barisan Sosialis and the

P.A.P. to  remember  this. That the  motion  that  is

before   the   House - of  course,  there   are   other

motions - but  the main motion before the House  is  one

that calls for calm judgment, that calls for, shall we

say,  one united voice, and they should not take  this

opportunity to run down their ex-comrades. The Barisan

Sosialis  exposing the P.A.P., and the P.A.P. exposing

the Barisan Sosialis. All that does not matter on this

motion.   After  that,  I  could  assure  the  Barisan

Sosialis  that they are free to do what they want.  In

fact, I can even say this. That their criticism of the

P.A.P. might  not even be on the same  scale  as  the

criticism  that  we  will  level  at  the  P.A.P. in

discussions  on other matters that will  come  up  for

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why I say let us be moderate in our language is,

as  I  said,  that  for merger to take  place,  it  is

vitally  necessary to get the agreement of  the  other

party,  and  the  other party  in  this  case  is  the

Government  of  the Federation of Malaya.  Fortunately

for Singapore, we have, as the head of that Government

in  the  Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul  Rahman,  a

real friend. He is a real friend of Singapore. We  can

trust  him to see that Singapore is not placed in  any

disadvantageous position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would urge upon the P.A.P. in all their

speeches  after  this not to try to  claim  that  Cmd.

Paper No. 33 is bringing about merger. Talk no more of

merger  because it is not merger. The least  they  say

about merger, the better it will be for them, and  the

easier  ii will be for their ex-comrades to  take  it.

The plan that they agreed to is just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



to bring Singapore closer to the Federation of Malaya.

Instead  of  trying to prove things that need  not  be

proved,  because  it  is  their  conscience  that   is

pricking  them  the whole time because  they  seem  to

think  that people will say it is a sell-out, if  they

are  to  come out and say plainly, "This is  the  best

that  we can get under the circumstances and we advise

you that this is better than nothing," then there will

be  less attack. People will then say, "At least  they

have told the truth. There could be no allegations  of

twists and turns. There could be no allegations  of  a

phoney, a sell-out or humbug. It is because of the way

the P.A.P. present these talks that have been going on

in   the   Federation   between  Singapore   and   the

Federation,  present them in a way  which  they  think

could  give  them political credit, it is  because  of

that  that  they are now in this mess. They  need  not

have  to  be in this mess. They are now in this  mess.

Every-time  we tell them that it is not  merger,  they

keep  on  repeating that it is merger, merger, merger.

And Suara Singapore -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Suara P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And from Suara Singapore, I keep

on  hearing, "Merger, merger." I must say, Sir, I tune

it off when I know it is not merger. It is not merger.

The Tunku himself has said that it is a form of closer

association.  That is for the P.A.P. For  the  Barisan

Sosialis, if they really believe in merger, and  I  do

not  doubt it, if they really believe it and  want  to

achieve it, -if they want to get married - some of them,

I think, are still not married - the period of courtship

is   a   period  when  there  are  great  trials   and

tribulations.  Do not try to say that  you  are  rich;

that  you  are good; that you are this; that  you  are

that.  It will not help. But try to win the heart  and

mind of the other party. In order to win that, I would

tell them that they should not -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Member for

Cairnhill that the Chair is on this side?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Chair does

not  require  to  be  .reminded. But  Members  of  the

Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis   have   to   be  reminded   that   whatever

utterances  they  make  in  this  Assembly  may   have

repercussions on the merger discussion that is  taking

place -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That perhaps is quite agreed.

But  the rule says that the Member must speak  to  the

Chair,  or  rather  perhaps speak to  the  Assemblymen

through the Chair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> No. On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, it would appear

that  the Member for Cairnhill is directing his advice

to  this side of the House, and it appears to me  that

he   is   advocating  premarital  relationship  before

marriage. Can he clarify that, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, evil is he who

evil thinks. Maybe the Member for Nee Soon his mind is

so  full  of such ideas that when you start courtship,

that is premarital relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has been clarified.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sometimes it is very difficult for

doctors to understand. It is only laymen like us -

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, so in this courtship, which

is  still a courtship even although when the agreement

reached  with  the  Government of  the  Federation  of

Malaya  is  accepted  in this  House,  the  period  of

courtship is still there; but then, at least,  we  are

allowed  to  stay still. We can even talk through  the

window.  We  do not have to cross to Kuala Lumpur  any

more.  There  is  a period of courtship.  Let  us,  as

leaders of the people in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



this  House, try and win over the Government  of  the

Federation of Malaya, the people of the Federation  of

Malaya, so  that in the shortest possible time  there

can  be  merger. And when I say merger.  I  mean  real

lasting merger where the citizens of Singapore are the

citizens of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> To achieve that, one must be

careful  in  the choice of words when  one  speaks  to

someone whom one is courting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether there is real and genuine

enmity  between the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P.,  because

the  leader of the Barisan Sosialis on the  first  day

said.  "It  grieves me to see so man)' vacant  seats."

May be he was suggesting to the P.A.P., "Come on, call

me  back.  I'll  come hack. There are so  many  vacant

seats."  And yesterday, the Minister for Finance  said

that  they  were doing their best to save the  Barisan

Sosialis from the clutches of the Communists,  and  he

ended his speech by saying, "Hop it while the going is

good". Sir, from all these suggestions, perhaps it  is

clear  to  us  that  there  is  really  no  difference

although   they  are  in  opposite  camps;  they   are

together.  They  cannot deny the fact that  they  have

been  together. They have been together for two years.

To  every  criticism of the Opposition, we found  that

those  who  are  now  sitting on this  side  were  the

greatest  champions of P.A.P. policy, in  fact,  if  I

remember  rightly,  the  Member  for  Queenstown, the

leader  of  the Barisan Sosialis, touched on  what  he

called the arbitrary imposition of the pay-cuts of the

civil service. Those were the words used by us when we

were just eight of us here -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of order.

This  is  not  relevant to the motion we  are  talking

about at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order has, of course, been

correctly taken. The hon. Member is straying away from

the  amendment. He should try not to stray  away  from

the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it another point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir,I

do not want to appear -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He has given way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I do not want to appear as

if  I were the Speaker, hut as you have said just now,

you  would give leave to the House to pull up a Member

if  he  is  out of order. I only wish to  remind  the

Member  for  Cairnhill that there is ample opportunity

for him to debate or bring out whatever remarks he has

on  the  second  half of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Does it hurt?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is exactly what

I  have  been saying from the very beginning  of  this

debate. There will be opportunities for Members to say

what  they want to say when we debate the other  items

on  the  Order Paper. I have indicated that since  the

procedural device I have suggested has not been agreed

to  by one side of the House, I will not take -it upon

myself  to  pull  up  Members for  irrelevancies.  The

Leader  of the House, of course, is at liberty to  get

up on points of order when Members are irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, it seems I have been

trying  to tell Members the art of courtship.  I  must

take  in the right spirit what the Leader of the House

is trying to say in his explanation. I know, Sir, that

it  is  very difficult for a speaker not to apparently

stray,  but it is so difficult to do justification  to

the  stand  that we take in opposing the amendment  of

the Barisan Sosialis unless we have an opportunity  to

explain  and to answer the criticisms that the  Leader

of  the Barisan Sosialis has brought before this House

for 7½ hours; unless we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



have  a  chance to explain that all that he  has  been

saying is not all right. It will be difficult.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. When the Member for Cairnhill I

said that the speaker was straying, I take it he means

the Member speaking and not the Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I mean the man who speaks,

not the Speaker who seldom speaks!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the words of the leader of the

Barisan  Sosialis can cause, and for all we  know  may

have  already caused, misgivings in the hearts of  the

people  of  the  Federation. He  touched  so  much  on

citizenship. In fact, most of his speech,  the  attack

that  he  levelled  at the P.A.P. Government,  was  on

citizenship.  Of  course,  we  know,  Sir,  that  only

citizens of Singapore will have the vote and they  are

hoping that there might be a general election soon  as

they are calling on the Government to resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arrangement that the Government of

Singapore  has  reached  with the  Government  of  the

Federation, as contained in Cmd. Paper No. 33, clearly

shows  that it is not merger, and because  it  is  not

merger,  therefore, the citizens of  Singapore  cannot

claim to be citizens of the Federation of Malaya.  All

the  confusion that has arisen is as a result  of  the

Prime Minister trying to explain away this citizenship

by  telling  the Ban-san Sosialis and  the  people  of

Singapore  that citizenship is citizenship, but  there

is  nationality.  Federal nationality?  Everyone  will

become a Federal national; but citizenship, why worry.

Singapore  citizens are still Singapore citizens,  and

Federal  citizens are still Federal citizens.  If  the

Prime  Minister had not tried to show that he was  too

clever,  everything would have been easily  understood

and  everybody would have been happy. The  arrangement

that has been reached between the Singapore Government

and  the Federation Government is that, in so  far  as

external  affairs, defence and internal  security  are

concerned, these shall be vested in the Government  of

the  Federation of Malaya. Apart from that, and  apart

from pan-Malayan matters which could be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



concurrent  with  or vested in the Government  of  the

Federation  of Malaya, Singapore is to be  autonomous.

Singapore, at least is going to have an opportunity to

send  great  leaders like the leader  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis to the Federal Parliament where he can  speak

on  behalf of the people of Singapore and protect  the

interests of the people of Singapore. Fifteen of them.

Whether 15 is enough or not enough is a matter that  I

am  sure  the  Assembly would like to  touch  on.  The

leader  of the Barisan Sosialis says it is too  small.

He  has suggested it could be 30. But the line that my

Party  will take is this. I say here in all sincerity.

Had  it  been an Alliance Government here  today,  we

would  have got a better deal. But because the  P.A.P.

which  is  now the Government has agreed on  this  and

departed  from that, we will support them on that.  It

would  appear that that is the best they  can  do.  We

should be thankful.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That at least Singapore is going

to  live  side by side along the same street with  the

Federation of Malaya and the Bornean territories; that

these  territories which were at one  time  under  one

British  administrative control  will  now  come  back

together  and  be in the Federation of  Malaysia.  And

that  is a good start. Although, of course, there will

be  some  like the Barisan Sosialis who want  complete

merger straightaway. It is easy to say what you  want,

Sir,It  is  very easy to say that we  want  complete

merger;  that we want this and that we want that.  But

one   must  remember  that  we  must  also  take  into

consideration the wants of the other party. Even  take

Singapore  for instance. Years and years ago,  we  all

wanted in-dependence, but then we were quite satisfied

with natural evolution towards independence -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We had a Rendel Constitution when

the Member for Anson was the first Chief Minister -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - and quite rightly, he was not

satisfied  with  the  Rendel  Constitution.  He   went

forward to get the present Constitution. What  is  the

next  step?  The  next step, he says, is  independence

through merger, but since merger is not taking  place,

it  is  still  independence through closer association

with the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today - and in fact for the last three days - Tunku

Abdul  Rahman  and  his colleagues have  been  holding

discussions in London and it appears strange  that  it

is  left  to  the Prime Minister of the Federation  of

Malaya  to  go and talk of independence for Singapore.

He  is such a good man. He goes there to help us  out,

and yet we have Members of the Barisan Sosialis trying

to tell him off [Interruption].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. Sir, that the Member for Queenstown is still

as  excited as ever. The first day when he stood up to

give  his speech, he was so excited that he forgot  my

poor  head.  His hand came into contact with  my  poor

head!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Blistered!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> And the Member for

Farrer Park got it too!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Member for Farrer Park and I

do  not  have  sufficient hair, and we had  our  heads

fertilised  by the Member for Queenstown when  he  got

excited!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is offered to us in this Cmd. Paper No. 33

is  the best possible under the circumstances,  and  I

would urge the representatives in this House to accept

it because it will just make certain of our desire for

merger - call it complete merger or genuine  merger.  We

will be taking the first step. We will be getting  one

foot  in.  The P.A.P. has exposed itself to an  attack

that  what  they are trying to deliver is not  merger,

because in their attempt to describe merger, they have

tried to get political credit for themselves. But much

as we do not like it, we must be thankful that for the

first time after so many, many years of separation, we

have a Government in the Federation of Malaya which is

prepared to extend a friendly hand so that we  can  be

closer  together,  so that we can at  least  have  the

opportunity of knowing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



each  other at close range, and so that we can  really

become one in the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us not try to say that the citizens of

Singapore have been let down. They have not  been  let

down. The only question you can ask is, why should the

P.A.P.  Government be so anxious to give away internal

security? That you can ask the P.A.P. Government.  But

I  know why. I do not have to ask. They want to  shirk

their  responsibility for internal security even under

this   Constitution.   Internal   security   is    the

responsibility  of  the Government of  Singapore.  But

what  do  they  always say? They  says  "The  Internal

Security  Council." Every time they  hide  behind  the

cloak  of the Internal Security Council, and this  was

referred to by the Minister for Finance yesterday when

he  said, "Oh, this is not true." Not true! Of course,

they  do not like it. Therefore, when they say,  "Give

away internal security to the Federation," and at  the

same time a series of 12 awful disclosures is made by

the   Prime  Minister  over  Radio  Singapore,   Radio

Singapura -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Radio P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - I can feel sorry for the Members

of  the  Barisan Sosialis who fear that  all  this  is

leading up to something, that the P.A.P. Government is

working  all  this up so that later on the  Federation

Government  will step in and clean the house  for  the

PAP.  I cannot blame the Barisan Sosialis for thinking

along  those lines. But in so far as the statement  is

derogatory  to  the  Government of the  Federation  of

Malaya,  I  want  to say this. The Government  of  the

Federation of Malaya has been associated with  us  for

the past two years in the Internal Security Council. I

am  sure  that the Singapore Government can say,  with

all   sincerity,  that  the  representative   of   the

Federation  of Malaya has never at any time interfered

or given orders to the Singapore Government as to what

should or should not be done. In fact, questions  have

been  asked - even at this sitting - by the  Member  for

Anson  whether  or not the Federation  Government  has

asked the Singapore Government to take certain actions

in the Internal Security Council, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



answer  has been "No". So for the two years  that  the

Federation Government has been associated with  us  in

the  Internal  Security Council, they have  not  done-anything to make us fear them. Therefore, in this  new

arrangement where internal security is to be vested in

the  Federation of Malaya, need we have any fear'? Can

we  not understand that a Governmen - particularly  an

elected  Government - cannot do what h wants,  that  it

has  to face the electorate even in the Federation  of

Malaya  if  it  does things that are unconstitutional,

undemocratic and not in keeping with the Constitution?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can understand that the Federation

Government   is   interested  in  internal   security.

Internal security is a problem that affects the  whole

of  Malaysia.  It  does  not  only  affect  Singapore.

Therefore,  the  Federation says that  it  has  to  be

interested  in internal security, for what happens  in

Singapore  is  going  to  have  repercussions  in  the

Federation.  Therefore,  as  an  older  brother,   the

Federation feels that it must at least have a  say  in

the  internal  security of Singapore which  cannot  be

divorced  from the internal security of the  whole  of

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On external affairs, I think we are satisfied, as

there  has been no challenge made. Defence is Malayan-wide. We cannot defend Singapore without defending the

whole of Malaya. Therefore, I think no one can quarrel

with  defence  and  external  affairs, although   the

Barisan Sosialis have touched on internal security  by

saving, as a result of that, that the big bad ogre  in

the Federation will be doing all sorts of nasty things

to help the P.A.P. Government to remain in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P., or the Government, are wont to

accuse  the Barisan Sosialis - and I am sure  they  will

keep  on accusing them - of not being for genuine merger

or  for complete merger. They will try to ridicule the

Barisan  Sosialis. I am not speaking for  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  but I hope that in what they say they  must

remember this, that in whatever speeches they may want

to  make  on this very important issue, they must  get

away



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



from  party politics. Let us look at - the  matter  in

its  proper perspective and not be swayed by  personal

animosity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this amendment that is before the House, I

would like to say that we oppose it not because we  do

not believe in genuine merger or that the citizens  of

Singapore should not become citizens of the Federation

of Malaya, but we oppose it because the words added by

the  leader  of the Barisan Sosialis are  tautologous,

redundant  and are of a political character.  We  hope

that  the Barisan Sosialis, if they sincerely  believe

in  merger - and  I  say  they do sincerely  believe  in

merger - will  withdraw  the  amendment  and   take   a

unanimous  vote on the motion that has been  moved  by

the  Minister for Labour. They can then level as  much

criticism as they want on the form of merger that  the

P.A.P. proposes to take in Cmd. Paper No. 33. But  on

an  expression  of noble sentiments,  let  us  all  be

united.  Let  us criticise as much as we want  on  the

method of achieving our goal, but let us also remember

that  merger  is just the ultimate goal. For  so  many

years,  the ball has never been at our feet. Today  we

have the ball. Let us dribble it closer and closer  to

the goal-mouth and we will wait for the opportune time

to shoot it into that goal of merger.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Sir, it is the moment of interruption.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is not really the moment of

interruption. I was think, ing of carrying  -on  until

half-past five since we had half an hour's break.  Mr

Byrne.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all genuine

nationalists  and patriots have always  wanted  merger

except  the  Communists and the British who,  although

they  have  never been able to obstruct  the  tide  of

nationalism in the Federation, have nevertheless  been

happy to acquiesce in arrangements in which they could

still   exercise  sovereignty  over  their   base   in

Singapore, which is vital for the protection of  their

interests in this area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some, Sir, who say they believe in merger

and   who  have  seized  upon  two  Articles  of   the

Federation  Constitution, just two  Articles  of  that

Constitution, namely, Articles 2 and 22.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have here with me an authoritative

exposition  on  the Constitution of the Federation  of

Malaya,  and I would refer the House now to Article  2

which  provides that the Federation Parliament may  by

law  admit other States to the Federation; and Article

22  which  provides that the Parliament may  determine

what  persons  are to be citizens by reason  of  their

connection  with the territory which is admitted.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  they  have  seized  upon  these   two

Articles of the Federation Constitution to base  their

claim  for a complete merger with automatic Federation

citizen  fights for all Singapore citizens,  and  they

have  maintained  that  if  these  two  Articles  were

invoked,  the  Federation Parliament could  have  been

persuaded to agree to this demand. They have even gone

to  the  extent  of accusing those who  have  had  due

regard   to  the  other  important  Articles  of   the

Federation Constitution as well as these two  Articles

of being guilty of what they call a sell-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before we claim automatic

Federation citizenship rights for our citizens, it  is

important  for  us first to find out the circumstances

in  which automatic citizenship rights are granted  in

the  Federation.  That is of paramount  importance  in

these discussions. That brings us, Sir, directly to  a

consideration  of  Article 14 (1)  of  the  Federation

Constitution. Here, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is laid  down

who  are the persons who are citizens by operation  of

law, i.e., who are the persons who are entitled to  an

automatic  grant of Federation citizenship.  They  are

the following persons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person who, immediately before Merdeka Day.

was  a  citizen of the Federation by virtue of any  of

the  provisions of the Federation of Malaya Agreement,

1948, whether by operation of law or otherwise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take that first provision, Sir. It becomes

necessary for us to enquire who are these persons  who

became   citizens  by  operation  of  law  under   the

Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948; and to find  out

who  they  are,  we  must look at the  terms  of  this

Agreement.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,I  have  arranged  for

copies  of  this  Agreement  to  be  circulated   this

afternoon.  As  a matter of historical interest, this

Federation  of  Malaya  Agreement.  1948,   which   is

scheduled  to  the  Order-in-council implementing  the

Federation of Malaya Agreement which is reproduced  in

the subsidiary legislation and the legal notifications

of the Federation of Malaya of 1948 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Sir. Just to assist you, Sir, we

have  copies.  They  have been  given  to  us  by  the

Assembly Clerk.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Librarian.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry. The Librarian.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> As a matter of historical interest, this

Federation   of  Malaya  Agreement  was   subsequently

amended   by  the  Federation  of  Malaya  (Agreement)

Ordinance, 1952. That amendment was necessary  because

of  the  passing of the British Nationality and Status

of Aliens Act by the British Parliament, and also, Mr

Speaker, Sir, because of the stricter provisions  that

the  Federation  Government wished to  introduce  into

their  citizenship arrangements after the outbreak  of

the Emergency in the Federation in 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the two relevant sections for the

purpose  of  this discussion are section  124  of  the

Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, and section  125

of  the  Federation  of  Malaya Agreement  (Amendment)

Ordinance,  1952. By virtue of the provisions  of  the

Interpretation  and General Clauses Enactment  in  the

Federation of Malaya, it is necessary for us  to  read

the  Agreement  of 1948 in relation to the  amendments

that  were made by the (Amendment) Ordinance of  1952.

Mr Speaker, Sir, if these two sections -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



section  124  of  the Federation of Malaya  Agreement,

1948,  and  section  125 of the Federation  of  Malaya

Agreement  (Amendment) Ordinance, 1952-are studied  in

relation  to  each other, it will be observed  that  a

person born in Penang or Malacca (what is referred  to

in   the  agreement  as  British  Settlements)  become

Federation citizens by operation of law. A person born

in any other part of the Federation does not become  a

citizen by operation of law unless -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) he is a subject of the ruler. Subjects of the

ruler  are  defined  as aborigines,  Malays  and

persons naturalised as subjects of the ruler.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) he is a British subject or a citizen of the

United  Kingdom and Colonies. (Whenever "British

subjects"  were  used in the 1948 Agreement, the

words  "Citizen  of the U.K. and Colonies"  were

substituted  in  the amending  Ordinance.")  And

one  of  his  parents  is born  in  any  of  the

territories of the Federation.



<br><br>Sir, if the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, is

looked at, it will be seen that there are two

other provisions in that Agreement. The first

was that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons born before, on or after the 1st

February, 1948. (i.e. the appointed date of the

Federation of Malaya Agreement) in the

Federation who habitually spoke the Malay

language and conformed to Malay customs;



<br><br>and secondly -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other persons born before.

on  or  after the 1st February, 1948, in any  of

the  territories  of  the  Federation,  both  of

whose   parents  were  born  in   any   of   the

territories  of the Federation and  were  before

or  at  the  time of their birth  or  thereafter

became permanently resident in any territory  of

the Federation -



<br><br>were   also  citizens  by  operation  of  law.   These

provisions  were deleted by the Federation  of  Malaya

Agreement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



(Amendment) Ordinance, 1952, after the outbreak of the

Emergency.  In  fact,  the Federation  Government  was

clearly  tightening up its citizenship  laws  when  ii

made  that amendment. Sir, all other persons  who  are

born  in  the  Federation  would  have  to  apply  for

Federation  citizenship, and the words used  are  that

they   must   make  an  application  "for   Federation

citizenship and to satisfy the requirements laid  down

in  the  Federation of Malaya Agreement. 1948."  I  am

told  those requirements are requirements of residence

and an adequate knowledge (note the words used are not

"an  elementary knowledge" but "an adequate knowledge"

of the Malay language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now return to Article 14 of

the  present Constitution of the Federation of Malaya.

The  second  category of persons who are  entitled  to

automatic   citizenship  rights,  under   the   second

provision  of  Article 14, are  persons  born  in  the

Federation on or after Merdeka Day. Here, Sir, we  get

to  the point where, for the first time, the jus  soli

is  accepted  as  being the law of the  Federation  of

Malaya. I will come to that later. Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category are those persons who are born

outside  the Federation on or after Merdeka Day  whose

fathers  are citizens at the time of their  birth  and

whose fathers were either born in the Federation or in

the service of the Government of the Federation or  of

a State at the time of their birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth and last category are those persons who

are  born  outside the Federation on or after  Merdeka

Day  whose fathers are citizens at the time  of  their

birth,  if  the  birth  is  registered  at  a  Malayan

Consulate  within  one year of its occurrence  or  for

such longer period as the Federation Government may in

any particular case allow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, Sir, we have it in a nutshell, a succinct and

comprehensive  statement in a single  Article  of  all

persons  who are entitled as of right to an  automatic

grant  of  Federation citizenship. The jus  soli,  the

right  of aim automatic grant of citizenship on birth,

is  acknowledged in Article 14 as being operative only

on and after Merdeka Day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those who are born in the Federation before

Merdeka  Day and who are not citizens by operation  of

law  under  the Federation of Malaya Agreement,  1948,

they  must register for citizenship under Article  16,

and they have to satisfy age, residence, character and

language requirements as well as show an intention  to

reside  permanently in the Federation before they  can

qualify for registration as citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are resident in the Federation on

Merdeka  Day  and who arc not born in the  Federation,

they  must register for citizenship under Article  17.

and  they  have  to  satisfy age, a longer  residence,

character and language requirements as well as show an

intention  to  reside permanently  in  the  Federation

before  they can qualify for registration as citizens.

The  language requirement here, Sir, is an  elementary

knowledge  of  Malay;  not an  adequate  knowledge  of

Malay.  For  those  who are naturalised,  an  adequate

knowledge  of  Malay is insisted on,  and  there  were

exemptions  from the language requirement  granted  to

all  those who were born or resident in the Federation

and applied for citizenship within one year of Merdeka

Day.  These  are  matters  on  which  the  Member  for

Queenstown has already touched upon in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all others who are neither born nor resident in

the  Federation on Merdeka Day, citizenship can  only

be obtained by naturalisation under Article 19.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where citizenship can be granted by

registration  to  those born in the Federation  before

Merdeka Day under Article 16, and to those resident in

the Federation on Merdeka Day under Article 17, and by

naturalisation  under Article  19,  even  if  all  the

requirements   for   the  grant  of   citizenship   by

registration   or   naturalisation   are    satisfied,

citizenship  can  still be refused  and  there  is  no

appeal from such refusal to the Courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in support of this, I would refer

you, to a note of Professor Sheridan in his commentary

on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



Federation   Constitution  on  the  words,   "If   the

Federation Government is satisfied" in Article 16.  He

notes, Sir, that



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no judicial review of decisions of the

Federal Government.".



<br><br>In  an earlier note on Article 14 of the Constitution,

he draws attention to the fact:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... that the decision of the Federal Government under

Part  III shall not be subject to appeal or review  in

any court."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it must be obvious to anybody who

has   made  a  detailed  and  careful  study  of   the

citizenship laws in the Federation that there must  he

a large number of Indians and Chinese who were horn in

-the  States  of  the  Federation outside  Penang  and

Malacca before Merdeka Day who are still not qualified

under  Federation  citizenship laws for  an  automatic

grant of Federation citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so in spite of the fact that they were born

before  Merdeka  Day  in  associated  States  of  what

became,  after the 31st August, 1957, the  independent

sovereign State of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jus soli is acknowledged as being operative in

the  Federation only on and, after Merdeka Day.  In  a

note on this article. Sir, Professor Sheridan says -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am indebted to the hon. Member. May

I  point  out that that is not correct'? The jus  soli

applies to all those born in Penang and Malacca before

Merdeka  Day. They became Federal citizens  under  the

Federation of Malaya Agreement and they became Federal

citizens  under the Constitution by virtue of  Article

XIV.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, this is the actual note of

Professor Sheridan. I am referring to Article  XIV  of

the  Federation Constitution, and I have the notes  of

Professor Sheridan on Article XIV, and he says, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Would the Minister identify the

book for the record?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I refer to "The Federation Constitution,"

by L. A. Sheridan. Page 24. It is a general note under

his  comments  on Article XIV of the Constitution.  He

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no omnibus provision for citizenship by

operation  of law for those born within the Federation

before Merdeka Day."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Minister give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged. I was pointing out,

Sir,  that the Constitution makes Federal citizens  of

all  those who were Federation citizens before Merdeka

Day, and Article 125, as amended, of the Federation of

Malaya   Agreement,  1948  and  1952,  by  virtue   of

subsection (b) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies born

before,  on or after the prescribed date, that  is  to

say,   15th   September,  1952,  in  either   of   the

Settlements becomes by operation of law a  citizen  of

the Federation."



<br><br>So  all  who  were born in Penang and  Malacca  before

Merdeka  Day  were,  by virtue of  the  Federation  of

Malaya  Agreement, Federal citizens, and by virtue  of

Article XIV, became citizens of the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I will accept that. Mr Speaker, Sir,

this   being  so, if  we  were  to  c]aim   automatic

Federation  citizenship  for  all  persons   born   in

Singapore  on  merger,  is it  reasonable  for  us  to

believe  that  the  Federation  Parliament,  which  is

responsible  to  the people of the  Federation,  would

agree  to  grant  the Singapore-born  more  favourable

terms  than  it has been prepared to concede-to  those

who   were  born  in  the  associated  States  of  the

Federation, outside Malacca and Penang, before Merdeka

Day and who are not eligible for an automatic grant of

Federal citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we were able to persuade the Federation

Parliament to grant more favourable terms to our local-born  by asking that they should be accorded the  same

citizenship terms as those accorded to persons born in

Penang  and  Malacca  under the Federation  of  Malaya

Agreement, 1948, as amended by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



the  (Amendment) Ordinance of 1952, could this not  be

construed  to be selling out the political  rights  of

the  larger  number  of Singapore  citizens  who  have

acquired Singapore citizenship by residence? And, Sir,

if the Federation Parliament has not granted automatic

Federation   citizenship  to  persons  born   in   the

associated  States of the Federation,  outside  Penang

and  Malacca,  would it be reasonable  to  expect  the

Federation  Parliament to grant automatic  citizenship

rights  to  persons who have only acquired citizenship

rights in Singapore by residence?

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  ask  the  Hon, the Minister for  Health  and  Law

whether he is representing the people of Singapore  or

representing the people of the Federation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of

clarification. That may be a point of argument. If the

hon.  Member wants clarification on the legal treatise

which we are being treated to, he may seek it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been stated in

this  House  that we have sold out on  the  people  of

Singapore   because  we  have  failed   to   make   an

uncompromising   demand   for   automatic   Federation

citizenship. Mr Speaker, Sir, I put this argument  to

the Barisan Sosialis for their serious consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Queenstown went to great lengths speaking on our Singapore citizenship laws. We agree that it is true that there is a large number of

people  in Singapore who are either Singapore citizens

by birth or who have obtained Singapore citizenship by

virtue of their long residence here. Most of them very

likely  have had residence of 15 and more years.  That

is all accepted by us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we, however, reasonably expect the Federation

Parliament to grant our citizens more favourable terms

than  they  are prepared to grant to their own  local-born. This is the point at issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, Sir, that under the provisions of

Articles  4  and  22  of the Federation  Constitution.

special   arrangements  would  have  to  be  made   on

citizenship at the time of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What articles?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I am sorry. Articles 2 and 22. Mr

Speaker, on Article 22, there is a note on page 30  of

Sheridan's commentaries. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Presumably this is a transitional provision relating

to   the  connection  these  persons  have  with   the

territories before its admission to the Federation."



<br><br>And it says thereafter:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The matter is presumably governed by Article 8 (1)

and  the non-transitional provisions of Chapter  1  of

Part III.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-transitional provisions are Article 14 of the

Federation Constitution.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the argument of the Barisan

Sosialis  that  if all our 624,000 Singapore  citizens

were to become Federal citizens, we would have, on the

basis  of counting heads, about 25 to 30 seats in  the

Central  Legislature. Sir, do they  seriously  suggest

that  political representation in electoral  areas  is

determined just by the counting of heads of those  who

are  eligible to vote? There are in this  House,  Sir,

Members  returned from the rural areas which are  more

than   20   times  the  size  of  some  of  the   city

constituencies and where the eligible voters are about

half  the number of some of the very small but compact

city  constituencies. Yet their representation in this

House  is equal. Has the Barisan Sosialis ever claimed

that this was unfair and unequal representation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the Federation, only about 26.5 per

cent  of the estimated total population of 6.7 million

is  urbanised:  the rest of the population  is  thinly

distributed  outside the urban areas. Because  of  the

geography  and the distribution of population  in  the

Federation, the electoral areas have had to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



fairly distributed between the small compact and  more

heavily populated urban areas and the larger and  more

thinly  populated rural areas. A fair and just balance

has  had to be worked out. If political representation

were  to  he worked out on the basis of just  counting

the  heads of those who are eligible to vote, then  it

would  mean  that  there  would  be  vast  tracts   of

Federation   territory  where   there   are   sizeable

populations who would be deprived of political rights.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  there were  2,240,000  registered

voters  in the Federation for the general election  of

1959  and  the number of voters increased to 2,310,000

in  March 1960. A figure of 2,345,000 was forecast for

March 1961. Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter of interest,

I  have  all  the facts and figures from the  official

Year Book of the Federation of Malaya, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present House of Representatives of the

Federation has a membership of 104 and this is  to  be

reduced  to  100 when the next general election  takes

place  in spite of the fact that the voting population

has  been  estimated to increase by 105,000  from  the

last general election to March this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore itself there are constituencies, as I

have said just now, of larger size with smaller voting

populations   which  enjoy  equal  representation   to

smaller  and  more compact constituencies with  larger

voting populations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar conditions are reproduced in the Federation.

On  this  basis,  it  does  not  follow  that  if  the

electorate  of the Federation is increased by  another

624,000  on  the  basis  of the automatic  citizenship

proposals  of the Barisan Sosialis, there must  -be  a

proportionate increase in the number of  seats.  There

are other factors, Sir, which must also be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> A point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indeed, he is being very good, Sir.

May   I   draw  attention  to  Article  116   of   the

Constitution,  which specifically  provides  for  that

very  condition:  that  you  must  give  proportionate

representation  to  each area in accordance  with  the

number of voters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are other factors

which must also be considered. In the Federation,  the

urbanised population amounts to 26.5 per cent  of  the

total  population.  In Singapore  conditions  are  the

reverse.  There is a relatively smaller population  in

the   rural  areas  and  a  larger  concentration   of

population  in  the  city area, of about  five  square

miles in a total area of 220 square miles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have to have regard to the relation of the

total  number of seats in the urbanised areas  to  the

total  number of seats in the non-urbanised  areas  of

the  Federation, and if only voting heads were  to  be

counted   on   the  basis  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis

proposals,  it  would  upset  the  present   electoral

arrangements  in  the Federation and  give  an  unfair

advantage  to  the urbanised areas of  the  integrated

territories at the expense of the non-urbanised areas.

These  are  weighty considerations which  the  Barisan

Sosialis  have  deliberately  chosen  to  overlook  in

pressing their claim for proportionate representation.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown is before the House. Mr Byrne.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson

just  now  referred me to Article 116, which  required

that representation should be based on population. May

I read Article 116 (4):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Each State shall be divided into constituencies in

such manner that each constituencies contains a number

of  electors as nearly equal to the electoral quota of

the State as may be after making due allowance for the

distribution  of  the  different communities  and  for

differences in density of population and the means  of

communication;  but the allowance so  made  shall  not

increase  or  reduce  the number of  electors  in  any

constituency to a number differing from the  electoral

quota be more than fifteen per cent.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, just confirms what I have been saying,

namely,  that  allowance must be made  for  rural  and

urban representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, he has

referred to subsection (4) of Article 116, which deals

with constituencies in a State. We are talking about a

quota of a State with reference to the Federation, and

I  ask  that  he read subsection (3) which deals  with

that, if he is reading subsection (4).



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir. You cannot

divorce subsection (3) from subsection (4) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Read it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Constituencies shall be allocated to the several

States in such manner that the electoral quota of each

State is as nearly equal to the electoral quota of the

Federation   as  it  can  be  without  causing   undue

disparity  between the population quota of that  State

and the population quota of the Federation.',



<br><br>and then you come to subsection (4).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, say they are in a State,

constituencies of 10,000 voters. Say there are 100,000

voters  in  a  State and there are 10  constituencies.

There must be leverage of 15 per cent either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



way,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. You see the number of  voters

per  candidate  will vary between  8,500  and  11,500.

There must be that interplay between 8,500 and 11,500,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is strange that only when

merger  is  in prospect that the Barisan Sosialis  has

for  the  first  time advanced the argument  that,  in

fact, there are two classes of Singapore citizens, the

second-class  who are local-born, and the  third-class

who  has  acquired Singapore citizenship by residence.

This is the first time I have known that I am a second-class citizen and my colleagues in the Government  are

third-class citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger or no merger, there will always be

persons  in  the  Federation  who  will  be  acquiring

citizenship by residence as opposed to those  who  are

citizens  by birth. Why does the Barisan Sosialis  not

seek  to draw such distinctions between the local-born

and the rest in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, merger or no merger, Singapore

citizens, whether they are local-born or have acquired

Singapore  citizenship by residence,  can  qualify  to

become  Federal  citizens  if  they  comply  with  the

Federation citizenship laws. Does the Barisan Sosialis

reasonably  con  end  that  a  Singapore  citizen   by

residence,  who qualifies to become a Federal  citizen

by  complying  with  the Federation citizenship  laws,

promotes himself from a third-class citizen to a first-class citizen and that a Federal citizen by birth  who

acquires Singapore citizenship reduces himself from  a

first-class to a third-class citizen?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these spurious arguments about classes of

citizens  have  been invented by  those  who  seek  to

oppose merger. Nationalists and patriots do not try to

pretend  that there are different classes of  citizens

when   everybody  knows  that,  in   fact,   no   such

distinction exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have accused the

Federation Government of wanting to enforce  a  policy

of  apartheid in Singapore. I cannot see the relevance

of such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



a  charge. Surely apartheid, as we call understand it,

is  the  deliberate  political,  social  and  economic

subjugation  of  a  larger community  or  group  by  a

minority  - in  the interests of that minority - on  the

basis of colour. Can any such intention be seen in the

merger   proposals  before  this  House?  If   it   is

mischievously  contended by the Barisan Sosialis  that

the Federation Government is seeking to impose a Malay

hegemony  (the word "hegemony" was used, Mr  Speaker,

Sir)  over the Chinese in Singapore through the merger

proposals, then this is a complete distortion  of  the

facts  and  of  the truth. Are there not  3.1  million

Malaysian  and  2.3 million Chinese in the  Federation

and 0.2 million Malaysians and 1.2 million Chinese  in

Singapore?  Do  not these figures show a preponderance

in  favour of the Chinese? Where is the minority group

which  is trying to subjugate the majority group?  And

are not the Federation born Malays in Singapore in the

third-class   citizenship  and   the   Federation-born

Chinese in the first-class citizenship invented by the

Barisan  Sosialis? Do not the Chinese enjoy  political

rights  both  in the Federation and in  the  Singapore

Legislatures, and is there any question of the Chinese

being   refused  representation  in  the  new  Central

Legislature?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then can the Barisan Sosialis read into these

merger  proposals  an  attempt  on  the  part  of  the

Federation Government to enforce a policy of apartheid

in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we were also told that before we

proceed  with  these merger proposals we  should  take

note  of the experience of the Irish in their struggle

for  independence.  Sir,  Ireland  was  annexed  after

bloody  wars and merged in the territories of England,

Wales and Scotland to constitute the United Kingdom of

Great  Britain  and  Ireland in the  early  nineteenth

century. These political arrangements were resisted by

Irish  nationalists. They are still resisted by  Irish

nationalists. After more bloody wars in  the  twenties

of  this century, Ulster was partitioned from the rest

of  Ireland  and the Irish Free State was constituted.

These are the historical facts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partition of Ireland was effected against the

will  of  all  Irish  nationalists.  In  the  case  of

Singapore,  it  was the British who, in  pursuance  of

their divide and rule policy, separated Singapore from

the  Federation and the genuine nationalists  both  in

Singapore and the Federation are doing their utmost to

reunite these territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not the stand of the Barisan Sosialis that if

automatic  citizenship rights are not granted  to  all

Singapore citizens, then there should be no merger and

that  Singapore  should remain a fully  self-governing

State  with control over internal security?  In  fact,

Sir, their stand is that if merger is not effected  on

their  terms, then they are quite content  that  Singapore should remain a British colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are those who are trying to divide Singapore

from   the  Federation?  Are  they  not  the   Barisan

Sosialis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Irish nationalist who condemned the

partition of Ireland, we shall not rest until we  have

put  an  end  to  the divide and rule  policy  of  the

British   and  have  obtained  the  reunification   of

Singapore with the Federation mainland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have contended that it is a

humiliating  fact that all persons born in  Singapore

after  merger  comes into being, will not  yet  become

Federal  citizens  by right of birth.  What  is  there

humiliating about this to the people of Singapore?  Is

not  the  converse also true that all persons born  in

the   Federation   after  the  two   territories   are

integrated  will not become citizens of  Singapore  by

right  of birth? If Singapore citizenship were granted

to  all  Federal  citizens after  merger  and  Federal

citizenship  denied  to all Singapore  citizens,  then

such  terms  could  be said to be humiliating  to  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have shown, Sir, in the earlier part of my address

that  if  we pressed for automatic Federal citizenship

rights  for  all Singapore citizens who are local-born

on  the same terms as those accorded to the local-born

in  Penang  and Malacca, then our local  citizens  who

have become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



citizens  by residence would have been disenfranchised

and this would have been a humiliating imposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would we have been justified in sacrificing the

political  rights  of  these  citizens  to  gain   the

objective of a single citizenship for all persons born

in the integrated territories after merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that complete merger will be totally

unacceptable  to the Federation Parliament,  and  they

have  said so. It is being pursued by those  who  have

political  ambitions for the purpose of enabling  them

to stand as candidates for election to the new Federal

Parliament anywhere in the integrated territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, Sir, that any Party which insists on

pursuing  a claim for automatic Federation citizenship

rights   for   all  Singapore  citizens,   which   the

Federation  Parliament cannot possibly accept  without

discriminating against its own local-born, does so for

reasons  which must be suspect. It is equally  obvious

that  conditions  for  merger can  be  formulated  and

advanced by those who are genuinely seeking merger  in

the  national  interest as well as by  those  who  are

really   anti-nationalist  and  who  are  deliberately

seeking to frustrate merger because they are afraid of

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No true nationalist will ever attempt to base his

claim   for   merger  on  just  two  Articles   of   a

constitutional instrument whilst turning a  blind  eye

to the rest of the Articles of the Constitution. If he

does  so, then his intention is clearly not to advance

the cause of merger but to oppose it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Articles of the Federation Constitution are

just  as  important  on the issue  of  merger  as  the

Articles dealing with the acquisition of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, those Articles of the Federation

Constitution   dealing  with   the   distribution   of

legislative  powers as between the Federal  Government

and  the State Governments, must be looked at as  well

as  the  Articles  and the Schedule dealing  with  the

financial  arrangements between the Federal Government

and the State Governments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ninth Schedule of the Federation Constitution

dealing  with  the distribution of legislative  powers

between   the   Federal  Government  and   the   State

Governments, and the Tenth Schedule dealing  with  the

financial  arrangements between the Federal Government

and the State Governments are studied closely, it will

be  seen at a glance that complete merger on the basis

of  the Barisan Sosialis' proposals would work to  the

prejudice of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No nationalist or patriot would want to propose

terms  which  he  knows would be  prejudicial  to  the

interests of the peoples he wishes to serve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we in this House and the Government of

Singapore   discharge   our  responsibilities   in   a

realistic  manner to the people of Singapore,  whether

they are citizens or resident aliens, if the powers of

this  House  are reduced to those of a State  Assembly

under    the    existing   Federation   constitutional

arrangements,  and  if  the  executive  and  financial

powers  of the Singapore Government are placed  within

the  narrow  confines of the powers reserved  for  the

State Governments in the Ninth and Tenth Schedules  of

the  present Federation Constitution? It is for  these

reasons,  Sir, that we have sought a partnership  with

the Federation rather than complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have argued that we should have

entered   into   negotiations  with   the   Federation

Government  for  complete  merger  on  the  basis   of

automatic  Federation citizenship  for  all  Singapore

citizens,   and  should  have  pressed   this   demand

uncompromisingly. It takes two to make any bargain and

I   cannot   see   how  anyone  can  press   a   claim

uncompromisingly in a genuine negotiation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Sir, have preferred to negotiate rather than

make  uncompromising demands. We know that in  genuine

negotiations  no terms and conditions can  be  liberal

and generous to both Singapore and the Federation, nor

can  they  satisfy all parties on both  sides  of  the

Causeway.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Sir, have preferred to strike the golden mean,

and  this  golden mean finds expression in  the  White

Paper  setting out the heads of agreement  for  merger

between  the Federation and Singapore which the  Prime

Minister has asked this House to approve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In demanding complete merger, the Barisan Sosialis

has  stated in this House that it couples this  demand

with  a further demand, that once automatic Federation

citizenship  rights  are obtained  for  all  Singapore

citizens, then there can be no deprivation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Article 25 of the Federation Constitution, there

can  be no deprivation of citizenship in respect of  a

person  born  in the Federation before,  on  or  after

Merdeka   Day,  but  deprivation  of  citizenship   is

provided  for  in  respect of those  resident  in  the

Federation on Merdeka Day who became citizens or those

who  become  citizens by naturalisation if  they  show

themselves  by  act  or  speech  to  be  disloyal   or

disaffected  towards the Federation. Is it reasonable.

Sir,  for the Barisan Sosialis to claim that, assuming

all  Singapore  citizens become  Federal  citizens  on

merger,  those  Singapore citizens who  have  acquired

Singapore  citizenship by residence or who  have  been

naturalised   should  be  specially   protected   from

deprivation of citizenship when their counterparts  in

the  Federation  do  not enjoy this  protection?  This

proposition, Sir, is, to my mind, utterly  absurd  and

clearly  proves  that  those who  press  such  claims,

knowing  them  to be unreasonable, do so because  they

wish  to  frustrate merger rather than to advance  the

cause of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have also stated that the

Federal   nationality  that  Singapore  citizens   and

Federation  citizens  will  obtain  after  merger   is

spurious.  There is nothing constitutionally irregular

or  spurious  in political arrangements which  provide

for separate citizenship and for a common nationality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of nationality connotes ideas of

allegiance  to  a  Head  of State, whether  it  is  a

President  or  a  King, and undivided loyalty  to  the

country of one's birth or adoption.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is from this concept that political rights and

responsibility stem, and in return for this allegiance

and  loyalty, the national is protected abroad by  the

sovereign authority of his State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This notion of a common nationality can provide the

link  between  separate territories  which  are  under

different citizenship laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the concept at the root of the idea of the

British Commonwealth of Nations where territories with

separate  and  distinct  citizenship  laws  agree   to

acknowledge a common Head of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the separate territories of Malaysia,

this idea of common nationality in a common allegiance

to  a  single Head of State can bind these territories

together  in  a  single  political  unit  and  thereby

enhance  its  prestige and influence in  international

affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask this House to reject the claim for

complete merger as advanced by the Barisan Sosialis on

the  grounds  that if these proposals are implemented,

they  will  work  to the prejudice of  the  people  of

Singapore,  whether  they are citizens  by  birth  and

residence or resident aliens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that, as nationalists, we have prepared

a  businesslike  and practical plan  for  merger  with

separate   citizenship  arrangements  and   a   common

nationality. We have not sold out any of the  existing

political  rights of our citizens, but have taken  the

precaution  of  ensuring that our citizens  will  have

their   fair  share  of  representation  in  the   new

legislature of the integrated territories.

I would like to ask: what   is  the  stand  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   in

connection  with  this question of merger?  They  want

Singapore  to  be  integrated with the  Federation  of

Malaysia  as  the  twelfth State  with  all  Singapore

citizens automatically becoming Federal citizens.  The

Member  for Queenstown said that the proposals of  the

Tunku,  in effect, would mean that Singapore  citizens

cannot  stand  as  candidates  for  election  in   the

Federation and that Singapore citizens residing in the

Federation  cannot vote, and so on. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

have  the Barisan Sosialis forgotten that if Singapore

citizens  cannot become voters or stand as  candidates

for  election  in  the Federation,  similarly  Federal

citizens  cannot  vote  or  stand  as  candidates  for

election in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another charge made by the leader of the Barisan

Sosialis on Monday was on the Tunku's proposal  for  a

merger between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.

In  this connection. I would like to emphasise that it

is   the  proposal  of  the  Prime  Minister  of   the

Federation  of  Malaya and not  the  proposal  of  the

P.A.P. The Member for Queenstown said that the Tunku's

proposal would mean that the people of Singapore would

be  disenfranchised and sold out. To  whom  have  they

been  sold out and who have been sold out? Is  it  the

contention of the Barisan Sosialis that the people  of

Singapore have been sold out? Or do they mean that the 13 Members of

the Barisan Sosialis have been sold out?

Do  they  mean that only the electorate  of  their  13

constituencies have been sold out? I know that we,  on

behalf  of  the  Alliance  and  other  representatives

present  in this House, also represent the people.  We

have  our  own supporters. But it is immaterial  if  I

were  to  say that the charge made by the  Member  for

Queenstown  is  correct that the people  of  Singapore

have been sold out to the Federation. As a son of  the

soil,  I  agree  to  my  family  being  sold  to   the

Federation of Malaya instead of our being sold to  the

Communist Party or to a Communist government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the Barisan Sosialis realise the meaning of their

amendment'?  It means that the position  of  Singapore

will  be  the  same  as  that of  Johore,  Malacca  or

Selangor. Is this what the Barisan Sosialis  want?  I

hope  when  the other Members of the Barisan  Sosialis

speak, they will clarify this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not deceive the people. Of course, at this

very moment, there are many political organisations or

political  leaders preaching one thing but  practising

another.  On  the  charge made by the  Prime  Minister

against the Barisan Sosialis, that a statement of  the

Barisan  Sosialis which appeared in a Malay  newspaper

was  different from that which appeared in an  English

newspaper - and similarly, different versions were given

in  the  Chinese newspapers - I would like to ask  the

Barisan Sosialis to clarify their position. I  ask  of

them to do so because the Member for Queenstown in his

speech  condemned  the Federation  of  Malaya  on  its

educational policy, the internal security policy,  and

so  on.  According to them, all these policies of  the

Federation Government are wrong, inadequate,  and  not

in  accord with Socialist policies: the Government  is

oppressive and sending people to prison. Although they

say that the policies of the Federation Government are

bad, yet they seek complete merger. I am at a loss  to

understand  this because I feel that even  a  mad  man

would not speak that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, if we compare the desires of the Barisan

Sosialis  with  the amendment to the motion  moved  by

their  leader, it contains poison. On the other  hand,

Mr Speaker, if the Tunku agreed at the beginning to a

complete merger, I am sure the Barisan Sosialis  would

oppose  that  too. They would advance the reason  that

with   complete  merger,  the  special   position   of

Singapore  would be jeopardised, the education  policy

would not be guaranteed, and the labour position would

be  endangered. In my opinion, even if complete merger

is  offered, the Barisan Sosialis will reject  it,  or

for  that matter accept the merger as contained in the

amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech the Member for Queens-town commended

the  Tunku  on his policy towards apartheid.  This  is

good.  I  myself and my Party, the U.M.N.O.  Alliance,

and I am sure all right-thinking people, subscribe  to

the Tunku's policy on apartheid. But if the Member for

Queenstown had stopped there, it would have been right

However,  he  went  further. He said  that  merger  as

proposed  by  the Tunku means that Singapore  citizens

will  be  discriminated by the Federation.  It  is  my

intention  to  speak at length on this matter,  but  a

Minister from the Government has already dealt on this

matter,  and  so  it is not necessary  for  me  to  go

further  on  it. But what grieves me, Mr Speaker,  is

that  the  Member  for Queenstown  has  gone  to  some

lengths to attack the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Mr Speaker, is that the Barisan

Sosialis  have  said  that with the  proposed  merger,

socialists like the Barisan Sosialis in Singapore  are

prepared  to make sacrifices. Their leader  also  said

that he supported complete merger because he knew that

the  position  of  internal security  rests  with  the

Federation of Malaya and, on behalf of the socialists,

they would be prepared to sacrifice themselves. In his

words,  the  socialists in the  Federation  today  are

experiencing hardship, which means that the Federation

Government has put the socialists in gaol.  I  do  not

know, Mr Speaker, but what I do know is that those in

the  Federation who have sacrificed themselves are not

the socialists. If that is the stand of the Federation

of  Malaya,  then it follows that the counterparts  of

the  Barisan Sosialis in the Federation, Mr Urn  Kean

Siew,  Mr  David,  and  other colleagues  of  another

opposition Party, Mr Seenivasagam, will no doubt  be

sent   to  gaol.  But  they  are  free  now.  So  this

allegation, coming  as  it does  from  a  responsible

Member without any foundation, is to be regretted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, is that the Member for

Queenstown has been repeating "socialism".  I  do  not

know what is "socialism", and I would like to know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



whether  his  "socialism" is based on  nationalism  or

Communism  or communalism. I do not know what  is  his

interpretation or definition of "socialism". Then when

he  used  the  word  "socialism", he  dragged  in  the

Federation Government, saying that this Government  is

a  Right-wing Government, which means that  it  is  an

irresponsible    Government   not   discharging    its

responsibilities  to the people of the  Federation  of

Malaya. Therefore, it means that merger will mean that

the Right-wing Government will neglect the citizens of

Singapore.  I can say this, Mr Speaker,  I  challenge

the  Barisan  Sosialis. I can tell them that  although

today the Federation Government has been charged as  a

Right-wing Government, a feudalistic Government,  just

the  same I can assure them unreservedly that although

it  is a Right-wing Government or a feudalistic Govern

ment,  yet  the  administration of the  Federation  of

Malaya  is  based more on genuine socialism  than  the

address  made  by  the leader of the Barisan  Sosialis

both in Singapore and in the Federation of Malaya.  If

we  compare the people of the Federation of Malaya  to

our  neighbours,  say, the people of Burma,  Thailand,

the  Philippines,  Laos,  or  even  Indonesia,  it  is

obviously clear that the people of the Federation  are

enjoying the fruits of independence

more   than  the  people  of  the  other  countries

mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): That is the true

position.  I  am glad to hear the words "Hear,  hear!"

from   the  Back-bench.  Also  when  the  Member   for

Cairnhill, when attacking the Barisan Sosialis,  asked

them  not to slur the Federation Government or condemn

the  Tunku,  we  also  heard "Hear,  hear!"  from  the

Backbench - the Worker's Party. When his turn  to  speak

comes, I hope he will not attack the Tunku.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, another charge made by the Barisan Sosialis is that the Tunku had been influenced by our Prime Minister who had struck terror into the heart of

the Tunku, with the result that he was forced to agree

to  the  proposed merger as contained  in  the  motion

today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



I personally know the Tunku for a number of years and,

to  my  mind, a thousand Prime Ministers like Mr  Lee

Kuan   Yew   cannot  exercise  influence   over   him.

Similarly,  a  thousand  Dr  Lee  Siew  Chohs  cannot

influence him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what frightens the Tunku, me and my colleagues - and I do not know what the Government side feels - is that one day, on waking up, we might find

that  the Singapore harbour is filled not with English

warships but with Communist warships. That is what  we

are  afraid of. But it does not mean that I  have  any

love  for  English warships; they have  to  leave  our

shores in the not too distant future. It is merely to

emphasise my stand and the stand of U.M.N.O. and  the

Alliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem which I wish to deal with relates to

my  Indian  and Chinese friends. Although we represent

the Malay community, when we struggle for the fate  of

Singapore, it is our ardent desire to work in close co-operation with our Chinese and Indian brothers who owe

undivided loyalty to the State. But unfortunately when

my  colleagues from U.M.N.O. and myself speak in  this

House  we have been charged as representing a communal

body  and  acting with irresponsibility. We have  also

been  accused  of  harping on  communal  affairs.  The

reasons  are  that  the  speech  of  the  Member   for

Queenstown on Monday, the arguments he put forward for

7½  hours (lasting two days) - some Members had  no

time  for lunch - are all based on communalism. I  would

like  to  ask  not only the Member for Queenstown  but

also   all  Members  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  these

questions - whom  does  the Barisan Sosialis  represent,

and  whom  are  they  fighting  for?  Is  the  Barisan

Sosialis  fighting  for  the fate  of  the  people  of

Singapore? For whose interests is the Barisan Sosialis

fighting  or struggling? I am sure we, who have  heard

the  speech made by the Member for Queenstown and  the

facts  enumerated  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis  in  the

newspapers,  must  come  to the  conclusion  that  the

Barisan Sosialis do not fight for the interests of the

people  of  Singapore. We are not fools.  We  are  not

children. We are adults. We know how to play  politics

and we also know how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



to  play  cards. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I accuse  the

Barisan  Sosialis  of  using  communal  sentiments  to

achieve  their  own aims. The problem confronting  us.

that  is  the  amendment which seeks to  make  Federal

citizenship  automatic,  and  Singapore  becoming  the

twelfth  state, does not present a problem at  all  to

the  Barisan Sosialis. This is a manoeuvre on the part

of  the  Barisan Sosialis. Who are really  behind  the

Barisan  Sosialis? Throw their cards on the table.  My

accusation  is  not counted because I have  heard  the

speeches  of the Government Ministers. I have  my  own

means of finding out information. I accuse the Barisan

Sosialis of using communal emotion and sentiment,  not

because they want to struggle for the interests of the

people   of   Singapore  but  solely  for  their   own

interests. We in the Opposition, the Alliance,  cannot

take action. Only the Government can. This is the last

weapon, Mr Speaker, employed by the Barisan Sosialis,

the  communal  weapon.  The struggle  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  can  be  equated  to  the  struggle  of  the

socialist  Parties in the Federation of Malaya.  I  am

duty  bound to warn the Barisan Sosialis, who are fond

of  using  these  communal sentiments - this  warning

comes  from U.M.N.O. and I am sure the great  majority

of  the  people  of  Singapore can  warn  the  Barisan

Sosialis - not  to  use the communal weapon, lest  the

weapon resorted to by the Barisan Sosialis will devour

itself.  If  the  Barisan Sosialis use these  communal

sentiments as an instrument, we from U.M.N.O. will  be

prepared to resort to communal tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we, as leaders, whether in political Parties or in Government, or leaders in a small village, if we want to he treated as leaders, we

should  keep  our sense of proportion.  We  must  give

examples  to  the villagers or to the people  whom  we

represent. If a leader or a Party does not know his or

its responsibilities, and does not know where he or it

is   going, naturally  the  people  whom  he  or   it

represents will be misled, though such leaders will be

able to achieve their own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



ends.  For the Barisan Sosialis, when discussing  this

problem, which is an important one, on merger  between

Singapore  and the Federation, let them  forget, that

they  are  Malays or they are Indians, if they  cannot

forget  that, then it means that we must  be  prepared

for long axes or long parangs.



<br><br>6.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I first pay tribute to  the  Member

for  Queenstown  for  the tenacity  and, may  I  add,

pugnacity with which he plodded through a 7½  hours'

speech  some  seven hours after it had really  ended?

This  tribute should properly be extended to his ghost

writers who, I thought, looked most disconcerted as he

weaved and wavered his way through his maze of words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since in this amendment we are dealing with the

request    that   all   Singapore   citizens    should

automatically become Federal citizens, I shall confine

my remarks to this aspect of his exhaustive discourse.

It  would be tedious for me to belabour all the points

that  the  Member fur Queenstown made to  support  his

contention that the citizenship proposals contained in

the  White  Paper  were  a sell-out.  The  Member  for

Queenstown  belaboured his points so mercilessly  here

yesterday  and the day before that most of  them  have

been reduced to mere pulp.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the one point he belaboured was this: that if

the   Federal   Legislature  wanted  to  declare   all

Singapore citizens Federal citizens, it could do so by

law.  Sir,, never before was so much effort wasted  by

the  ghost writers to make this obvious point.  Nobody

disputes  that, the  Federal  Legislature,  being   a

sovereign body, can pass any laws it likes. It can, in

theory,  enact legislation saying that the Member  for

Queenstown is dotty. For all I know, he may not he  so

in fact, but, in theory, he would he pronounced so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown need not have tied himself

into knots trying to state the obvious point that  the

Federal Legislature has the power, in theory, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



declare  not only citizens of Singapore but, all  non-citizens as well, Federal citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, however, have to devise citizenship laws not in

the  abstract  but  in  the light  of  hard  political

realities. The first point to bear in mind is  whether

the  11 other States now comprising the Federation are

prepared  to  grant Federal citizenship  to  Singapore

citizens  on  terms  more favourable  than  they  were

prepared to grant to their own people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, lots of people became Singapore

citizens  under terms more liberal than those accorded

to people in the Federation. What the Barisan Sosialis

are  asking for is privileged treatment for  Singapore

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally the Barisan Sosialis leaders demanded

merger  on  the basis of Penang and Malacca - I  repeat,

Sir,  on the basis of Penang and Malacca. We correctly

pointed out that the Barisan Sosialis' proposal  would

have  meant that only about 284,000 out of the 624,000

Singapore  citizens  would automatically  qualify  for

Federal citizenship under the present citizenship laws

of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Barisan Sosialis discovered that they had

made  a  blunder in demanding merger on the  basis  of

Penang  and  Malacca, they developed a new  propaganda

line.   They   said.  "Why  not  get  the   Federation

Parliament to accept all Singapore citizens as Federal

citizens  automatically?" There  was  no  longer  any

reference  to  merger  on  the  basis  of  Penang  and

Malacca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Barisan Sosialis leaders are really

sincere  when  they  say that  what  they  are  really

worried  about is the fate of about 624,000  Singapore

citizens  and  that  they  are  really  bursting  with

enthusiasm  for complete merger, then let  them  state

quite  categorically  that  in  return  for  automatic

Federal  citizenship  they  are  prepared  to  support

actively   the  Federation's  education  policy,   the

Federation's  labour policy and give complete  control

over  Singapore's finances and trade to the Federation

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my contention, Sir, that this demand for

automatic  Federal citizenship is merely a  device  to

sabotage merger. All this simulation of enthusiasm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



for  complete merger cannot conceal the fact that  the

Barisan  Sosialis leaders - and I am referring  to  the

Barisan  Sosialis leaders who are not in this Chamber - are terrified of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us recollect that the 13

Assemblymen  broke away from the P.A.P. not  over  the

question  of complete merger as they term it now,  but

because  they  wanted the P.A.P. to  fight  for  full

internal self-government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - which is a contradiction and a

negation of merger. That was the real genesis  of  the

breakaway. Since then they have found new reasons. But

let  us remember that the 13 P.A.P. Assemblymen  broke

away  from  us on the question of full internal  self-government and not on the question of complete  merger

or   automatic   Federal  citizenship  for   Singapore

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the second reason was that they wanted

internal  security to be in the hands of the Singapore

Government  That  was the reason  for  the  13  P.A.P.

Assemblymen sitting on the other side. Now  they  have

discovered  new reasons If we bear this constantly  in

mind - that the break occurred not over the question  of

complete  merger,  but  over  the  question  of   full

internal self-government with internal security in the

hands   of  the  Singapore  Government - then  we  shall

understand  the  twists  and  turns  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis  policy in recent months. However, Sir,  that

is  a  question  we shall deal with when  we  come  to

discuss the main motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demand for complete merger on the basis of

automatic   Federal   citizenship   is   therefore   a

relatively new line. The idea is to ask for conditions

which would be unacceptable to the Federation so  that

there would be no merger of any kind. Then the Barisan

Sosialis leaders can come forward and tell the people,

"What a pity there cannot be merger. So, comrades, let

us  fight  for the next best thing - for full internal

self-government with internal security in the hands of

the Singapore Government."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> And the I.S.C.

abolished!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And the I.S.C. abolished. If it is

not  automatic Federal citizenship, then  the  Barisan

Sosialis would - even if automatic citizenship had  been

granted - have  put forward some other  condition  which

they  knew  would  be unacceptable to the  Federation,

such  as that the condition for merger should  be,  in

addition  to automatic Federal citizenship,  say,  the

abolition of the Internal Security Council,  or  even,

as a desperate measure, that the Member for Queenstown

should be made the first Prime Minister of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis leaders are putting forward

this  demand for automatic Federal citizenship because

they  believe that not only would there be  opposition

to  merger on this basis from the Federation, hut also

from the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I observed earlier, automatic Federal citizenship

would  not  meet  with the approval of  the  11  other

States which are partners to any agreement. They would

not  agree to this because that would put them in  the

position of having to grant more favourable terms than

were granted to their own citizens. It would mean  not

equal treatment for Singapore but giving more favoured

treatment to Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, there would also be resistance

on  political  grounds. Sir, in our party publications

and  speeches by P.A.P. leaders in the past,  we  have

stated  repeatedly that in any political  calculation,

either in Singapore or in the Federation, we must take

note  of  the fact that there are communal  fears  and

communal  prejudices. Any solution, however  fine  and

reasonable it might sound in theory, which  leads  the

Malays  to  believe, however wrongly, that  it  is  an

attempt to bend them to the will of another community,

is  bound  to  fail;  certainly to lead  to  disaster.

Similarly,  any  measure which  excites  the  communal

fears  of  the  Chinese or Indians is also  doomed  to

failure. Sir, communal fears and suspicions may,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



in  the  final  analysis, be based on  prejudices  and

illusions, but unfortunately, they are there and it is

the  duty  of any practical politician to  take  these

unjustified  fears, prejudices and superstitions  into

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always stated - and this thesis has been

accepted  and  endorsed publicly not only  by  the  13

Barisan Assemblymen opposite, but also by people  like

Mr  Lim  Ching Siong and others - that merger has  been

resisted by the Federation in the past because of  the

fear  that Malays would be politically swamped by  the

Chinese  of  Singapore. This we have stated  publicly.

and  we  have  endorsed ii as a piece of analysis.  We

ourselves do not believe that this is so, but we  have

always  recognised that this is a political  fact  and

that  many  Malays  in Singapore  and  the  Federation

believe this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, to press for automatic citizenship,

at  the  present juncture, would certainly  meet  with

resistance from the Malays in the Federation. The Ban-san  Sosialis leaders are not so innocent.  They  know

that  by asking at this juncture for automatic Federal

citizenship,  they would assist, say a communal  Party

like  the  P.M.I.P., to mobilise Malay  opposition  to

merger.  If our submission is correct - that  what  they

are  really interested in is to sabotage merger at all

costs - then  in  pressing for this  new  demand  for

automatic Federal citizenship (of which we have  never

heard)   it   is  now  quite  clear  that   in   their

recklessness and in their fear of merger, the  Barisan

Sosialis  leaders are quite prepared  to  put  forward

proposals  which  they know full well  would  help  to

revive  the  fading political fortunes of a  communist

and racialist party in the Federation. After all, Sir,

not  so  long  ago the Fajar, some of whose  activists

have  been  aiding and abetting the Barisan  Sosialis,

claimed  in  one  of  the articles that  the  Alliance

Government  was more communal than the  P.M.I.P.  When

desperate  fireside revolutionaries can  believe  this

sort  of thing, then they are well past the borderline

between sanity and insanity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting forward their proposals for automatic

Federal  citizenship, the Barisan Sosialis are  hoping

that  communal parties like the P.M.I.P. can  mobilise

Malays  into  not  only opposing merger,  but  perhaps

opposing  the  Alliance as well, which  probably  give

some  credence to the claim by the Member for  Queens-town  that  perhaps in the not so distant future,  the

Alliance  Government would not be there. In  order  to

attain their immediate objective of sabotaging merger,

the Barisan Sosialis are therefore prepared to enhance

the  political prospects of a racialist party like the

P.M.I.P., because they know that any demand like  that

would  automatically arouse, first, the suspicions  of

the  Malays (which we have always said so):  that  any

demand  which leads the Malays to fear that  Singapore

is  going  to swamp them politically would excite  the

latent communal prejudices which are always there, and

which we must take into consideration. They know that.

They also know that the P.M.I.P. has already said that

merger  in  any form is unacceptable to them,  so  any

demand by the Singapore Government that we should  get

automatic  Federal citizenship for all  the  Singapore

citizens  would  certainly bring into  the  arena  the

P.M.I.P. who can then mobilise the Malays who  would,

in any case, feel that this demand at this juncture is

an attempt by Singapore to swamp them politically. So,

Sir,  while  the leaders of the Barisan  Sosialis  are

prepared  to shed crocodile tears over the  sufferings

of  the people, they turn a blind eye to the fact that

their  demand for automatic Federal citizenship  could

strengthen  the communal parties and would  result  in

consequences  which  could  only  mean  conflict   and

bloodshed  between the various communities. Maybe  not

them but their leaders will say this is the price that

has to be paid for revolution. But -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> But what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - the attack on the Federation

Government  by the Member for Queenstown,  the  threat

that not only do they want a type of merger which they

know  would  arouse the antagonism and suspicions  of

the Malays,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



but  also  the threat that their type of merger  would

result  in the overthrow of the Federation Government,

are designed to create suspicion and fear, on the part

of  the Federation Government into rejecting any  type

of  merger. Supposing the Federation refuses to accept

merger  on the basis of automatic Federal citizenship,

what  then  is the alternative? We come back  to  the

alternative   which  is  what  they   really   want - an

internally self-governing Singapore minus the Internal

Security  Council.  Have they  sup, plied  any  other

solution?  That  is the inference they  expect  us  to

draw;  that  if  we cannot have merger with  automatic

Federal citizenship, then, let us go back to what they

really want - internal self-government minus the I.S.C. -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Under the British!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So let us not think that the Barisan

Sosialis are really interested in what happens to  the

people  here or in the Federation so long as they  can

generate opposition to merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown is well aware that his

condition     for     merger -    automatic     Federal

citizenship - would be rejected by the  Federation.  One

of the points he belaboured here yesterday and the day

before  yesterday  was that he was  prepared  for  the

Singapore  Government to press for  automatic  Federal

citizenship. But he said, and I quote from yesterday's

Straits Times, that automatic Federal citizenship "was

only  impractical if the Federation Government refused

to  agree  on this. But that was entirely a  different

matter from being constitutionally impossible". So  he

knows  that  this demand will be unacceptable  to  the

Federation  Government. He believes that  it  will  be

unacceptable, and that is what he wants - any  condition

which would stop merger - so that he and his friends can

go  back  to what they are really after: full internal

self-government  minus the Internal Security  Council.

Sir, they always go together, like ham and egg.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Are you the egg?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In other words, the Member for

Queenstown knows full well that merger on the basis of

automatic Federal citizenship would be rejected by the

11  other  States comprising the Federation.  That  is

precisely  what  the  Barisan  Sosialis  want - the

rejection  of merger - so that after a sorry shaking  of

heads, the shedding of crocodile tears, they can  pick

up  the original wan-cry which brought about the break

with  the  P.A.P. - the  cry  of  full  internal  self-government, with internal security in the hands of the

Singapore  Government,  and a British  passport.  This

demand  for  automatic  Federal  citizenship  is  also

calculated, as I said, Sir, to mobilise opposition  to

merger  in  Singapore as well - not only the  Federation

but  Singapore  too. You will have  noticed  that  the

Member for Queenstown did not - though he spoke for 7½

hours - elaborate on certain implications of  complete

merger  on  the basis of automatic Federal citizenship

for Singapore citizens, it is true, Sir, that he waxed

eloquent on the, willingness of Mr Lim Ching Siong to

sacrifice himself - I cannot recollect, Sir,  hut  I  do

not   think   the   Member  for  Queenstown   included

himself - by  going  to  gaol to get  automatic  Federal

citizenship for the people. Sir,I know of no  law  in

the  Federation which entitles a count to send Mr Lim

Ching Siong or even the Member for Queenstown to  gaol

if   there  should  be  a  reunification  of  the  two

territories. People get sent to gaol for all sorts  of

things, but not for bringing about a reunification  of

Singapore with the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> We are fighting for other

reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is not what the Member for

Queenstown said. He said, for the edification  of  his

vast public - which I understand numbers about 200 - that here was this great man willing to go to gaol  to

achieve  the  reunification  of  Singapore  with   the

Federation. This only proves my point that  there  are

certain  people  who do not want merger  because  they

feel  that  it will get them into trouble. The  Member

for  Queenstown was putting forward our  thesis  in  a

slightly different way. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



any  case,  he  is convinced that there  would  be  no

merger  on the basis of automatic Federal citizenship.

Therefore, his promise of self-sacrifice on  the  part

of  Mr  Lim Ching Siong and possibly himself  is  one

which can be safely made. However. Sir, the people  of

Singapore  are  not  interested  in  whether   it   is

necessary  for Mr Lim Ching Siong and the Member  for

Queenstown to make sacrifices in order to get merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Member for Queenstown has avoided

discussing are the sacrifices the people of  Singapore

would  have to make in return for the kind  of  merger

proposed  by the Barisan Sosialis: that is, merger  on

the  basis  of automatic Federal citizenship.  He  was

singularly  silent on this point. It  is  quite  clean

that  the proposal of the Barisan Sosialis would  mean

the  control and direction of education being  in  the

hands  of the Federation Government. I ask Members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis - I am quite sure many  of  them

will  have a great deal to say, though not as much  as

the  Member for Queenstown, for having exhausted their

ammunition,  the ghost writers will  not  be  able  to

churn  out another 7½ hours' speech - that when  they

do  speak,  I hope they will state categorically  that

they  are willing to accept the Federation's education

policy and all that it implies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is right. We have been

waiting to hear that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Let them state categorically here

that they accept the Federation's education policy and

all that it implies.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> On a point of order. I am

sure  the  Minister will agree with  me  that  we  the

Barisan Sosialis are not easily intimidated. The  fact

that  the  Minister  points his finger  too  often  at

Members of the Barisan Sosialis is, to say the  least,

provoking.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have remarked in the past that I

discourage  gestures in the Assembly, and I  did  fear

that they might be construed as being intimidatory  or

perhaps  provocative. Perhaps the Minister could  turn

and point to the Chair. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall take great

care  not  to  intimidate  Members  opposite  with  my

finger.   If   they  are  of  the   stuff   of   which

revolutionaries  are  made, they  should  not  be  too

easily  intimidated, for after all it is a very,  very

small  finger that I am pointing. Therefore,  I  shall

not  attempt  to  point  a finger  even  at  you,  Mr

Speaker, but at myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 13 Members of the Barisan Sosialis. One of

them  has shot his bolt. There are 12 left. I  suggest

that when they do make a passionate declaration for  a

complete  merger, they will say that they will  accept

the Federation's education policy in toto.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> What is your attitude?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We do not. That is why we have asked

for autonomy over education and labour. In addition to

that,  they  must state categorically  that  they  are

prepared to accept the Federation's policy on  labour,

for that is what full merger on the basis of automatic

Federal  citizenship means. Let them state that.  They

must  state  categorically that they are  prepared  to

accept   the  4:1  ratio  that  now  obtains  in   the

Federation's civil service. They must also state  that

they  are  prepared  to give the  Federation  complete

control  over our finances and trade. If the 12  other

gentlemen - after due consultation with the  people  who

really  guide the destinies in the Barisan  'Star' - can

give  us  these categorical assurances, then  we  will

consider  taking  seriously their amendment  for  full

merger -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Did you -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - on the basis of automatic Federal

citizenship  for all Singapore citizens. It  is  quite

clear,  Sir, that this business of complete merger  on

the   basis  of  automatic  Federal  citizenship   for

Singapore citizens was really intended as a  trap  for

the  P.A.P., for if the P.A.P. Government was  foolish

enough  to  say, "Yes, we want to outbid  the  Barisan

Sosialis," - we would not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



want  full merger but we would want full, full  merger

with  automatic Federal citizenship - then  the  Barisan

Sosialis leaders, having nothing to lose except  their

seats, would go around telling the people of Singapore

that  it  would  be terrible if they  were  to  accept

complete  merger  on  the basis of  automatic  Federal

citizenship and all that it implies. They  would  say.

"Look,  this merger means that we have to  accept  the

Federation's  education policies:  the  workers  would

have  to accept the Federation's labour policies;  the

traders  would  have to accept complete financial  and

trade   control  by  the  Federation,  and  the  civil

servants  in  Singapore would have to accept  the  4:1

ratio."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Nanyang University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And also the Nan-yang University.

But  now, Sir, they are left with that baby. They hope

to  get out of it by slurring over the implications of

the  merger  that they propose - a merger  which  would

really be a sell-out in the present situation.  Or  if

by  some chance the Federation Government should  have

accepted  automatic merger with all that  it  implies,

then  the  Barisan  Sosialis  had  hoped  to  mobilise

students,  workers,  traders, and  civil  servants  to

resist  merger, for they could have gone around saying

that  the new merger proposals would mean the loss  of

control  over  education,  Nanyang  University,  civil

servants  having to compete on the basis of 4:1.  They

would  hold  mass meetings or they would get  somebody

else  to  hold mass meetings at which they would  say,

"In  view of the opposition of the people of Singapore

to merger, it is with regret that the Barisan Sosialis

has  decided to heed the voice of the people - which  we

always  do - and we will fight instead for full internal

self-government with internal security in the hands of

the  Singapore Government." [Interruption] I  am  just

quoting a phrase that is always repeated by Members of

the  Barisan  Sosialis and certainly by their  mentors [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The proposal in our White Paper

regarding citizenship took cognisance of the different

interests and of the different developments in the two

territories during the last 15 years. In theory,  Sir,

we  approve  of  a  single citizenship  and  a  single

nationality  for all, but we have to work  within  the

framework   of   hard   realities.   After   all,   no

constitutional arrangement is final. Conditions change

and  political facts change. As practical men, we must

devise  solutions not in the abstract but in  relation

to hard political facts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Without political facts, you are

finished!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We believe that our proposals for

citizenship  and  nationality have helped  to  resolve

conflicting  interests  between  the  two  territories

without detriment to the legitimate interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore as well as  the  people  of  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the points the Member for Queenstown

belaboured until it was reduced to pulp was that under

the  White  Paper proposals, Singapore citizens  would

become  second-class citizens. I listened to  him  not

for all the 7½ hours (occasionally I got out for  a

hit  of  fresh  air) but he could not  give  a  single

instance  of  how  under  our  proposals  a  Singapore

citizen was going to he a second-class citizen.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That was why no word was

mentioned over the radio.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not mind perhaps an

occasional  interjection. But when these interjections

become perpetual or continuous, then I must stop them.

Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Obviously the 7½ hours was not

enough for the gentleman to unburden himself!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it was significant that the Member could

only  give one instance to substantiate his claim that

under  the  White Paper proposals, Singapore  citizens

would  become second-class citizens. He said,  "It  is

terrible  that Singapore citizens are going to  become

second-class citizens, because they could  not  either

vote or stand for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



election  in the Federation." That was his main  theme

right  through. He took 7½ hours to say what  can  be

said  in  exactly  two  seconds - that  it  is  terrible

because  Singapore citizens cannot vote or  stand  for

election  in the Federation. That was his major  point

and that was what he described as a betrayal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask, Sir, how many of Singapore's 624,000

citizens are yearning to go and stand for election  in

the Federation'?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Ask the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> How many of them would consider it

imperative that they should contest elections  in  the

States  of  the Federation? Sir, I can well understand

the  Member for Queenstown having to look  for  a  new

constituency  in the Federation. It may  be  that  the

Member for Nee Soon, who I understand inaugurated  the

opening  of  his branch in front of a wide open  field

with  almost an uninterrupted view - is losing a lot  of

sleep  over  the thought that perhaps  the  people  in

Kelantan  or  Trengganu must forego  the  pleasure  of

having  him  represent them in the Federal Parliament.

For some Members in the Barisan Sosialis, it may be  a

legitimate  source of exasperation  that  they  cannot

find  new political pastures in the Federation.  But,

Sir, is it seriously suggested that, therefore, merger

should be abandoned simply because Mr Lim Ching Siong

and  his  Barisan  Sosialis friends cannot  stand  for

election  in  the Federation? But as far as  the  vast

majority  of  the voters or citizens of Singapore  are

concerned,  they  are not interested in  fighting  for

election  in  any  of  the  eleven  States   in   the

Federation.  In  any case, the Member  for  Queenstown

will   not  be  deprived  of  an  opportunity  to   be

represented in the Federal Parliament. All he need  do

is  to  move from Queenstown to a new constituency  in

Singapore to contest for one of the 15 seats to  which

Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Kampong Glam!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Certainly Kampong Glam is a very

fatal  choice, for I think the Member will have to  go

back to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



his  medical practice. All he need do is to move  from

Queenstown  to  a  new constituency  in  Singapore  to

contest  one  of the 15 seats to which  Singapore  is

entitled in the Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And may I make this point, Sir? It is true that a

Singapore citizen, as a Singapore citizen, cannot vote

or  stand  for election in any of the States  in  the

Federation.  But it is equally true that a  Federation

citizen cannot, as a Federation citizen, vote or stand

for  election in Singapore. If this makes a  Singapore

citizen  a  second-class  citizen,  then  it  makes  a

Federation citizen a second-class citizen in  relation

to  Singapore. So if two people are second-class, they

are  of one class. The term "second-class" would  have

meaning  only  if  a Federal citizen is  treated  more

favourably than a Singapore citizen. For example, if a

Federal citizen were allowed to vote in and contest an

election  in  Singapore, and a Singapore citizen  were

denied  reciprocal rights, then the  contention  of  a

second-class citizenship becomes valid. If,  say,  the

leader  of  the  P.P.P. came over  and  contested  in

Queenstown  and the Member for Queenstown were  denied

the privilege of being able to go to Menglembu, then I

would say that obviously the Member for Queenstown was

being  treated  as  perhaps not  even  a  second-class

citizen  but  a  third-class citizen -as  against  Mr

Seenivasagam  of  the  P.P.P.  But  where  there   is

reciprocity, then I say that is equality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in demanding automatic citizenship simply

because  a  few  perambulatory politicians - people  who

move around from one place to another, very often  at

night - cannot move to the Federation maybe  to  make  a

clean  start - and the opposition to these  White  Paper

proposals   is   purely   on  that   basis - then,   the

melodramatic  gestures of Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong,  the

Member for Queenstown, and perhaps the Member for  Nee

Soon  and  others that they are prepared to  sacrifice

themselves  so  that the people of Singapore  can  all

become  automatically Federal citizens, is  a  lot  of

eyewash.  What  they  are  really  interested  in   is

promoting the sectional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



interests  of a small group of perambulating,  nomadic

politicians  who  are hoping to seek better  political

fortunes in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our proposals, Sir, none of the existing

Singapore citizens lose any of their rights. They  can

vote representatives into the Federal Parliament. As a

matter  of fact, we would be having the second largest

number  of  seats  among  the States  in  the  Federal

Legislature. Any Singapore citizen can be  elected  to

the  Federal Parliament. Under our present citizenship

arrangement,  it  is also possible  for  Singapore  to

retain  control  over  such  matters  as  labour   and

education.  Therefore,  Sir, all  that  the  case  put

forward by the Member for Queenstown over a period  of

7½  hours  amounted  to was this - that  this  is  a

terrible  thing, this is a betrayal, because  it  will

prevent  a  few  nomadic  politicians  from  becoming,

possibly,  the  first Prime Minister of Malaysia.  But

the   ordinary   people,  the  600,000-odd   Singapore

citizens, lose nothing and enjoy new and equal  rights

in  the  Federal Legislature and autonomy  in  matters

which   they  consider  vital  to  their   lives   and

existence.  So,  whether Mr Lim Ching  Siong  or  Mr

Woodhull can stand for election in Tanjong Rambutan is

not vital. The people's interests, welfare and dignity

are vital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, in any agreement it is not a

question of Singapore just saying, "Well, this is what

we  want." It is a question of Singapore persuading 11

other States. So any agreement must be mutual and must

be  satisfactory to all the 12 States, and the  White

Paper proposals are agreeable to the 11 States in  the

Federation.  It  is  not helpful now  to  put  forward

suggestions which make certain in advance that  merger

will  not  come  about. As I said.  Sir,  the  Barisan

Sosialis'  proposals are all designed to wreck  merger

so that they can force the people into accepting their

disastrous   alternative - may  I  repeat  the   slogan,

Sir? - full  internal self-government with control  over

internal security.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders of the Barisan Sosialis are nut really

interested  in  education or  the  interests  of  the

workers or the rights of citizens. What they want  is

full  internal self-government, so that  the  men  who

manipulate them can further the plans which  they  are

not  at  the  moment  ready  to  endorse  and  espouse

publicity.  To do that, they must Stop merger  at  all

costs. Let us remember that. Sir - they must stop merger

at all cost



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if the Federation Government were

persuaded to grant the conditions put forward  by  the

Barisan Sosialis, they would come out with some  other

conditions  -  "Oh, this is still not what  we  want.

There is no equality." And, therefore, they might even

ask,  "Let there he equal representation of  seats  in

the  Federal  Legislature between  Singapore  and  the

Federation. If there are 100 seats, let Singapore have

51  or  60  seats. Anything less than that is  unequal

treatment."  They  will bring up any  excuse  to  stop

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, it would be worth while finding

out  exactly (a) when did the Barisan Sosialis  decide

that  the  P.A.P.'s plan for merger was phoney  and  a

sell-out?  Exactly when did they decide that,  because

that  is  very important. And (b) when did the  puppet

masters  who manipulate the Barisan Sosialis think  up

the  new line of full merger on the basis of automatic

Federal   citizenship  for  all   existing   Singapore

citizens? The time factor is very important



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote from a letter from Mr Lim Ching

Siong   - I   always  notice,  when  I   mention   this

gentleman's  name, that there is almost an  awe-struck

silence - which he wrote to the Straits Times  on  24th

June,  1961.  We  had heard a great  deal  about  this

colonial   paper.  I  notice  that  the   Member   for

Queenstown  was  quoting  extensively  from  on1y  one

paper.   Obviously  this  gentleman  only  reads   one

newspaper in this part of the world.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is only one English

newspaper!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Oh, there are two. And also Mr Lim

Ching Siong occasionally writes for the Straits Tunes.

Anyway, this is what he had to say in connection with - I  think  the  title is-called, "The  conditions  for

merger". He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To begin with, let us not pretend that anyone is

against  merger.  Malaya and  Singapore  are  not  two

separate states. The present division is an act of the

British  Colonial Government and every genuine Malayan

seeks.

a union of these two territories.'



<br><br>Remember, Sir, this was written on 24th June,  though

on 2nd June the 6 trade unionists had already, without

consulting   the   P.A.P. - Sir, I  understand   they

consulted  the  U.K. Commissioner - decided  to  make  a

demand  that  we  should  fight  for  internal   self-government,  which is a complete negation  of  merger.

But here he says, nobody is, really against merger and

we should all support it. Then he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Merger, we have hitherto come to understand, was a

thing   of   the   distant  future.  However,   recent

statements  by leaders of the Federation hold  out  an

earlier promise of the union of these two territories.

Encouraging as it is, the question now arises: on what

terms will this be effected? The right-wing Government

in  the  Federation  and  a  left-wing  Government  in

Singapore apply certain conflicting policies.'



<br><br>This, Sir, is the operative sentence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This is recognised in the statement by Dr Toh, the

P.A.P.  Chairman,  that  whatever  the  constitutional

position  of  the  future, we must have  control  over

labour and education. This is exactly our concern.  We

have  stated that any constitutional arrangement  must

not mean a setback for the people in terms of freedom.

and democracy.'



<br><br>Surely, no one can quarrel with this. So, Sir, on 24th

June  Mr Lim Ching Siong wrote to the Straits  Times

saying that though the P.A.P. had asked for merger  on

the  basis  of autonomy in labour and education,  that

was  also the concern of Mr Lim Ching Siong. At  that

time,  Mr Lim Ching Siong did not say that the P.A.P.

proposals  for  merger on the basis  of  autonomy  in

education and labour were a phoney or a sell-out.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because we did not know the

details!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He was saying that that was also his

concern. So many of his runner-boys at that time  did

not  denounce the P.A.P. merger proposals as a phoney,

but were repeating the hymn that they had been trained

to say: internal self-government, and the abolition of

the  Internal Security Council. Sir, their demand  at

that time, on 24th June, was internal self-government,

and  they  blessed the P.A.P. in its struggle  to  get

merger  on  the  basis  of  autonomy  in  labour   and

education. Of course, in making their demand for  full

internal  self-government, they did not  then  realise

that  they had made a major political blunder,  though

they  were trained as poodles to echo dutifully  their

master's  voice, saying that the P.A.P. was  terrible

because it was not prepared to fight for full internal

self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why did Mr Lim and his performing poodles take

an indulgent attitude, even an attitude of approval to

wards  the P.A.P. merger terms? The reason is  simple.

They  thought  the  Federation would  not  consent  to

merger  on the P.A.P.'s terms. After all, had not  Mr

Lim  Ching  Siong, Mr Wood-hull, Mr Puthucheary  and

Mr  Fong Swee Suan had tea and double-cross  buns  in

secret  with members of the U.K. Commission? Had  they

not  heard things directly from the lion's mouth? They

thought that they had read the Indian signs correctly,

though  it would appear that the Indian signs were  in

Greek! At that time, that is, in June, Mr Lim and his

friends thought that the P.A.P. merger proposals would

not be accepted by the Federation. So, therefore, they

felt, maybe on the basis of whatever clarification was

made  to  the  U.K. Commission, that  they  were  safe

enough in supporting the P.A.P. type of merger because

that would never come about, and, therefore, what harm

was  there  in supporting a line of action  which  was

doomed;  in  which  case they could  go  back  to  the

original,  the  real and consistent  demand:  internal

self-government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, you will notice that then we never heard

a  single  word  about full merger, automatic  Federal

citizenship.  Then on 25th August, the Federation  and

the  Singapore  Governments issued a  joint  statement

supporting   merger  on  the  basis  of  autonomy   in

education   and   labour.  The  impossible   and   the

improbable  had happened! Mr Lim and his friends  had

once  again  miscalculated. They had read  the  Indian

signs  with a Greek dictionary! I can only guess  what

happened   after  that.  There  were   possibly   many

nocturnal  meetings and a lot of running around.  What

they thought would not happen had happened. So the old

slogans  had  to  be scrapped. The top  tunes  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  singers which probably  until  then

were   "Merger  is  impossible"  and  "Internal  self-government  under  British  protection", had  to   be

abandoned  as tunes not in keeping with the times.  So

it  became necessary for the Barisan Sosialis choir to

strike up a new tune. The only problem was, what tune?

Very often it was clear that they had been singing the

wrong  tune. Times have changed. The tunes have to  be

changed. So we can only gather, Sir, that for a period

after 25th August the Barisan Sosialis were in a state

that  can only be described as befuddlement. They  did

not know what to do. That is best exemplified, Sir, in

the  "Declaration  of  meeting  of  convenors  of  the

Barisan Sosialis" published on 3rd September, 1961. In

fact,  I am going to read it out, and I hope you  will

be listening to it very carefully, because -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Speaker will be listening to

it  very carefully. Perhaps the Minister would like to

address his remarks to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the first thing you will note

is  that  you will not find a single reference  to,  a

single  chorus  from the current popular  hit - complete

merger  on  the basis of automatic Federal citizenship

for all Singapore citizens. Not a word of it here. But

they  declared in paragraph 5 what they termed as "Our

stand on the constitutional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



future". That phrase gives the impression of gentlemen

who  have decided on what they want. They are standing

firm. In fact, it is quite clear, Sir, that they  were

so  uncertain  of what was really going  on,  who  was

going  to  win  the race, that on 3rd September,  they

decided  that  the best thing to do, in  view  of  all

sorts  of  funny things happening, was to bet  on  all

horses,  They stood for the following things: (a)  for

full  and complete merger, with Singapore joining  the

Federation  as  a  constituent State like  Penang  and

Malacca. This I have no doubt they thought was a  very

smart  move against the P.A.P.'s proposals for  merger

on  the  basis  of autonomy in education  and  labour,

which  round about June they thought would never  come

about, and have now come about. They said, "Well, this

is  a counter-stroke. Let us ask for full and complete

merger with Singapore joining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation as a constituent State like Penang and

Malacca."  And  thereby  they  felt  that  they  could

counter  what  they often described  as  the  P.A.P.'s

slander  that they are not behind merger. In fact,  it

proved  that they were not merely 100 per cent  behind

merger,  but  were 200 per cent behind merger.  Quite

clearly  they  wanted an immediate full  and  complete

merger,  with  Singapore joining the Federation  as  a

constituent  State  like Penang and  Malacca.  On  the

other hand -
