  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education why priority is given to the 3rd
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> child, who has an elder brother or sister studying in the school, over the 1st or 2nd child with a parent who has been sterilized after the birth of the 1st or 2nd child and whether this move is unfair to parents who have been given to believe that sterilization after the 2nd child would give their children priority of admission to schools over 3rd child siblings whose parents are not even required to be sterilized.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon (Minister of State of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State of Education (Dr Tay Eng Soon) (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Phase 1 registration is for a second or third child who has an elder brother or sister studying in the same school. The reasons for this are obvious. Parents need not transport their children to different schools and the elder brother or sister can look after the younger one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 2 registration is more extensive. It includes, among others, children of parents who have direct connections with the school;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> parents, brothers or sisters who are former students of the school: members of the advisory or management committees or staff of the school. Parents who have undergone sterilization after the first or second child are accorded the highest priority under Phase 2, namely, Phase 2A. Far from being unfairly treated, parents in this category have priority under Phase 2A which is valid at any school. In contrast, Phase 1 priority applies only at a school which the siblings are attending.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how the hon. Member has been led to believe that sterilized parents have been promised priority by the Ministry over third child siblings whose parents are not sterilized. The Ministry has never made such a promise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter raised by the hon. Member is academic. Since 1977, the number of children of parents sterilized after the birth of the first or second child varied between 1,100 and 1,779. Last year, it was 1,379. In every instance, the children of sterilized parents in this category have been placed in the schools of their first choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I ask my supplementary question, I would just like to enlighten the House on the family planning programme of our nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, will you please keep it brief because we have quite a few questions today?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Yes. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the Family Planning and Population Board which was established by an Act of Parliament and inaugurated in January 1966. I refer you to the Family Planning Board Paper 45 and the Family Planning Board Paper 52.1. I would also like to draw the attention of the House to a set of social policies introduced in 1969-70.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, what is your supplementary question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I think I need to explain before I come to the supplementary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> question. I think you must allow me to continue, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Thank you very much. These policies were further intensified in 1972. These include, among others, higher priority for choice primary schools for children, one of whose parents has been sterilized after one or two children. I ask, higher priority over whom? Obviously it must be over those who are not sterilized.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our national policy in 1975, a total of 9,495 women were sterilized. 16% of those who ligated did so after one or two children, Why did I choose 1975? I chose 1975 because children born then will be going to school now. 16% works out to 1,520. These 1,520 mothers made a bold decision. They underwent an operative procedure and not without its hazards of surgery and anaesthesia, only to realize six years later that what they were promised in 1975 did not materialize to their expectation in 1981. They may have other reasons for sterilization but one of their considerations is priority over those not sterilized after two or three children. This is the policy of our family planning. Unless the Ministry of Education thinks otherwise, I feel very sorry for the Family Planning Board and I am wondering how are they going to explain to the people in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Point of order, Sir. Is the hon. Member delivering a speech or asking a supplementary question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have asked the Member for his supplementary question. Dr Tan, please let us have your supplementary question. If you cannot make up your mind, I will have to rule you out of order,
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, if you stop me at this stage, it is not very fair. I think I must continue further.

  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must insist that the hon. Member complies with Standing Orders. This is Question Time. I want to know what his supplementary question is.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, let us have your supplementary question. If not, I have to call on Mr Ho for Question 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> My question is whether the Ministry of Education has taken into account the family planning policy of our nation. The Minister of State has said that the Ministry of Education has not made any promise to the people of Singapore on this priority. Can the Minister of State of Education clarify this point for this House?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already said that those parents who were sterilized after one or two children have the highest priority under Phase 2 at any school in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the same understanding which the Ministry announced in 1974. I refer the hon. Member to the Straits Times of 22nd July 1974 in which we said that if one of the parents had undergone sterilization, the children would be given priority under Phase 2. This is applicable to all schools.

   <b>SALARY OF TEACHERS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education why a primary school teacher who applied for a teaching post in a secondary school has been told that he would not be paid salary of a secondary school teacher despite approval of his application.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there does not exist a salary scale for secondary school teachers. Teachers' salaries are determined by academic qualifications and experience. Teachers are broadly classified into two groups, university graduates and non-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> graduates, and they are placed on separate salary scales. Generally, graduate teachers teach in upper secondary schools and junior colleges and non-graduate teachers teach in primary schools and lower secondary classes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer from a primary school to a secondary school does not entitle the teacher to a graduate's pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Sir, can the Minister of State tell this House how does a Taiwan university graduate, who is a primary school teacher, go about applying for a teaching post in a secondary school and get a secondary school teacher's pay?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, I have said that there is no secondary school teacher's pay as opposed to primary school teacher's pay. It is a question of whether the teacher is a graduate and accepted as such by the Public Service Commission. If the teacher has a degree and applies to the Public Service Commission and is accepted as such as a graduate teacher, then he will be put on the graduate teacher's salary scale, irrespective of whether he is in a primary school or a secondary school.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, how does one get to know whether a Taiwan university degree is recognized by the Government or not?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the recognition of university degrees for the civil service is determined by the Public Service Commission.

  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education (a) what was the average percentage of pupils who left school before sitting for the PSLE during the past two years; (b) at what stage did most of them leave school; and (c) what were the main reasons for their doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, during the last two years the total number of primary school students who left the school system before the PSLE was 1.6% of the total enrolment in 1 979 and 0.3% in 1980. These figures do not include those pupils who fail badly in the schools and are transferred to the basic course previously and now to the monolingual course to continue their education. These pupils will continue in the school system until they are ready for enrolment at the VITB. The majority of premature school leavers were at the Primary 6 level. For example, in 1979, out of 4,732 premature school leavers, 3,488 or 74% left at Primary 6. The trend was similar in 1980.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various reasons why pupils leave school prematurely. Some leave because they are required to supplement the family income through employment. Others do so because of family problems. The majority do so because they have lost interest in schooling after repeated failure in their studies and because of inadequate parental guidance and support.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin (Nee Soon):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister of State whether the Ministry has carried out or will be carrying out any study to find out what happened to these students who leave school before the PSLE, especially those who have lost interest in their studies.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, the answer to the Member's question is "Yes". The Ministry has been carrying out studies of pupils who have left the school system.

  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Sir, noting the statement by the Minister of State that some of the students who dropped out after PSLE had to do something to supplement the income of the family, does this mean that they are taking on some jobs? If so, what type of jobs, and whether this will contravene any labour laws of this country?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, on the question of contravening the labour laws in this country, the Member should address the question to the Minister for Labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye (Rochore):</b> Sir, just to follow up, may I ask the Minister of State of Education this question: Can he attribute the number of drop-outs in primary schools to the restructuring of the education policy?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> Sir, before the restructuring of the school system, those who failed badly were put on the basic course for a number of years until such time when they became ready for entry into the VITB. Since the restructuring of the education system, many of these students would go into the monolingual stream, again for a number of years of basic education, before joining the VITB. I think it is too early to say whether the revised education system is resulting in more students not making it through the school system.

The other four, Ang Mo Kio South, Chong De, Chong Shan and Jing Shan, will be completed sometime in 1982. Although these four schools will not be ready before January 1982, pupils can register and are, in fact, being registered for these schools. They will be having their classes in the existing schools and the four new schools will be completed before 1982.

So the names continue because the assets of these schools will pass over to the Ministry of Education.

  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for Finance what specific steps have been taken to improve the quality of personnel management so as to bring about better teamwork, higher productivity and more harmonious relations in Government Departments, Ministries and Statutory Boards.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in March this year I said, in answer to a question from the Member for Mountbatten, that the general morale of workers in the Civil Service was excellent. There is no reason to believe that morale has deteriorated or needs special attention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my Ministry, in conjunction with the PSC, has the overall responsibility for the Civil Service, all Ministries are responsible for the day-to-day management and well-being of their staff. They must motivate their staff to maximize productivity. To help them do this job better, my Ministry is studying a suggestion for creating a separate Personnel Officers Service. The intention is to build up a core of career personnel administrators who
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> can give full-time attention to personnel matters. They would then be posted to Ministries and larger departments to work very much like Personnel Managers and Personnel Officers in companies. The Budget Division of my Ministry would provide the coordination and leadership to these career personnel administrators who in turn would provide useful feedback to the Division.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also considering a proposal, in accordance with recommendations by the Committee on Productivity, that a Productivity Working Committee be formed to initiate and oversee the implementation of management practices that will promote productivity. Such a Committee would be chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Budget Division. It would include representatives from other Ministries, besides representatives from the Public Service Commission, Management Services Department, and the Civil Service Institute.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and their reasons for not opting: and (b) whether there is any plan to extend the CPF option to other categories of officers in the Civil Service; if not, whether there are any special reasons for not extending it, and if so, what is the timeframe for implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, 38% of all Divisions III and IV officers in the Civil Service have not opted for the Central Provident Fund Scheme. They have not been asked to give reasons for their decision but it is probable that they decided not to opt for the CPF Scheme for some or all of the following reasons. First, they did not want to suffer a drop in take-home pay. Second, they did not want to lose medical benefits given by Government upon retirement. Third, they were near to retirement and there was therefore no advantage or less advantage in opting for the CPF Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no firm plan as yet to extend to Divisions I and 11 officers the option to cross over to the CPF Scheme. Members may remember that the Prime Minister touched on this matter briefly on 17th March 1981 when he replied to questions from the Member for Punggol and the Member for Mountbatten following the Statement he made on the Revision of Salaries of Ministers, Chief Justice and other protocol office holders. The Prime Minister said then that for certain key jobs, like those held by Administrative Officers, we cannot afford to hire and fire. For such persons, a pensionable service is the only kind of service. He also indicated that to hold the loyalty of these officers, there would have to be regular adjustments of their salary and a decent pension. The Government is considering some suggestions to improve the Pensions Scheme. Until this matter is decided, it is best not to give any Service in Divisions I and II the option to cross over from the Pensions Scheme to the CPF Scheme so that the key Services will not feel disadvantaged.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the testing of ammunition at the Chartered Industries at Boon Lay Road has been going on since 1967. These testings are carried out daily from 9.00 am to 2.30 pm and from 3.30 pm to 8.30 pm under controlled conditions. They create noise at levels of about 70-74 decibel (dB) at the residential flats nearby. The noise levels are slightly higher than the background noise level of 64- ,70 dB in the locality. The noise level caused by the testings is no higher than the noise caused by the heavy vehicle moving along Jalan Boon Lay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Chartered Industries has been advised to minimize the noise. They are taking action to appoint an acoustic consultant to carry out a noise control study at the firing range with the intention of reducing the noise level. They will also be required to adjust the time of testing to minimize the nuisance caused to the residents.

  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for the Environment what is the purpose of the "water-borne fee" collected by the Public Utilities Board; what amount has been collected since its introduction up to any convenient date; how this amount collected has been expended and whether the need to maintain the rate for this fee will be reviewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore is a compact, urbanized and industrialized state. Over the last 20 years, the Government has built a modern sewerage system to ensure a high standard of public health. Waste water from our homes and industries is collected and treated before dis-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> charge into our watercourses or the sea. This has prevented water-borne diseases and the breeding of vectors, such as flies and mosquitoes. The modern sewerage system has also helped to reduce the pollution in our rivers and canals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, we have built four sewage treatment works, 118 sewage pumping stations and 1,400 kilometres of sewers. Another two sewage treatment works, costing $127 million at Jurong and Seletar, are under construction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty per cent of our population are now served by the modern sewerage system. Because of the effective sewerage system, Singapore is enjoying one of the highest public health standards in the world. We still have isolated outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as typhoid and cholera. Investigations, however, revealed that the harmful germs are food-borne and not waterborne.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sewerage infrastructure requires large amounts of capital. From FY 1970 to FY 1980, we have spent $795 million on capital expenditure. We have borrowed US$33.1 million (equivalent to S$78 million) from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to partly finance the capital expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1970, the Government levies a monthly water-borne fee on all premises with PUB water supply. In addition, a sanitary appliances fee (for toilets and urinals) is collected for premises connected to public sewers. The PUB collects the fees on behalf of the Government. The revenue pays for the depreciation of the capital works, the operating expenditure and interest payment on loans. This is a requirement of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The net surplus of revenue is used to defray part of the capital expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From FY 1970 to FY 1980, the amount of water-borne fee collected is $175 million, and the sanitary appliances and other fees are $214.1 million. For the same period, my Ministry spent a total of $260 million on providing sewerage services.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present rates of the water-borne fees are 7 cents per cubic metre for domestic premises and 15 cents per cubic metre for non-domestic premises. The sanitary appliances fee is $3 per toilet or urinal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net surplus has fallen in FY 1980. Our operating expenditure has increased because of higher energy and material costs, and wages. Based on existing revenue rates, we will run into a deficit in FY 1982. My Ministry has reviewed the rate of the waterborne fee and an announcement on the revision of the fee will be made shortly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the financial statement (Cols. 219 - 220) for the sewerage programme from FY 1970 to FY 1982 have been circulated for the information of the House.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as at 31st July, 1981, there were 6,923 outstanding applications for citizenship. The number of outstanding cases has been drastically reduced in recent years. At the end of 1978, the number outstanding was 24,862. This was reduced to 14,489 by the end of 1979. The number dropped to 8,882 at the end of 1980. Of the 6,923 applications pending, 1,799 applications were received before 1st January 1981. 292 of the 1,799 applications have already been refused and the applicants will be informed soon. The remaining 1,507 applications have been held up for various reasons. In some cases, the information provided by the applicants is inadequate and the Registry of Citizenship has to wait for the applicants to provide
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> further information or clarification. In other cases, the applications have been shelved temporarily as the applicants who do not now meet the criteria for approval are expected to qualify in the near future. These cases are not immediately rejected but are instead kept in view for the benefit of the applicants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority will be given to clearing the older applications. All the 1,507 applications received before 1981 should be cleared within six to 12 months, although this would depend partly on the cooperation of the applicants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first seven months of 1981, 10,131 persons applied for citizenship. Of these, 3,461 have been granted citizenship and 1,546 have been rejected. The rest are at various stages of processing. Normally, the average processing time of these new applications is about three months.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have, in fact, increased the number of criteria in the sense that we are now much more liberal so that we can attract more talent to Singapore. For example, if a foreign student who has studied in Singapore has done very well in the GCE 'A' level examination, that student will be favourably considered first for permanent residence and later for citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if that is the case, what about those outstanding cases which do not meet that criterion?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the outstanding cases, as I have said, have been drastically reduced from year to year and, as a result, we now have only 1,507 applications which were submitted before 1st January 1981. These cases, hopefully with the cooperation of the applicants concerned, may be dealt with within six to 12 months.

  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many accidents involving pedestrians and motor cyclists have occurred since 1st January, 1980, up to the latest convenient date; (b) how many of them were fatal; and (c) what remedial measures his Ministry proposes to take to reduce such accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there were 3,397 accidents involving pedestrians and 10,963 accidents involving motor-cyclists between 1st January, 1980 and 30th June 1981. These accidents resulted in the death of 148 pedestrians and 133 motor-cyclists. This adds up to 281 pedestrians and motor-cyclists or 73% of the total of 385 persons killed in road accidents during that period.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedestrians and motor-cyclists are most vulnerable among road users. Of the 96 pedestrian deaths in 1980, 58 or 60.4% were those aged 60 years and above and children under 14 years of age. As for motor-cyclists, the death toll on the roads was 133 or 34.6% of total accident fatalities for the period 1st January 1980 to 30th June 1981.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident prevention requires a multi-faceted approach involving enforcement, education, training and provision of adequate road-crossing facilities. These measures must be applied to all road users. However, to reduce accidents involving pedestrians and motor-cyclists in particular, the Traffic Police will concentrate its effort on these two categories of road users. For the pedestrians the target groups are those 60 years and above and children under 14 years of age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police is working closely with the Ministry of Education to make school children more aware of road safety. Since the East Coast Road Safety Park was opened in January this year, some 45,000 school children have undergone the road safety programme there, Another 85,000 students will participate in the programme by the end of 1981. 150,000 primary and secondary school students also attended audio visual
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> presentations on road safety in 1980. This activity will continue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of poor eye-sight and other disabilities, the aged should be helped to cross roads. Since February 1981, five constituencies have conducted campaigns to help the aged cross the road. More constituencies should hold similar campaigns so that it can become an accepted social responsibility for the young and able-bodied to assist the aged to cross roads.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote road safety consciousness among motor-cyclists, a Safe Riding Course was initiated in December 1979, Between December 1979 and July 1980, about 1,000 motor-cyclists took part in the courses. Five more courses will be held from August - December 1981. However, this is not adequate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the transfer of the driving licensing function from the Registry of Vehicles to the Traffic Police, priority will be given to upgrade the riding skills of motor-cyclists. A comprehensive plan is being worked out. One of the measures is to require all motorcyclists holding provisional licences to take their riding tests within a specified period of time. The existing pre-Provisional Driving Licence course will be gradually upgraded to one that will provide a complete training programme on motor-cycle riding. It is planned that, by 1985, only qualified riders will be allowed on public roads.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April 1980, 27 overhead bridges have been built. Another 45 more will be completed soon. Eighty-one signalized pedestrian crossings are planned for this financial year. The "no crossing zone", which presently extends to 50 metres from a designated crossing under the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, will soon be increased to 100 metres.

  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what progress has been made in the implementation of the Neighbourhood Watch Scheme; (b) how many constituencies have introduced the Scheme; (c) what are the tangible results; and (d) whether his Ministry is monitoring the progress of the Scheme and will make the necessary changes to ensure its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Neighbourhood Watch Scheme was launched in June this year. The objective is to organize neighbours to help one another and to protect themselves from crime such as robbery, housebreaking and thefts. To-date, 23 constituencies have introduced the Scheme and another 10 constituencies will be doing so between August and October this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still too early to gauge the tangible results of the Scheme. Members of Residents' Committees (RCs) are providing the leadership in forming Neighbourhood Watch Groups. Police officers who are members of RCs are spearheading the efforts and providing guidance to other members. There are 3,628 police officers living in public housing estates. To-date, 73 police officers who are RC members have helped to form 74 groups. The rest will soon be forming such groups with their immediate neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the Scheme, in terms of its effect in reducing the crime rate, can only be assessed after the Neighbourhood Watch Groups have had sufficient time to build up and consolidate themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs is monitoring the progress of the Scheme which is being coordinated by the RC Secretariat in the Prime Minister's Office and the Crime
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Prevention and Community Relations Department of the Police Force. The plan is to fully implement the scheme by 1st June, 1982 in all public housing estates with RCs. At the same time, the Police will urge residents' associations in private residential estates to form Neighbourhood Watch Groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to monitor the Scheme closely and make whatever adjustments that may be necessary to ensure its success.

  <b>Mr M.K.A. Jabbar</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in view of the recent spate of snatch thefts in the Radin Mas Constituency, whether the frequency of Police car patrols in the area can be increased.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there has been no recent upsurge of snatch thefts in the Radin Mas Constituency. There were nine cases of snatch thefts in the Constituency in the first seven months of this year. There were also nine cases of snatch theft over the corresponding period last year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radin Mas Constituency is patrolled by a team policing car from the Queenstown Police Station, In addition, there are Police National Servicemen in uniform performing
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> vertical policing during the day and at night. Plainclothes policemen and detectives also make their usual rounds and conduct anti-crime operations from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snatch theft is a crime of opportunity, The victims are invariably women. Through crime preventive campaigns the Police have repeatedly advised our women on how they should carry their handbags to avoid snatch thefts. This crime prevention message is now being disseminated to the residents of HDB estates through the Residents' Committees and through the Neighbourhood Watch Scheme, If members of the public were to take these simple precautions, they can avoid being victims of snatch thieves.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (a) if he is aware of the inconveniences caused as a result of changes in feeder service 261 in Ang Mo Kio, particularly in Chong Boon Constituency; and (b) if he will give an assurance that, for future changes, there would be sufficient consultation between the authorities and relevant civic organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am aware of the changes made to Service 261 in Ang Mo Kio New Town but did not know they had resulted in as much inconvenience as the hon. Member for Chong Boon has made out to be. However, before elaborating on the reasons for the changes, I wish to assure the hon. Member that the changes made were done in good faith. SBS had no intention of making things any more difficult for his constituents than they already are.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first change, that of skipping the bus stops along Avenue 3, was done to reduce congestion along the already congested Avenue 3 by some 23 buses an hour. In addition, SBS would have saved two buses which could then have been redeployed elsewhere. However, since this meant a walk of some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 180 to 400 metres for those wishing to make trunk transfers, the move was not well received. Consequently, the connection to Avenue 3 was restored.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change, that of splitting Service 261 into two, was done to segregate the rather large catchment of Service 261 in order to make operations more manageable as well as to improve service levels. But, unfortunately this too, I am afraid, was unacceptable to commuters affected. So finally, following consultations with the hon. Members for Cheng San and Chong Boon, SBS agreed to undo the change and restore Service 261 to its original route. This has since been done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, may I assure hon. Members that it is the usual practice for SBS and ROV to consult Members and their respective CCCs of any intended changes. However, in this case, this was inadvertently overlooked as it coincided with the relocation of the bus terminal.

  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng) (for the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Labour carries out annual surveys on the labour force, from which the Ministry knows the number of people employed and those that are unemployed. The Ministry also has an Employment Service to assist job seekers, including teenagers, to get employment.

  <br> Teenagers, whether they are unemployed, underemployed or employed, are welcome to seek the assistance of the Employment Service.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no difficulty in getting jobs under prevailing buoyant economic conditions. The welfare of teenagers will also be taken care of by regulations for the employment of children and young persons. There is, therefore, no need at this juncture to introduce any measures to assist them.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.
  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour why there was a significant increase in the number of cases of Noise Induced Deafness in 1980, as reported in the 1980 Singapore Yearbook of Labour Statistics; whether the actual number of incidents would far exceed the number reported to the Labour Ministry; what industries were largely responsible for this increase; and whether the existing legislation and control are adequate to check the situation, and, if not, what steps the Ministry will take in this respect.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Labour (Dr Wong Kwei Cheong) (for the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the number of confirmed cases of noise-induced deafness in 1980 was 229 as compared with 158 for 1979. This represented an increase of 45%. This increase was largely due to more workers being given periodic audiometric examinations by their employers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the actual number of cases of noise-induced deafness is more than the number reported to the Labour Ministry. This is because noise-induced deafness causes no obvious symptoms in the early stages but can be detected by an audio-metric examination. At present, noisy industries have been advised by the Industrial
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Health Division of the Labour Ministry to provide regular audiometric examinations for their workers. The Ministry intends to introduce legislation to make such examinations compulsory for all workers who are exposed to high noise levels. When such examinations are implemented, we shall get a much better picture of the total number of workers affected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must, however, be stressed that the vast majority of noise-induced deafness cases detected so far were in the early stages. For example, only 11 of the 229 cases confirmed in 1980 were advanced cases eligible for workmen's compensation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the industries largely responsible for the increase in noise-induced deafness in 1980, 113 of the 229 cases came from the transport, storage and supporting services industry, while 67 came from the manufacture of transport equipment industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 58 of the Factories Act stipulates that excessive noise shall be reduced as far as is practicable. Section 56 of the same Act provides that where workers are exposed to excessive noise, they have to be provided with proper ear protectors by their employers, Together with the forthcoming legislation on statutory audiometric examinations on a regular basis, these legislative requirements would be adequate to control the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, the Hon. Minister of State has spoken of the intention to introduce legislation to make audiometric examinations compulsory for workers exposed to high levels of noise. My question is: how high is a high level of noise? Does his Ministry have a permissible dBA level for workers exposed to high noise levels?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for noise-induced deafness in the early stages. the noise level is about 50 dBA in the speech frequencies 1-3 kiloHertz (kHz). More excessive cases, or proper noise-induced deafness, are caused by noise levels that exceed 50 dBA in the speech frequencies 1-3 kHz.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as at 31st July 1981, the CPF Board received a total of 1,830 applications, of which 703 were for full redemption of housing loans. So far, 200 applications have been approved, all of which were for full redemption of housing loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Sir, may I ask the Hon. Minister the following questions? First, with regard to applications which have been approved, why does the CPF Board insist on having first charge on the property and holding on to the title deeds? Secondly, in the case of a civil servant who utilizes his CPF savings to redeem his Government housing loan, why is there a conflict between the Ministry of Finance and the CPF Board on the question of who is to take first charge on the property when, in fact, the CPF Board is able to resolve this problem and reach an agreement with the private sector, namely, the banks and the finance companies which are to take second charge?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the keeping of the title deeds by the mortgagee or chargee is a legal practice. This is to prevent the mortgager from sub-mortgaging the property without the existing mortgagee's knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member asked why is there a conflict between the Ministry of Finance and the CPF Board on the question of who is to take first charge where civil servants utilize their CPF savings to redeem their Govern-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ment housing loans. I understand that the Ministry of Finance is checking with its legal advisers on its position as second mortgagee under the CPF residential properties scheme before it consents to the CPF Board having the first charge on the property. There is really no conflict. The banks and finance companies have already given their consent to the CPF Board having the first charge on the property. The CPF Board does not expect any problem in resolving this matter with the Ministry of Finance.

  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture (a) what was the reason for the recent spate of resignations of senior personnel from the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation; (b) whether the work efficiency of the SBC will be affected; and (c) what steps are being taken to check the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since 1st February 1980 to the end of July this year, 19 middle rank officers from the Programmes Division and 17 officers from the News and Current Affairs Division resigned. Most of them left for higher pay in the private sector. Some left to join the existing and proposed English language newspapers; others joined SBC for a few months and left, being unable to adapt to the irregular hours and pressures of broadcasting life; and a small number left for personal and domestic reasons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the recent resignations represent only 2% of the total establishment. they have not adversely affected work efficiency. With the conversion of RTS into SBC, the organization has been strengthened. Prior to the formation of SBC, there were 1,335 members of staff. The present staff strength is 1,764.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When SBC was established, priority was given to the creation of more and better promotional avenues for various categories of staff. Other improvements included the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> creation of new posts, regrading of existing ones, and revision and upgrading of salary structures of the creative staff. Promotional avenues have also been improved in 24 schemes of service and more frequent promotion exercises have been held. Since 1st February 1980, 36 promotion exercises have been held and 205 officers have been promoted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBC will continue to improve its conditions of service and schemes of service. Officers will be given on-the-job training and overseas training and attachments where necessary. Existing procedures and practices will be periodically reviewed to enable staff to do their work better and get greater job satisfaction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBC must continue to take every step to ensure that its staff find it attractive and satisfying to work in SBC. But we must accept the fact that it will not be possible to always match the terms offered by the private sector. Private firms, especially the small employers, can offer terms to a particular employee of SBC which SBC cannot match without upsetting relativities and staff morale.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To advise the Minister on the acquisition of historical, anthropological and an materials for display and for the reference collections.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To advise the Minister on the methods of presentation and display techniques, including the use of audio-visual aids in creating a more lively Museum presentation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To advise the Minister on new activities to further the objectives of the Museum and improve the Museum's services to researchers, students of history and the public in general.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Museum Development Committee has met regularly over the past year to draw up a blueprint for the development of the Museum which will meet the artistic and cultural needs of the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members may wish to know that among the Museum's priorities are:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Building up of a strong Curatorial Unit which is at the moment seriously understaffed. This requires not only more staff but also greater resources devoted to staff training and professional development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Upgrading and sprucing up of the Museum premises and public galleries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Improvement of the galleries facilities and upgrading of exhibit presentation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Creation of new areas of activities and display. The Ministry plans to set up a History of Singapore Gallery in the Museum. The objective is to make a graphic presentation and explanation of the history of Singapore. The presentation must attract the interest of Singaporeans and inform them of their past. The Museum will need to recruit and appoint specialized personnel such as a qualified multi-media firm and consultant, a professional designer and a Curator of History. A history section within the Curatorial Unit will also have to be set up to direct such a programme and to service the new History of Singapore Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Museum Development Committee and the Ministry of Culture are at present finalizing this plan and will submit it shortly to the Ministry of Finance to seek funds to implement the projects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on sprucing up the Museum and upgrading public galleries has commenced and is expected to be completed in about five to six months' time. The construction of the

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the whole, I am satisfied with the outcome of the recent International Conference on Kampuchea held in New York. First, despite Vietnamese and Soviet predictions of a boycott of the Conference, 93 member states of the UN attended and made clear their position on the Kampuchean question. It was evident that they felt strong enough about the ASEAN position on the Kampuchean question to attend the Conference, disregarding Vietnamese appeals and propaganda dissuading them from attending. Thirty-six of those who attended are members of the Non-Aligned Movement. The participating countries of the Conference were also well-balanced geographically. By attending, these countries identified themselves not only with the Kampuchean question, which has implications for all UN
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> members, but also with the ASEAN view of finding a comprehensive political solution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Conference adopted a Declaration and Resolution which contain all the elements which ASEAN feels are essential parts of a solution to the problem, namely:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) An agreement on ceasefire and withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea under supervision of UN peace-keeping forces;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Appropriate arrangements to ensure that armed Kampuchean factions will not be able to prevent or disrupt the holding of free elections after Vietnamese withdrawal, or intimidate or coerce the population in the electoral process;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Appropriate measures for maintenance of law and order in Kampuchea and the holding of free elections; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The holding of free elections under UN supervision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with all international conferences, differences did arise between ASEAN and others on a few contentious paragraphs in our proposed draft declaration, but these were overcome in the process of discussions. ASEAN was able to arrive at a satisfactory compromise in the language of the Conference Declaration which preserved the important principles that ASEAN put forward. ASEAN would have preferred to see a categorical call for the disarming of all Kampuchean factions. But it agreed to the final formulation as the principle that elections should be held free of armed coercion was agreed by all parties at the Conference. How the principle can be assured will have to be settled when the solution is implemented. ASEAN considers disarming as an effective method which must be considered when the Kampuchean problem comes close to a resolution. I am confident that in the process of negotiations towards a final solution to the Kampuchean question, these elements can be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties by ensuring that the people of Kampuchea are not only accorded the right to freely elect their representatives but without duress or coercion from any quarter.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of an inter-sessional committee by the International Conference is also another positive development which we should all welcome. It provides a mechanism for on-going consultations among UN members on the resolution of this problem. It also provides the means to conduct direct or indirect contacts and negotiations with the various parties concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Conference was never intended to solve the Kampuchean problem in one meeting. Within the limited aims that ASEAN set for the Conference, the Conference was a success.

  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, the Hon. Minister mentioned the proposal for a comprehensive political settlement. Would the Minister comment on the prospects for the implementation of the comprehensive political settlement?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, the hon. Member probably means the prospect in the immediate future. I think this problem must be looked at in a time-frame. We have to be realistic. There will be no solution in the immediate future. But as we see it now, in a three to five-year time-frame - this may change if there are developments in other parts of the world - if pressure continues to be maintained on Vietnam and if Vietnam continues to be isolated and continues to pay the price, both political and economic, for the course of action it is pursuing, I think we will see a real movement towards a solution. At that point, Vietnam will realize that the solution as proposed at the International Conference offers the best way out for Vietnam from this conflict. So the short answer is that in the immediate future there will probably be no concrete movement towards a solution, but I am sticking my neck out that in the three to five-year time-frame there will be some real movement.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Culture if he is aware that certain dailies, in the zeal of competition, have been bringing out their newspapers the evening before and whether such a practice (i) is in the interest of the reading public, and (ii) contravenes the permits issued under the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Fong Sip Chee (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture):</b> Sir, the Ministry is aware that the Chinese dailies - Nanyang Siang Pau, Sin Chew Jit Poh, Shin Min and Min Pao - bring out their newspapers the evening before.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang and Sin Chew have the more serious news. They start printing around 9.00 pm. About 8% to 10% of their total daily circulation is put on sale between 9.30 pm. and 10.30 pm. The papers which come out at this time cater for the night market and cover news items up to 8.30 pm that evening. However, unless there are major news items later, both newspapers normally continue printing for the following morning's circulation. Usually, by midnight or so, 30% to 50% of the total circulation of the two newspapers would have been printed. It is normal for the two papers to stop press at around 12 midnight to 1.00 am to incorporate the latest news items.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally the two papers should stop printing after catering for the evening market and resume printing only in the early hours of the morning. That would ensure that all morning readers get the latest news. Unfortunately this is not the case. The existing practice saves on overtime costs for the newspapers. It is also preferred by news vendors who find it convenient to collect the papers early.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shin Min and Min Pao, on the other hand, cater mainly for readers who want light evening news. The evening editions, therefore, form the bulk of their total circulation - 56% to 70% for Shin Min, and 60% to 64% for Min Pao.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early publication of the dailies does not contravene the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act. The hon. Member may feel that something ought to be done to ensure that as many readers as possible get the latest news.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> This is a matter outside official control, How, when and what makes a paper sell does not depend on official edicts or regulations. It is competition and consumer preference that decides the result. In an increasingly bilingual society, the Chinese and English papers compete more and more for the same readership. Among other things, it is the paper that is consistently first with the news that will get the readers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether he will agree that with the success of the bilingual policy, more and more people can read both the English and Chinese newspapers. Therefore, if they find that the English newspapers could carry the latest news comparatively ahead of the Chinese newspapers, it will not be necessary for them to read the Chinese newspapers. In the long run, this will not be conducive to the interest of the Chinese newspapers. In fact, it will be a loss not only to the country but also to the Chinese newspapers and their readers as well. Is the Minister of State aware that recently when one of our Minister's speeches was made in Mandarin, it was published in the English newspapers the following day whereas it was published in the Chinese newspapers yet one day later. This is the result of the Chinese newspapers printing their papers too early in the evening before.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the Ministry shares the hon. Member's concern for the well-being of the Chinese papers. As much as we like to adhere to our principle that the papers can compete freely, really it is the wisdom of the management of the various papers that finally decide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the example that the hon. Member quoted. It was indeed unfortunate, but I would call upon the dailies, particularly the Chinese dailies, to pay heed to the Member's concern. As I said earlier, and as the Member himself has acknowledged, in a more and more bilingual society, if one goes for news one would read the paper that could give first-hand news, be it English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil. The various vernacular papers are already hampered by more cumbersome editorial problems, like trans-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> lation from the teleprinters, international news plus local news releases into the Chinese, Malay or Tamil languages. It means a longer time spent on editing. This handicap, together with their policy, might reduce the papers into publishing timeless articles and losing out in the publishing of the latest news.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the newspapers to pay heed to the Member's concern but the Ministry will still adhere to our stand that we allow free competition to dictate their own fate.

  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Public Utilities Board and the Jurong Town Corporation have ascertained the cause of the rusty water supplied to households in the Boon Lay and Jurong housing estates; (b) whether the impurities in the water will cause harmful effects to the residents; (c) what remedial actions are being taken and by whom; and (d) when the residents in those areas can expect to receive clear and rust-free water.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, rusty water experienced in some households in the Boon Lay and Taman Jurong housing estates is caused by corrosion of the water storage tanks in the building. The corrosion has been accelerated by the higher chloride content of the water which comes from the Kranji and Pandan reservoirs. Chemical and bacteriological tests show that the water is safe for drinking. The iron content in the water which causes the colouration is within the maximum permissible level laid down by the World Health Organization.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Town Corporation has embarked on a programme to repaint the inside of the water storage tanks. It is trying various types of paints to select the one that is most
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> effective against corrosion. In the meantime the tanks are being cleaned and flushed periodically. PUB is monitoring the programme closely. 93 blocks of flats in Taman Jurong and 37 blocks in the Boon Lay area are affected. Normally it will take about 12 months for all the work to be completed, but my Minister has instructed the JTC to speed up the work so that the residents in Boon Lay and Jurong will receive clear and rust-free water at the earliest possible time.

   <b>(Increase in water rates)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, with reference to his recent speech regarding increase in water consumption and the possible increase in water rates, whether there is no way of reducing water consumption without raising water charges, and whether he is aware that, as the Public Utilities Board has not ruled out the possibility of further increases in electricity and gas charges, with yearly increases in water rates many families with limited incomes will find great difficulty in making ends meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Sir, water rates have to be periodically revised because the cost of supplying water rises each year. As long as the PUB workers continue to enjoy periodic wage increases in line with other workers and new reservoirs and water treatment plants have to be constructed at higher cost, there is no way to avoid revision of water tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the revision of water tariffs, PUB has also to take into account the need to curb the high rate of increase in water consumption which, if not brought down, will lead to water shortages in the future. Past experience has shown that increases in water tariffs are effective in helping to curb wasteful consumption. A more drastic measure to cut wasteful water consumption is to impose water rationing. Such a measure, in my view, is socially less palat-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> able and economically less efficient. It should be introduced, if at all, in a crisis. To help the public to be more frugal in water usage, the PUB will mount a Save Water Campaign in October this year. I am aware that the PUB has not ruled out the possibility of further increases in electricity and gas charges. PUB cannot hold down charges when the price of imported oil continues to rise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the hon. Member for Khe Bong's concern for the difficulties facing families with limited incomes, and I would like to assure him that the revision in water tariffs will be structured so that the increase will be equitable. It will be the large and wasteful consumers who will be more heavily penalized for the wasteful habits. I have also asked the PUB to phase out the increases so as to allow consumers time to adjust their expenditure and to spare them from the traumatic adjustments of sudden large revisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this round of revision, the increases will be quite moderate. For those households which consume less than 20 cubic metres of water per month - 61% of households are in this category - the average increase will amount to less than a dollar per month; in fact, less than the price of a packet of cigarettes or three cups of coffee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Trade and Industry seems to believe that water consumption can only be reduced if the rate of water charges is increased. I wish to refer him to a speech he made recently. In his speech, he did say that the rate of water consumption dropped from 9% to 1.7% in 1976 after the last revision in 1975 but the rate of increase in water consumption had since been steadily rising to 7.7% last year. If this is so, it proves beyond a doubt that increasing the water rates is not an effective measure to stop an increase in water consumption. Thus, I would like to ask the Minister whether he will consider launching a social campaign to try and persuade the people to save water voluntarily.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said just now, the PUB will be mounting a Save Water Campaign in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> October to persuade the public to be more frugal in water usage. However, we will also increase the water tariffs to make sure that water usage goes down.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I think that is not fair. The Minister should wait for at least one year to see whether -

  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, are you raising a supplementary question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes, Sir, I am raising a supplementary question following this point. I would like to ask the Minister to consider increasing the water rates only as a last resort.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have considered other means and we believe that the increase in water tariffs is one of the best ways to bring down water usage.

   <b>(Water production cost and selling price)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he can ascertain from the Public Utilities Board what is the net cost of production and the selling price of water per cubic metre, and how many cubic metres of water were sold from 1976 to 1980, both years inclusive, giving each year's net profit/loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in 1980 the Public Utilities Board's average cost of producing one cubic metre of water was 33 cents. This year, the average cost is expected to rise to 37.4 cents because of the increased cost of energy, chemicals and equipment and the higher wages of workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average selling price of water in 1980 was 44.7 cents per cubic metre. However, the water tariff for domestic consumers is structured in blocks at increasing rates for higher levels of consumption. At present, the price per cubic metre for the first 25 cubic metres consumed is only 30 cents. Seventy-four per cent of domestic consumers consume less than 25 cubic metres a month and are, therefore, enjoying water at below cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also asked for the relevant statistics on the amount of water sold and the Water Department's profit or loss for the years 1976 to 1980. I shall also give the development expenditure for these years in order to put these statistics in their proper perspective.
  <pre>
                      Surplus of   Development
         Water Sold   Water Dept   Expenditure

          Million      Dollars      Dollars
         Cu Metres     Million      Million

 1976       198         18.2         18.9

 1977       210         22.8         35.1

 1978       224         25.0         39.9

 1979       238         36.7         41.3

 1980       256         19.3         36.3
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen, the surplus of the Water Department each year falls far short of the amount required to finance the development expenditure for the construction of new reservoirs and treatment plants. The PUB has had to borrow from the Government, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to meet part of its development expenditure.

  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many householders read their own Public Utilities Board meters as at 31st July, 1981 ; and (b) what steps the PUB is taking to promote self-reading of meters by consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the month of July 1981, about 14,000 consumers or 2.3% of the total 600,000 accounts sent in their own meter readings for billing. To encourage consumers to read their own meters, PUB issues meter-reading cards with prepaid postage to all consumers who Wish to make their own readings. These cards are also left at the premises by the meter readers when they are unable to take meter readings because the premises are found to be locked.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB has also been promoting self-reading of meters by giving talks in schools and community centres during which a special audio-visual show on how to read

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd August, 1979, new Building Regulations aimed at conserving use of energy in buildings, came into operation. The Regulations prescribe, among other things, a maximum Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV) which is a measure of the ability of a building envelope to keep out external heat, of 45 measured in watts per square metre for air-conditioned commercial buildings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage owners of existing air-conditioned commercial buildings to make the necessary renovations to comply with the energy conservation standard, the costs of renovation are deductible for income tax purposes for corporate owners and 40% of the costs of renovation are deductible against annual property tax for individual owners. The Income Tax Act and Property Tax Act will be suitably amended to provide for these deductions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these incentives, a disincentive in the form of a surcharge of 20% of the electricity bill will be imposed on owners who fail to achieve the energy conservation standard by 1st January 1982.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is probably aware that the Registrar of Vehicles will be introducing a scheme to conduct compulsory car inspections from 1982. Cars over 10 years old will be checked every year whilst those over three years old will be checked every other year. The purpose of this scheme is to upgrade the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and to control pollution by encouraging owners to maintain their cars regularly. The ROV has appointed two agents to conduct inspections on behalf of the Government. They are the Vehicle Inspection Company (VICOM) and the Automobile Association of Singapore (AA). The Vehicle Inspection Company is a private company owned by the NTUC, and is setting up an inspection centre at Sin Ming Road while the Automobile Association of Singapore is setting up their inspection centre at Eunos Avenue, off Sims Avenue. Both agents will be using computerized equipment to conduct inspections.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that all cars are inspected properly and according to standards acceptable to the ROV. The Road Traffic Act is, therefore, being amended to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> enable rules to be made for this purpose. Some of the rules will prescribe the requirements that cars have to meet in relation to construction and condition. Other rules will spell out the minimum requirements which the inspection agents have to comply with, such as the type of equipment to be installed, how inspections should be carried out and what to check during the inspection. The rules will also authorize the agents to issue certificates of roadworthiness and to collect inspection fees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first stage of the implementation programme in 1982, all cars over five years old will be called up for inspection. The remaining cars will be called up in phases later. Announcements will be made as we progress. ROV will publish information booklets in conjunction with the two agents to advise car owners and workshop personnel of the inspection standards. These booklets will be released shortly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this amendment Bill, it is an offence for a person to drive his car if it does not have a valid certificate of inspection as required by law.

  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. S. Jayakumar (Bedok):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to say a few words on this Bill. This Bill has two features. I wish to address myself to that feature of the Bill relating to the inspection and examination of motor vehicles and the granting or withholding of a certificate for compliance or non-compliance with the prescribed requirements relating to the construction and condition of the vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by expressing my very strong support for the general principle contained in this part of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for the requirement to have vehicles inspected and examined and for vehicles to have test certificates is unquestionable. Our objectives of promoting safety on our roads and of combating air pollution are met not only by ensuring that drivers on our roads drive safely but also by ensuring
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that the vehicles which are driven on our roads themselves are in a safe and satisfactory condition. A motor vehicle, it goes without saying, which is faulty in construction or has faulty parts, for instance, faulty brakes, can be as lethal and dangerous on our roads as the most reckless and careless driver. This part of the Bill can, therefore, only benefit the national interest in promoting safety on the roads. And in so far as the provisions of the Bill seek to ensure pollution control, it also goes a long way to ensuring the quality of the air which we breathe.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that and without detracting from my support for the basic principles, I wish to make one or two observations which the Hon. Minister might wish to take note for later consideration, particularly when the rules are drafted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point of concern is that the criterion or purpose according to which the relevant officials will examine the vehicle and make a decision to grant or not to grant a certificate is not mentioned in the provisions. It is also not mentioned in the Explanatory Statement. It is very fortunate that we heard just now the Hon. Minister's statement where he explained that the purpose of the Bill is that of ensuring roadworthiness and of ensuring pollution control. But if I might respectfully suggest, these cardinal elements of the proposed legislation ought to have been included in the provisions of the legislation itself. It would have been desirable to state them in the legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this omission may, at first glance, seem minor, but I would like to suggest that it is important. In my view it is important because, on principle, when Parliament enacts legislation, especially legislation which confers discretionary powers on public officials and in this particular case where it even goes so far as to confer discretionary powers on private companies, then we in Parliament must ensure that the scope of the discretionary powers must be defined as clearly as possible, The legislative intent behind the legislation should be as clear as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> possible. In this case, as we have noted, the legislative intent in giving discretionary power to grant or withhold test certificates is that of road-worthiness, safety factor and pollution control. I think there are at least four good reasons why these cardinal elements should have been included in the legislation that emanates from this Chamber.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it will enable the relevant officials in the Ministry to draft the subsidiary legislation, the rules, without any doubt as to the scope of the statute and as to whether the rules that they are drafting come within the ambit and purview of the legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there would have been better guidance for the public servants and the public companies to whom an agency role has been granted to exercise their discretionary powers under the Act. With the purpose spelt out in the provisions, there would be less ambiguity, less room for misinterpretations, and therefore, hopefully less disputes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when disputes arise, and let us hope that they do not arise, concerning the interpretation of the rules, or disputes arise concerning the exercise of discretionary powers, then the Courts will come into the picture, and in that case what the legislative intent is would become very crucial.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it would be helpful also to the citizens concerned if they have no doubt as to the exact purport and intent behind the legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of these considerations that I thought I should express this concern. To illustrate my concern, let me give a hypothetical example. Can the examiner or inspector, for instance, refuse to grant a certificate on the ground that the paintwork or upholstery is in an unsatisfactory condition? I would assume that this is not the intention of the legislature. It is not our intention that the discretionary powers should go to that extent because it may not have any relationship to roadworthiness or the prevention of pollution. But if we look at the Bill, the phrase "the prescribed requirements relating to its construction and condition" may be wide enough
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to cover that element. But this doubt could have been avoided if the legislation had laid down either in the provisions or in the Explanatory Statement that the purpose was to promote safety, roadworthiness and to prevent pollution. I am glad, however, that the Hon. Minister has, in his speech, brought this out very clearly and, therefore, has left us with no doubt as to the purpose according to which the discretionary powers will be exercised. Perhaps the matter might be dealt with when the rules are being drafted so that what is not explicit in the Act may be made explicit in the rules.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to deal with concerns the provision which is proposed on the creation of offences. The proposed new section 41 (D) creates an offence; it attributes the offence to whoever uses a vehicle, any vehicle, without a test certificate, There must have been good reasons for taking this approach in the legislation. But I would like to ask a question of the Minister as to whether it might not have been a better approach to attribute the offence to the registered owner of the car and to make the possession of the test certificate an essential prerequisite for registration of the car, in the same manner that the possession of a valid insurance coverage is a prerequisite for registration of a motor vehicle so that the obligation rests with the person applying for registration of the car and the offence can also be attributed to him. I would like to ask whether that would not have been a better approach. But, as I have said, there must have been good reasons and it will be helpful if the Hon. Minister can enlighten the House on this point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me say that these two observations which I have made do not in any way detract from the strong position of support that I wish to express for the laudable motives behind this amending legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the hon. Member for his strong support for the Bill and for his observations on which he has so? kindly elaborated at length.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has raised two points. One is about the purpose or criterion upon which the test certificate will be issued and why this was not clearly stated in the Bill As a normal practice, the details of the requirement or criterion relating to the condition and construction to which vehicles would have to comply will be fully prescribed in the subsidiary legislation. Once this has been done, there should be no question as to what the purpose or criterion of the Bill is all about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the aim of the Road Traffic Act is to ensure and to promote road safety. This Bill, being part of the main Act, has the same legislative intent of the Act and is implied. There will be no misinterpretation of the intention or objective of the Act, although it may be useful to reiterate it from time to time, perhaps in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill, as the hon. Member would like to see.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point the hon. Member raised was about the rationale for attaching the offence to the person who uses the vehicle rather than the registered owner of the vehicle. If the Member reads section 41 D carefully, it spells out that the registered owner is responsible for the roadworthiness of his motor vehicle. If the owner allows his vehicle which has no test certificate to be used on the road, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction. However, in addition to the vehicle owner, if the driver of the vehicle is not the owner himself, then the driver who uses on the road a motor vehicle which has no test certificate, shall also be guilty of an offence. This is necessary as a further deterrent, as I am sure the hon. Member will appreciate the danger of using such motor vehicles on the roads.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the hon. Member that perhaps we should make it a prerequisite to obtain a test certificate before the motor vehicle is registered or is having its road taxes renewed, as in the case of vehicle insurance coverage mentioned by the Member. I shall ask the Registry of Vehicles to look into this in the implementation of the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Now, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill was committed to a Select Committee by the House on 6th March 1981. The Committee received three written representations, one from an individual, the second from the Great Eastern Life Assurance Field Officers Guild and the third from the Life Insurance Association. The Committee heard oral evidence from three representatives of the Life Insurance Association.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to touch briefly on the major concerns of the Life Insurance Association and the Committee's consideration of their representations. The Life Insurance Association welcomed the idea of a mortgage reducing insurance scheme for CPF members. It was, however, opposed to the proposal that the CPF Board run the scheme because it considered the insurance industry well placed and well equipped to handle the scheme on a consortium basis. It was also concerned that the CPF Board would later on move into other fields of insurance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out to the Life Insurance Association that the mortgage reducing insurance scheme was part of the State's social security provision and a logical extension of the Home Ownership Scheme. The CPF Board being a non-profit oriented organization and able to offer the most
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> attractive premiums should be the body to run the scheme. There was no reason why legislation should be enacted to require CPF members to take out a mortgage reducing insurance policy from a profit-making organization like the consortium proposed by the Life Insurance Association.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Life Insurance Association submitted a proposal for the mortgage reducing insurance scheme. It suggested that it be underwritten by a consortium to be formed by members of the Association. The Committee noted that the premium rates quoted in the Life Insurance Association proposal were higher than those proposed by the CPF Board. Furthermore, under the Life Insurance Association's proposal existing borrowers may be required to undergo a medical examination at their (insured) own expense and be subject to higher premiums if found unfit. In the case of the CPF scheme, there was no requirement for a medical examination. In addition, the premium rates under the Life Insurance Association's proposal were only valid for two years after which the rates may be revised in the light of experience. There was no such limitation in the case of the CPF scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Select Committee gave due consideration to the representations made, but did not make any amendments to the CPF (Amendment) Bill.

  <b>The Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Central Provident Fund Act are summarized in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Explanatory Statement to the Central Provident Fund (Amendment No. 2) Bill, 1981. I would like to touch on the more important amendments in the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clauses 4 and 7 provide for amendments to the Central Provident Fund Act to enable the CPF Board to implement the private residential property scheme. Members are no doubt aware that the Government proposes to allow CPF savings to be used for the purchase of private residential properties. The rationale behind this proposal is to help CPF members who are either ineligible for public housing or prefer to own a private residential property. It is also to enable CPF members to invest their CPF savings in residential properties as a hedge against inflation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private residential property scheme will be implemented in two phases to soften the impact of the scheme on the property market. In the first phase to be effected from 1st June 1981, CPF members will be allowed to use their CPF savings to redeem their outstanding housing loans. In the second phase, effective from 1st January 1982, CPF members will be allowed to use their CPF savings to purchase residential properties. Under both phases, the property can be for the member's own occupation or for rental.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 29 (g) of the Central Provident Fund Act, the Minister may make regulations to allow CPF members to use their CPF savings to purchase a property. However, the property can only be used for the member's own occupation and the CPF savings cannot be used to discharge an outstanding housing loan. Clause 7 seeks, therefore, to enable the Minister to allow a CPF member to use his savings for a property which is not owner-occupied and to discharge an outstanding housing loan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF savings are meant to provide for the old age of the CPF member. The CPF Board has, therefore, a social responsibility to ensure that CPF savings used under the private residential property scheme are returned to the CPF together with accrued interest if the CPF member sells the property
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> which he has purchased with CPF savings before he reaches the age of 55 years. To enable the Board to discharge this responsibility, clause 4 provides for a charge in favour of the CPF Board to be created on a property in respect of which CPF savings have been used. The charge will be subject to all prior encumbrances affecting the property.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board may not be able to recover fully the CPF savings used in cases where the property is subject to an existing mortgage. The mortgagee may exercise his power of sale to recover the outstanding loan leaving an insufficient amount to meet the CPF Board's claim. In order for the CPF Board to discharge its social responsibility, it will be seeking a first charge in cases where CPF savings are used for properties subject to an existing mortgage. The Board would obtain the consent of existing mortgagees for the Board to have the first charge. In this regard, the Board has obtained the agreement of the Association of Banks and Finance Houses Association for the Board to have the first charge provided, of course, the collateral is adequate to protect the bank's and finance company's interest. This first charge would apply to the amount of CPF savings withdrawn. The accrued interest will, however, rank pari passu with the interest of the banks and finance companies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important amendment is provided in clause 3 of the Bill which seeks to shorten the waiting period for a subsequent withdrawal of CPF savings of CPF members who have made a first withdrawal on or after attaining the age of 55 years. At present, under section 11 of the Central Provident Fund Act a CPF member who is 55 years of age and above must wait for five years before withdrawing again his CPF savings. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 11 to allow such a member to make one further withdrawal on or after every third anniversary of a member's date of birth after he has attained the age of 55, i.e. at the ages of 58, 61 and so on. CPF members concerned are those who have made a first withdrawal of their CPF savings on or after the age of 55 years and are still
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> working. There is no need for their CPF savings to be accumulated for a long period. Instead they should be allowed to make a further withdrawal of their CPF savings every three years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is concerned about frivolous job-hopping by employees. To help minimize this problem, the CPF Board has introduced a scheme which allows an employer to obtain information on a prospective employee's employment history for the last three years. Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to allow an employer who wishes to obtain such particulars to apply to the Board upon payment of a prescribed fee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4 of the Central Provident Fund Act provides for the appointment of a Chairman and six members to the Board. The six members comprise two representatives each from Government, employers and employees. This composition is adequate for the role played by the Board in the past. However, with the introduction of new responsibilities and activities such as the Private Residential Property Scheme and the Home Protection Insurance Scheme, it will be necessary to appoint to the Board additional members. Clause 2 provides for section 4 of the Act to be amended to increase the membership of the Board up to four persons and the quorum of the Board from three to five persons.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems of censorship in Singapore today are more complex than a decade ago, Mass travel has made it very difficult for a society to filter foreign influences. Just as bad money drives out good money, debased values and bizarre life-styles spread from country to country, undermining and eroding established virtues and values. All these have changed the problems of censorship. Technological advances, for example, have brought about the invention of video tapes and video discs which make it possible for films hitherto viewed only in cinema halls to be available for private viewing. This has also introduced new censorship problems as obviously it is easier to monitor what is shown in cinemas than what is viewed at home.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video tapes are coming into Singapore in large numbers; some of them are objectionable because of violent or nude scenes while others are outright pornographic. Because of their very compactness, they are easily smuggled in, duplicated and distributed in large numbers. Video libraries have mushroomed, exhibiting and distributing tapes, many of which are either uncensored, objectionable or pornographic. We are a highly urbanized society and in a relatively short time few segments of our population will be left untouched by this media.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of monitoring and controlling what is communicated through video tapes is a world-wide one. We have no model to emulate in dealing with this problem. The Western countries gave up censorship even before the mass advent of video tapes. So they have not even tried to face up to this problem. In other countries like Japan, censorship is voluntary through the Video Tape Ethics Council. The Japanese are far more permissive in their standards than anything we would contemplate. But somehow there is not the same massive erosion of traditional sexual moralities and the family institution in Japan. What gives their society this strength merits more study by us, which we will do. Hence, I would not want to suggest that with the passage of this Bill we would have found a final solution to the problems of the deleterious and destructive values and life-styles that are prone to be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> purveyed through films and video tapes. The matter will continue to be studied and legal and administrative measures will have to be revised in the light of experience and technological developments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot wait until we have a more perfect system to deal with this problem. Something has to be done now, It is with this in mind that we have drafted the Films Bill. This Bill retains, in the main, the provisions of the existing Films Act. The main changes relate to licensing provisions and enhancement of penalties relating to uncensored or pornographic films, tapes and other records. As the provisions are outlined in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill, I shall therefore dwell only on those important provisions which introduce licensing control of the trade and the enhanced penalties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 deals with the requirement for licensing. I have stated before in this House that the video tape distribution and lending business has attracted more than its fair share of crooks and charlatans. For successful supervision of this trade, the close cooperation of the trade is essential. We must evolve a system, over time, which combines Government administrative measures and a large measure of voluntary actions on the part of the trade. To achieve this, we must weed out criminal and irresponsible elements from the trade. Thus the requirement for licensing. Anyone who carries on the business of importing, making, distributing or exhibiting video tapes without a licence or anyone who allows his place to be used by an unlicensed operator will be guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not less than $5,000 but not exceeding $20,000 or to an imprisonment term not exceeding six months or to both fine and imprisonment. All applicants will be screened and conditions will, where necessary, be imposed on the licences issued, and the licensee will be required to furnish a deposit or bank guarantee. If he breaches any of the conditions, his deposit will be forfeited and his licence revoked. The person aggrieved by the forfeiture of his deposit can appeal to the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also enhances the penalties for the exhibition, distribution and possession of uncensored and pornographic tapes. The penalties are on per copy basis. Under clause 21, the penalty for possession, exhibition and distribution of uncensored tapes is a fine of not less than $100 per copy but not exceeding the aggregate of $20,000. For exhibition and distribution, there is also provision for an additional penalty of an imprisonment term not exceeding six months. The penalties are heavier for the possession, exhibition and distribution of pornographic tapes. Under clause 29, the penalties for possession of pornographic tapes are a fine of not less than $500 per copy but not exceeding the aggregate of $20,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding six months or both fine and imprisonment. The penalties for exhibition and distribution of pornographic tapes are higher, being a fine of not less than $1,000 per copy but not exceeding the aggregate of $40,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding two years or both fine and imprisonment. The Bill also provides for the tapes and equipment involved in the commission of offences relating to uncensored or pornographic tapes to be confiscated and destroyed. This should prove to be an effective deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further tighten the control of the trade in video tapes, clause 14 provides that every tape in the possession of any person shall be submitted without any alteration or excision for censorship. This compulsory censorship, however, will not apply to any recordings of local television programmes that are not intended for distribution or public exhibition. It will also not apply to other recordings made by individuals which are not intended for distribution or public exhibition, but such recordings must not be of any feature, commercial, documentary or overseas television film.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 35 (2) the Minister retains the power to exempt any person or film from any provision of this Bill, subject to such conditions as he thinks fit. The exemption can be withdrawn at any time if it is abused.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>5.04 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to strengthen as well as to amend the existing laws relating to the possession, distribution and the exhibition of films. No doubt, it has been prompted by the growing popularity of video tapes as can be seen by clause 2 which now seeks to extend the definition of "film" to include video tapes as well as the latest development, video discs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us in this House are aware of the necessity for this Bill, particularly with the revelation by the Minister in this House earlier this year and again just a while ago that some operators of video libraries are characters of less than desirable standing. Adequate protection must be given to members of the public to ensure that they are protected against those who seek to enrich themselves by catering to baser needs through the distribution of films that contain excessive sex and pornography, As we all know, whenever there is something popular going on, there will always be those who are out to make a fast buck from innocent victims. Those who do their business honestly have nothing to fear on the implementation of this legislation. It is those flyby-night operators that some of the provisions of this legislation is directed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel, however, that this Bill does not provide sufficient protection for members of the public. Some operators of video libraries are still charging subscription fees as well as entrance fees for those who intend to borrow films from them. If their licence is revoked or suspended because they have contravened the Act, the subscribers will lose everything. What I would like to know is whether the security deposit provided for under clause 8 can be used to compensate innocent members of the public who will lose their money if the libraries they subscribe to are forced to close, in the same way as we provide for travellers to be compensated if they are victimized by unscrupulous travel agents.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have another point to raise and this relates to clause 14. Under clause 14, every film must be submitted for censorship. As was reported not long ago, films which have been submitted to the Board of Film Censors take a long time to be censored. There have been instances of films taking up till six months to a year before they are approved. I would like to ask the Minister whether there is now sufficient manpower in the Board of Film Censors to ensure that films are censored quickly.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, I would just like to answer the two points raised by the hon. Member. First, the point relating to deposits. As the Bill is now drafted, it is not intended that the deposit be used to pay off subscribers in the event that the licensee's business is closed. But, as I mentioned earlier, licences will be issued with conditions. In the course of imposing these conditions or drafting these conditions, we will certainly take into account the interests of the subscribers, and I can well envisage a situation where a condition may be imposed requiring a further deposit or some other measure which can lend some protection of the kind that the hon. Member has in mind. But this is something that will have to be studied further.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to the time taken for censorship, I am glad to report that we have recruited additional staff and censorship is now done much more quickly. We will also be introducing administrative procedures whereby training films brought by reputable firms or other institutions may be exempted from censorship or some other procedure may be established which will enable them to take out their films without

  <br>
  <br> any delay. These measures will be taken to expedite the censoring of films.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
