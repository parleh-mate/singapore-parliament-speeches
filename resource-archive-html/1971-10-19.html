<div align="center"><b>(Issue of exemption letters to find employment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

Minister  of  Defence if exemption  permits  can  be

issued  to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



persons who have already registered  for

national  service and have undergone  the  necessary

test  but  have not yet been called  up,  so  as  to

enable them to find employment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this is being done.  Letters  of

exemption from full-time national service are  given

to  persons  who  are not enlisted within  one  year

after  they  are  due for national service  call-up.

These  letters are intended to enable them  to  find

employment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>TELEX SERVICE IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Capacity and efficiency)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for

Communications if he is satisfied with the  capacity

and efficiency of the Telex service in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, because the demand for Telex

service  in  Singapore has grown at  an  accelerated

rate  in recent years (the growth rate for the first

half  of  1971 is 60 per cent on that  of  the  same

period  for  1970) and the fact that  suppliers  for

teleprinter  have not been able to  honour  delivery

dates  last year, I regret to state that  the  Telex

service  at  present  is not as satisfactory  as  we

would want it to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have taken the following steps to

improve  the  situation:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in the middle of

last year, an order was made for 262 Telex machines,

and again in January this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>







year,  another order for 503 Telex machines was made,

thus  making a total of 765 machines on  order  at  a

cost  of  $2.6  million.  As the  present  number  of

applicants for Telex machines who are on the  waiting

list  is  249, subject to the above suppliers meeting

their  delivery dates, we should be able  to  satisfy

the  present demand for Telex machines in full by the

middle of next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, 400 lines of the 1,200-line National

Automatic Telex Exchange, costing $1.96 million, will

be  commissioned into operation this month (October).

The  full  capacity of this exchange will be realised

by the middle of next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a 150-channel automatic International Telex

Exchange has been ordered at a cost of $640,000,  and

should be operational early in 1973.

<div align="center"><b>PORT OF SINGAPORE AUTHORITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Introduction of four-shift system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   whether  the   Port   of   Singapore

Authority  is considering the introduction  of  a  4-shift system for port workers, and whether there will

be sufficient workers to man the shifts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the present

three-shift  system for dock workers in the  Port  of

Singapore  Authority would appear to be  adequate  to

meet  the  requirements  of the  shipping  community,

there is therefore no intention on the part of P.S.A.

to introduce a four-shift system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR MOTOR VEHICLES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications if he will take the necessary measures

to  ensure  that every person applying  for  a  motor

vehicle  licence has a valid policy of  insurance  to

cover  the vehicle for the full period for which  the

licence is to be taken out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank

the  Member  for Kallang for highlighting  a  problem

which  the Registrar of Vehicles has been faced  with

for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that under existing legislation, a

vehicle  owner need produce only an insurance  policy

valid  on the day that he applies to renew the annual

road licence. In some cases, the insurance policy may

expire  or  becomes invalid before the  road  licence

expires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to introduce legislation soon

to  ensure  that vehicle owners do take out insurance

policies which will be valid for the full period  for

which a road licence is applied for. It has not  been

possible  to  do this earlier because of the  immense

problem  of  record  keeping,  which  will  soon   be

resolved  when the Registry of Vehicles  computerises

its records by early 1972.

<div align="center"><b>CRASH PROGRAMME FOR TRAINING RELIEF TEACHERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Education why there is still a large number of relief

teachers, who are untrained, and if his Ministry  is

planning a crash programme to train such teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 1st October, 1971, there were

1,115  relief  teachers, of  whom  246  were  trained

teachers. It is expected that by May 1972,  when  the

next  batch  of teachers graduate from the  Teachers'

Training  College, another 845 trained teachers  will

be  added  to the pool of relief teachers,  replacing

those  who  are untrained. Under these circumstances,

Mr Speaker, Sir, it is unnecessary to conduct a crash

programme to train relief teachers.

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR FAMILIES OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT AIDED SCHOOL STAFF</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for

Education, in view of the taking over of two  British

hospitals, recently, if the Government will consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



extending  medical benefits to the  families  of  the

staff serving in Government-aided schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the medical

benefits   accorded  to  Government   servants   were

extended  to aided school staff with effect from  1st

September,  1970,  it  was announced  that  the  same

medical  benefits would be extended to their families

when  sufficient ward accommodation became available.

Although  the  Ministry  of  Health  has  taken  over

Alexandra   Hospital  and  Sembawang  Hospital,   the

necessary  medical  facilities,  in  particular  ward

accommodation, are not immediately available to  give

a  reasonably  satisfactory service  to  the  persons

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandra Hospital was taken over with effect from

10th September, 1971, and is not fully operational as

yet.  The  present service is limited to medical  and

paediatric cases only. The Surgical, Orthopaedic, and

Obstetrical Units have not yet been established.  The

paying   class  wards  which  will  be  required   to

accommodate  members of the families of aided  school

staff are also not ready yet. The other services will

be  provided  by stages as the relevant equipment  is

purchased  and installed, and structural  alterations

to the building are carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sembawang Hospital is a small hospital with 68 "C"

class  beds.  It has been set aside for  the  use  of

convalescent cases only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, Sir, it is not possible at the

moment  to  extend  the medical benefits  enjoyed  by

aided   school  staff  to  families.  However,   when

Alexandra  Hospital becomes fully operational,  i.e.,

when it is able to provide the full range of services

and  the  structural alterations to the building  are

completed, this matter will again be considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, if at the

moment  the  medical authorities cannot provide  ward

facilities for members of families of those  teachers

who are employed in the aided schools,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



can  they  at  least  provide  them  with  outpatient

services? And if they cannot, why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I believe it would be more

profitable if the Member directed his question to the

Minister for Health.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chua, would you like to answer that

supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, I

think  that matter does not fall within my portfolio,

because  if it is decided that we provide' them  with

outpatient services, then we will provide them.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> May I have your guidance, Mr

Speaker,  Sir? To whom shall I direct my question  if

the  Minister  for Health thinks that  it  does, not

concern him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,. I have said that

as  soon  as  facilities, are available and  since  a

promise   has  been  made,  we  will  extend  medical

benefits  to  the families of aided school  teachers.

But whether the hospitals can undertake operations on

members of their families -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Outpatient services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry. I thought it was

operations.  Sir,  there  are  outpatient  facilities

available all over Singapore, and there is no  reason

why  they  cannot go to the hospitals for  outpatient

treatment.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, for out-patient treatment

they  have got to pay at the moment. The point raised

was, this: as Government servants are accorded  free

outpatient  treatment as well as ward treatment,  why

should  not suck benefits be extended to the families

of aided school teachers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, applications can be made to

the  Ministry of Finance for a waiver of these  fees,

if necessary.

<div align="center"><b>DRUG ADDICTION AMONG STUDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a)  how  serious  is drug addiction  among  students

(secondary  and tertiary) and how many students  were

found  to be involved between 1st January, 1971,  and

the  latest  convenient date; and (b) how  have  they

been dealt with by the authorities concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no known

case   of  drug  addiction  among  secondary   school

students.  However,  the number of  secondary  school

students found to have experimented in the taking  of

drugs is on the increase. Between 1st January and 8th

October  of  this  year, 39 such cases  involving  10

girls  and  29 boys have come to light. The  tertiary

institutions  have  not reported  any  case  of  drug

addiction or drug taking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whenever a student is suspected of

having   taken   drugs,  his  or  her   parents   are

immediately  consulted so that a closer care  can  be

taken  of  the  potential addict  and  the  necessary

advice  and  medical  help  given.  Some  cases   are

referred  to  the  Child  Guidance  `Clinic  of   the

Ministry of Health where trained persons can  counsel

the  students and give therapeutic help if necessary.

But  the main object must be to track down the pusher

of drugs.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore National

several  three-year  "training and  `coaching"  plans

submitted by its affiliates. All sports organisations

have been advised to place special emphasis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



on  the  progressive  training  of  their  particular

branch  of sports in order to raise their proficiency

to  international standards. At the moment, there  is

already  a  scheme for Badminton promotion  involving

seven  different training centres based on the three-year programme with the aim of creating a substantial

corps  of  Badminton  players of  a  reasonably  high

standard  to  be  considered for the  national  team.

These  centres  provide training for  the  youths  in

schools  as well as those who are members  of  sports

organisations and the community centres.

the success of the plans put up by the various sports

controlling bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand with the training given to participants

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj</b> asked the Minister

for  Social Affairs (a) who are the people classified

as   "Fakir  Miskin"  who  are  entitled  to  receive

assistance from the "Fitrah" collected by the  Majlis

Ugama  Islam;  (b) how many Muslims  are  given  this

assistance  and of these how many are also  receiving

Social  Welfare assistance; and (c) what  action  has

been  taken  against Muslims who have not paid  their

"Fitrah" last year and how many are involved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Geylang Serai is aware that the exercise of Fitrah is

a  requirement in the tenets of Islam and  is  now  a

common  feature in many countries with  Muslims.  The

disbursement  of  Fitrah is governed  by  Muslim  law

which  specifically provides for the  definition  and

qualification  for  the Fakirs and  the  Miskins  who

generally  may  be said to be the deserving  and  the

very   deserving   of  the  Muslims  for   collective

financial  assistance by Muslims as a  whole  towards

the  end of Ramadan, the month of the fast. The basis

for  this  in Singapore is determined by  the  Majlis

Ugama   Islam  who  are  also  responsible  for   the

collection  and  distribution of Fitrah.  The  Majlis

Ugama  Islam  applies a means test on applicants  who

claim  to  be  either  Fakir  or  Miskin.  They   are

registered  yearly  with  details  of  their  incomes

before payments are made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, $73,912 was paid out from the Fitrah

Account  to  18,478 Muslims classified  as  Fakir  or

Miskin.  They  were  each  given  $4.00.  It  is  not

possible to ascertain how many of the 18,478  Muslims

who  are  classified  in this category  are  also  on

public assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970 also, a total of 649 Muslims were reported

by  the  Amils as having defaulted in the payment  of

Fitrah. Letters were sent out requesting them to call

for an interview. Investigation revealed that in most

cases  failure  to  pay  was due  to  poor  financial

circumstances. A few claimed preference to pay during

the  last three days of Ramadan but fell ill and were

accordingly  unable  to comply  with  the  law;  some

removed  to  new  addresses and  inquiries  with  the

National Registration Office confirmed they  had  not

reported  changes  of addresses.  Yet  a  few  others

turned up later to make late payments. The figure  of

649  represents only a small fraction  of  defaulters

the  Majlis  Ugama  Islam have  managed  to  act  on.

However,  the  Majlis  are now trying  to  compile  a

register  of Muslims in Singapore, the completion  of

which would assist them greatly in tracking those who

have failed to make Fitrah payments.

<div align="center"><b>REFORMATIVE MEASURES FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>GANJA AND MX PILL USERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj</b> asked the Minister

for  Health what reformative measures are being taken

in respect of ganja and MX pill users.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

uniform opinion on the reformative measures for ganja

and MX pill users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two drugs are not as dangerous as opium,

morphine,  heroin  and other hard drugs  where  users

find  themselves  quickly and  easily  addicted.  The

effects .are physically and mentally destructive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any

drug,  including ganja and MX pills, is bad. Although

these  two  drugs  may not create the  same  physical

dependence  as  morphine or  heroin,  they  create  a

psychological dependence. This occurs in persons with

inadequate  personalities,  making  them  excessively

reliant  on other people, or dependent on the  drugs.

The  taking  of ganja and MX pills can  lead  to  the

taking of the more dangerous drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ganja smoking has a longer history. Not much medical

research  has gone into it. Those that have  come  to

our  attention have been those who have been arrested

or  are  in custody. For those persons in prison,  an

attempt is made to get them to rid themselves of  the

need  to  fall back on smoking ganja. So far we  have

admitted  17  ganja addicts to the St. John's  Island

treatment centre. For the ganja addict, treatment  is

relatively  simple.  At St. John's  Island  they  are

encouraged  to participate in healthy activities  and

to  convince  them  that they need  no  ganja.  `They

participate  in gardening, tailoring,  carpentry  and

fish rearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of MX pill takers is relatively new.

Very  little is known about the long-term effects  of

this drug. MX is the pharmaceutical preparation under

the trade name of "Mandrax" which is a preparation of

methaqualone, which is a mild hypnotic combined  with

an  antihistamine.  It is curious  why  it  has  been

pushed by drug pedals, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



why  it has been so readily accepted by some persons.

It  is not a "mind bending" drug, such as L.S.D., nor

a  stimulant, such as the pep pills. It may be  taken

out of curiosity or because it has got a potentiating

effect  not  known  pharmaceutically.  Whatever   the

reason,  its  use without a doctor's  control  causes

concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few cases that have been brought to the

attention of the clinicians have been cases of  over-dosage.  The  treatment has  been  to  wash  out  the

stomach.  About a dozen patients are  known  to  have

been treated in this way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since prevention is better than cure, the Medical

Department  has been disseminating knowledge  on  the

dangers  of these drugs to various groups  of  people

who deal with young persons. Lectures were given this

year  to  the Samaritans, psychiatric nurses, customs

officers, school health doctors and officers  of  the

Singapore  Command and Staff College, and  to  school

students and other groups of younger people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special clinic has been formed in one of the

Medical   departments  in  the  Outram  Road  General

Hospital where ganja smokers and persons on MX  pills

and  others are treated and counselled. The follow-up

is   undertaken  by  doctors,  almoners   and   other

voluntary  staff. Arrangements have  also  been  made

with   the   Chinese   Y.M.C.A, to   undertake   the

rehabilitation of some of these persons through group

activities.

from  which payments of damages can be made  in  such

cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir.

We  cannot set up a similar fund without raising  the

rates  of  premium  on motor insurance,  which  would

adversely  affect the motoring public.  My  Ministry,

however,  is  considering  whether  the  difficulties

raised  in  the  Member's question  can  be  overcome

<div align="center"><b>TEN PER CENT IMPORT SURCHARGE BY U.S. GOVERNMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Effect on Singapore's industries)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what   significant   impact  has   been   caused   to

Singapore's industries by the imposition  of  the  10

per  cent  import  surcharge  by  the  United  States

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I should perhaps explain briefly

the  nature  of the 10 per cent import surcharge  and

the pattern of our trade with the United States.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10 per cent import surcharge' was imposed by the

American  Government  on  16th  August,  1971,  as  a

temporary  supplemental  duty  and  as  one  of   the

measures  to  cope  with  their  balance  of  payment

difficulties. It is applicable to goods entering  the

United  States  which are already subject  to  import

duty.  Raw  materials and primary produce which  were

not then dutiable' and products which were subject to

import  quotas, such as petroleum and cotton  textile

goods,  are  exempt from the surcharge. In  addition,

for  certain  products assembled from American  parts

and  components, both import duty and  the  surcharge

are  levied  only  on  the  value  added,  i.e.,  the

difference'  between the f.o.b price  (Singapore)  of

the  product and the cost of the American  parts  and

components.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic exports of Singapore to' the U.S.A.

were  $246 million in 1970 and about $148 million  in

the  first half of 1971. Of these, the most important

items  are  electronic and electrical products  which

account for nearly 50 per cent; textile and garments,

20  per cent;, processed rubber, 20 per cent in 1970,

12  per  cent  in  1971; timber  products,  including

plywood  and veneer, 6 per cent; petroleum  products,

1.5  per  cent in 1970, 7 per cent in 1971;  pleasure

craft, 2 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the main Singapore-made exports. As far as

the electronic and electrical products are concerned,

the surcharge falls on the value added. As much of it

is  assembled  from  U.S, parts and  components,  the

effective rate of the surcharge is probably less than

5 per cent. Furthermore, most of these' companies are

selling  to  their  parent companies  in  the  United

States  and  there has been no drop in  demand.  With

regard  to  textiles and garments, those from  cotton

are  subject to quota and therefore exempt  from  the

surcharge. Our export of synthetic textile  products.

to  the United States is quite small and, from recent

press  reports,  would  also, be  exempt.  Petroleum

products and crumb rubber are not dutiable and so not

subject to the surcharge. Plywood and veneer do  have

to pay duty, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



the  demand depends on construction activity  in  the

U.S. If the United States economic measures result in

stimulating  construction  activity,  they  will   be

importing more plywood and veneer and their importers

may have to absorb part of the surcharge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, therefore, the surcharge has not

affected us very much. In some instances, we may have

a     temporary    advantage.    Certain    equipment

manufacturers  such as household  appliances  in  the

United  States  have  been facing severe  competition

from  other industrialised countries. To improve  the

competitive  position of their products made  in  the

United States, they have to import certain parts  and

components  from  us.  With the surcharge,  they  may

increase  sales  which  would thus  lead  to  greater

demand  for  our parts and components. On  the  other

hand,  a  few specific companies here making finished

products  such as pleasure craft which  are  dutiable

may  have  to face some temporary difficu1tes.  They

should,  however,  be  able  to  make  the  necessary

adjustments with a little bit of belt-tightening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, in the short term, we are not seriously

affected, we nevertheless hope that the problem  will

be settled quickly. If it is prolonged, the surcharge

would  distort  international trade  since  the  more

important   question   of   international    currency

adjustments  is  linked to the  import  surcharge.  A

shrinkage  of overall world trade would have  adverse

repercussions  for  us. This would  also  affect  new

investment   necessary   to   sustain   growth    and

modernisation in our economic structure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  of  State  for Finance  mentioned  domestic

exports  to the United States. I would like  to  know

what  is the position of our re-exports to the United

States.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, most of our re-exports are in

the  form  of  primary produce from  the  surrounding

countries and, as I pointed out in my main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



answer, primary produce which is not dutiable is  not

subject to the 10 per cent surcharge.

smoking  sessions.  Checks  and  searches  have  been

conducted on roadside stalls suspected of engaging in

the sale of ganja.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two departments have also intensified raids and

checks  on  drug stores, Chinese medicine  shops  and

roadside stalls reported to be frequented by MX  pill

consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main sources of supply of ganja, are locations

in  the  countries in the' region and are brought  to

Singapore  mainly by sea. In the case  of  MX  pills,

however, they are usually brought into Singapore from

across the causeway through the Woodlands Checkpoint.

Both  the Police and Customs have been' carrying  out

investigations into the' movements and activities  of

local syndicates involved in the trafficking of ganja

and  MX  pills.  They  also search, coastal  vessels

suspected  of  carrying  these  drugs.  Additionally,

preventive sea patrols are maintained round the clock

to detect smuggling of these drugs into the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 1,315 raids were mounted in 1970 and

resulted  in the recovery of 840 pounds of ganja,  14

MX pills and 625 arrests (613 for ganja and 12 for MX pills).  From 1st January to 15th October this  year,

1,007 raids have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



been  carried  out, resulting in the  seizure  of  450

pounds  of ganja, 2,280 MX pills and 420 arrests  (397 for ganja and 23 for MX pills).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs will soon establish a

also  plans to build a capacity to educate the  public

<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the drug menace

in  the Republic `has not reached the danger levels of

America, for instance. However, the Government takes a

very  serious view of the drug problem. It can  easily

get out of control, if left unchecked. There `will  be

more  constant,  persistent  and  thorough  action  to

prevent, detect and suppress the traffic of drugs into

the country and its use by young and old.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



Such  activities will be co-ordinated in  the  Central

Narcotics  Bureau  which is being established  in  the

Ministry of Home Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the activities of the Bureau, there are

plans  to provide (a) surveillance and counselling  in

educational   institutions,  (b)  expansion   of   the

facilities  for treatment and rehabilitation  of  drug

addicts,  and  (c)  formation  of  an  association  of

responsible     persons,    doctors,    psychiatrists,

psychologists,  social  workers,  parents,  etc.,   to

complement  the efforts of the Government in  tackling

this  drug  problem.  People  interested  in  actively

helping  the Central Narcotics Bureau will be  invited

to the inaugural meeting of the association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will be introduced shortly to provide for

enhanced  penalties  for those found  guilty  of  drug

peddling.

reported to the police between 1st January, 1968,  and

30th  September this year. None of the  accidents  was

fatal. The break-down of collisions is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between vehicle and bicycle - four accidents



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between vehicle and vehicle - one accident

between  1st January, 1971, and the latest  convenient

date;   how   many   cases  have   been   dealt   with

such menace.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  from  January to September  this  year

there  were 887 cases of armed robberies, 43 cases  of

murders   and  303  cases  of  criminal  assaults   by

gangsters or thugs. The corresponding figures for  the

same period last year are 590, 47 and 28 respectively.

The   term   "armed   robberies",  however,   includes

robberies  in which simple weapons such as pen  knives

are  used. Fire-arms were used in 78 of the 887  cases

of armed robberies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of cases dealt with successfully by the

police  is 70 for armed robberies, 21 for murders  and

102  for  criminal assaults. The corresponding figures

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PARLIAMENTARY MEMBERSHIP BILL, 1971</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1971</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Law and National Development)</b></div>



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a White Paper on

the  Report  of  the Electoral Boundaries  Delineation

Committee has been presented to Parliament as  Command

21  of 1971. The Government has decided to accept  all

the recommendations with regard to the sub-division of

11  large constituencies and the creation of seven new

constituencies with consequential adjustments to eight

constituencies. The enlargement of six constituencies,

outside   the   central  areas  of  the  city,   whose

electorates  are  lower  than  12,800  has  also  been

accepted.    The   acceptance   of   the   Committee's

recommendation will increase the number  of  electoral

divisions from 58 to 65.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Elections Act (Chapter 50) provides

that  each electoral division shall return one  Member

to  serve in Parliament. The Constitution of Singapore

stipulates a Parliamentary membership of 51  until  it

is   varied   by   law.   In  this   connection,   the

Parliamentary Membership Act, 1967, was introduced  in

Parliament in that year to increase the membership  to

58.  Consequent  to  the  increase  of  the  electoral

divisions to 65, it is necessary again to introduce  a

Bill,  entitled  the  Parliamentary  Membership  Bill,

1971, at the present sitting of Parliament to increase

the  number  of electoral members to Parliament  above

the  present total membership. This increase will come

into  effect  as  from  the  next  general  elections.

However,   for  the  purposes  of  the  next   general

elections,  it  is  necessary  to  publish  a  Gazette

Notification  under  section 8  of  the  Parliamentary

Elections  Act (Chapter 50) specifying the  names  and

boundaries of the 65 revised registers of electors under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



section  10  of the same Act. The  Parliamentary

Membership Bill, 1971, will enable these steps to  be

taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another Bill, entitled the Parliamentary

Elections  (Amendment) Bill, will also be  introduced

at  the present sitting of Parliament. This Bill will

amend the Parliamentary Elections Act (Chapter 50) to

provide  for  the preparation of fresh  registers  of

electors  from  the  registers  maintained   by   the

Commissioner of National Registration and to  include

in  such  registers the names of all entitled persons

who  were, on the 1st day of July, 1971, citizens  of

Singapore and to whom identity cards were issued. The

present  registers of electors were reviewed in  1967

and  since  then  there has been  an  annual  average

increase  of  36,000 electors. By 1st  February  next

year, the number of electors is expected to be in the

region of 951,751. However, the rapid development  of

Housing  and Development Board estates has culminated

in  uneven  distributions of electors, especially  in

the electoral division of Toa Payoh which is expected

by  1972  to have about 70,000 electors, whereas  the

average number of electors per electoral division  is

16,000.  In  this  context, the  fresh  registers  of

electors  prepared according to the revised electoral

boundaries  will  contain more even distributions  of

electors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill

has  become  law,  a  Gazette  Notification  will  be

published to specify the names and boundaries of  the

65 revised electoral divisions.

<div align="center"><b>POLICE JUNIOR OFFICERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(New structure and salary scales)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>3.27p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has been some

speculation about revision of salaries and terms  and

conditions of service for the Police Junior  Officers

arising from the Lee Soo Ann



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



Report.  I should like to state that the Lee Soo  Ann

Committee's  recommendations  with  regard   to   the

structure  and  salary scales for the  Police  Junior

Officers  have  been  accepted in  principle  by  the

Government, and will be implemented in the new fiscal

year on 1stX April, 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new structure, there will be three ranks

of  Constables, Sergeants and Assistant Inspectors to

replace  the  present six ranks.  The  new  ranks  of

Constables  and  Sergeants will be accorded  Division

III   status,   while  the  new  rank  of   Assistant

Inspectors  will  be in Division  II,  thereby  being

eligible'  for  higher rates of  vacation  leave  and

other benefits in their respective enhanced status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new salary scales to be implemented on 1st

April, 1972, will be -

<pre>

    Constable    $170 x l5A - 215/285 x 20A - 425/445 x 20A - 625;



    Sergeant     $385 x 20A - 505/555 x 30A - 765;



    Assistant

      Inspector  $600 x 30A - 690/750 x 35A - 925.

</pre>



<br><br>With these improved salary scales,. Police Junior

Officers will be expected to carry out greater

responsibilities commensurate with their new status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interval between now and 1st April next year,

a  suitable method of' conversion of serving officers

from the' existing salary scales to the new structure

will be worked out. Agreement between my Ministry and

the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  on  the  method  of

conversion  has  not  yet been  reached.  It  is  not

possible to accept the conversions recommended by the

Lee   Soo   Ann   Committee,  partly  because   those

conversions  were  based on the assumption  that  all

allowances  will be abolished. The Ministry  of  Home

Affairs  has, however, made strong representation  to

retain some of these allowances and convert others to

incremental  credits. My Ministry has accepted  this.

Hence,   adjustments   to  the  salary   conversions'

proposed by the Report will be necessary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending implementation of the new salary scales on

1st  April next year and resolution of the method  of

conversion between the Ministries of Home Affairs and

Finance,  it has been decided that the Police  Junior

Officers will be given an interim increase. From next

month,  that is, from the 1st of November, an interim

allowance  of  10  per  cent of their  present  total

emoluments,  excluding  housing  and  public  utility

allowances,  will  be  paid  to  all  serving  Junior

Officers on their present salaries. This means  a  10

per  cent  increase  in  take-home  pay,  salary  and

special  post and education allowances. This  interim

10  per  cent increase will be taken account of  when

converting these officers to the new salary scales on

1st April next year. Payment of this interim increase

is  expected  to cost Government about $2  million  a

year  on  the  basis of the present strength  of  the

Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval in principle of the new salary scales

will  enable the Ministry of Home Affairs to  attract

even  better  qualified  Police  Junior  Officers  in

future  recruitment  exercises, especially  now  that

from  the  next intake of recruits payment for  board

and  lodging  will be waived during their  period  of

training  at  the  Police Academy.  However,  if  any

constable   resigns   within   two   years   of   his

commencement of service, he will have to refund  this

cost.  This  is  one  of the recommendations  of  the

Report which has been accepted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Members may wish to ask questions on

these two Ministerial statements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to ask a  few  questions

relating to the first Ministerial statement. Firstly,

can  the  Minister  for Law and National  Development

elaborate   on  the  delineation  of  the   electoral

boundaries,  and  what are the basic  principles  and

other considerations governing the subdivisions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, after the readjustments to the electoral

boundaries have been made what will be the land area,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



size  of  the  population  and  the  number  of   the

electorate  in  each division? Will  they  be  evenly

spread   out  on  a  pan-island  basis?  Will   these

readjustments serve the people better?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I notice that there has not been much

change  in  the  electoral boundaries  in  the  rural

areas.  In  future, will there be any subdivision  of

electoral divisions in the rural areas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will answer all these questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I would suggest to the Member that he

study  the White Paper in which the reasons  for  the

delineation of these electoral boundaries  have  been

set  out in detail. Reasons have also been given  for

increasing  the electorate population of  some  areas

and decreasing others, the whole object being to have

a more equal distribution of the electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what will happen in the rural areas in the

future,  I  am afraid I do not know. The Member  will

have to wait for the next electoral commission.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are there any questions? If there are

none,  we  proceed with the introduction  of  Government

vested  in  the  Queen's  Harbour  Master  under  the

Admiralty Waters Ordinance. With the British military

pull-out,  it  has  been agreed  that  the  Singapore

portion  of the Admiralty Waters will be handed  back

to  the  control  of the Singapore  Government,  with

effect  from  1st November, 1971. The Government  has

accordingly  decided  that  the  Port  of   Singapore

Authority  should take over the Waters 10  be  handed

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present Workmen's Compensation

Ordinance  was  enacted in 1955, that  is,  about  16

years  ago.  Since  then, we have progressed  from  a

colony depending principally upon entrepot trade  for

our  livelihood to a sovereign and independent nation

with  industrial activities assuming an  increasingly

dominant role in our national economy In striving for

rapid  industrialisation, we  have  encountered  many

problems, including that of a shortage of skilled and

semi-skilled labour, the need to upgrade  the  skills

of  our  workers as well as introducing them  to  new

skills  to  meet  the  demands  of  higher  and  more

sophisticated  technology.  We  are,   however,   not

deterred  by  the  immensity of the problem.  On  the

contrary,  we  have taken various concrete  steps  to

overcome  it. On a short-term basis, we have embarked

upon crash training programmes as well as adopting  a

more  liberal immigration policy to attract the entry

of  foreign skilled labour into Singapore. As a long-term  measure,  we have restructured our  educational

system   so  as  to  give  technical  and  vocational

education   the   proper  emphasis  and   recognition

demanded  by  our  current  industrial  and  economic

policies. We firmly believe that ultimately  we  must

be in a position to supply the skills required by our

own  industries  instead of having to depend  largely

upon immigrant skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it grieves me to say that, despite

the  fact  that  skilled labour is one  of  our  most

important assets, insufficient efforts have been made

to  ensure  that there is no unnecessary  wastage  of

labour   through   accidents.   This   careless   and

irresponsible  attitude is reflected  in  the  upward

trend   in   industrial   accidents.   According   to

statistics compiled by my Ministry, there were  9,682

accidents  reported under the Workmen's  Compensation

Ordinance  for the year 1970 as compared  with  8,714

for  1969, that is, an increase of 11 per  cent.  Of

these,  159 were fatal and 866 resulted in  permanent

disablement  as  against  132  fatal  cases  and  731

permanent disablement cases for 1969. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



a  matter  of  fact,  the total number  of  accidents

reported  under the Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance

has been steadily increasing from 7,850 cases in 1964

to  9,682 for last year. In 1970, a total of  302,800

man-days were lost in factories alone as a result  of

accidents  compared with 202,876  man-days  lost  for

1969.  In terms of workmen's compensation, the amount

paid  in  1970 was $1,611,504, which is approximately

three times the figure for 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, monetary compensation paid out to

workers or their immediate families is only a part of

the  cost  to  the country arising out of  accidents.

There are other costs involved, such as cost of wages

paid  for  working time lost, medical costs borne  by

the employers and the Government, cost of `damage  to

the  premises or machines in the case of fire,  costs

of  education  and vocational or industrial  training

which  could  amount to several millions of  dollars.

Based  on the 1969 rates, it has been estimated  that

the  financial  loss  to the industrial  economy  was

almost $23 million in that year. It can thus be  seen

that,  apart  from  the  sufferings  of  the  persons

concerned as well as the anxiety and hardship  caused

to  members of their immediate family, relatives  and

friends,  industrial  accidents  are  costly  to  the

economy of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, no responsible government can afford to

sit  tight  and  watch  the situation  deteriorating.

Although we cannot completely prevent accidents  from

happening, it is possible, through education  of  the

employers   and   employees,  coupled   with   strict

enforcement  of minimum safety measures and  enhanced

rates of compensation, to arrest the upward trend  of

industrial accidents. The recent promulgation of  the

Building   Operations   and  Works   of   Engineering

Construction Regulations, 1971, is the first of  many

such  safety regulations to be introduced to  provide

safety   guidelines  to  employers   and   employees.

Extensive  amendments to the Factories Act are  being

drafted   to   provide  for  a  higher  standard   of

industrial health and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



safety   and  to  give  more  teeth  to  the  Factory

Inspectorate. The Workmen's Compensation  (Amendment)

Bill will have the effect of compelling the employers

to pay more attention to the safety of their workers,

while at the same time providing a greater amount  of

compensation  to  alleviate the sufferings  of  those

unfortunate victims and their immediate families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main provisions of this amendment Bill are

detailed in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill.  I

would like, however, to draw attention to some of the

more important changes. Firstly, clause 2 of the Bill

seeks  to  amend  the proviso to  subsection  (1)  of

section 2 of the Ordinance and to extend the scope of

the Ordinance to cover non-manual workers who earn up

to  $750  per  month  as against $400  per  month  at

present.  This is a logical sequel to the  Employment

Act,  1968,  which covers all employees,  other  than

those  belonging to certain excepted categories,  who

are earning less than $750 per month. Clause 2 of the

Bill   will  also  bring  all  non-manual  Government

employees earning less than $750 per month within the

ambit  of  the Ordinance, many of them for the  first

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the most important amendment to the

Ordinance   relates  to  the  quantum  of   workmen's

compensation.  I  would  like  to  stress  that   the

Ordinance is an essential piece of legislation  which

assures  the workers that, in the event of  accidents

arising  out of or in the course of employment,  they

or  members  of  their families would be  compensated

financially. The compensation payable is  related  to

the  earning  capacity of the person  concerned.  The

compensation payable under the existing Ordinance has

become  inadequate. When it was fixed  in  1955,  the

average monthly wage of a workman 18 years of age and

above  was $160 as compared with $197 for July  1970.

Although  the  average wage rate has  increased,  the

maximum  compensation  payable has  remained  static.

Besides,  the  purchasing power  of  the  dollar  has

decreased to some extent during this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



period.  In view of this, clause 6 of the  Bill  will

increase  the  maximum compensation prescribed  under

section  8  of  the  Ordinance to three  times  their

present amounts, that is, from $7,200 to $21,600  for

fatal   cases,  from  $9,600  to  $28,800  in   cases

resulting in permanent total incapacity, and from $65

to  $195  for  every  15 days in cases  resulting  in

temporary  incapacity. In order that the  workmen  or

their   dependants  will  in  fact  obtain  increased

compensation,  the multiplying factors for  computing

compensation  have  also  been  raised  considerably.

Moreover, provision is made to ensure that  in  fatal

cases,  the  minimum  amount of compensation  payable

shall not be less than the present maximum of $7,200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the earnings of a workman cannot be

determined, the minimum wages are fixed by section  9

of  the  Ordinance for the purpose of  computing  the

amount   of  compensation.  Clause  7  of  the   Bill

increases these minimum wages from $80 to $120 if the

workman  is  18 years of age and above, from  $65  to

$105  where  he is 16 years and above  but  below  18

years  of age, and from $45 to $90 where he is  below

16  years  of  age.  This amendment will,  therefore,

increase  the  quantum  of compensation  due  to  any

workman so affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, to ensure that the interests of `the workers

are  adequately covered and protected, subsection (1)

of  section 26 `of the Ordinance is being amended  by

clause  15  of  the  Bill to provide  for  compulsory

insurance against the employer's liability under this

Ordinance. However, power is given to the Minister to

exempt employers from this requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the First Schedule to the Ordinance

is  also being amended by clause 17 to provide a more

comprehensive  and definitive list of injuries  which

result in permanent incapacity and to clearly specify

the  corresponding  percentage  of  loss  of  earning

capacity. This amendment will facilitate the task  of

the  medical officers in recommending the quantum  of

award to be given in respect of industrial injuries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important amendment is effected by clause 18

of   the  Bill  which  seeks  to  add  silicosis  and

asbestosis  to  the  list  of  occupational  diseases

specified  in  the Second Schedule to the  Ordinance.

One  immediate  effect  of  this  amendment  is  that

workers  who  are  engaged in  occupations  involving

exposure to asbestos dust or fine particles of silica

generated  by  industrial  processes,  for   example,

granite crushing, sand blasting, kaolin grinding  and

ceramic  works,  will  be eligible  for  compensation

under   the  Ordinance  if,  as  a  result  of  their

occupation,  they contract the disease of  asbestosis

or  silicosis. In this connection, medical boards and

panels  will  be  established  to  determine  matters

relating to medical evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in drafting the Workmen's

Compensation   (Amendment)   Bill,   we   have   also

considered  the views and comments of  the  Singapore

Employers  Federation,  the  National  Trades   Union

Congress, the General Insurance Association  as  well

as  those expressed by Members earlier in this House.

Employers will, as a result, be required to take  out

compulsory  insurance at a higher  premium.  However,

insurance companies will, no doubt, offer rebates for

no accidents or low-accident records and this will be

an incentive to management to provide a healthier and

safer working environment for their employees. Hence,

the  additional premium can be offset in the long run

against  less  accidents,  better  productivity   and

profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment Bill is only one of a

series   of  legislation  to  encourage  more  safety

consciousness among employers and employees. However,

these legislative measures in themselves will not  be

completely effective in reducing industrial accidents

if  the  employers  and employees do  not  co-operate

whole   -heartedly.  Hitherto,  most  employers   and

employees  have paid scant regard to the  safety  and

well-being  of  labour. In their desire  to  maximise

profits,  employers  tend  to  neglect  the  need  to

provide the minimum requirements for safety of  their

workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



Some  unions themselves appear to be preoccupied with

bargaining  for  more  dollars  and  cents   to   the

exclusion  of  safeguarding the lives  and  limbs  of

their  members.  Even  in  the  odd  instances  where

employers  had provided helmets and safety  belts  in

construction  projects and factories,  it  was  found

that  the  workers were not willing to  make  use  of

them, In our urgent drive to industrialise rapidly to

provide  jobs  for  the unemployed whose  number  was

augmented by those retrenched from the British bases,

and, in the long run, to build up a strong and viable

economy  capable  of self-sustaining  growth  thereby

ensuring  a rising standard of living, the Government

has  had  to be content with what rudimentary devices

the employers are prepared to install.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be said that some loss in human assets is

inevitable     irs    the    present     stage     of

industrialisation. Nonetheless, the number of serious

accidents  is  unnecessarily high, particularly  when

about  the  only  valuable asset  we  have  is  human

resources. I would therefore urge both employers  and

employees to be more safety conscious and exert  more

discipline  in  ensuring that safety regulations  are

scrupulously observed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

while  I  rise  to support the Workmen's Compensation

(Amendment)  Bill,  I must say that  I  have  certain

reservations  about  it. In  so  far  as  it  confers

increased  benefits  on workers  who  may  have  been

incapacitated in one way or another as  a  result  of

accidents  arising out of or in the course  of  their

employment,  the  provisions  of  the  Bill  are,  of

course,  to  be welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the amendments

to the Workmen's Compensation Act as proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Bill can be divided into  three  main

categories



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Raising of the salary ceiling for non-manual

workers to come within the ambit of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Tripling the maximum amount of compensation

payable under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Compulsory insurance by employers against

liabilities under the Act unless it is waived  by

the Minister.



<br><br>The   first  principal  category  of  amendments   is

presumably  to  bring the Workmen's Compensation  Act

into  line  with the Employment Act (Chapter  123  of 1970 Edition) and the other associated  legislation.

I,  however,  must comment that the  raising  of  the

salary   ceiling  for  non-manual  workers  is   more

apparent than real. It should be noted that the class

of  non-manual workers who earn a salary of  $400  at

the  time  when  the Workmen's Compensation  Act  was

first  brought  into operation in 1954  may  possibly

correspond to a class of non-manual workers earning a

salary higher than $750 per month at present in  view

of  the  rise  in  the  general wage  level  and  the

decrease  in  the real value or purchasing  power  of

money during the intervening period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the proposals relating to the triple

increase in the rates of monetary compensation  under

the Act, I wholeheartedly agree that such increase is

timely  if  not  long  overdue.  The  principal  Act,

however,  contains certain anomalies which, far  from

being  dealt  with, are being propagated without  the

slightest  alteration  or  rectification  under   the

proposed  Bill. I shall be touching on this point  in

greater detail later on in my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of compulsory insurance by

employers against their liabilities under the Act, it

makes a welcome change from the prevailing provision.

Under the prevailing provisions of the Act, it is not

obligatory for any employer to insure himself against

his liabilities under the Act. Under the Bill, it  is

proposed that an employer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



should  be compelled to insure himself unless  he  is

exempted  by the Minister. Presumably the  Government

will exempt itself. While I shall be touching more on

this  point  later  on, for the  present  I  wish  to

comment  that  it  would  be desirable  if  the  Bill

indicates, at least generally, the basis on which the

Minister may exempt an employer from the requirements

of compulsory insurance under the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the specific provisions of the Bill, I wish

to  direct the attention of Members of this House  to

clause 4 which seeks to amend section 4 of the Act by

deleting  section 5 thereof and replacing it  with  a

new  provision. On the face of it, the amendment does

not  seem  to  involve any fundamental principle  and

appears  to be of little practical significance.  But

there  are  two points which should be considered  by

this  House before approving the amendment now  under

reference.  One  point is that  while  the  amendment

seeks   to   reduce  the  period   under   which   no

compensation  is  payable under  the  Act  from  four

consecutive  days  to  three  consecutive  days,  the

amendment   also  abolishes  the  saving  clause   in

relation   to  such  period.  Under  the   prevailing

provision  of  the Act, the period of four  days  for

which no compensation is payable is clarified by  the

condition  whether  the total  period  of  incapacity

exceeds  14  days  or  not. But  under  the  proposed

amendment  the  period of three days is  an  absolute

period for which no compensation is payable. In other

words,  a  worker  would  not  be  entitled  to   any

compensation  for  the  first  three  days   of   his

incapacity,  irrespective  of  whether  he   may   be

ultimately incapacitated for a period of 14  days  or

more.  I  have always been under the impression  that

the  intention  of  including  the  provision  of  an

initial  period for which no compensation is payable,

together  with  a  saving clause,  is  apparently  to

prevent  any  possible abuse of  the  provision.  The

proposed   amendment,  by  excluding  the  qualifying

condition, takes on a punitive character in  relation

to workers. The Government may have strong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



reasons for putting forward such an amendment. It may

well   be  that  by  reason  of  the  provision   for

compulsory  insurance it may not be  administratively

convenient or practical to include the first few days

of any period of incapacity for the purpose of paying

compensation under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proposing the amendment, it may be also possible

that   the   Government   is   influenced   by    the

consideration  that  it  may be  more  practical  for

workers  as  well  as their respective  employers  to

treat the initial first few days of any incapacity as

sick leave under the Employment Act. This leads me to

the  other  point  which  I  wish  to  bring  to  the

attention  of  Members of this House. There  are  two

main  considerations  to  note  in  respect  of   the

understanding  that  workers can utilise  their  sick

leave  benefit in relation to the first few  days  of

any  period of incapacity. One consideration is  that

unless a collective agreement expressly provides  for

such  period  of  incapacity to be  treated  as  sick

leave, an employer may raise difficulty when a worker

wishes  to claim such period as sick leave.  Even  if

such  a  defect  in  a collective  agreement  can  be

remedied  in  respect of all organised  workers,  the

fact  remains that the vast majority of  workers  are

not  organised and, therefore, cannot claim  to  have

the  benefit  of  any collective agreement.  The  net

result  is  that it is more likely that  workers  may

have  to bear the full cost of the first few days  of

incapacity  rather than the employers  by  reason  of

such  a  provision  as proposed under  the  Bill.  I,

therefore,  suggest that if the Government  considers

it  necessary to have such an amendment to subsection

(5) of section 4 of the Act, then it is only fair and

reasonable  that the initial first few  days  of  any

incapacity should be treated as sick leave under  the

provisions of the Employment Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill, by amending section 8 of the

Act  and  thereby  trebling  the  maximum  amount  of

compensation  payable thereunder, has  attracted  the

most  comments  from  the  public.  The  comments  of

workers on the proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



amendment are favourable and so are `the comments  of

most   employers,   apart  from  the   few   die-hard

exceptions.  I do not believe that any  sane  person,

whether  inside or outside this House,  would  grudge

the increase in the amount of compensation to be paid

to  a workman or his dependant's in the event of  his

death  or  incapacity within the ambit  of  the  Act.

Under  the proposed subsection (2) of section 8,  the

amount  of  maximum benefit payable to the dependants

of  a workman who died is $21,600 as compared to  the

existing  maximum of $7,200. In subsection  (3),  the

amount  of  compensation payable  to  a  workman  who

suffers  permanent total incapacity is a  maximum  of

$28,800  or, if he is incapable as well of performing

the  essential actions of life by himself, a  maximum

of $36,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned, however, that the basis of computing

compensation under the proposed section  8  may  give

rise  to  anomalies which may in turn result  in  the

dependants  of the deceased workman being better  off

than those of a permanently and totally incapacitated

workman.  Comparing, for instance,  the  compensation

payable  under the proposed subsection  (2)  (a)  (i)

with  that payable under the proposed subsection  (3)

(a),  on the basis of the stipulated minimum wage  of

$120  per month for a worker who is 18 years  of  age

and  above,  it  would appear that  the  compensation

payable  under the proposed subsection  (2)  (a)  (i)

would  amount  to 72 x 120 or $8,640,  and  that  the

compensation payable under subsection (3)  (a)  would

equal to 60 x 120 or $7,200. It has been the practice

for  any  court of law to award higher damages  to  a

workman  incapacitated by injury  resulting  from  an

accident than to the dependants of a deceased person.

The basis for such practice is that the person who is

injured  but  survives would logically  have  greater

suffering and would be likely to incur more  expenses

by  way  of  his own maintenance than the person  who

died  as  the  result of the accident. Such  practice

seems to have been adopted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



by the Government because the maximum benefit payable

on  the  death  of a worker is $21,600 as  stated  in

subsection (2), and the maximum compensation  payable

to   an  injured  worker  is  $28,800  as  stated  in

subsection (3). On the basis of a workman earning the

minimum  wage of $120 a month, the dependants  of  an

injured   workman  who  is  unable  to  perform   the

essential  actions  of  life  without  the   constant

attention  of  another  person,  however,  the  total

compensation  payable  on the  basis  of  60  months'

earnings will amount to 75 x 120 or $9,000, which  is

barely  $500  more  than  the  sum  awarded  to   the

dependants   of  a  deceased  workman.   Insufficient

consideration seems to have been given  to  the  fact

that  a permanently and totally incapacitated worker,

though able to perform the essential actions of  life

without  the  constant attention of  another  person,

poses  a  continuing and additional burden  upon  his

dependants, which would not have been the case if  he

had  died  instead of being permanently  and  totally

incapacitated.  Such calculation may  be  branded  as

being  callous and unduly cynical, but  the  fact  is

that  we are a pragmatic people living in a pragmatic

society.  To  my  mind, the persons  responsible  for

drafting  the  proposed amendment  to  the  Workmen's

Compensation  Act  seem to have contented  themselves

with   merely   trebling  the  various   amounts   of

compensation  payable under the Act and  leaving  the

infrastructure  of the Act untouched.  For  instance,

under   the  proposed  subsection  (3),  a  necessary

distinction seems to have been made as to  whether  a

worker  is  over or under the age of 16 or 18  years.

The  fact that such distinction is contained  in  the

present  Act is not sufficient justification for  its

reproduction in the Bill. I would have thought that a

proper  distinction  should  have  been  made  as  to

whether  the incapacitated worker has any  dependants

or not. 1 would therefore suggest that subsection (3)

of  section 8 of the Act should be amended to provide

for  the payment of compensation to a workman who  is

incapacitated  but  who has no dependants  a  sum  of

$28,800



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



or  equal to 108 months' earnings, whichever  is  the

less,  and  the payment of compensation to a  workman

who is incapacitated and who has dependants `a sum of

$36,000  or equal to 135 `months' earnings, whichever

is the less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of clause 15 of the Bill amending

section  26  of  the  Act to provide  for  compulsory

insurance  by an employer of his liability under  the

Act  is  in  the general interest of the  worker  for

whose  protection such a provision is intended. While

I  appreciate  the  move by the `Government  in  this

direction,  I  am  of  the  view  that  it   is   not

sufficiently  effective. For instance,  the  proposed

subsection  (2)  and `subsection (3)  of  section  26

contain  provisions  prohibiting  any  avoidance   or

evasion  by  an employer of his liability  under  the

Act.  The Act is not sufficiently comprehensive.  The

whole  provision of subsection (2) of section  26  as

stated   in  the  Bill  revolves  around   the   word

"deduction" in relation to the earnings of a  worker.

But to my mind if an unscrupulous employer desires to

evade  `this particular provision, he would not  have

been  so foolish as to deduct from `the wages of  his

workers the premium payable under an insurance  cover

in  respect of his liability under the Act. With  his

absolute  prerogative  to hire  and  fire  under  the

Industrial  Relations  Act,  it  would  have  been  a

relatively  simple matter for an employer to  dismiss

his   workers  and  offer  them  re-employment   with

slightly lower salaries. It should be noted that most

manual  workers in the construction industry,  which

often  hits  the headlines with fatal accidents,  are

employed or paid on a daily-rated basis. It would  be

perfectly legitimate for an employer to pay a wage of

$10  a  day  before  the introduction  of  compulsory

insurance under the Workmen's Compensation Act and to

offer  a  wage of $9 a day to a worker  under  a  new

contract  the  day  after `the introduction  of  such

provision  for compulsory insurance. Even  if  it  is

possible  `for  the  Government  to  succeed  in  its

prosecution  of such an employer under `the  proposed

section  26  as presently worded, it would  be  scant

consolation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



to  a  worker  who has been previously dismissed  for

objecting to an attempt by his employer to  so  avoid

his liabilities under the Act, that such employer  is

convicted for so contravening the Act. I suggest  the

phrase  "or  any  reduction off" should  be  included

after the phrase "any reduction from". As it is,  the

proposed  provision  contains  a  sufficiently  large

enough loophole for a bulldozer to plough through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 of the Bill gives effect to a long overdue

amendment  of  the First Schedule  to  the  Act.  The

proposed    First   Schedule   is   generally    more

comprehensive  than the existing  Schedule.  I  feel,

however,  that  in  making  such  an  amendment   the

Government has not gone as far as it should  have  in

revising  the  scope  of  the  First  Schedule.   Not

sufficient consideration seems to have been given  to

the  circumstance  that  a  person  ordinarily  makes

greater  use  of  one hand than  the  other.  In  the

proposed   Schedule  as  well  as  in  the   existing

Schedule, the computation of loss of earning capacity

is  based  on  the  assumption that every  person  is

ambidextrous, that is, has equal facility or  agility

in  the  use of either hand or arm. I am of the  view

that  in  all cases of permanent incapacity involving

the loss of an arm or a hand, a distinction should be

made  whether  it  is  an arm  or  a  hand  that  i's

habitually used or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed Schedule the quantum of

incapacity  in relation to the loss of a hand  or  an

arm  appears  to  be  determined  by  the  degree  of

reduction  in  earning capacity in  every  employment

which the injured worker was able to undertake at the

time   of   the  accident  and  which  requires   the

indiscriminate use of both arms and hands. Where  the

range  of  employment open to the injured  worker  at

`the time of accident is such as to enable him to use

one  hand or arm more than the other or in preference

to the other, the reduction in earning capacity ought

to  depend  on  whether  the  hand  or  arm  lost  is

habitually  used  or  not. Moreover,  the  older  the

injured  worker the harder it would  be  for  him  to

adjust to the loss of an arm or hand habitually  used

whether for the purpose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



of  working  or performing the essential  actions  of

life.  On  the  basis of my comment, I  suggest  that

items  No. 8 to 20 in the proposed Schedule  relating

to  the  computation of loss of earning  capacity  in

respect of an arm or a hand should be amended to take

into  consideration whether such arm or hand lost  is

one which is habitually used by the worker affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further comment I wish to make iii regard to the

First  Schedule to the Workmen's Compensation Act  is

that  the  injuries  which are deemed  to  result  in

permanent incapacity as listed therein seem to be  of

a  purely  physical character without any  exception.

The  Bill itself does not envisage any change in  the

nature of the contents of such First Schedule,  apart

from  the  revision  of  the percentage  of  loss  of

earning  capacity in relation to the listed injuries.

In fact, the basic assumption runs throughout the Act

that  any  injury resulting in permanent Or temporary

incapacity   must  be  of  a  physical  nature.   Yet

increasing cognisance has been taken in certain parts

of   the   world  of  the  possibility  of  a  worker

sustaining mental illness or injury in the course  of

his  employment resulting in permanent  or  temporary

incapacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main difficulty of or objection to including

mental  illness  within the scope  of  any  workmen's

compensation legislation lies in the fact `that, with

our  present level of knowledge, the etiology of  any

mental  illness may give rise to a controversy  which

cannot be satisfactorily resolved. One way of cutting

the  Gordian knot of mental illness is to  adopt  the

ratio decidendi of the United States Court of Appeals

in  the District of Columbia which has ruled that the

onus is for an employer to disprove, rather than  for

an  employee  to  prove, a causal connection  between

employment  and  disability in  the  case  of  mental

illness  related  to the job. If  such  a  basis  for

bringing mental illness within the ambit of workmen's

compensation legislation is accepted in Singapore, it

would mean that a worker need only prove that his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



mental  illness is caused by work to collect whatever

benefits are payable under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members in this House may be of the view that

such  sophisticated development of  the  concept  and

practice of workmen's compensation is a luxury  which

Singapore cannot afford in the present stage  of  its

industrial  development. While it is  true  that  the

inclusion of injuries of a mental character  for  the

purpose  of determining incapacity under the Act  may

introduce  a  whole  wide range of complexities  with

their  accompanying confusion, I am of the view  that

this  House  should take note of the  need  to  bring

mental illness within the ambit of the Act some  time

in  the  not  too distant future. It is already  `the

prevalent view of a section of the medical profession

in  Singapore that the gathering momentum of economic

development  has brought about with it an  increasing

tempo of life and a heightening of social tension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hardly qualified or in any position to comment

any  further  on the various medical aspects  of  the

problem of relating mental illness to the purpose  of

the Workmen's Compensation Act. But I sincerely think

that  it is a matter that the Government should  look

into, not merely for the sake of the workers but also

on  account  of  the  possible repercussion  of  `the

problem  of mental illness on the further development

of   Singapore.  Perhaps  the  proposed   Board   for

occupational illnesses and diseases may  be  directed

to look into this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have so far dealt with the specific provisions of

the  Bill  amending  the Workmen's Compensation  Act.

While  the  Bill is most commendable in its intention

and  attempt  to revise the Act and bring  it  up  to

date, it is to be regretted that no attempt has  been

made to revise the basis or scope of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "compensation" seems to have given rise to

the  impression that whatever compensation or benefit

that   is   to  be  conferred  under  the  Act   must

necessarily  be monetary. I am inclined to  the  view

that the purpose of any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



such Act is not merely to provide for the payment  of

monetary  compensation to workers who  have  suffered

injury or accident arising out of or in the course of

their  employment,  but also  to  compensate  in  any

manner  for  the loss of or reduction in the  working

capacity of such injured person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis of the Act is actually directed at the

loss   of   working  capacity,  whether  totally   or

partially,  and  whether permanently or  temporarily.

And  such loss of working capacity is related to  the

range of employment open to the injured worker at the

time   of  the  accident.  The  payment  of  monetary

compensation  is  only one of the  means,  granted  a

convenient  and  practical  method  of  helping   the

injured  worker to adjust to the loss of or reduction

in   his   working  capacity.  While   such   payment

undoubtedly  serves to compensate the injured  worker

and  his  depend-ants for the loss of wages, it  does

not  in  any  way  prevent or minimise  the  loss  to

society   of   skilled  manpower  through  industrial

accidents or even the demoralising effect of enforced

idleness upon the injured workers themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent publicity given to the need for providing

sufficient   employment  opportunities  for   persons

suffering  from various physical disabilities  serves

to  underline  the  fact that  disabled  persons  can

perform  useful  and constructive  functions  in  the

`society in which they live, provided they are  given

the  opportunities  compatible  with  their  physical

condition.  What has prevented such disabled  persons

from  obtaining gainful employment in the  past,  and

even today, is not the fear of the potential employer

that  the  disabled persons are not able  to  justify

whatever salaries or wages are paid to them  but  the

irrational  prejudice  of  employers  to  equate  any

physical  disability with the total loss  of  earning

capacity. If it is accepted that disabled persons who

have  no  previous  experience of gainful  employment

deserve    reasonable   opportunities   of    gainful

employment, then it should be beyond any question  of

doubt that an incapacitated worker who has not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



only  previous  experience of gainful employment  but

also  varying  degrees of skill or  experience  in  a

specific  field of employment, should be  accorded  a

reasonable  opportunity  of  continuing  any  gainful

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore suggest that the compensation for

the  loss  of  earning  or working  capacity  through

industrial accidents should be made on the  basis  of

the rehabilitation of the injured workers as well  as

`the payment of monetary benefit to such workers  and

their  dependants.  Similarly, provisions  should  be

included in the Act, as far as it is consistent  with

the scope of the Act, to prevent or minimise the loss

of  working  capacity  through industrial  accidents.

Under  the  Act  as  it  stands at  present,  medical

examination is prescribed only after the workers have

suffered injuries. I am of the view that, taking into

consideration the provision for compulsory  insurance

under  the  Act  and the nature of  the  occupational

diseases  or  injuries  as  set  out  in  the  Second

Schedule  thereto,  it  may  be  desirable   that   a

provision  be  included for the yearly or  periodical

medical  examination of workers  at  the  expense  of

their   employers  for  the  purpose  of   preventing

unnecessary injury and facilitating the determination

of  the  nature  of the degree of the injury  in  the

event of an accident occurring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be desirable, in conjunction with any

scheme for compulsory and regular medical examination

of  workers  at  the expense of their  employers,  to

require any employer to provide workers who are found

unfit  for  regular employment as a  result  of  such

medical   examination  with  lighter  or  alternative

duties  within  the  means  and  capability  of   the

employer. Otherwise such a scheme for compulsory  and

regular medical examination of workers would turn out

to  be  more  of  a  curse than a blessing,  as  some

employers  may  prefer to take the easy  way  out  by

callously  dismissing workers who  are  found  to  be

medically unfit for their usual employment.

<br><br>4.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b>Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the Bill in principle. The

provisions of this Bill provide for desirable

amendments to the Workmen's Compensation Act,

particularly those amendments regarding the maximum

amount of benefits variously obtainable under the

Act. I find it necessary to seek clarification in

respect of some of the proposed amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3 of the Bill, among the various

amendments  proposed therein, the new  definition  of

"earnings" is worded to include "overtime payments or

other  special  remuneration for work done"  for  the

purpose  of computing the compensation payable  to  a

workman  under  the  Act in the event  of  injury  or

death.  Such  overtime payments and other  allowances

are qualified by the phrase "if of constant character

or   for   work  habitually  performed".  While   the

provision  contained in this definition of "earnings"

appears to be reasonably clear as to the intention of

this legislation to provide for an equitable basis of

computing the compensation payable to a worker in the

event  of an industrial accident, it is not so  clear

as  to  how  to determine the basis in a satisfactory

manner.   As  a  trade  unionist,  it  has  been   my

experience  that overtime payments and other  similar

allowances may be of a constant character or for work

habitually performed, but the actual amount  of  such

overtime payments or allowances may greatly vary from

month  to month, from week to week, or even from  day

to  day. The indication in the Bill seems to be  that

such  overtime  payments  or  allowances  should   be

determined  in  respect  of  the  period  immediately

preceding   the   industrial   accident   for   which

compensation is payable under the Act. The difficulty

is that it is not clear whether such period should be

the last few years, the last few months, the last few

weeks,  or  the  last few days before the  industrial

accident. The importance of having a standard  period

for  the  computation of earnings for the purpose  of

quantifying  the  compensation  properly  payable  is

unquestionable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



in  those  cases  where  the   amount   of

compensation  to be paid is below the  maximum  limit

specified by this Bill. Thus, if earnings are  to  be

computed   on   the   basis  of  a  worker's   total'

remuneration  during  the last  month  preceding  his

industrial  accident,  the'  amount  of  compensation

determined  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of

section  8 of the Act may vary by as much as  20  per

cent,  depending  on  the actual amount  of  overtime

payments or other' allowances he received during that

last  month.  Thus an anomalous situation  may  arise

where two workers, receiving the same amount of wages

and normally the same amount of overtime payments  or

other   allowances,  may  actually   receive   widely

different  amounts of compensation for the same  type

and  degree of incapacity, simply because during  the

last  month  preceding  their  respective  industrial

accidents   one  worker  might  have  received   more

overtime payments or other allowances than the other-worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that some formula or other

guideline  be  incorporated into  the  definition  of

"earnings"  for  the-purpose  of  standardising   the

computation of overtime payments or other  allowances

for   the  purpose  of  determining  the  amount   of

compensation properly payable under the Act.  In  the

absence  of  such formula or guideline,  there  is  a

possibility that the proposed basis of computing such

earnings  may  give  rise  to  misunderstanding   and

friction  between  the workers  concerned  and  their

respective employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the same clause 3 of the Bill, a new

definition of "employer" is proposed in place of  the

existing   definition.   The   new   definition    is

substantially   a   reproduction  of   the   existing

definition  and  seems to be mainly dictated  by  the

need  to  provide  for  the radical  changes  in  the

political  situation of Singapore since the enactment

of  the  Act  more than a decade ago.  It  is  to  be

regretted that the opportunity has not been taken  to

widen the scope of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



the definition of "employer" in relation to the phrase

appearing therein, i.e.:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"where the services of a workman are temporarily

lent  or  let on hire to another person by the  person

with  whom the workman has entered into a contract  of

service or apprenticeship".



<br><br>The  situation covered by this phrase applies  to  the

practice  of  contract or subcontract  for  labour  as

prevailing  in the Republic. Such a phrase  would  not

conceivably cover a situation where a person may enter

into a contract for services in contradistinction to a

contract of service on his own behalf or on behalf  of

a group of other persons. The reason, as I see it, for

making a principal liable under the Act in respect  of

the  employees  of  a contractor or  subcontractor  of

labour   is   that,  in  the  event  of  the   insurer

disclaiming liability under the Act, the principal  is

more  likely  to  be  a  person  or  organisation   of

substantial  means  with  the necessary  capacity  for

giving  effect to the provisions of the Act  governing

the payment of compensation thereunder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposal to make it compulsory for an

employer to insure against liability under the Act, it

is  likely  for an unscrupulous person or organisation

employing  contract  labour to attempt  to  evade  the

application of the Act after the coming into operation

thereof  by  converting all contracts of service  into

contracts for services. It may well be argued that the

contractor or subcontractor for labour may be a person

or  organisation of sufficiently substantial means  to

be   able  to  give  satisfactory  discharge  to   his

liabilities under the Act. My point is that as long as

there  is a possibility of evading the application  of

the  Act by converting the contract of service into  a

contract for services, the evasion of the applications

of  the  Act  may have disastrous consequences  for  a

worker  injured  in  an  industrial  accident  if  the

contractor who is deemed to be the employer under  the

Act  is  a  man of straw and fails for one  reason  or

other  to  have  a valid insurance cover  against  his

liabilities under the Act. I will be dealing with this

in greater detail when I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



comment  upon  the  provisions of the  Bill  regarding

compulsory  insurance.  For  the  present  I  wish  to

emphasise  that  the prosecution of  an  employer  for

contravention  of the Act will in no way  resolve  the

question  of payment of compensation properly  payable

under the Act to a workman who has been injured in  an

industrial accident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 15 of the Bill, by repealing

the  existing  section 26 of the Act and replacing  it

with  the new provision, introduces a significant  and

vital element to the Act. Under the existing Act there

is  no  obligation for an employer to  insure  himself

against  his liabilities under the Act. The result  is

that  the tragedy of the' worker who had an industrial

accident is possibly compounded by the further tragedy

of   his  inability  to  obtain  any  compensation  as

provided  for under the Act by reason of his  employer

being  uninsured and being incapable  of  meeting  his

liabilities under the Act. The proposed provision  for

compulsory  insurance  by  the  employer  against  his

liabilities  under  this  Act  is,  therefore,    very

commendable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, however, certain doubts about this particular

provision  which I hope the Minister will be  able  to

clarify  for  me. It is very well to provide  for  the

punishment   of   an  employer  who  contravenes   the

provisions of compulsory insurance in any manner.  But

what this Act has failed to make clear is the position

of  the  workers of an employer who has been convicted

of  such  contravention of the Act. The situation  may

arise  where  an employer, either through  wilful  and

deliberate action or negligent omission on his part to

insure, has sufficient cause to disclaim liability for

the  payment of full or any compensation to an injured

worker  under  the  Act by reason of  his  failure  to

comply  with any of the conditions in the contract  of

insurance  covering his liability  under  the  Act.  A

likely cause for such a situation would be an instance

in inaccurate declaration by an employer of the actual

number  of  employees  for the  purpose  of  insurance

coverage. Should one of his employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



subsequently meet with an industrial accident and  be

entitled  to  claim compensation under the  Act,  the

insurer  concerned may very well claim  that  as  the

employer  has made a fraudulent declaration  for  the

purpose  of paying less insurance premium than  would

otherwise   be  payable  by  him,  the  insurer   can

accordingly  exercise  the  right  to  disclaim   any

liability under the insurance contract as a result of

such  a  wrongful  disclosure by the employer.  While

there  is  some controversy about the correctness  of

the  judicial  precedent  for  the  doctrine  that  a

contract  of  insurance should be treated differently

from  any other contract on the ground that full  and

frank  disclosure of any relevant particulars  is  an

essential element for the validity of the contract of

insurance,  there can be no doubt that,  as  the  law

stands  at  present, any failure of  an  employer  to

comply  strictly  with  any  of  the  conditions   of

contract  of  insurance  would  have  the  effect  of

invalidating  such  a contract. The  tragedy  of  the

subsequent  invalidation of a contract of  insurance,

as  I  have said earlier, lies in the effect  on  the

claim  of  an injured worker to whatever compensation

is payable under the Act. If the employer is a person

or  an  organisation of substantial means,  not  much

harm  would have resulted from the disclaimer by  the

insurer  of his liability under the Act. But  if  the

employer  is  not in such a fortunate  position,  the

plight of the injured worker, needless to say,  would

be  beyond any legal or legitimate recourse. If there

are  any  doubts whether the nightmare I am  painting

may  not  be over-exaggerated, I need only call  your

attention,   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  to  the   identical

situation arising in the event of a traffic  accident

where  the  relevant insurer disclaims all  liability

for the action of the party solely or principally  to

be  blamed for the action. Over the years there  have

been several cases where the victims, after obtaining

judgment  for  the injuries arising  from  accidents,

find that there are no ways



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



or   means  of  enforcing  the  judgment,  since  the

relevant insurers have disclaimed liability  and  the

judgment  debtors  are  persons  of  straw.  I  have,

however,  been given to understand that all insurance

companies have voluntarily formed a pool for  meeting

the   claims  of  third  parties  who  have  suffered

injuries  as a result of any culpable act by  persons

in  respect  of  whom  the respective  insurers  have

disclaimed liability. While it is true that a similar

pool  may  be  organised by insurers to  meet  claims

under the Workmen's Compensation Act in the event  of

any  individual  insurer disclaiming liability  under

the  Act by reason of any breach of contract or faith

by  the  respective  clients,  I  think  it  is  more

desirable that there should be a provision to require

an  insurer to be primarily responsible for the claim

of the injured workman under the Act and subsequently

to  recover the money paid out under such claim  from

the  defaulting employer. It is pointless to  provide

compensation in respect of the death or injury  of  a

worker as a result of an industrial accident when  at

the  same  time  the  Act makes it  possible  for  an

insurer to disclaim any liability for the payment  of

such compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental purpose, as I see it, of making it

compulsory  for  an  employer to insure  against  his

liability  under  the  Act is  to  ensure  that  such

compensation would be paid, as the insurer would  be,

by  reason  of  the  nature of  his  business,  in  a

comparably better and stronger position to effect the

discharge  of  liability  under  the  Act  than   any

employer.  For  those employers who  are  persons  or

organisations of substantial means and who  are  able

to  meet  their  liability under the  Act,  there  is

provision  for the Minister to exempt them  from  the

provisions  of compulsory insurance. Such  being  the

case,  I sincerely think that it is advisable that  a

provision should he incorporated into the Act to  the

effect that any question of any breach of contract or

faith by any employer should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



a  matter to be resolved between the insurer and  the

employer  concerned, and should not  operate  in  any

manner that would justify the withholding of or delay

in  the  payment of compensation to an injured worker

under the Act.



<br><br>4.50p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

gives me satisfaction to rise in support of the  Bill

as I am among those in the House who have pressed for

an  upward  revision  in  the workmen's  compensation

benefit  over  the  past few years.  Apart  from  the

increase  in monetary benefits, the Bill incorporates

a  number of fresh features. One of these is that  it

is  now  a compulsory requirement for an employer  to

insure his liability under the Act. To my mind,  this

is  an  important  safeguard,  as  has  already  been

pointed out by the two Members who spoke before me. I

have  personally  come  across  at  least  two  cases

recently  in  my constituency where, because  of  the

absence  of insurance, the dependants of the deceased

workmen  were left without any compensation,  as  the

employers were apparently men of straw and were in no

position to honour their statutory obligation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the provision in the Bill as regards

insurance leaves much to be desired in so far as  the

safeguarding of the workmen's interest is  concerned.

This  has already been pointed out by the Member  for

Toa  Payoh, it  is  not  clear  whether  it  is  the

intention of clause 15 to require employers to insure

their liability under the common law also. As you are

aware,  an  injured workman has the right  of  option

either  to claim for statutory benefit or take action

against  his  employer  under the  common  law  where

negligence  can be proved against the  employer.  The

Bill  also  does  not provide any  safeguard  to  the

injured  parties  when  either because  of  defective

insurance arrangements or other reasons liability  is

repudiated by an insurer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it is, to my mind, essential that a

central fund be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



established by all the insurers - the suggestion  has

already  been made by the Member for Toa Payoh  -  to

ensure  that all claims falling within the  scope  of

the  Act,  but which for technical reasons cannot  be

paid  tinder an insurance policy, are met out of  the

fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are unscrupulous insurers, and there are also

unscrupulous  legal  practitioners.  Quite  often  in

exercising  their  rights under the  law  to  recover

compensation,  it becomes necessary for  the  injured

workmen  to  enlist  the help of lawyers.  When  this

happens,  the expenses involved are often costly.  In

cases  where  unscrupulous  legal  practitioners  are

involved  -  some of them have come to  be  known  as

"ambulance  chasers"  -  the  payment  of   fees   is

calculated  on  what is called the "No  cure  no  pay

basis".  In  successful cases, the fees  payable  can

come  to  as much as 40 to 50 per cent of the quantum

of  compensation  recovered, leaving only  negligible

amounts   for  the  poor  dependants.  Sir,  evidence

against  such malpractices is unfortunately  hard  to

come  by,  but  its existence is common knowledge.  I

think the Bar Council have been trying their best  to

prevent  this malpractice, but so far they  have  not

been   particularly  successful.   To   prevent   the

exploitation  of  our  workers by  such  unscrupulous

parties,  I  urge  that our Legal Aid  Bureau  should

consider   the   setting  up  of  a   separate   unit

specialising in the handling of all such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, whilst the increase in the quantum of

compensation  is  a  necessary step,  it  is  only  a

negative  way  of looking after the  welfare  of  our

workers. There is only one positive approach and that

is  for  all  interested parties, be they  employers,

workers  or  the  Government, to work  hand  in  hand

toward a higher standard of accident prevention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully agree with the amendment Bill which undoubtedly

is  a  progressive piece of legislation.  This  is  a

Government  measure  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the

workers. In this respect, it is necessary. Many of my

colleagues  in this House and I have all  along  been

paying  much  attention to the problem of  industrial

accidents. Over the past few years we have urged  the

Government to adopt more effective measures to reduce

the  number of industrial accidents. One of the  main

provisions  in the Bill is the provision to  increase

the  rate  of  compensation. This will  be  an  added

benefit  to  the  victims and the  members  of  their

families. They can henceforth be better looked after.

However, what is more important is that we should try

to  devise methods by which industrial accidents  can

be  prevented.  That is to say, we  should  urge  all

employers  to  provide  adequate  safety  precautions

either  in  the  factories or at the building  sites.

There should also be an adequate number of inspectors

to  go round and inspect the sites. If they find that

the  safety  precautions there are inadequate  or  if

anything  is  amiss, they should  then  instruct  the

employer  concerned to take measures  to  remedy  the

situation  so that the lives of the workers  will  be

safeguarded and tragedy is thereby prevented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a worker dies as a result of an industrial

accident, it will be a tragedy not only to his family

-causing members of his family to be derelicts -  but

it will also be a loss tX our country. At the present

stage  of  our industrialisation programme,  we  need

young   and  capable  workers  who  can  make   their

contributions. At the moment we are short of  labour.

We  are  now  allowing thousands  of  labourers  from

neighbouring countries to enter Singapore. So  if  we

can  safeguard the lives of our own workers, we  will

he contributing not only to their welfare hut also to

our country's welfare.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of our contract system. As we

know,  many  large  contractors  have  subcontractors

working under them. If there is no adequate provision

in  our  laws regulating the relationship  among  the

contractors, the subcontractors and the workers, then

once  an industrial accident happens to a worker,  it

would  be  difficult  for him  to  get  any  adequate

compensation unless we implement a scheme whereby all

contractors are registered to ensure that victims  of

industrial accidents are adequately compensated. Sir,

I hope the Minister will look into this suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to give some views on  the

Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill.  In view  of

the  increase  in  the  number of  accidents  in  the

industrial  sector,  the  construction  industry  and

other  fields  in  recent years, the  amendment  Bill

provides  for  an increase in the maximum  amount  of

compensation from $7,200 to $21,600, which is  treble

the original amount of compensation. Judging from the

present  standard of living, this amount  of  $21,600

cannot be said to be not a considerable sum of money.

Therefore,  I  am in full support of  this  amendment

Bill.  However, Sir, everybody hopes to  be  able  to

work  in safety and to be able to enjoy his full span

of life without any mishap. Nobody wants to encounter

any  mishap  in  order to claim  compensation.  If  a

workman  is  seriously disabled and  also  loses  his

sight,  even  the  increased amount  of  compensation

would not adequately compensate him. Therefore, I  am

of  the  opinion  that  though the  increase  in  the

quantum  of compensation is one aspect of the matter,

the  more  important  point  is  to  try  to  prevent

industrial accidents or reduce their number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics given by the Minister who

spoke  about the increase in the number of industrial

accidents  without informing us of  the  measures  to

remedy the situation, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



feel   that  there  is  some  defect  in  the  Bill.

According  to the statistical report, in 1970  there

were  9,682  cases of industrial accidents.  In  the

first  seven months of this year, there have already

been  5,966  cases of industrial accidents.  Judging

from  this trend, by the end of this year the number

may  well exceed 10,000. If there are no appropriate

safety  measures  to  prevent  this  situation  from

developing  further,  then every  year  we  will  be

losing tens of thousands of workers in this way.  If

this trend were to continue, then after eight or  10

years many of our factories might have to close down

because  of  the acute shortage of skilled  workers.

The   Social  Welfare  Department  and   our   other

resources might also be heavily taxed because of the

increase in the number of disabled persons. This can

be  said  to  be  a  great burden  on  our  country.

Industrial  accidents  will  affect  not  only   our

national   economic  life,  but  also   our   social

security. To provide for safeguards for our  workers

and   to  maintain  our  continued  prosperity   and

national progress, we should take active measures to

prevent  or  to  reduce  the  number  of  industrial

accidents. This is the basic solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now actively promoting `the policy of

rapid industrialisation. We are also engaged in full-scale  urban  renewal schemes, and, in  the  private

sector,  the  building industry is also  prospering.

All this indicates prosperity and progress. However,

it cannot be denied that this also has brought about

many  more  industrial  accidents.  This  is  mainly

because  many  businessmen  in  the  industrial  and

commercial  sectors, in order to meet  the  pressing

needs  of  the hour, resort to economising on  their

budgets   and   instituting   makeshift   provisions

wherever  possible, and neglect  to  provide  safety

measures  for  their workers. In addition  to  this,

there is a shortage of skilled workers, thus leading

to   frequent  industrial  accidents.  I  think  the

immediate  need  is to enforce stringent  provisions

stipulating   that   all  factories   and   building

contractors should provide adequate safety  measures

and facilities for their workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



And  the  Government should send out  inspectors  to

make  regular checks. Furthermore, there  should  be

active  training of technical personnel to  shoulder

the  task  of  supervision. Only with this  sort  of

precautionary measures may we reduce, if not  avoid,

industrial  accidents. If we do not  take  immediate

measures to provide for stringent measures to reduce

the  numerous dangers faced by the workers-hut allow

industrial  accidents to happen now  and  then,  our

country will suffer great losses. As we all know, we

do  not  have any natural resources and the  capital

for   nation   building  is  not   just   our   good

geographical position. Our main asset is  our  human

resources and our wisdom. So we should try  to  make

full  use of our human resources and use our  wisdom

well  to  treasure, preserve and protect our limited

human  resources.  Only then  can  our  country  and

society continue to progress and prosper.



<br><br>5.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much

cheered  by  the keen interest shown by  Members  on

this  subject  of workmen's compensation.  When  the

time comes for action to be taken against the people

concerned, 1 can be assured of their support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criticism of the Member for Paya Lebar is that

I  dwelt  mainly on the quantum of compensation  and

not   on  the  basic  issue  of  industrial  safety.

However,  I  wish  to remind him  that  we  are  now

dealing  with the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment)

Bill and not the Factories Act. But as I pointed out

earlier,  I  am  proposing  to  introduce  extensive

amendments  to  the  Factories  Act  and,  when  the

amendment  Bill is ready, I am sure the  Member  for

Paya Lebar will have another opportunity to air  his

views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the various points raised by

the  Members for Kallang, Toa Payoh and Jalan  Kayu.

As  I  pointed  out earlier, the proposed  Workmen's

Compensation (Amendment) Bill was circulated to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



National Trades Union Congress for its comments. Some

of   its   suggestions   have   been   accepted   and

incorporated  in  the present amendment  Bill,  while

others  for  various reasons have not been  accepted.

And  what Members have raised today refers mainly  to

those suggestions that have not been accepted by  the

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point has been made that in clause 6 - section 8

(3) (a) - anomalies may arise and the dependants of a

deceased  workman may be better off than those  of  a

permanently  and  totally  incapacitated  workman.  I

think Members have been informed that to prevent this

from  happening, we have decided that  a  proviso  be

added  to  section  8  (3) (a)  which  will  read  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where permanent total incapacity results from the

injury, the amount of compensation shall be -



<pre>

  (a) in  the case of a workman who is eighteen years

      of age and above at the time of the accident, a

      lump sum of twenty-eight thousand eight hundred

      dollars  or  equal  to sixty months'  earnings,

      whichever is the less:



      Provided   that  the  amount  of   compensation

      payable  shall not be less than the  amount  to

      which   his  dependants,  assuming  that   such

      dependants  exist, would be entitled  if  death

      had resulted from the injury.'

</pre>



<br>I think this will take care of the Member's concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has also been made of clause 15 relating to

amendment  of section 26 (2) of the Act.  We  do  not

think  there  is  a  need to amend  this  section  as

proposed, because any workman who thinks that he  has

been  dismissed after objecting to an attempt by  his

employer  to  avoid  liability  could  be  adequately

looked  after  by  invoking  the  provisions  of  the

Industrial  Relations  Act, in particular  subsection

(2) of section 35 thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has also been made of clause 17 relating to

the  amendment  to  the First Schedule  of  the  Act.

Again.  I  think we cannot agree that the  amount  of

compensation payable to cases of hand injuries should

be governed by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



the  consideration  whether the  hand  is  habitually

used.  The reasons are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The adoption of a single

scale  makes for smooth administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In all occupations, workers are required to use and do use

both   their  hands,  although  there  may  be   some

difference in the degree of such use between one hand

and the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be very difficult in practice to determine

which  hand  is more habitually used than the  other,

and   disputes   are   bound  to   arise   over   the

interpretation of what is meant by "habitually used".

It  will  be better if we leave this matter to  those

who are more qualified. For example, medical officers

can  prescribe a higher percentage of award in favour

of  the  worker. In any case, the suggested amendment

can  only  benefit a few workers who are employed  in

occupations  where there is clear evidence  that  one

hand is more habitually used than the other. I do not

think that at this stage it is necessary to make that

kind of amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang has suggested that there

should be yearly medical examinations. First of  all,

I  cannot see in what way yearly medical examinations

can   prevent  accidents  from  happening.  Accidents

simply  happen,  whether the  workmen  are  medically

examined  yearly  or not. What is needed  is  a  more

concerted effort to instil safety consciousness  into

the  workers  and the employers. Medical examinations

can   be  useful  only  in  certain  industries,  for

example, the petroleum and chemical industries, where

occupational diseases can be detected in their  early

stages. The provision of yearly or periodical medical

examinations   is  feasible  only   in   the   bigger

industries   or  establishments.  The   reasons   are

obvious.  Not all employers can afford to offer  such

facilities to their workmen and occupational diseases

are not found in all industries.

Several Members have dwelt on the point of compulsory

insurance  and  have expressed the fear  that  it  is

possible that the insurance companies may disclaim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



their liability because of some fault  in  the

insurance  policy  taken  up  by  the  employer.  The

Workmen's  Compensation Act has been in force  for  a

number  of years and, to my knowledge, no cases  have

yet  been reported of insurance companies disclaiming

their  liability. Nevertheless, the  point  has  been

made  and we will keep that in mind. Should cases  of

this nature happen, we shall reconsider the provision

of compulsory insurance and take appropriate steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pointed out earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir,

legislative  measures  alone cannot  bring  down  the

number  of  industrial  accidents,  unless  there  is

strict   enforcement   of   the   law   and   greater

consciousness  of industrial safety  among  employers

and  employees. In this respect, 1 think the National

Trades  Union  Congress and the Singapore  Employers'

Federation   as   well   as   other   public-spirited

individuals  can play a part in promoting  industrial

safety by giving the subject more publicity, so  that

the losses both to the economy of the country and the

workers  can  be better appreciated. As  far  as  the

Labour Ministry is concerned, there is no doubt  that

the  Factory Inspectorate, as it is now, is not  only

understaffed  but  also  inexperienced.   Take,   for

instance,  the  construction  industry.  It  has  the

highest  number of fatal accident cases, and  yet  in

our  Factory Inspectorate there is not a single civil

engineer. We have, instead, mechanical engineers.  To

bring  down  the  rate  of industrial  accidents  may

require  effort  on  the  part  of  everybody  -  the

Government, the employers and the employees. When the

Factories Act has been tightened up and strengthened,

we  will  carry out an industrial safety campaign  to

drive the lesson home, and follow it up thereafter by

strict enforcement.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I could

hardly  agree  more  with the Minister  that  medical

examinations would not prevent industrial  accidents,

but  what  I  did  suggest was  that  if  there  were

periodical medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



examinations - whether yearly, biyearly or  bi-yearly

there   could   be  early  detection  of   industrial

diseases. That was my suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise is that the

Minister has not yet answered whether he would  agree

to  widen  the  scope  of workmen's  compensation  to

include  mental  illnesses  which  are  caused  by  a

person's employment. The Minister is silent about it.

I am not sure whether he is avoiding the issue now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise is that at the

present moment the Workmen's Compensation Section  in

the  Ministry of Labour deals only with claims.  When

insurance  is introduced, it will have to see  to  it

that  employers  do really insure their  workers.  In

this case, the Workmen's Compensation Section must be

strengthened.  The  Factory  Inspectorate  has   been

strengthened. So I hope the Minister for Labour  will

not forget to look into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I certainly agree

with  the  Member  for  Kallang  that  the  Workmen's

Compensation  Section should be  strengthened.  I  am

sure that when this matter comes up before this House

again  in the next budget, we can get the support  of

the Member for Kallang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, about the mental cases I think that

requires further consideration and consultation  with

the  medical authorities. I am not saying that I will

not  agree  to include mental illness in  the  Second

Schedule,  but I think this subject requires  further

consideration before a decision is made.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the

Minister  will  also  see to it  that  the  Workmen's

Compensation  Section in the Ministry  of  Labour  is

headed  by  someone  who is more qualified.  Now  the

section deals only with claims, its functions will be

broadened  and  definitely we need a  man  of  higher

calibre  to  look after this section.  I  assure  the

Minister that I will raise this subject again at  the

right time during the budget debate if it is not done

between now and then.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Workmen's Compensation

Section  works  in the dark. 1 know  of  cases  where

workers  do not know why they were or why  they  were

not given compensation. Therefore, there should be  a

Workmen's Compensation Board on which the workers can

be  represented at hearings, inquiries and so  on.  I

hope   the  Minister  will  not  forget  about  this.

Everything is in the dark!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the last

suggestion  is a good one and I certainly  will  take

note  of it. I cannot agree with the Member more that

the  Workmen's Compensation Section should be staffed

by more qualified people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>TOKYO CONVENTION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to enable Singapore to

implement  the  Tokyo  Convention  which  deals  with

offences   committed  on  board  aircraft.  Singapore

accepted the Convention in March 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Tokyo Convention covers acts which

jeopardize the safety of an aircraft or of persons or

property  therein or which jeopardize good order  and

discipline  on  board.  The Convention  requires  any

member  State in which a hijacked aircraft lands  to,

firstly, take appropriate measures to return  control

of  the aircraft, crew and passengers to the aircraft

commander,  and, secondly, permit onward movement  of

the aircraft,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>





crew and passengers as soon as practicable. Under the

Convention  the  State  iii  which  the  aircraft  is

registered  can exercise jurisdiction  over  offences

and acts committed on board the aircraft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a civil aviation centre and with a view to

deterring  aircraft  hijacking, it  is  obvious  that

Singapore  should  take appropriate measures  against

all  kinds  of unlawful acts over civil  aircraft  in

flight.  Accession  to the Convention,  while  not  a

complete solution to hijacking, will help reduce some

of the risks which result from such acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential features of the Bill may be summarised

as follows. The criminal law of Singapore is extended

to acts and omissions taking place on board Singapore-controlled   aircraft   while   in   flight   outside

Singapore. Courts in Singapore will have power to try

offences  committed  on board a  Singapore-controlled

aircraft in flight outside Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill gives wide powers to the commander of an

aircraft to deal with persons who commit or are about

to  commit offences on board the aircraft. There  are

provisions which deal with the taking of evidence  in

connection  with  offences  committed  on  board   an

aircraft.   The   Minister  is  empowered   to   make

regulations  for carrying out the provisions  of  the

Tokyo Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.--[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK OF SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in September last year I

announced that Government had decided to convert  the

Post Office Savings Bank into a statutory corporation

to  give  the Bank greater freedom of action  and  to

provide  more  efficient service to its  half-million

depositors. This Bill seeks to convert the Bank  into

a statutory corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of being an independent statutory

board  are  obvious.  Management  will  have  greater

flexibility in administration, recruitment of  staff,

business operations and promotional programmes.  With

financial   autonomy  the  Bank  will  be   able   to

demonstrate its effectiveness. Calculations show that

the  Bank  can  be self-supporting and  viable  as  a

statutory corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now summarise the principal provisions of the

Bill.  The  main objects of the Bank are  to  provide

means  for  the  deposit of savings and  to  mobilise

domestic savings for public development. The Bank  is

empowered  to  operate time deposit accounts  and  to

lend money to its depositors, vide clauses 5 (a)  and

(b) of the Bill. These are new facilities and will no

doubt be welcomed by the depositors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of the Bank will be vested in a Board

of  Directors  consisting of between five  and  eight

members,  all of whom, including its Chairman,  shall

be appointed by the Minister. There is also provision

under  clause  17 for the appointment  of  a  General

Manager who shall be the chief executive of the Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point is that Government will continue

to  guarantee the repayment of deposits and interest.

This  is  provided for in clause 26.  The  public  is

therefore  assured  of complete  security  for  their

deposits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision for the creation of a general

reserve  fund  from the Bank's surplus revenues.  The

Bank may also invest in such stocks and securities as

the  Minister  for Finance may, from  time  to  time,

approve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude with a

brief review of the past



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



and  future prospects of the Bank. When we took  over

control  of the Bank from Kuala Lumpur in 1966,  five

years ago, there were only 250,000 depositors and $37

million in deposits. As at 30th September this  year,

there  were  548,492 depositors  and  the  amount  of

deposits   was  $85.83  million.  Credit   for   this

excellent   achievement  must  go  to  the   Advisory

Committee appointed in 1968, to the staff, and to the

strong  support from the public, including our school

children. I must add that the interest of 4 per  cent

will  continue  to be exempt from income  tax!  I  am

confident    that,   as   an   autonomous   statutory

corporation, the Post Office Savings Bank will become

an  even  greater financial institution  than  it  is

today,  and  I  have no doubt that  the  public  will

continue to give their fullest support to the Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I welcome the amendment Bill. The Post Office Savings

Bank  of  Singapore  has  played  a  great  part   in

mobilising   domestic  savings  among   the   public,

particularly in promoting the saving habit among  the

school  children  in Singapore. As a  result  of  the

various incentives offered by the Post Office Savings

Bank,  considerable interest among our  students  has

been stimulated. The number of students participating

in  the Savings Bank programme has increased over the

years.   Cultivating  the  saving  habit  among   our

children  and young citizens is a great step forward.

In this connection, I would like to mention a case in

point. Last year a competition for the highest number

of  new depositors with the Post Office Savings  Bank

was  held  among our school children.  The  Mm  Chung

School (Naval Base Public Chinese School), which is a

primary school in my constituency, has a small school

enrolment  but it won the competition.  This  is,  of

course, a credit to Sembawang constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has stated just now

that  the aim of this Bill is to make the Post Office

Savings Bank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



financially  viable and autonomous and this  move  to

convert  it into a statutory body will make  it  more

effective  and  efficient. It is also  my  hope  that

after  its  conversion into a corporation,  the  Post

Office   Savings  Bank  will  be  capable  of  better

performance,   particularly  in  promoting   domestic

savings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the Post Office Savings

Bank  has been giving encouragement to depositors  by

way  of  allowing  those with $500  or  more  in  the

savings bank to take part in lucky draws. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  principle this is a good way  to  encourage

saving among members of the public so that they  will

put  more  money into the Post Office  Savings  Bank.

However, in respect of the detailed workings  of  the

lucky   draw,   I  feel  that  there  is   room   for

improvement.  This lucky draw has been  so  organised

that  a  depositor must personally collect the coupon

from  the Post Office Savings Bank. In my view,  this

will   cause   considerable  inconvenience   to   the

depositors,  particularly those who are absent-minded

or  who are too busy to go and collect the coupon.  I

would, therefore, like to suggest to the Minister  to

organise  a better system for the lucky draw,  if  at

all a lucky draw is to be held next year. That is  to

say,  let those with $500 or more in the savings bank

be  given a coupon automatically to take part in  the

lucky  draw  instead of their having  to  collect  it

personally.  In this way, all those who are  eligible

will  be  able to participate in the lucky  draw.  By

having  coupons sent to them by post, they will  thus

have the opportunity to take part in a lucky draw. If

Members  of  Parliament do take part  in  this  lucky

draw, they will have an opportunity to win a prize!



<br><br>6.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that

the  Member for Sembawang has spoken in full  support

of  the  decision to convert the Post Office  Savings

Bank  into  a statutory corporation. He has suggested

that  if  there are going to be lucky  draws  in  the

future,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



then  the  depositors  need  not  personally  present

themselves  at  the post office to  get  the  lottery

tickets. I must assume that the Member has not as yet

participated in the lucky draw, because if he had, he

would  have known the reason why a depositor  has  to

make  a personal application. It is because the staff

will have to see that the particular person does have

at  least $500 in the Post Office Savings Bank.  When

issuing  the lottery ticket, the staff will stamp  on

the  pass book itself that such and such a lucky draw

ticket  has been given to the depositor. That is  the

reason  why it is necessary for a depositor  to  call

personally  and present his passbook.  Therefore,  it

will  not  be  possible really to send a  lucky  draw

ticket by post and for the depositor to receive it at

the  other end without his having to turn up  at  the

post office himself. I can assure him that there will

be  lucky  draws  for 1972 and we do  hope  that  the

Member  for  Sembawang will be one of the  depositors

who  will qualify for the lucky draw tickets and thus

win a prize!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Complex at Kallang at present

under  construction,  when  completed,  will  provide

comprehensive   facilities   for   a    variety    of

requirements    of    international    games     with

sophistication   and  standards   required   of   the

Olympics. Situated in a general recreational area  in

the heart of the city



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>







and adjacent to the sea, the complex will provide for

a  main  open-air stadium for track and field  events

which will, in the first instance, accommodate 50,000

with   provision   for  extension   up   to   100,000

spectators,  two covered stadium for  indoor  sports,

with   one   for  8,000  and  the  other  for   4,000

spectators, swimming pools and tennis courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of the complex was first mooted in 1964,

but the actual construction started only in 1968. The

main  stadium will be completed towards  the  end  of

1972  and will constitute the first phase. The  other

features  of  the complex will be the  second  phase,

preliminary work on which has begun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design and construction of the first phase has

been done entirely by the Public Works Department  in

Singapore  and  a  Singapore contractor.  The  second

phase  is being undertaken by Messrs Kenzo Tange  and

Urtec,  headed  by the world-renowned  architect  and

planner,  Professor  Tange.  The  whole  complex   is

expected  to be completed by early 1975. The  complex

is  located on State land. Constructional  costs  are

expected to be in the region of S$60 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main and covered stadium, essentially catering

for sports, will be multipurpose. The main stadium is

also  planned  to  be used for parades,  rallies  and

concerts. The covered stadium will also be  used  for

exhibitions,  forums,  etc.,  besides  a  variety  of

indoor sports requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third phase will be the development of

facilities  in  the  vicinity for multi-storeyed  car

parks and a mass transportation system to provide for

easier  and quicker access to the complex from  other

parts of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main stadium will also provide for reception and

refreshment   areas,  especially  shopping   arcades,

offices  for sports organisations, accommodation  for

centralised  training  and indoor  sports  facilities

like mini golf, driving ranges, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally intended that the National Sports

Promotion  Board  would also be responsible  for  the

Kallang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



Sports  Complex.  However, since the  Board  will  be

preoccupied  with  its many and varied  functions  to

actually  promote  and develop sports  standards  and

popularity  in  Singapore, it is now considered  that

the  Sports  Complex at Kallang should be  separately

and  efficiently managed, as far as possible,  as  an

economically   viable  concept.   It   is,   however,

essential to ensure that not only are the stadium and

related facilities utilised, but also that they  will

fully  help  in the promotion of sports. There  will,

therefore,  be  necessity  for  correlation  and  co-ordination  of  the policies of the  National  Sports

Promotion  Board  and  the proposed  National  Sports

Corporation  to  see that, as far as  possible,  they

complement each other in the best interests of sports

promotion  in Singapore. In fact, it is the intention

to  provide  that  a  member of the  National  Sports

Promotion Board will serve on the Board of Management

of the proposed National Stadium Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Stadium Corporation will look after all

the  facilities  in  the National Sports  Complex  at

Kallang.  The  monies required for their  realisation

will,  in the first instance, be obtained from grants

made  by Singapore Pools (Private) Limited from their

annual  profits. However, if and when this source  of

financing  is  not adequate, it will be possible  for

the  Corporation to obtain loans on a  long-term  and

low-interest basis from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the Minister to appoint eight

persons  to  form  the  Corporation.  They  will   be

assisted  in  their  day-to-day  operations   by   an

executive staff. The members of the Corporation  will

be  required to prepare and execute proposals for the

construction and management of the main  stadium  and

other  stadium and sports facilities in  the  Kallang

Sports Complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In furtherance of this objective, the Bill provides

for  the  Corporation to enter into contracts,  raise

funds, receive donations and contributions and  other

forms  of aid from all lawful sources, and to  borrow

money  either  from the Government or  other  sources

approved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Minister.  The Bill also  provides  for  the

establishment of a National Stadium Fund  which  will

consist of the subventions, donations, loans,  grants

and  contributions mentioned above,  and  limits  the

disbursement of such monies solely for the purpose of

making   payments  in  or  in  connection  with   the

performance of its functions, powers and duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is also required to submit to the

Minister  for  consideration and approval  an  annual

budget   containing  estimates  of  its  income   and

expenditure  for  the  ensuing  financial  year.  The

approved  budget  will have to be  published  in  the

Gazette and the Corporation will be bound by  it.  By

31st  October of each year, the Corporation  is  also

required  to  submit a statement of accounts  to  the

Minister.  The Minister is also empowered to  appoint

an  auditor  to audit the Corporation's accounts  and

the  auditor  is required to submit a report  of  his

audit to the Corporation as well as to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also allows the Minister to give directions

to  the  Corporation as to its functions as he thinks

fit  and he may also empower the Corporation to  make

regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is exempted from the payment of

stamp  duty and income tax and gifts to the fund  are

exempted from income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  ancient times, athletic sports  have  been  an

important   item  of  activities.  Today,   countries

throughout  the world, whether big or  small,  attach

great importance to sports and are actively promoting

them  so  that  they have become even  more  popular.

Especially  in this fast-changing society where  life

is both busy and tense, sports have an important role

to  play in promoting health and harmonizing the mind

and the body. In addition to this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



sports   also   play  an  important   role   in   the

international  political arena.  They  are  the  main

bridge  to  the promotion of international friendship

and understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been very active in promoting and

popularising  sports activities.  Particularly  today

when  we  are  an  independent, sovereign  and  young

developing  country,  we have  been  behind  none  in

sports  activities.  This  is  in  keeping  with  our

foreign  policy  of  "Making more friends  and  fewer

enemies",  so as to establish friendship and  promote

good  relations with other countries.  On  the  other

hand, the great majority of our population is made up

of  youths who are our future successors and who must

have  the  prerequisites  of  health  and  ruggedness

before   they   can  shoulder  the  heavy   task   of

nationhood. Therefore, in order to meet  the  aim  of

our  Government to build a rugged "Society, a big and

well-equipped national stadium is necessary.  Equally

important is the need to set up a Corporation to take

full charge of the planning, building and managing of

such  a big sports complex. Therefore, I welcome  the

presentation of this Bill. However, I would  like  to

give two points of view for consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as revealed by the authorities concerned,

the National Sports Complex is quite a large complex;

hence the cost of its maintenance and operation  will

also  be  considerable. In clause  15  of  the  Bill,

Singapore Pools (Private) Limited and grants  in  aid

of  the  Government are included as among the sources

of   finance.  I  would  like  to  stress  here   the

importance  of Government financial aids.  Otherwise,

the  Sports Complex will be like the National Theatre

and  be  faced with the same problem. Because without

Government  aid, the National Theatre,  in  order  to

survive on a "self-supporting" basis, has to  seek  a

solution  by  living on rentals and hire  fees,  thus

meeting with diverse difficulties while promoting art

in  our country. In this way, civic art organisations

are also not benefited. What we are worried about  is

that  if  there is no Government financial  aid,  the

National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



Stadium  Corporation,  in order  to  meet  the  large

amount  of  recurrent expenditure, will similarly  be

forced  to obtain money from civic organisations  and

spectators  in  the  last resort.  Then  it  will  be

contrary  to  the  high ideal and  aim  of  promoting

sports in our country by building the National Sports

Stadium Complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with Government's active encouragement and

promotional efforts, sports activities in our country

can  be said to be quite vigorous. However, it is sad

to  note that the existing number of sports fields is

rather  inadequate. Some of these are even on private

property.  Even when the National Sports  Complex  is

completed, these existing grounds still deserve to be

preserved  and utilized. Therefore, I hope  that  the

authorities   concerned  will,   wherever   possible,

preserve  these existing sports grounds and,  at  the

same time, for the safety of the users and members of

the  public, try to make the owners of these  grounds

improve the safety precautions therein.



<br><br>6.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

express my full support for this Bill. The setting up

of  the  National Sports Complex will provide perfect

facilities  for sports in our country.  The  National

Stadium  Corporation  is  given  the  main  task   of

managing  and administering the Sports Complex.  This

is a very important task. Undoubtedly, the setting up

of  the  National Stadium symbolises  the  fact  that

sports  in Singapore have entered a new era and  have

marched  a  step  forward. It is a milestone  in  our

sports  history. According to the Minister, a sum  of

$60 million will be involved in the setting up of the

National Sports Complex. This is a huge sum of money.

Since  we have mobilised such a large amount of money

and have put out efforts to build a sports complex, I

hope  we  will  have  better  means  of  raising  the

standard  of  our  sports and  also  of  popularising

sports  among our people so that they may be stronger

and more healthy and so serve our country better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill sets out the functions of the National

Stadium  Corporation, one of which is  to  raise  the

standard of sports in our country. In this respect, I

am   of  the  view  that  we  should  pay  particular

attention to the following two tasks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is about the setting up of a sports fund.

As  we  all know, in the past few years we have  been

very active in sports. We have tried our best to take

part  in  various  regional and international  sports

tournaments.  However, the common  problem  faced  by

people  in  sports circles is the raising  of  funds.

Therefore, whenever a tournament is to be held  on  a

large  scale,  it is necessary for people  in  sports

circles to try their best to raise funds to meet  the

expenditure. I remember some members of our  national

teams were not given the opportunity to take part  in

international  or  regional sports meets  because  of

lack  of funds. Therefore, we must try to get  enough

money for the sports fund so as to be able to develop

sports  in  our country. I hope the Corporation  will

pay  special  attention to the  question  of  raising

funds   to  supplement  the  National  Stadium  Fund,

whether  from  Government  or  other  sources.   With

adequate  funds,  we  will  be  able  to  train   our

sportsmen and sportswomen so that they can compete in

the  international and regional sports arena and also

raise our standard of sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Corporation should

also  pay  attention  to  the provision  of  engaging

capable sports coaches in all fields and have regular

periods of training for our national teams. Only with

planned  and  regulated training programmes  can  our

national  teams hope to win any laurels or prizes  in

international or regional competitions and  to  bring

glory to our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will pay attention to these two

points.



<br><br>6.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

connection  with  Phase  II of  the  National  Sports

Complex in Kallang Park, I wish to ask the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



Minister two questions. Firstly, what is the fee  for

engaging the services of Prof. Tange to carry out the

project? Secondly, why are local architects not given

the chance to carry out such a prestigious project of

our own?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the two points

raised by the Member for Tiong Bahru - one deals with

financial  aid from the Government. I would  like  to

assure  him in particular and other Members  of  this

House who are interested in sports that they need not

worry  about  sports  and  financial  aid  from   the

Government.  In fact, the Government  has  gone  into

sports  activities one hundred per  cent.  This  Bill

provides  for  the  National Stadium  Corporation  to

approach  the Government for loans if it is necessary

to help the Corporation financially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question of safety precautions raised

by the Member, this has always been borne in mind not

only by the National Stadium Corporation but also  by

the  National  Sports Promotion  Board.  And  we  are

looking  into this very actively and Members  can  be

assured that precautionary measures will be taken for

the  safety of sportsmen and sportswomen and also for

the spectators in the sports complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang raised two points - to

raise the standard of sports and to popularise sports

among  the  masses. On the question  of  raising  the

standard  of sports, this has been going on  for  the

last  three or four years. We are always looking into

or trying our best to raise the standard of sports in

Singapore. In fact, when I answered a Question of one

Member  earlier, I said that the Singapore  Badminton

Association  has  already  a  scheme  by  which   the

standard  of badminton is going to be improved.  Many

other sports organisations will be doing likewise. So

the Member need not worry about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the popularisation of sports among the masses,

sports activities will be carried out at constituency

level next year. We are promoting inter-constituency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



sports competitions. If I am not mistaken,  we

will  start  with football and sepak takraw.  I  hope

every Member of Parliament will encourage all sports

organisations in their constituencies to  participate

in these competitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a sports fund, clause 15 of the

National  Stadium Corporation Bill provides that  the

Corporation will actively promote fund raising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of capable coaches, here again the

N.S.P.B, has always been looking into  it.  We  have

brought  in one or two capable coaches from  overseas

to train our sportsmen and sportswomen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Mountbatten as

to  the amount of fees to be paid to Professor  Tange

for  the  second phase of the Sports  Complex,  I  am

afraid I cannot tell the Member offhand. But I  will

find out about this and will inform the Member if  he

wishes to know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question why local architects are not

given  the  chance to build the two covered  stadium,

this  is  because  we would like  to  have  something

special  for  the Sports Complex and we thought  that

Professor Tange is the best man who could plan for us

the two covered stadia inside the Sports complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 of this Bill seeks to amend subsection (2)

of section 4 of the Housing and Development Ordinance

which  at present requires the Chairman or the Deputy

Chairman of the Board, in addition to another  person

authorised by the Board, to sign every deed, document

and  any instrument requiring the seal of the  Board.

The  effect  of  the  amendment is  to  simplify  the

procedure  for  the final execution of  documents  to

allow  the Board's seal to be affixed in the presence

of  the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman or any member

of  the Board and an authorised officer of the Board,

thereby   relieving  the  Chairman  and  the   Deputy

Chairman  of  this  tedious  legal  obligation.  This

amendment  is  necessary in view of the  considerable

increase  in the number of documents to be sealed  by

the   Housing   and  Development  Board   since   the

introduction  of the home ownership  scheme  for  the

people. Members of the House are no doubt aware  that

more and more citizens are coming forward to purchase

Housing and Development Board flats, especially  with

the recent raising of the family income limit. As  at

30th September, 1971, 36,470 units of flats have been

sold by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 9 of the Bill deal with minor

amendments  to  various sections of Part  IV  of  the

Ordinance,   such  as  deleting  the  words   "living

accommodation"  and substituting  therefor  the  word

"building"; and inserting immediately after the  word

"flat"  the words ", house or other building".  These

amendments  are  necessary  in  order  to  make   the

provisions of the Ordinance apply to buildings  other

than those meant for residential purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to amend a clause in

Part  IIA  of  the  Constitution of  Singapore  which

relates  to  the Judiciary with a view to enabling  a

Judge  of  the Supreme Court who has ceased  to  hold

office to sit again for specific period or periods as

a Judge of that Court should the need arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, clause (1) of Article 52F of the

Constitution  of Singapore enables  a  Judge  of  the

Supreme  Court  to hold office until the  age  of  65

years  with  an  extension not exceeding  six  months

after  he  attains  that age  as  the  President  may

approve,  so that as the law now stands a  Judge  may

not  hold  office after the age of 65 years  and  six

months.  The  Bill, if passed, will enable  not  only

Judges  who retire at the age of 65 or 65X- years  to

be  re-employed, but also those who retire or  resign

before  attaining  65 years. This provision  will  be

invoked  only  when it is necessary and,  of  course,

only  if  the  Judge is himself willing to  serve.  A

former  Judge could therefore be called upon to  help

out at any time as, for example, when a serving Judge

is  ill for a considerable time, or is expected to be

absent for several months for any cause, or if it  is

necessary  to  maintain  the  present  complement  of

Judges  with experience when one of them is  required

to  retire  by  reason of age. This is  in  fact  the

position  with  regard  to  one  senior  Judge  whose

extended term of office expires in November this year

when  he  will  attain the age of 65  years  and  six

months. As there are now only six Judges, apart  from

the  Chief Justice, and the maintenance of  at  least

this  number is desirable, it would seem  a  pity  to

lose  the experience that this retiring senior  Judge

represents so long as he is in good health and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



willing   to   serve  in  that  capacity  beyond   his

compulsory retiring age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is worth noting that the retiring age for

Judges  of the Supreme Court varies in other countries

from  65  years  in India to 75 years in  England  and

Canada.  In  Australia, they are  appointed  for  life

while  in  the  United  States  there  is  no  age  of

retirement,  but on reaching the age of 70  a  Supreme

Court  Judge who has served 10 consecutive  years  may

request  release from active duty. It is  not  thought

necessary  or desirable to raise the present  retiring

age  of Judges in Singapore as there would be some who

wish  to  retire at the age of 65 years, and  we  feel

that  they should not be prevented from so doing. This

Bill,  therefore,  has the merit of not  altering  the

present retiring age of our Judges for the benefit  of

those  who  would prefer to retire at the age  of  65,

while  at  the  same  time it enables  those  who  are

prepared  to serve for specific periods after reaching

retiring age to help out whenever there is a need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An existing provision in the Constitution, namely

clause (2) of Article 52B, enables "a person qualified

for  appointment as a Judge of the Supreme  Court"  to

sit as a Judge of that Court for a specific period and

there is in fact one such Judge who has been appointed

under  this provision. The amendment now proposed  has

been  conveniently incorporated in that  provision  so

that  a  person  so  qualified for  appointment  or  a

retired Judge of the Supreme Court who is recalled  to

serve  under  the new provision will hold  office  for

such period or periods as the President, acting on the

advice of the Prime Minister, directs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a formal Bill, the object of which is to

exclude  the  1970 Annual Supplement to  the  Laws  of

Singapore  to be printed this year from the rule  laid

down  in section 5 (1) (a) of the Revised Editions  of

the  Laws (Annual Supplements) Act. The rule is to the

effect  that each Annual Supplement shall contain  all

the  Acts passed between 1st January and 31st December

of  the  year immediately preceding the date of issue.

However,  the 1970 Revised Edition of Acts, an  eight-volume  work  containing  the Statutes  of  Singapore,

includes  the Acts passed by Parliament in 1970  other

than  14 Acts passed on the 30th December, 1970, which

were  not  brought into operation in  1970.  The  1970

Annual Supplement to be issued this year is to contain

all the Acts so omitted from the 1970 Revised Edition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill can, therefore, be said to be necessitated

by  the  situation created by the 1970 Revised Edition

of  Acts  which absorbed the first 48 of the  62  Acts

passed  in  1970 but not the Acts numbered  49  to  62

which  were passed on 30th December last year.  Having

regard to the rule that every Annual Supplement  shall

contain all the Acts passed in the preceding year,  an

amending  Act becomes necessary to enable  the  Annual

Supplement, which is to be printed in 1971, to consist

of  only  those Acts passed by Parliament in 1970  and

not included in the Revised Edition of Acts, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parallel situation existed when the 1955 Revised

Edition  of  the  Laws  of Singapore  was  issued.  An

adjustment  was  also necessary  in  respect  of  that

Edition, as may be seen by a perusal of section 5  (2)

of the principal Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normalcy in the publication of Annual Supplements

will be restored next year when all the Acts passed

from 1st January to 31st December of this year will,

in accordance with the rule I have just cited, be

contained in the Annual Supplement to be printed in

1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would not be inappropriate for me to

conclude  with  a  few  remarks on  the  1970  Revised

Edition  of  Acts.  It is the eighth  Revised  Edition

since  the publication of the first edition  in  1886.

The  last Revised Edition was issued 16 years  ago  in

1955  and  was  known as "The Laws of  the  Colony  of

Singapore".  The 1970 Revised Edition has taken  about

four  years  to  complete and  is  the  first  Revised

Edition  to  be  published  since  Singapore  attained

independence.  It  amends,  it  consolidates,  and  it

brings  up  to  date the laws in force in  independent

Singapore and enables each piece of legislation to  be

read  as  a clear, connected and completed entity  and

will  indeed  be  a boon to the Bench,  the  Bar,  the

Magistrates in the Subordinate Courts, officers in the

Legal Service, law students, Government officers,  and

others  concerned with the administration of  justice,

and,  in fact, anyone who has occasion to look up  the

law  on  any  subject. All the eight  volumes  of  the

present  Edition have already been issued and  are  in

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the rapid expansion of our industrial

activities, the Jurong Town Corporation has  found  it

necessary  to expand the Jurong Industrial  Estate  by

developing,   in  accordance  with  the  layout   plan

approved by the Master Plan Committee, the area  shown

coloured  purple, brown and green and yellow shown  on

the  plan  marked  "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN  NO.

this House for the information of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area coloured purple comprises State lands which

will   be  alienated  to  the  Corporation.  The  area

coloured brown comprises private lands which will have

to  be  acquired for the development,  and  the  areas

coloured  green and yellow are foreshores  which  will

have to be reclaimed for the proposed development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval of the House is now sought for the

reclamation    of    these    foreshores     totalling

approximately  372  acres in  area.  The  Jurong  Town

the reclamation in two stages at an estimated cost  of

$11.5  million.  The fill will be taken  from  surplus

earth cut in the development of the hilly areas in the

Tuas  area,  west  of Sungei Jurong,  presently  being

undertaken  by the Corporation. The whole  reclamation

is  expected  to be completed in two to  three  years'

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with

section  4  of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270),

approves  the reclamation by Government of  those

portions   of  the  foreshores  at   Pulau   Ayer

Merlimau    containing   a    total    area    of

PLAN  NO.  3/71" which is deposited in  the  Land

Office, Singapore.'

<hr>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the State lands and foreshores at Pulau Ayer

Merlimau  will  be  alienated  to  the  Jurong   Town

Corporation  to  enable the Corporation  in  turn  to

sublease  these  State lands and  foreshores  to  the

Singapore Petroleum Co. (Pte.) Ltd, for the  proposed

development  of  an oil refinery on the  island.  The

development project, to be undertaken by the  Company

as  a  joint  venture  with the Development  Bank  of

Singapore, will involve a total investment  of  about

$160  million  and provide about 2,500  persons  with

employment  during  the  construction  period.   When

completed,  the  refinery  will  employ   about   300

persons,  and,  it is estimated, will  produce  about

65,000 barrels of oil per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enable the development project to be

carried out, it is necessary to reclaim approximately

170  acres of the foreshores as shown coloured  green

on  the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO.

3/71", a copy of which is displayed in the Library of

this House for the information of Members. The Jurong

Town   Corporation  as  agent  of  Government,   will

undertake the reclamation of these foreshores  at  an

estimated  cost of $2 million. The fill required  for

the initial reclamation will be obtained by cutting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



down  the  high ground on the island. The reclamation

is expected to be completed in eight months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

reclamation  by Government of those portions  of  the

foreshores at Pulau Ayer Merlimau containing a  total

area  of  approximately 170 acres as  shown  coloured

green  on  the  plan marked "LAND OFFICE  RECLAMATEON

Advances, and Recoverable Costs. Increases for  other

items   are   needed   to  meet  normal   growth   of
