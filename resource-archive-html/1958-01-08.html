<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Notices in Vernacular Press)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he will state the reasons why the Notices

of  Contested Elections in respect of  the  recent

City  Council  elections,  as  published  in   the

Government  Gazette  Extraordinary  No.   123   of

November  26,  1957,  were not  published  in  the

vernacular newspapers;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3406</b></font><br><br>



and whether he will take steps by the introduction

of  amending legislation, or otherwise, to  ensure

that Notices of Contested Elections in respect  of

elections  to  the Legislative Assembly,  City  or

District  Council will in the future be  published

in the vernacular newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, section 34 (4)  of  the  Local

Government   Elections  Ordinance   requires   the

Returning Officer to publish these notices in  the

Gazette  and also in such newspapers as he  thinks

fit.  There is therefore no requirement that  they

should be published in any particular newspaper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, owing to the high cost of advertisement

charges, consideration is now being given  to  the

question   of   amending  legislation  restricting

publication in the Gazette only in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amending legislation may not be enacted

before  the District Council elections this  year.

As  these elections will take place in areas which

are  mainly rural, consideration will be given  to

publishing   these  notices  in   the   vernacular

newspapers only in addition to the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If and when the amending legislation is enacted,

Government intends inserting advertisements in the

newspapers to the effect that the details of these

Notices  of  Contested Elections are available  in

the Gazette.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker.

Sir, can the Hon. the Chief Secretary tell us  how

much  did  it  cost Government to  publish  or  to

advertise  such Notices of Contested Elections  in

the newspapers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, the advertisement charges in

respect  of  these Notices of Contested  Elections

came up to about $15,750.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, will the

Hon. the  Chief  Secretary  inform  us   whether

consideration will be given for posters to be  put

up  at  all  community centres and  public  places

giving information on these coming elections?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, we will give that due

consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Chief Secretary tell us why is it that a decision

has been made by Government that such notices will

not be advertised in future but only published in

the Gazette?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

said that the reason is owing to the high cost  of

the advertisement charges.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, is the

Government  aware  that certain  sections  of  the

public  buy certain newspapers, and they will  not

read the notices unless they are advertised in the

vernacular Press?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> That is a matter of opinion.

<div align="center"><b>(Numbers completed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Local Government, Lands and Housing if he will

state -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how many Singapore Improvement Trust

housing  units were completed in  the  year 1957; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many Singapore Improvement Trust

housing  units are expected to be completed

in the year 1958.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the reply to (a) is 1,274  dwelling

units  and 70 shops; and the reply to (b) is 4,551

dwelling units and 197 shops.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Hon. the Minister give a directive to the  S.I.T.

that  it  should have made allocations immediately

on  the  completion of these 1,274 dwelling  units

last year?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, no directive is required

because it has been the practice of the S.I.T. to

allocate houses as soon as they are finished.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I hope!

<div align="center"><b>DEPARTMENT LAND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Negotiations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry whether he will state what  progress

has  been  made in the negotiations with  the  War

Department  to  enable farmers  to  continue  pig-keeping  on  War Department land, and whether  the

War  Department has given an assurance that no ban

on  pig-keeping will come into operation from  1st

February, 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, in view of the representations

made  by  the  Government, the Services  have  now

agreed  to  go further into the question  of  pig-breeding on War Department land, and have  in  the

meantime agreed to postpone any action until  28th

February. In case some action is inevitable,  they

will  consider the possibility of resettlement  of

farmers  who  may wish to be moved, should  it  be

necessary  to place restrictions in certain  areas

totally prohibiting the keeping of pigs.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Hon. the Minister give an assurance that he  will

do everything possible to safeguard the livelihood

of these farmers?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Government is

dedicated to safeguarding the lives and livelihood

of farmers and other citizens.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>10.08 a.m.

<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled

"An  Ordinance to amend the Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance, 1957 (No. 35 of 1957)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have  to  lay upon the Table a Certificate  of

Urgency signed by His Excellency the Governor  in

respect of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I have with me the

relevant  number of typed copies of the Bill  for

distribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk

and distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objects of the Bill are clearly set out

in  the explanatory note. Clause 2 seeks to  make

an  amendment  to  section 11  of  the  Singapore

Citizenship Ordinance. Under this section of  the

Ordinance,  persons who are recruited  in  Malaya

into  the British armed forces have been deprived

of the right of becoming citizens of Singapore. I

have received representations from this group  of

people and it has been considered that it is  but

fair  that  such persons and their  families  who

have been recruited into the British armed forces

in  Malaya should be entitled to become  citizens

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to make a minor amendment. It

makes  a correction of a mistake that crept  into

the Bill when it was considered last time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to add a proviso to section 26 of

the  Ordinance. Under section 26, people who  are

entitled  to  become citizens  of  Singapore  are

being  registered for an initial period of  three

months  ending 31st January, 1958. So  far,  more

than  230,000  citizens have been registered  but

there have been cases in which the Registrars are

not   in   a   position  to  grant   certificates

immediately on application and have had to  defer

the  cases for further investigation. This clause

seeks  to enable those deferred cases, when  they

have  been  finalised within one month after  the

registration period, to be allowed to be included

in the electoral register.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3410</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been about 5,000 deferred cases of

various  categories, such as people  who  applied

with  identity cards defaced and have to get  new

ones  to  satisfy the Registrar on the claims  on

the  application form, people who  were  born  in

Singapore and claimed birth elsewhere,  cases  of

absences  from  the Colony, and cases  where  the

applicants are seamen and were unable to  satisfy

the Registrar that their absences fall within the

approved categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is doing all it can to finalise

consideration of these deferred cases within  one

month  from  31st January, 1958, and it  is  felt

that  it  is  but fair that those who  registered

during   the   registration  period   but   whose

applications   are   deferred   pending   further

investigation, should  their  applications   be

approved  and  citizenship granted  them,  should

qualify  for inclusion on the electoral  register

for the purpose of the next general election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because the initial registration period

will come to an end on 31st January, 1958, that a

Certificate of Urgency has been found  necessary.

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Sir, I second it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.16 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

making   a   speech   but   just   a   point   of

clarification. The Hon. the Chief  Minister  said

that  the  Government would try to  finalise  all

deferred  cases  within  one  month.  If  it   so

happens  that  the  Government  cannot  finalise

matters  within  that month, and registration  is

made  after  the expiry of that month,  will  the

Government  then consider that the  applicant  is

deemed   to   be   a  citizen  of  Singapore   if

registration is granted?



<br><br>10.17 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we support this Bill. In the case of  those

who  are recruited into the British armed forces,

I think we considered it in Select Committee, and

we  agree that such persons should be given  that

consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think the object of the Citizenship

Ordinance  is  to  allow  people,  who  owe  their

loyalty to Singapore, to have a say in the  matter

of  government.  This means the  exercise  of  the

franchise  and  if  those who have  registered  as

citizens are going to stay away from voting during

elections  again, then the object of the Ordinance

will  be  defeated. We should ensure that  a  good

percentage of those who are on the electoral  roll

should come forward during elections to have their

say.  We  do not like to see the fate of Singapore

being  decided by just a few people who go to  the

polls while the majority stay at home. If there is

anything  to  grouse about later,  they  can  only

blame themselves for failing to elect a government

of their own choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity, Sir, to warn the people

of  Singapore  that it is of paramount  importance

that  they should all go to the polls and exercise

their vote so that the percentage of voters should

not be just 30 but near 100. Only in that case can

democracy work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support this Bill.



<br><br>10.19 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  support the amending Bill wholeheartedly

but  there  is one point I would like to  ask  the

Government to consider. Some people have been  put

in prison for banishment; they intend to apply for

citizenship  during  the  registration  period.  I

wonder  whether the Government will  consider  the

cases  of  such  banishees who sincerely  want  to

swear  allegiance  to Singapore.  Will  Government

consider their applications or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, can I have an answer to

my question?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member has already

spoken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not

making my speech, I was asking a question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member is too

late.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

two  points which require some reply. In the  case

of  the  question  posed by the  hon.  Member  for

Queenstown,  I  can assure him that  all  deferred

cases  can  be  completed within  one  month.  The

figure  of 5.000 was quoted by me but it does  not

mean  that  the  Government is  holding  up  these

deferred  cases  until  1st  February  before   it

considers them. Out of these 5,000 cases, for  all

we  know, 4,785 might have been disposed of. It is

those  cases  coming in towards  the  end  of  the

registration  period  which require  this  special

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point raised by the hon. Member

for Changi, surely he understands that one of the

qualifications for citizenship is that of good

character?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. [The Chief Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>10.21 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Member for Queenstown

wishes to say anything further on the Bill, this

is the opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I have received my answer

already, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read the Third

<div align="center"><b>FEDERATION OF MALAYA INDEPENDENCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. V. Winslow (Acting Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Attorney-General (Mr A. V. Winslow):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple and straightforward Bill

necessitated by the attainment of independence  by

the   Federation  of  Malaya.  A  number  of   our

Singapore  Ordinances provide for the Governor  of

Singapore  and  the  High  Commissioner   of   the

Federation  of Malaya jointly to make appointments

to  certain statutory Boards. If this Bill becomes

law,  the  powers hitherto exercised by  the  High

Commissioner will be exercisable in future by  the

Yang di-Pertuan Agong of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make a

few  other minor changes. Thus, the Bill  provides

that references to the Federation of Malaya and to

Federal citizens shall in future be construed  as

references to the Federation of Malaya established

on  the  31st day of August, 1957, and to citizens

of   the  Federation  respectively.  Consequential

amendments have also been made by the Bill to  the

Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Winslow -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Winslow:</b> Sir, I beg to apply for permission

to  move  an  amendment to clause 2,  line  16.  I

apologise for not giving earlier notice because it

was   only   discovered  yesterday.  The  proposed

amendment  is  in page 1, line 16,  to  leave  out

"Federation" and insert "Federal". I  apply  under

Standing Order 51 and crave the indulgence of  the

House.  Standing  Order 51(2) says  that  "if  the

Chairman is of the opinion that an amendment is of

a minor or purely drafting character, he may, with

the  general assent of Members present, permit  it

to  be moved without notice." I submit, Sir,  that

this   is  a  minor  clerical  error  which   went

unnoticed when the Bill was introduced at the last

sitting.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It seems to be a typographical

error. The amendment can be considered to be of  a

minor character. Has the Hon. the Attorney-General

the assent of honourable Members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment made: In page 1, line 16, to leave out

"Federation" and insert "Federal." - [Mr Winslow].

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.34 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His

Excellency's consent to proceed with this Bill.  I

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the amendments proposed in the

Bill  is  to  provide additional  options  not  at

present  allowed  by  the principal  Ordinance  to

contributors  to  the Straits Settlements  Widows'

and Orphans' Pension Scheme who retire under  the

provisions  of  the  Retirement  from  the  Public

Service (Compensation) Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law provides for a compulsory

contribution  to  the scheme  of  4  per  cent  of

officers'  salaries,  and  retiring  officers  are

given  a choice between paying 4 per cent of their

last  drawn personal emoluments or 4 per  cent  of

their   unreduced   pension.  Officers   who   are

compulsorily   retired  under   the   Compensation

Ordinance as a result of the implementation of the

policy  of  Malayanisation  are  denied  the  full

benefits  of the scheme to the extent  that  their

compulsory   retirement   prevents    them    from

contributing sums which increase progressively  as

the  officers'  salaries increase  by  incremental

advancement or by promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore desired, Sir, to make the

following  three  further  options  available   to

officers    retiring   under   the    Compensation

Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to cease contributing to the scheme and to

have  the prospective benefits frozen  from

the date of cessation; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to pay into the scheme an actuarially

computed  amount which would  freeze  their

prospective   benefits   at   the   amounts

produced  as  if  they  had  continued   to

contribute after retirement at 4  per  cent

of  last  drawn  salary or 4  per  cent  of

unreduced pension; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to allow contributors to withdraw an

actuarially calculated proportion of  their

contributions  in  return  for  a  complete

relinquishment  of their rights  under  the

scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill now before the

House, and new rules IX and X are designed to give

effect to this intention. Sir, the legislation is,

in  the  nature  of things, complicated,  but  the

examples  given in clause 8 (b) of the Bill  show

the   effect  of  the  alternatives.  Members  are

assured  that  the  options  have  been  based  on

actuarial  advice and that no loss  of  Government

funds is incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of the Federation of Malaya has

already  amended its Widows' and Orphans'  Pension

legislation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3416</b></font><br><br>



to  provide  for  these  similar  additional

options, and the Bill will now bring us into  line

with the Federation in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes provision to enable members

of  the  Straits Settlements Widows' and  Orphans'

Pension Scheme who are compulsorily retired in the

Federation  of Malaya to avail themselves  of  the

same options.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other clauses in the Bill are

consequential   amendments   to   the    principal

Ordinance. I would like to point out that there is

a  very minor typographical error in the last line

of  the  explanatory note, where  the  figure  "8"

should  be  "9". I shall, in the Committee  stage,

move  a  small  amendment of which I have  already

given notice. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these rules are designed to provide for the

following contingencies which I shall outline now,

which were still under consideration when the main

rules were approved in the middle of 1957. Rule  2

of  the amendment, hon. Members will see, provides

for  the Minister to have the power to exempt  any

vessel or any class or description of vessel  from

any  of  the provisions of the Port Rules. Rule  3

amends  certain signals as specified  in  Schedule

VII  of  the principal Rules, and it also provides

for  a  new signal to assist the Director of Posts

to  clear  all mails from ships in the port.  This

was  omitted  in the last Rules.  Rule  4  of  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This schedule of applications for supplementary

vote  refers to expenditure in 1957. The need  for

supplements became apparent during the latter part

of last year. We then had the choice of presenting

a  message either at the end of the Budget sitting

or  at  the first sitting in the New Year. As  the

expenditure   in  each  case  was  justified   and

inescapable,  and as there was  to  be  a  sitting

early in January, it was decided to hold over  the

application  until this sitting,  rather  than  to

inflict  it  on hon. Members when they were  weary

with  financial  business. The  message  therefore

asks  for votes for expenditure which has  already

been  incurred. Hon. Members will recall that,  in

special  circumstances,  the  Government  has  the

power   to   incur  expenditure  in   advance   of

legislative approval, provided that it reports the

measure at the earliest opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full explanations are given in each case of the

reasons for each application, but I shall be happy

to endeavour to add to these explanations if

required.

<div align="center"><b>LOAN TO GOVERNMENT OFFICERS' HOUSING SOCIETY</b></div>



<br><br>10.54 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I have His Excellency the

Governor's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves of the loan by the

Government  to the Singapore Government  Officers'

Co-operative Housing Society Limited of the sum of

$2,000,000 at an interest rate of 4½ per cent  per

annum repayable by eleven equal annual instalments

to start from the 11th year after the grant of the

loan  and  be  completed in the 21st year,  to  be

secured  by a legal mortgage of all the  immovable

properties belonging to the Society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members are probably aware that

following a decision of Government not to  provide

quarters  for  locally- domiciled officers  except

for   those   who   are  required   to   live   in

institutional quarters, it was decided in 1953  to

provide  facilities  to  enable  locally-domiciled

officers to acquire their own houses. In order  to

implement  this decision, a scheme was  formulated

in  September  1953  whereby  Government  servants

could  borrow from Government through the  Malaya-Borneo  Building Society, Ltd., acting as  agents,

to enable them to purchase their own houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it was decided to give further

assistance  to the Singapore Government  Officers'

Co-operative  Housing Society  Limited  which  had

been  established in December 1948 and  which  had

already  been granted a loan of $200,000  in  June

1951  for the purpose of building houses for  sale

on hire-purchase to its members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing loan scheme for Government servants

operated  by  the Malaya-Borneo Building  Society,

Ltd. was  approved in September 1953.  A  sum  of

$2,000,000  was  made  available  in   the   first

instance. This sum was fully committed by the  end

of  the  year and a further sum of $1,000,000  was

advanced  in  January 1954. The demand  for  loans

continued and further sums of $1,000,000 were made

available  in  September 1954 and  in  March  1955

respectively,  making  the  total  of   $5,000,000

outlaid  in  housing loans to Government  servants

through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3422</b></font><br><br>



agency of the Malaya-Borneo Building Society, Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of interest charged on these loans has

been  5  per  cent  per annum, out  of  which  the

Society   has   retained   one   per   cent    for

administrative expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government Officers' Co-operative

Housing  Society  Ltd. had been given  a  loan  of

$200,000  in  June  1951 to be  repaid  by  annual

instalments  of $20,000 commencing in the  twelfth

year following the grant of the loan. The rate  of

interest charged was 3½ per cent per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the decision to assist locally-domiciled Government officers to buy their own

houses,  another loan of $500,000 was approved  to

the  Society in October 1953, to be repaid  either

by  annual instalments of $25,000 or with interest

and capital repayable at three years' notice after

a  minimum  period of 12 years. In  April  1954  a

third  loan  of  $1,000,000 was  approved,  to  be

repaid  by  annual instalments of  not  less  than

$50,000,  repayment to be completed in  21  years.

The  rate  of interest charged on these loans  was

also 3½ per cent per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, the Staff Side of the Singapore Civil

Service  Joint  Council requested that  Government

should  give  further assistance  to  enable  more

locally-domiciled Government officers  to  acquire

their  own  houses.  This  request  received  very

careful consideration in the light of Government's

overall financial resources and of the fact that a

total  of $6,700,000 had already been tied  up  in

housing loans. In view, however, of the importance

of  implementing the 1953 decision to the limit of

Government's  financial capacity, it  was  decided

that  a  further sum of $2,000,000 should be  made

available to the Singapore Government Officers' Co-operative  Housing  Society.  It  was  considered,

however,  that this further sum should be directed

more particularly to giving assistance to officers

in  the subordinate grades of the service, and the

Society was asked to frame a satisfactory low-cost

housing scheme for Divisions III and IV officers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3423</b></font><br><br>



A   satisfactory  scheme  has  now  been  prepared

providing for the construction of both single- and

double-storeyed houses, and this has been approved

by  Government. This additional loan of $2,000,000

to  the  Society would be repayable  by  11  equal

instalments to begin from the 11th year after  the

grant of the loan and to be completed in the  21st

year.  The loan will be adequately secured against

the immovable property of the Society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of interest which should be charged on

this  new  loan  has been the subject  of  careful

consideration  and  discussion with  the  Society.

Naturally, the officers of the Society are anxious

to  obtain the loan on the cheapest possible terms

and have advanced the argument that since previous

loans,  which have been utilised to provide houses

for fairly senior officers, have borne interest of

3½  per  cent,  it is inappropriate that  the  new

loan,  which  is  to be devoted to  the  needs  of

subordinate  officers, should bear interest  at  a

higher  rate.  The force of this  argument  is  of

course  appreciated. At the same  time,  the  fact

remains   that   interest  rates  have   increased

considerably since previous loans were granted and

that  in  these  circumstances, it  would  not  be

proper  to  tie  money up for a period  of  twenty

years  at  a  rate  of  interest  which  bears  no

resemblance to current market rates. At  the  same

time,  note  was  taken of  the  decision  of  the

previous  Government to grant loans on  favourable

terms.  In  all the circumstances, it was  thought

that  all interests would be served by the  charge

of interest of 4½ per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision to charge interest on the further

loan  to  the  Society at 4½ per cent  raised  the

question of the adjustment of the rate of interest

charged  on  loans made through the  Malaya-Borneo

Building Society. This at present stands  at  five

per  cent of which, as I said before, the  Society

retains  one  per cent as an agency  fee  and  for

administrative  expenses. In this  connection,  it

was  noted that the Malaya-Borneo Building Society

had  itself  adjusted interest rates  on  its  own

loans  in  sympathy with the increase in  interest

rates  generally. After consideration of  all  the

factors concerned,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3424</b></font><br><br>



it was decided that the rate of  interest

on  existing and future loans through the  Society

should be raised to six per cent of which one  per

cent  would be retained by the Society.  The  loan

agreements  issued  by the Society  require  three

months'  notice  to be given of  any  increase  in

interest  rate.  Consequently,  the  new  rate  of

interest  on the existing loans will be  effective

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT LOAN TO CITY COUNCIL OF $4,000,000</b></div>



<br><br>11.03 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency

the Governor's authority to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the loan by the

Government to the City Council of $4,000,000  free

of  interest  and  to be repaid  by  equal  annual

instalments over a period of ten years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the proposal to build the Merdeka

Bridge   and   connected  road-works   was   under

consideration, discussions were held with the City

Council  about the apportionment of liability  for

the   cost  of  the  undertaking.  After   lengthy

discussions, it was agreed that Government  should

meet  the  cost  of  the bridge,  while  the  City

Council, which   was   responsible    for    the

construction and maintenance of roads and  bridges

within the city area, should meet the cost of  the

new  roads  leading to the bridge, the  Guillemard

Road  and  other  necessary  roundabouts  and  the

bridge  over the Stamford Canal. The cost of  this

work was estimated at $4 million.

As the City Council had no surplus funds available

and  would find difficulty in raising a  loan  for

this particular work in addition to the loan funds

required   for  its  other  essential  development

projects, Government agreed to lend the sum of  $4

million  to  the  Council  free  of  interest  and

repayable  over  a  period  of  ten  years.   This

decision  was taken by the Governor in Council  in

July 1954 but owing to an oversight was not put to

the  Legislative  Council for formal  approval  at

that  time.  The Director of Audit has  now  drawn

attention to this oversight and has suggested that

the  Legislative  Assembly  as  successor  to  the

Legislative Council should be asked to give formal

approval to the loan. This is the reason for  this

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are aware that the work to be  met

from  this loan has already been completed  and  I

think  it would be generally agreed that the money

devoted to the bridge and connected works has been

well spent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will also recall that sometime ago,

I  moved  that all long-terms loans to the S.I.T.,

the  City  Council and other authority  should  be

charged to expenditure. This loan was included  in

the total sum involved in that motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the loan by the

Government to the City Council of $4,000,000, free

of  interest  and  to be repaid  by  equal  annual

instalments over a period of ten years.
