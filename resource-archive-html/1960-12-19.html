<div align="center"><b>SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before we deal with the motion standing

in the name of the Deputy Prime Minister, I feel it is

my  duty to endeavour to put the matter in its  proper

perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the motion should on no account be

considered as a motion of censure and punishment moved

in  the  interests of the Government or of individuals

in  the  Government, but should be treated as a motion

which  relates  to  the dignity and prestige  of  this

Assembly and therefore is a motion in the interests of

this Assembly as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the motion suggests to this House

that  an  hon. Member has been guilty of dishonourable

conduct  for  which this House is invited  to  condemn

him,  and  the second part of the motion suggests  the

punishment which should be meted out in the  event  of

this  House being satisfied of the guilt of  the  hon.

Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some misunderstanding as to whether

these  proceedings are tantamount to an  endeavour  to

curtail  what is commonly known as "freedom of  speech

in  this Assembly". That, in my view, is not the case.

The freedom of speech in relation to this Assembly  is

the  freedom of speech protected under the  provisions

of  section 3 of the Legislative Assembly (Powers  and

Privileges) Ordinance, 1955, which reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`3. No civil or criminal proceedings may be

instituted  against any person while a member  of  the

Assembly-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in respect of words spoken before the Assembly

or a committee thereof; or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in respect of words written in a report to the

Assembly or to any committee thereof or  in  any

petition,  bill, resolution, motion or  question

brought or introduced by him therein.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That section means that an hon. Member of this House

is  free  of  any legal restraint in regard  to  words

spoken before this Assembly or written in relation  to

proceedings in this Assembly. It simply means that  he

cannot be prosecuted or be sued in any court of law in

respect  of  those words. It does not  mean  that  the

Member is free from restraint in so far as this  House

itself  is  concerned, that is to say, he must  always

remain accountable to this House, inter alia, for  any

words uttered in this House or written in relation  to

the  proceedings  in  this  House.  The  privilege  of

freedom  of  speech given by the Legislative  Assembly

(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance, 1955, does not mean

that  hon. Members are granted an unrestrained licence

of speech in this Assembly, and because an hon. Member

is  protected by that privilege of freedom of  speech,

it  does not mean that this House will permit  him  to

abuse that privilege with impunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House possesses an inherent power to do all

that  is  necessary to maintain its  own  dignity  and

decorum,  and  the Singapore (Constitution)  Order  in

Council  has provided in subsection (1) of section  48

that  this Assembly "may from time to time make, amend

and  revoke  Standing Orders for  the  regulation  and

orderly  conduct  of  its  own  proceedings  and   the

despatch of business".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Standing Orders, I need only refer

to paragraph (5) of Standing Order No. 56 which reads

as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(5) Nothing in this Standing Order shall be taken

to deprive the Assembly of the power of proceeding

against any Member according to any resolution of the

Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, therefore, if this House is satisfied

that  the conduct of the hon. Member for Hong  Lim  is

such  as  to  be  an affront to its  own  dignity  and

prestige  in the sense, inter alia, that that  conduct

has  brought  discredit to the House  as  a  whole-not

merely   to   individual  Members  of  the  Government

Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



Party, or indeed, to any other Member of the House  or

to  persons outside this House-then the House may feel

itself  justified in condemning or censuring the  hon.

Member  for  Hong Lim and thereafter in proceeding  to

consider  what punishment, consonant with its  powers,

it should mete out to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What those powers are is a matter of law on which I

am  not  called upon to pronounce. Suffice it  to  say

that  there  is  an undoubted power  inherent  in  any

House,  in the interest of the orderly conduct of  its

business  and  the  preservation of  its  dignity  and

prestige, inter alia, to suspend or even expel Members

who are, in its opinion, unfit to sit in the House and

who would bring discredit upon it. But let me sound  a

word  of  warning.  Whether this  Assembly  has  those

extreme  powers unabridged, is a matter this  Assembly

will  have to inquire into with care and, if need  be,

upon  which  this Assembly might wish  to  seek  legal

advice.  I  myself feel it my duty as the guardian  of

the  privileges of this House and the custodian of the

rights  of hon. Members to sound that note of  warning

having regard to-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, section 48 (1) of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, which  I  have

already quoted;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Standing Orders made thereunder;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, section 59 of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order in Council, 1958, which reads as follows :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`59. It shall be lawful, by laws enacted under this

Order,  to  determine  and  regulate  the  privileges,

immunities and powers of the Assembly and its Members;

but  no  such  privileges, immunities or powers  shall

exceed  those  of the Commons' House of Parliament  in

the United Kingdom or of the Members thereof.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Fourthly, the Legislative Assembly (Powers and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privileges) Ordinance, 1955, the long title of which

reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An Ordinance to declare and define certain powers,

privileges and immunities of the Legislative  Assembly

established  under  the  Singapore  Colony  Order   in

Council,  1955, and of the Members of such Legislative

Assembly, to regulate the conduct of members and other

persons in connection with the proceedings thereof, to

give  protection  to  the  persons  employed  in   the

publication of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



reports  and other papers of the Legislative  Assembly

and  for purposes incidental to or connected with  the

matters aforesaid.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those provisions of law and of the Standing Orders

do  give  to this Assembly powers to suspend a  Member

under  certain circumstances but, as I have indicated,

this  Assembly will have to satisfy itself that  those

provisions of law and of the Standing Orders have not,

in  fact, abridged the inherent power of this Assembly

to   suspend   a   Member  more  especially   in   the

circumstances  which have arisen  in  this  particular

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me make it quite clear that this motion

will  and  must proceed as a motion which affects  the

House  as a whole and which invites the House  in  the

first instance to say whether its dignity and prestige

have  not  been affronted by the conduct of  the  hon.

Member  for  Hong Lim. That is the first issue  before

this House, and when that issue has been disposed  of,

the  House  will proceed, if necessary, to the  second

issue, that is to say, the question of punishment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House condemns the Member for Hong Lim for

his  dishonourable conduct unbecoming  of  an  elected

representative  of  the people in that  he  repeatedly

used  his  privilege in this Assembly as a  cloak  for

spreading  malicious  falsehoods  to  unjustly  injure

innocent   persons  both  inside  and   outside   this

Assembly;  that  he be suspended from the  service  of

this Assembly until such time as (i) he apologises  to

this  Assembly for his dishonourable conduct; (ii)  he

unreservedly   withdraws  his  unfounded   allegations

against the Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour

and  Law;  and (iii) he assures the Assembly  that  he

will  not  persist  in abusing his privilege  in  this

Assembly  by uttering malicious falsehoods, unless  he

be  prepared  when  challenged to repeat  outside  the

Assembly the charges he makes in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to you for having

discussed  with me last Saturday the procedure  to  be

followed today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



I  understand  that you have also similarly  discussed

this  matter with the Opposition. I accept your ruling

that  the  motion  should be divided into  two  parts;

firstly,  the condemnation of the Member for Hong  Lim

for   his  undignified  conduct;  and,  secondly,  the

punishment  arising out of such a breach of  privilege

as considered by the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech, I shall confine myself to the first

part of the motion which, as you have indicated, is to

be  disposed  of before the second part is considered.

Let  me assure you, Mr Speaker, that this motion  has

been  placed before the House not light-heartedly  but

with  great  gravity, because it  involves  a  serious

censure  of a Member of this House and, in particular,

one who also happens to be a Member of the Opposition.

So  it  is  necessary for me to state as  clearly  and

dispassionately why this motion is being  brought.  It

is  not  being brought in anger or haste, because  the

Government is well aware that, by doing so, it may  be

laying itself open to a possible charge that it is  an

attempt  to  silence  a  Member  who  has,  since  his

expulsion  from  the  Government  Benches,   been   an

opponent of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to assure you, Mr Speaker, that this

motion is not being brought because of the Member  for

Hong   Lim's   criticisms,  however  unfair,   however

reckless, or however sustained, of Government  policy.

To deny that to any Member of this House is to make  a

mockery  of democracy, to repudiate all the things  we

believe   in.  The  right  of  any  Member  to   voice

criticism, however extreme and unfair, without fear is

what the right of privilege seeks to ensure, i.e. the

right not to be penalised either politically or  in  a

court  of law for the things that may be said in  this

House. The right of privilege is a shield to protect a

`Member   in  his  exercise  and  discharge   of   his

democratic  right  to criticise  a  government  as  he

thinks fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I shall show later when I come to enumerate the

itemized charges against the Member for Hong Lim, none

of   these   specific  charges  relate  to   political

criticisms of Government policies. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



most  important to bear this in mind, for it is likely

this  point  may  be  overlooked  in  the  course   of

discussion inside and outside this House. This  motion

in  no way relates to his political criticisms or even

mistaken analysis of Government policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should, briefly, like to touch first on the legal

position  in this matter upon which I have  taken  the

advice  of  the State Advocate-General. This  Assembly

has  been  given  the power under section  48  of  the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order in Council,  1958,  to

make  Standing Orders for the regulation  and  orderly

conduct  of  its own proceedings and the  despatch  of

business.  In exercise of these powers, the  Assembly,

by  resolution  on the 29th December, 1959,  made  the

Standing  Orders  which  came  into  effect  from  1st

January, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions relating to the "Rules of Order in

the  Assembly" are contained in Standing Orders 52  to

58. These follow the similar provisions applicable  in

the  House  of Commons in England and which  give  the

Speaker  summary power to deal with disorderly conduct

and disregard of the authority of the Chair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 56 (1) sets out the procedure to be

followed  where  a  Member  commits  the  offence   of

disregarding  the  authority  of  the  Chair   or   of

persistently and wilfully obstructing the business  of

the  Assembly.  This  follows  the  provision  of  the

Commons'  Standing Order 22 (1) . The Commons' Standing

Order 22 (6) goes on to provide that "nothing in  this

Order shall be taken to deprive the House of the power

of  proceeding against any Member according to ancient

usages".  This  refers to the inherent  power  of  the

House  of  Commons to punish a Member  for  breach  of

privilege. The corresponding provision in the Standing

Orders  of the Legislative Assembly is Standing  Order

56 (5) which provides:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Standing Order shall be taken to

deprive  the  Assembly  of  the  power  of  proceeding

against any Member according to any resolution of  the

Assembly.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus this Assembly has an inherent right of taking

proceedings  against  any  Member  for  a  breach   of

privilege. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



have no local precedent of the exercise of this right,

and   it  is  necessary  therefore  to  turn  to   the

precedents  built by the House of Commons in  England.

It is settled in England that the House of Commons has

the  right,  in  the case of breach of  privilege,  to

suspend  or  even to expel a Member of the House.  The

Legislative  Assembly in Singapore has  the  power  to

suspend  a  Member and this power is  referred  to  in

Standing  Order 6. It has been held, as is  stated  in

Erskine  May's  "The Law, Privileges, Proceedings  and

Usage  of  Parliament" at page 124, that speeches  and

writings reflecting on the conduct of Members  of  the

House  of Commons may amount to a breach of privilege

even when they do not amount to libel at common law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case, the complaint goes further since they do

amount  to libels at common law. In such cases,  on  a

complaint  being made, the matter can be raised  by  a

motion. The practice in such cases, where, the  matter

of  complaint is a charge alleged to have been made by

one  Member  against another in a  speech,  even  when

outside  the  House of Commons, and where  the  Member

admits  the correctness of the report and states  that

he is in a position to prove the charge and is willing

to  attempt to do so, is to give him an opportunity of

establishing the charge. In a few instances the matter

has  been referred to a committee of the House.  Where

the  Member has refused either to withdraw the charges

or  to  substantiate them, the House may  adjudge  him

guilty  of  a  breach of privilege and deal  with  him

accordingly.  Where  the Member  accused  has  made  a

proper  apology  for  his offence,  the  incriminating

motion   has  usually  been  withdrawn,  and  if   not

withdrawn,  it may be set aside. Where the Member  has

made  a full and ample apology to the House, the House

can, while condemning the Member's conduct as a breach

of  its  privileges, resolve that it would not proceed

further in the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member of the Assembly has undoubtedly the

privilege  of  freedom of speech. But  this  privilege

must not be used as a licence to make offensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



imputations on Members of the Assembly. As Sir William

Anson, in his classical work on "The Law and Custom of

the Constitution", says in page 170:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Speech and action in Parliament may thus be said to

be  unquestioned  and  free.  But  this  freedom  from

external  influence or interference does  not  involve

any unrestrained licence of speech within the walls of

the  House. The House controls the action of  its  own

members,  and  enforces this control  by  censure;  by

suspension   from  the  service  of  the   House;   by

commitment;  by  expulsion.  Abuse  of  the  forms  of

debate;  irregular or disrespectful use of the  King's

name;  the  use  of  language which  is  offensive  or

insulting to either House, or to individual members of

either  House, or to Parliament collectively, are  the

offences which may be thus dealt with.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to suspend a Member is at the discretion of

the  Assembly  to  be exercised in accordance  with  a

resolution  of  the  Assembly, and  the  Assembly  may

provide  the  period  for which  a  Member  is  to  be

suspended. It is a power not to be lightly  used,  but

is  nevertheless  essential to preserve  the  dignity,

honour  and  prestige of the Legislative Assembly.  To

check   and   to   prevent  unseemly  and   disorderly

proceedings  which destroy confidence and respect  for

the  House  of  the  elected  representatives  of  the

people,  checks and safeguards have been built  up  in

the House of Commons. Any person, whether a Member  of

the  House  or not, who whether inside or outside  the

House  utters any statement which defames a Member  of

the  House,  on complaint to the House, will  have  to

either substantiate his allegations or withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House of Commons there is a special Select

Committee   called   the   Committee   of   Privileges

constituted  to  stand  guard over  these  matters  of

privilege. There have been several recent instances of

these disciplinary proceedings which we have been able

to  ascertain by cable from London. Summaries of  more

important instances have been sent and I list them  as

follows:



<br><br><i>Case No. 1-1834.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of public speech by Member as reported in

newspaper,  accusing another of dishonourable  conduct

in  promoting a Bill in private while opposing  it  in

public.  Referred by motion to Committee of Privileges

to  whom  Member apologised. House ordered  report  of

Committee  of  Privileges to lie  upon  Table  and  be

printed. No other action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Case No. 2-1844.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of public speech by Member as reported in

newspaper, accusing other Members of improper conduct.

Member  refused  to retract or explain  statement  and

challenged jurisdiction of House in the matter.  House

resolved  imputation wholly unfounded  and  calumnious

and  did  not affect in slightest degree  honour  and

character of Members to whom it applied.



<br><br><i>Case No. 3-1873.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of statements in book by Member impugning

character  of  certain other Members  and  threatening

further  exposures in order to influence their conduct

in Parliament. Member apologised and motion withdrawn.



<br><br><i>Case No. 4-1884.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of circular issued by Member to other

Members  soliciting  support of a  Bill  for  personal

reasons.  Member  apologised and  House  resolved  to

proceed to other business.



<br><br><i>Case No. 5-1887.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of offensive expressions used by one

Member to another in lobby of House. Member apologised

and motion withdrawn.



<br><br><i>Case No. 6-1893.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of public speech by Member as reported in

newspaper  imputing  corruption  to  certain  Members.

Member claimed report in many respects inaccurate  but

apologised. Question not put.



<br><br><i>Case No. 7-1907.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of letter from Member in newspaper

suggesting  connection between awards of honours  and

contributions to party funds. Motion that a breach  of

privilege and that a Select Committee should be set up

to inquire into allegations negatived.



<br><br><i>Case No. 8-1911.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of publication of letter from one Member

to  another  reflecting on conduct of Speaker.  Member

who  sent  letter  apologised  and  motion  withdrawn.

Member who received and published letter suspended for

one week, was resolution of House.



<br><br><i>Case No. 9-1921.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of public speech as reported in newspaper

accusing Members of drunkenness in House. Motion  that

this  cross-libel  and breach of  privilege  withdrawn

following apology.



<br><br><i>Case No. 10-1926.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of public speech by Member as reported in

newspaper  reflecting  on conduct  of  other  Members.

House resolved speech cross-libel and grave breach  of

its privileges.



<br><br><i>Case No. 11-1929.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of newspaper article by Member accusing

Chairman  of  Ways  and Means of partisanship.  Member

expressed  regret  that statement complained  of  made

outside the House. Motion withdrawn after debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Case No. 12-1936.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint of statements in newspaper article by

Member. Member apologised and motion withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the common form in all of the

above  is that the Member is present and permitted  to

make  a statement and then directed by the Speaker  to

withdraw while the debate proceeds. The point was made

in  one  or  two  cases that questions  of  breach  of

privilege  must be raised as soon as possible  and  in

Erskine    May's    authoritative    commentary     on

"Parliamentary   Practice   (16th   Edition)",   other

instances  akin  to  my  complaint  are  quoted.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I refer to pages 143  and  144?  In

page 143, I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where the Member has refused either to withdraw the

charges  or  to  substantiate  them,  the  House   has

sometimes   adjudged  him  guilty  of  a   breach   of

privilege, and dealt with him accordingly.'



<br><br>In page 144, I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In two instances, however, the House condemned the

Member's  conduct as a breach of its  privileges,  but

resolved  that  in consequence of the full  and  ample

apology  he  had offered to the House, or that  having

regard to his withdrawal of the expressions complained

of, it would not proceed any further in the matter.'



<br><br>In  page 104 of Erskine May's "Parliamentary Practice"

(Chapter VII), on "Penal Jurisdiction of Each  House",

may I quote:



<br><br><div align="center">PUNISHMENTS INFLICTED ON MEMBERS</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of contempts committed against the House

of   Commons  by  Members  two  other  penalties   are

available,  viz., suspension from the service  of  the

House and expulsion. In some cases expulsion has  been

inflicted in addition to committal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Lords, a sentence of expulsion against one of

its  Members,  passed by that House as a court,  would

rank as a disqualification.



<br><br><div align="center">SUSPENSION BY THE COMMONS</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension from the service of the House was a

punishment employed by the House of Commons under  its

power of enforcing discipline among its Members,  long

before  it  was  prescribed  by  standing  order   for

particular   offences,  such  as  disregard   of   the

authority  of the Chair, or obstruction,  and  it  can

still  be  imposed  at the discretion  of  the  House,

although,  of course, not under the summary  procedure

authorised by that standing order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1641, Mr Gervaise Hollis was suspended the House

during the Session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1643, Sir Norton Knatchbull was suspended the

House during the pleasure of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nearly two centuries this form of punishment had

been   in  abeyance,  no  case  of  suspension  having

occurred  since  1692. But at the  discretion  of  the

House  on  25  July, 1877, as a result  of  persistent

obstruction  by  Members  who supported  Parnell,  Mr

Speaker Brand gave the following ruling:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The House is perfectly well aware that any Member

persistently and wilfully obstructing public business

without  just  and reasonable cause is  guilty  of  a

contempt  of this House, and is liable to  punishment

whether  by  censure, suspension from the service  of

the  House, or commitment, according to the  judgment

of the House."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 20 February, 1911, Mr Ginnell, a Member, was

suspended for one week as a punishment for a breach of

privilege  in  publishing a letter reflecting  on  the Speaker's conduct in the Chair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1880, the procedure for suspending a

Member  for  particular  offences  was  laid  down  by

Standing  Order  No.  22, and suspensions  under  this

Standing Order are not infrequent.'



<br><br>Again  on page 125, are listed the different types  of

breaches of privileges. Amongst them, I will quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Imputations against Members of corruption in the

execution  of their duties

(cases of Carr, CJ.  (1667-87)  88,  95;  Noble, C.J. (1732-37) 245; Cundy,  C.J.

(1836)  658, 676; Parl. Deb, (1836) 35, cc. 167,  255;

and Knox, C.J. (1893-94) 631: Parl. Deb. (1893-94) 20, c. 112).'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have cited to you, Mr Speaker, the relevant

authorities. I need hardly say that for 200  years  in

the  House  of  Commons, it has not been necessary  to

suspend a Member for breach of privilege because, when

confronted,   Members   have   either   withdrawn   or

substantiated their allegations. It is our  hope  that

this  honourable  practice of  either  withdrawing  or

substantiating should be the guide for this  Assembly.

This  Assembly has borrowed extensively from the rules

and practice of the House of Commons. For human nature

being  what  it  is  all over the  world,  it  is  not

unlikely  that the same human failings  which  we  are

encountering,  and  will continue to  encounter,  have

been  experienced in the past in other Assemblies.  So

it  is that this Assembly has been given the powers to

discipline a wayward Member. However, because no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



one,  not even you, Mr Speaker, Sir, anticipated that

so soon in the life of this Assembly we would be faced

with  this unpleasant task, no Committee of Privileges

has  been constituted. And so, if the Member for  Hong

Lim  indicates  that  he chooses to  substantiate  his

allegations,  then,  as  you  have  ruled   with   the

concurrence  of  the Government and  Opposition  Front

Benchers, the whole House will resolve itself  into  a

Committee with you as Chairman to ascertain the truth.

And  in that event, the Member for Hong Lim will  have

his  wish, expressed in a statement he issued  on  the

21st  October, 1960, in answer to the Prime Minister's

challenge  to  repeat  his  allegations  outside   the

Chamber, fulfilled. He then stated - I quote the Straits

Times,  the  Nanyang Siang Pau, and the Sin  Chew  Jit

Poh, of the 22nd October, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Political issues should be debated and answered in

the Assembly, and not in a Court of Law.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge against the Member for Hong Lim is

totally  unrelated  to  his criticisms  of  Government

policy.  However  violently and unfairly  stated,  the

charge is that we condemn the Member for Hong Lim  for

dishonourable   conduct  unbecoming  of   an   elected

representative  of  the people in that  he  repeatedly

used  his  privilege in this Assembly as a  cloak  for

spreading  malicious  falsehoods  to  unjustly  injure

innocent   persons  both  inside  and   outside   this

Assembly.  The key words in this motion are "malicious

falsehoods",  not  just malicious criticisms.  We  are

therefore censuring him for using malicious falsehoods

to unjustly injure the reputation of people inside and

outside the Assembly. We shall show later that what he

uttered were malicious falsehoods. Our sole concern is

with these malicious falsehoods; nothing more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two reasons why we take such a

serious view of these malicious falsehoods as to bring

this motion against the Member for Hong Lim. The first

is,  that  resort to malicious falsehoods, will  bring

into  contempt the right of privilege the  Member  for

Hong  Lim  enjoys. A privilege of this  kind  must  be

exercised responsibly. If it is used irresponsibly, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



it has been by the Member for Hong Lim, then the right

of   privilege,  instead  of  becoming  a  shield  for

democracy,  becomes instead a weapon  to  destroy.  If

every  Member  in  this Assembly decides  to  use  his

privilege  as a cloak to defame others unjustly,  then

it is clear, Sir, that democracy would be brought into

contempt  and  ridicule. In other words, Mr  Speaker,

unbridled  and  reckless abuse of this privilege  will

ultimately  destroy the real worth of this  privilege.

And  this motion seeks to do no more than to check the

Member  for  Hong  Lim from continuing  to  abuse  his

privilege   by   the  persistent  use   of   malicious

falsehoods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why this motion is being brought

is  to repair the damage that the Member for Hong  Lim

has  unjustly caused to a number of people through the

use    of   malicious   falsehoods   by   unreservedly

withdrawing these malicious falsehoods and apologising

to the House for his dishonourable conduct. Perhaps it

would  be  as well, Sir, at this stage to itemise  the

most  recent and specific falsehoods on record.  These

items,  a  list  of  which I shall hand  to  you,  Mr

Speaker,  do  not relate to his political  criticisms,

Such  preposterous views as that the P.A.P. Government

has sold out the people, that it is pro-colonial, that

it  grinds the faces of the poor, and other outlandish

and queer views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion in no way seeks to prevent the Member

for  Hong  Lim,  if he so minds, from  repeating  such

nonsense  in the future. These items relate solely  to

malicious  falsehoods  uttered  inside  this  Assembly

under cover of privilege.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a list of three specific and the

most  recent allegations made by the Member  for  Hong

Lim.  You  will permit me, Mr Speaker, to quote  from

the  transcript of proceedings of this  House  on  the

10th  December, 1960, and on the 12th December,  1960.

These transcripts were issued by your Office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan: In my opinion, there is nothing,

as far as I know, to merit this transfer other than

the fact that he is the brother-in-law of the Prime

Minister.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, permit me to hand in a list of these three specific allegations which I have listed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of the list of allegations handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether it would be

convenient for honourable Members to have copies of

these allegations. But I thought the Leader of the

House has been warned that copies may be required. I

wonder if he has copies available.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will he please hand in the copies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the list of allegations handed in and

distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I shall now deal

with  these allegations. I will begin with  the  first

allegation which was made by the Member for Hong  Lim

during  the  consideration of item (5) of  sub-head  1

(Secretary) of Head 27 (City Health), Main  Estimates,

1961.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Ong Eng Guan: I wonder if this is the way to

get  away  from the P.S.C. in order to give a  job  to

this particular officer who happens to be a

brother-in-law of a Minister.'



<br><br>Sir,  this  particular officer mentioned is named  Mr

Michael  Romeo  Marcus. He first joined the  Municipal

Service in February 1931. In the course of the years

he  was  promoted  from the post of the  junior  clerk

through higher posts until he was finally appointed as

an  Assistant Secretary in the Secretariat with effect

from   the  1st  August,  1957.  The  basis   of   his

appointment  in  1957 was his previous  experience  in

clerical and secretarial work in the Secretariat. His

post  was in Class IV of the `Senior Officers' Service

in   the  salary  scale  of  $670x$30A-$880-$920-$965/

efficiency bar/$1,010x$45A-$1,145.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr M. R. Marcus resigned from the City Council with

effect from 2nd June, 1959. No reason was given in his

letter of resignation. His brother, L. A. Marcus,  had

previously resigned on 5th February, 1959.  His  other

brother,  P.  C.  Marcus, was at that time  the  Chief

Administrative  Officer,  and  was  involved  in   the

proceedings of the Commission of inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister took over the affairs of the City

Council  in October 1959, in the early part  of  1960,

that  is,  January and February, a number of  officers

who  had resigned from the City Council in the  period

June  1959 to October 1959 applied or were invited  to

return to the City Council. A circular letter inviting

re-employment   was,   in   fact,   issued   by    the

Administrator,  City Council, on the Prime  Minister's

authority  on 12th November, 1959. The relevant  parts

of this circular letter read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Between June and October when the City Council came

under  the  charge of the Minister,  there  have  been

resignations  from 30 senior officers,  three-quarters

of whom are local officers. The number of resignations

from  the  middle and lower ranks, who are  all  local

officers,  have been even greater, You  are  no  doubt

aware  that  these resignations were  precipitated  by

unfounded   speculations   regarding   their    future

prospects,    particularly   their   provident    fund

retirement benefits. After these unfounded fears  were

dispelled  by  the Prime Minister's reference  to  the

P.A.V.   Five-Year   Programme   regarding   existing

provident fund benefits and his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



statement   that   the   Government's   position   was

unchanged, I advised the Prime Minister that  some  12

of  the 30 persons who had tendered their resignations

should  be  given  an opportunity to reconsider  their

position   in  the  light  of  the  Prime   Minister's

statement,  and  to  withdraw their  resignations  and

continue in service either on the old terms of service

or on contract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the 12 persons are four from the Treasury

whom   Government  indicated  should  be  given   this

opportunity.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a number of officers availed themselves

of  this opportunity. At the end of April, Mr  M.  R.

Marcus  applied  to return, and on  the  5th  of  May,

action was being taken to consider this matter. As  it

was considered that Mr M. R. Marcus had resigned,  on

persuasion,  through  fear  of  his  position  as   an

employee  of  the  City Council, and  as  he  had  not

participated in political activities, he was permitted

to  return  to the City Council. However, because  the

officer  had  resigned and taken  away  his  provident

fund, it was decided that he had to commence afresh at

the  beginning of the timescale of Assistant Secretary

on  a temporary basis at an all-in salary of $670  per

month,  which  was less than his basic salary  at  the

time of his resignation, which was $740 per month plus

existing  allowances.  He  was  posted  to  the   City

Council,  Health Department, to do administrative  and

secretarial  duties as the Department was short-handed

and     had     recently    assumed     administrative

responsibilities for the City Cleansing Department and

the   Markets  and  Hawkers  Department.   Under   the

circumstances  of  the  reemployment  of  Mr  Marcus,

reference  to the Public Service Commission under  the

Local Government Ordinance was not necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr L. A. Marcus, brother of Mr M. R. Marcus, who had

resigned  from the City Council on 5th  February,

1959,   subsequently  obtained   employment   in   the

Singapore  Harbour  Board.  When  the  Prime  Minister

assumed  Ministerial responsibility for the  Singapore

Harbour  Board, he made it clear to the Board that  he

did not consider that employees of Government or

quasi-Government agencies who became embroiled in  political

activities should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



enjoy  the  benefit  of employment  in  Government  or

Government  agencies. The Board gave consideration  to

this principle and subsequently dismissed Mr Marcus.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. As I have understood it up to

now,  the first charge is in relation to a Mr  M.  R.

Marcus.  The  Leader of the House now  happens  to  be

mentioning another Marcus. Could he indicate how  that

is relevant to the first charge?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I was just relating

certain facts in the consideration of re-employment of

employees  who  had previously left the City  Council.

Mr L. A. Marcus was one of them, and I brought it  up

incidentally.  If you will permit me  to  continue.  I

shall  now  go  on to Mr M. R. Marcus.  The  deciding

principle  is whether an officer had been  politically

involved or not involved. The decision did not rest on

the blood relationship of the officer to a Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with allegations Nos. 2 and 3

together.   These   allegations   were   made   during

consideration  of  item  (42) of  sub-head  1  (Deputy

Commissioner)  of  Head  36  (Inland  Revenue),   Main

Estimates, 1961. In page 2 of the transcript:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan: Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish

to   put  it  to  the  Minister  that  many  of  these

recommendations - which I have read myself - are meant for

the purpose of fixing up certain things.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Ong Eng Guan: In my opinion, there is nothing,

as  far  as I know, to merit this transfer other  than

the  fact  that he is the brother-in-law of the  Prime

Minister.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two allegations of the Member for Hong Lim

amount to nothing less than that improper interference

had  taken place in the appointment to a senior  civil

service post, even to the extent of prevailing upon  a

committee,  consisting  of a Permanent  Secretary  and

four  heads  of departments, to vary the qualification

for   that  post  so  as  to  accommodate  the   Prime

Minister's brother-in-law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are serious allegations and, in default

of  a  retraction, the House is entitled to  full  and

detailed  evidence in substantiation. Let me  set  out

the bare facts about this appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post in question is that of Deputy Commissioner

(Valuation)  in  the  Inland Revenue  Department.  The

duties of the post and the qualifications required  of

the  holder  were  set  out by the  Working  Party  of

departmental  heads,  and  headed  by  the   Permanent

Secretary  of  the  Treasury, which was  appointed  to

consider  the integration of the Assessment Department

of the City Council into the Inland Revenue Department

of  the  Government, as recommended  by  the  Canadian

experts.  The  Finance  Minister  has  read  out   the

relevant  sections  of the Working Party's  Report  on

this  post during the debate on Head 36 of  the  Main

Estimates  on the  12th  December.  Permit   me,   Mr

Speaker, to quote from the transcript of part  of  the

proceedings  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  of   12th

December, 1960. Page 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dr Goh Keng Swee: I think I could best elucidate by

reading  some extracts from the Report of the  Working

Party on the integration of the City Assessment Office

into  the Government. This Working Party consisted  of

the following officers:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Permanent Secretary (Treasury), as the Chairman;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Comptroller of Income Tax;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting City Assessor;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Valuer and Assessor, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Organisations and Methods Branch of

the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br>It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is proposed that the Commissioner of Inland

Revenue, Grade D, should be in charge of two branches.

In  the Income Tax, Estate and Stamp Duties Branch, he

will  continue to have a Deputy Commissioner who  will

be in charge of the Income Tax Office and an Assistant

Commissioner to be in charge of both the  Estate  Duty

and the Stamp Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other Valuation Branch, there should also be

a   Deputy  Commissioner,  Grade  G.  This  grade   is

suggested  so  that  there  would  be  parity  in  the

deputyship  of  the two branches. The duties  of  this

post  have  been carefully considered by the Committee

and  it is considered that his requirements should  be

administrative ability and experience since  he  would

be  assisted  in technical matters by both  the  Chief

Valuer and the Chief Assessor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



While  it  is  desirable  that  he  should  have  some

knowledge relating to valuation and assessment, it  is

however thought that it would not be necessary to have

a professionally qualified man for this purpose. It is

considered  by the Committee that both  the  posts  of

Chief Valuer and Chief Assessor should be on the upper

time-scale so as to be in line with their counterparts

in  the other branch. These posts are technical  posts

and  require  a  high  standard of  qualification  and

experience  and on that account there are difficulties

envisaged as these officers fetch a special  price  in

the  circumstances  existing in  Singapore.  It  would

therefore be necessary to consider special terms  that

can be offered to attract suitable candidates to carry

on the duties for the next few years.".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me now deal with the present

incumbent   of   the  post  whose   only   merit   for

appointment,  in  the opinion of the Member  for  Hong

Lim,  was that he was the Prime

Minister's brother-in-law.  This  officer was appointed into  the  Singapore

Administrative Service more than ten years ago, on the

12th  July,  1950.  When  the P.A.P.  Government  took

office,  he  was  already holding  a  Grade  G  acting

appointment  as  Deputy  Commissioner  of  Lands.  The

salary  was  $1,520. The Land Office  was,  until  1st

February, 1960, under the portfolio of the ex-Minister

for  National Development. This officer served in this

capacity    under   the   ex-Minister   for   National

Development.  On  the  1st February,  1960,  the  Land

Office   was   transferred  to  the  Prime  Minister's

Ministry.  On  the  24th May, 1960,  the  officer  was

transferred  to the Inland Revenue Department  of  the

Finance   Ministry,  to  act  as  Deputy  Commissioner

(Valuation)    in   consequence   of   City    Council

integration.  On  the 1st of July,  applications  were

invited  through  departmental  circulars  and   Press

advertisement   for   substantive   appointment.   The

applications  received were considered by  the  Public

Service Commission. Under section 81(1) and (2) of the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958,  the

appointment, promotion, transfer from one Division  or

Service  or  from one class or grade  to  another,  is

vested  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  acting   in

accorance  with  the  advice  of  the  Public  Service

Commission. The promotion of public officers shall, be

on  the  basis of official qualifications,  experience

and merit. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



clearly  seen  that the Public Service Commission  is

the  established and impartial authority  in  deciding

upon all appointments to the public service. And it is

the    authority   to   decide   upon   the   official

qualifications, experience and merit of candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Service Commission advised that this

officer be appointed. The advice of the Commission was

accepted  by  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  and  on  1st

August,  1960, the officer was substantively appointed

to  the  post.  At  the time of his  appointment,  the

officer was the most senior administrative officer  on

the time-scale. It is hardly necessary for one to make

the  point  that if ever the Prime Minister wanted  to

exercise   improper   nepotism   in   civil    service

appointments,  he  had  his  opportunity  between  1st

February,  1960,  and 23rd May,  1960,  when  his  own

brother-in-law served in his own Ministry. During this

period,   instead,   four  time-scale   Administrative

Officers  were  promoted to Superscale G appointments

but not the Prime Minister's brother-in-law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of my submissions, Sir, I await with

interest  what the Member for Hong Lim has to  say  in

reply.  But  let  us get from him a clear  categorical

reply. The charges made by the Member for Hong Lim are

extremely  grave, and if they cannot be substantiated,

I submit, Sir, that he is guilty of gross abuse of the

privilege  of  the  Assembly. If he  persists  in  his

allegations, he must, in my view, prove with the  full

weight of evidence both the following propositions:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The committee consisting of a Permanent

Secretary  and four departmental heads were improperly

prevailed  upon by political influence  to  frame  the

qualifications of the post to suit the appointment  of

the present incumbent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Member's own words, these recommendations

were "meant for the purpose of fixing certain things".

Sir, let him prove this proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Member must prove that either the

appointment  to the post was not made  by  the  Public

Service Commission or, if it was so made, that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



Public Service Commission was subjected and guided  to

improper  influence in making its recommendations  for

this appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have set out the facts to show that the allegations made by the Member for Hong Lim, which

I  have  tabled, are falsehoods. When a  falsehood  is

made, then it is proper for the Member for Hong Lim to

withdraw  his allegation. If the Member for  Hong  Lim

persists  in  believing that what he  has  alleged  is

true,  then he should be prepared to substantiate  his

allegations either inside or outside the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been very patient with the

Member  for Hong Lim in spite of the fact that he  has

been  persistent in making malicious falsehoods. Ample

opportunity   has  been  given  to   him   to   either

substantiate  or withdraw his allegations.  The  Prime

Minister   issued  a  public  statement  outside   the

Legislative  Assembly on Monday, 12th December,  1960,

which  was printed in the Straits Times, Nanyang Siang

Pau and Sin Chew Jit Poh, and reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Two months ago I had occasion to publicly call Mr

Ong Eng Guan a liar and a rogue outside the Assembly'-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In quoting a report from the

newspapers,  I do not think the Leader  of  the  House

would  be justified in mentioning words in the  report

which   are   recognised   in   this   House   to   be

unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall then

quote  the  relevant extracts from the  statement  and

leave  out  those terms which you have  judged  to  be

unparliamentary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... during this Budget debate, his ... habits have

returned. Today in the Assembly in a specific case  he

had  alleged that I am guilty of political  corruption

and nepotism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I there and then in the Assembly told him what I

thought  of him: that my life and conduct bear looking

into,  but  his life and conduct cannot  bear  looking

into. I am prepared to repeat what I have said to  him

in   the   Assembly  publicly  outside   without   the

protection of privilege.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then challenged him to repeat his charges against

me  made  in the Assembly. If he again runs away  from

exposure, then I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



intend to move in the Assembly a substantive motion on

his personal conduct which is debasing the dignity  of

the   Assembly  and  demeaning  the  prestige  of  its

members.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When no reply was forthcoming to this statement by

the  Prime Minister, a second statement was issued  on

Tuesday, 13th December, 1960, as follows: and I  quote

relevant  extracts  from  the  Straits  Times.   These

extracts were also published in the Nanyang Siang  Pau

and the Sin Chew Jit Poh:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Twenty-four hours have passed and I still want to

know whether Mr Ong Eng Guan is prepared to accept my

challenge that I repeat what I have said of him in the

Assembly and that he repeats what he has said of me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore are anti-yellow culture and

if  what I have said of Mr Ong Eng Guan is not  true,

then  it  is  a  damaging statement against  his  good

reputation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore are also against nepotism and

political  corruption. Let him repeat his  allegations

outside  without privilege and give me the  chance  to

show the people that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, in today's debate, at 4.45 p.m. he rose

to  object  to  the  word `lies'  being  used  in  the

Assembly  by the Minister for Culture, as  it  is  not

`parliamentary'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously then he is a very sensitive man. So he

should be prepared to defend his reputation."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7 p.m. on Tuesday, 13th December, 1960, the

Member  for Hong Lim finally issued a statement  which

was  reported in the Straits Times, the Nanyang  Siang

Pau and the Sin Chew ut Poh as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"In political struggles, the fighting of duels or

the  character  assassination of political  opponents,

have proved to be of no avail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Assembly debates, and even since the

P.A.P. crisis  and the Hong Lim resolutions,  I  have

tried  to  bring  out,  by  the  method  of  political

debates,  the  grave  political  issues  facing   this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My belief is that political issues, when mixed up

with  personal  feelings, will only serve  to  confuse

these vital issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical fights or resort to the machineries of the

State  cannot  help  to resolve  or  settle  political

differences,  nor  can  they  decide  which   of   the

conflicting political views and ideologies are in  the

best interests of the country. The people are the best

judge of political issues."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the published reply by the Member

for Hong Lim in the Press was neither a substantiation

of his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



allegations nor a withdrawal of what he has said.  But

it  was  clear that he had no intention to repeat  his

allegations   without  the  protection   of   Assembly

privilege.  His  statement  was  an  equivocation   to

confuse  people that his own honour has not been  lost

and  leave damaged the reputation of those whom he had

charged  in  his  allegations in this  House.  It  was

because of this evasion by the Member for Hong Lim  to

either substantiate or withdraw his charges inside the

Assembly or outside the Assembly that we are compelled

today to bring this motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be asked, Sir, why is the Government taking

such  a  serious view of malicious falsehoods  uttered

repeatedly  by the Member for Hong Lim in this  House;

what  possible  harm can be done to  a  government  or

individuals   who   have  been  victims   of   obvious

falsehoods?  Because we believe, Sir,  that  once  the

utterance of malicious falsehoods under the cloak  of

privilege  is  allowed  to become  a  normal  part  of

strategy of debate in this Assembly, then if a  Member

of  this Assembly is agile enough - quick enough - he can

assassinate  characters  and  reputations  of   people

inside  and  outside this Assembly by simply  uttering

falsehoods  and then withdrawing them as a  matter  of

routine. No individual who has; earned the displeasure

of  a  Member of this House will be free of  character

assassination, including those inside and outside this

Assembly  who  think that it is wrong to  censure  and

restrain  a Member who deliberately uses this Assembly

for  spreading falsehoods about innocent  Members.  If

that happens, democracy will be brought not only, into

contempt  but freedom of speech becomes  a  means  for

libelling of innocent people, for spreading terror and

for smearing reputations. This must be the consequence

for  democracy  if  the malicious  falsehoods  of  the

Member for Hong Lim are shrugged away in, the name  of

freedom of speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be contended, Sir, that nobody inside or

outside  this Assembly, including the Member for  Hong

Lim, believes these malicious falsehoods. A great many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



people   do   not,   but  by  persistently   repeating

falsehoods  in  this Chamber, you can create  a  vague

mist  of corruption, deceit and moral turpitude around

a  person  or a group of persons. Malicious falsehoods

however  unfounded,  by constant  repetition,  may  be

believed  by  those  unacquainted with  the  rules  of

privilege  of  this Assembly to be  founded  on

half-truths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge is that the Member for Hong Lim is using

this  Assembly and the privilege he enjoys  to  repeat

malicious  and  unfounded falsehoods with  a  view  to

getting  them  printed in the Press and circulated  by

word  of  mouth. The issue reduced to its  essence  is

this. Did the Member for Hong Lim use his privilege in

this  Assembly to propagate falsehoods or did he  not?

If  the  Member for Hong Lim believes that the charges

he  uttered  are true, then he should be  prepared  to

repeat them outside without the protection of Assembly

privilege.   For   if   he   really   believes   these

allegations, then he should not be afraid of repeating

them,  but  he would be afraid of repeating them  only

if, he knew in his heart of hearts that the charges he

made   were  false  and  that  they  would  not  stand

examination before an impartial tribunal.  Our  charge

is  that  he  knows these allegations  are  completely

false and that he dares make them only if he can  hide

behind  the  shield of privilege.  So  the  choice  of

deciding on this motion lies with the Member for  Hong

Lim.  It is up to him to decide either to withdraw  or

to  substantiate his charges. First, if  he  genuinely

believes  that  these allegations are  true,  then  he

should  not  be  afraid to repeat  them  outside  this

Assembly  without cover of privilege.  The  moment  he

does  that,  he continues to sit in the  Assembly.  At

least,  he would show he sincerely believes  in  these

falsehoods and leave the injured parties to prove that

he  is wrong. Secondly, if he believes-as we think  he

does - these  are falsehoods, the honourable  thing  for

him  to  do is to acknowledge them and thus put  right

the grave wrong he has done to innocent people. If  he

does  this,  then he still continues  to  sit  in  the

Assembly and indulge - if he is so minded - in free



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



criticism  of  Government,  however  unfair,   however

improbable.  Whatever the course the Member  for  Hong

Lim  takes, let there be no confusion about  the  only

and  real purpose of this motion, and that - is  this:

should  the  Assembly be used as  a  cover  to  injure

innocent people through deliberate and persistent  use

of  malicious falsehoods? The right of free speech  is

not  involved. What is questioned is the  practice  of

uttering   malicious   falsehoods   under   cover   of

privilege. The Member for Hong Lim can indulge  in  as

much  criticism as he likes and continue to remain  in

the Assembly if he refrains from using his position in

this  House  for  the  purpose of  uttering  malicious

falsehoods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in accordance with the basic principle of

justice  that no man should be the prosecutor  in  his

own case, both the Prime Minister and the Minister for

Labour and Law will not be speaking on the motion, but

they are ready, if the Member for Hong Lim decides  to

substantiate, to give evidence on oath as to the truth

relating to these matters complained of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me to remind the House of

the  role  of  the Legislative Assembly.  A  civilised

democratic  State  rests on three pillars.  The  first

pillar  is the Legislature. The second pillar  is  the

Executive  and the instruments of the Executive,  that

is,    the    Government,   Ministers,   Parliamentary

Secretaries, civil service, the Police and other  arms

of  administration. The third pillar is the Judiciary.

If  any of these three pillars becomes worm-eaten  or

corroded, the whole structure of the democratic  State

collapses.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   it   is   a   heavy

responsibility and duty of Members of this House, both

on  the  Government side and the Opposition  side,  to

maintain  the integrity, dignity and prestige  of  the

Legislature.  When the privilege of a  Member  of  the

Assembly  is  misused,  the  integrity,  dignity   and

prestige  of  the  Legislature are  violated.  If  the

Legislative Assembly is degraded, then the  people  of

Singapore who are represented today in this House must

also feel degraded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past twelve months, we

have  watched with concern and dismay that the  fabric

of  orderly government in certain States which do  not

have   a   traditional  legislature   or   where   the

legislature has been abused has collapsed. We  do  not

wish to see it happen in Singapore. Our Legislature is

very  young and it is our bounden duty to nourish this

young plant so that it will develop into a healthy and

sturdy tree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this then is the crux of the

complaint - that the abuse of privilege  by  the  Member

for Hong Lim has brought the Legislature into contempt

and ridicule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the complaints I

have  specified, it is our right to expect the  Member

for  Hong,  Lim  either to substantiate  them  or

to withdraw  them. If he does not substantiate  and  also

refuses  to withdraw, then I must ask the Assembly  to

join  us  in  condemning  him  for  his  dishonourable

conduct  and find him guilty of a breach of  privilege

of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As it has already been pointed out, the

motion is in two distinct parts. The first part  seeks

to  call upon the House to condemn the Member for Hong

Lim, and the second part suggests the punishment to be

meted  out  to  him. In accordance with  parliamentary

practice  in  these matters, I shall now  propose  the

Question on the first part only, and shall deal  with

the second part after the first part has been disposed

of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question then is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House condemns the Member for Hong Lim

for his dishonourable conduct unbecoming of an elected

representative  of  the people in that  he  repeatedly

used  his  privilege in this Assembly as a  cloak  for

spreading  malicious  falsehoods  to  unjustly  injure

innocent   persons  both  inside  and   outside   this

Assembly;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in accordance with parliamentary practice, does

the  Member  for Hong Lim wish to make a statement  in

explanation  or exculpation in regard to  the  charges

made  against him? If he so desires, this is the  time

to make the statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

comes  a  time  in  the history of many  nations  when

changes were made to existing political forms. Some of

these changes have been brought about by a revolution,

others by constitutional means.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member for Hong Lim must

realise that he is now in the position of a defendant,

and  all he has to do in these proceedings is to offer

a    statement   in   explanation,   exculpation    or

extenuation;  or  he  may  simply  say  he  wishes  to

substantiate  these  allegations,  in  which  case   a

certain  course may proceed therefrom. I do not  think

it  is  proper for the Member for Hong Lim  to  embark

upon  a  long speech which has nothing to do with  the

matters  I  have indicated. He has, of  course,  other

opportunities of doing that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I must have the

necessary  introduction to explain the  points  raised

just now by the Leader of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the annals of British parliamentary history, both

in  the House of Commons and in the Dominions of other

Commonwealth Legislatures, today's motion  is  unique.

In  the  past  few days I have searched  in  vain  for

similar  precedents in the history  of  the  House  of

Commons. I could find none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Leader of the House just now

quoted  twelve breaches of privileges.  He  could  not

name  which  of  the twelve instances  quoted  have  I

committed  a  breach. He has also  not  given  us  the

distinction between an abuse of privilege and a breach

of  privilege, and he seems to confuse himself between

a breach of privilege and an abuse of privilege.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion, in effect, means that

the electorate of Hong Lim shall not be represented in

this  Assembly  if  I  refuse to  apologise,  for  the

lifetime  of this Government, which is 3� years.  In

the British House of Commons, there had been instances

of Members of Parliament being suspended, but they had

been suspended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



because  they  had  been charged for disregarding  the

authority of the Speaker, or had been persistently and

wilfully obstructing the business of' Parliament.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am not being charged with any of these

offences.  I understand that in the House of  Commons,

no Member of Parliament has been suspended since 1877,

except  under  the  British House of Commons  Standing

Order   22,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  Singapore

Legislative Assembly Standing Order No. 56. This, Sir,

is to punish Members for disregarding the authority of

the   Speaker   or  for  persistently   and   wilfully

obstructing the business of the Assembly. Such  action

of  suspending any Member has always been initiated by

the Speaker and not by the governing Party. It must be

made immediately after the offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under today's motion introduced by the Leader

of  the House, and not by the Speaker, I am not  being

charged that I have violated Standing Order 56.  I  am

not  being charged with disorderly conduct. I  am  not

being    charged   for   persistently   and   wilfully

obstructing the business of the Assembly. I  am  being

charged  by the majority governing Party for so-called

"dishonourable  conduct". I am being  charged  by  the

majority governing Party-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not wish to interrupt the

hon. Member in such a serious matter as this, but  the

epithet   that   he  is  using,  so-called   "majority

governing  Party", has nothing at all to do  with  the

motion. The motion is an invitation to the House as  a

whole  to  say that the hon. Member for  Hong  Lim  is

guilty of dishonourable conduct. And epithets of  that

nature  used by the Member for Hong Lim, I think,  are

out of place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I make an

explanation why I use this? The position in the  House

of  Commons and the position of the party system there

is  basically different from the party system  in  the

Singapore Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That does not make any

difference  at all to the position in so far  as  this

particular motion is concerned. I thought  I  made  it

quite clear when I made the announcement to honourable

Members  before the business of the day started.  That

was my view and I hold that view. And I think the hon.

Member for Hong Lim should abide by that view.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

charged  for making unfounded allegations and uttering

malicious  falsehoods. There has been no precedent  in

British   parliamentary  history  that  a  Member   of

Parliament    has   been   charged    for    so-called

dishonourable    conduct,   for    making    unfounded

allegations  and  for  so-called  uttering   malicious

falsehoods.  I  have searched for  precedents,  and  I

cannot find any.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this motion today, I am not charged with any

infringement of any of the 103 Standing Orders of  the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly. The motion today  has

nothing  to do with violation of the Standing  Orders,

which  regulate the conduct of this Assembly.  It  has

not  been introduced under any Standing Orders. It  is

being  introduced solely on the British  legal  theory

that   Parliament  is  sovereign  and  can  pass   any

resolution,  and can enact any law under the  sun,  so

long  as the majority in Parliament assents to it.  It

is argued that the Singapore Legislative Assembly



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me that the hon.

Member for Hong Lim is now questioning whether or  not

the  motion itself as a motion is in order. May I know

whether he is questioning that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In that event, the argument that

he  is now advancing, I think, would be an argument in

another  forum.  I, as Speaker of this Assembly,  have

not   discarded   the  notice  of  motion   as   being

inadmissible. To my mind, the motion, for the  reasons

I have endeavoured to enunciate, is a proper motion in

so  far  as  the  Standing Orders are  concerned,  and

therefore must be debated as such.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government

in   this  Assembly  has  pledged  to  carry  out  the

traditions of British Parliamentary democracy.  May  I

quote  from  Sir  Ivor  Jennings  in  his  chapter  on

"Parliamentary Democracy", pages 530  to  532  of  his

book on "Parliament":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`British constitutional history is a story of

resistance   to  oppression.  The  Magna  Carta,   the

Petition  of  Right,  the Act of Settlement,  and  the

Habeas  Corpus Acts, bear witness to the legal devices

that have been made to destroy oppression and maintain

freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal devices are not and cannot be enough. In Great

Britain, in particular, they are wholly ineffective as

against  a  Parliament. For, as  Lord  Burleigh  said,

"England can never be ruined but by a Parliament"; and

when  the House of Commons tried to exclude the member

for Middlesex Junius wrote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can never be really in danger till the forms of

Parliament  are made use of to destroy the  substance

of our civil and political liberties: till Parliament

itself   betrays   its  trust,  by  contributing   to

establish new principles of government; and employing

the  very  weapons committed to it by the  collective

body to stab the Constitution."



<br><br>In  the  last  resort  all legal  principles  and  all

constitutional checks depend on the proper exercise of

the  "transcendent and absolute" power of  Parliament.

The  power  of  the Opposition itself  rests  only  on

sufferance.   There  is  nothing   whatever   in   the

constitutional machinery that prevents  an  Opposition

from being suppressed. Nor is there anything effective

to  prevent  the  power of the Opposition  from  being

completely  destroyed  by  the  destruction  of   free

elections.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hesitate quite a lot in rising

to  intervene in this debate, because the position  is

that  this is a serious matter which affects not  only

the  Member for Hong Lim but also the Members of  this

Assembly as a whole. The question I would like to pose

to  the Member for Hong Lim is this - is he denying that

this  Assembly has the authority to proceed with  this

motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an

opportunity which I think anybody in my position would

like  to make use of to explain himself. And I beg  of

you, in the traditions of British Parliaments, to give

me a better chance to explain myself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is aware, and I

think  all  Members in this House are  aware,  that  I

endeavour to keep a fair balance on both sides. It  is

my  duty,  however distasteful it is, to see that  the

Standing Orders are followed as closely as may be. And

if   our  Standing  Orders  do  not  provide  for  the

situation,  then I am impelled to go to  the  Standing

Orders of the House of Commons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ruling has been that this Assembly is competent

to  hear  a motion of this nature in so far, at  least

anyway,  as the first part of the motion is concerned.

I  have  raised, I hope, some doubts in regard to  the

second  part of the motion. If the hon. Member is  not

satisfied  with that ruling, then, of course,  be  has

his remedy under the Standing Orders. His remedy is, I

think, under Standing Order 53:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Speaker in the Assembly or the Chairman in

Committee  shall be responsible for the observance  of

the  rules  of  order  in the Assembly  and  Committee

respectively  and his decision on any point  of  order

shall  not be open to appeal and shall not be reviewed

by the Assembly except upon a substantive motion moved

for that purpose. Notwithstanding anything in Standing

Order  No. 31 (Manner of giving Notices) such a motion

shall not require more than two clear days' notice.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My difficulty in this matter is, of course, to try

and  channel the debate to its proper course. And  the

proper  course,  in  my view, is  the  course  I  have

endeavoured to pursue, and that is that the Leader  of

the  House,  in  moving his motion, makes  his  charge

against  the Member for Hong Lim, and the  Member  for

Hong Lim can reply. As a rejoinder from the Member for

Hong Lim, he either says that the charges he made, are

wrong,  and then withdraws them, or he says  that  the

charges are right and he wishes to substantiate  them.

That  is all I think there is before the House at  the

moment. If, as I say, the hon. Member feels that  this

House  is not competent to carry on with this  motion,

which  I have ruled is a motion which can properly  be

taken in this House, then, as I have indicated, he  is

at  liberty  to give two days' notice of a  motion  to

overrule my ruling. If he chooses to take that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



course,  I would suggest to the House that the  debate

on  this motion should be adjourned in order to enable

him to do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am not

challenging  the competence of this House  to  discuss

this motion. I am sure you will remember that just now

the  Leader  of  the  House in  his  speech  mentioned

democaracy, free speech and all the other things which

he  has  brought up in the debate to substantiate  his

argument. Mr Speaker, Sir, you should also give me  a

chance to give my views on those points. They will all

be  relevant to what he has been saying, in  order  to

explain myself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps I have not made myself

quite  clear. The Leader of the House, of course,  was

under a duty to satisfy the House that the proceedings

he  was  taking  were proper, and  could  be  properly

debated  in this House. The hon. Member for Hong  Lim

is  not in the same position. His position, as  I  see

it,  is  that  of a defendant. Therefore,  all  he  is

concerned with is the substance of the charges brought

against him. That is all he is concerned with at  this

sitting.  If  the Member for Hong Lim says  that  this

House is competent to hear these charges, then that is

the  end of the matter and I cannot allow any argument

from  the  Member  to  show  that  the  House  is  not

competent. If, on the other hand, the hon. Member  for

Hong  Lim  maintains that the House is not  competent,

then I have indicated the course he can take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion

states, in the first place, that I have been guilty of

dishonourable conduct -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us clear this point, because

I  do not wish the hon. Member for Hong Lim to go away

with the impression that I have prevented him, or this

House  has  prevented  him, from  saying  anything  he

wishes  to  say. If the Member for Hong Lim  considers

that the point he is making is a point of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



importance, then I would urge that he take the  course

I  have  suggested, so that no person either in  this

Assembly  or outside can say that the hon. Member  for

Hong  Lim has not been given the opportunity of saying

all that he wishes to say in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be convenient to suspend for an

hour  for tea. I suspend for an hour. I will take this

Chair again at twenty-five to six.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.35 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question,

"That this House condemns the Member for Hong Lim  for

his  dishonourable conduct unbecoming  of  an  elected

representative  of  the people in that  he  repeatedly

used  his  privilege in this Assembly as a  cloak  for

spreading  malicious  falsehoods  to  unjustly  injure

innocent   persons  both  inside  and   outside   this

Assembly."



<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members will remember that

the  Question was proposed on the first  part  of  the

motion, that is, "That this House condemns the  Member

for  Hong Lim for his dishonourable conduct unbecoming

of  an elected representative of the people in that he

repeatedly  used his privilege in this Assembly  as  a

cloak  for spreading malicious falsehoods to  unjustly

injure  innocent persons both inside and outside  this

Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will know that just before I

suspended  this sitting, I suggested a certain  course

of  action to the Member for Hong Lim. May I know from

the  Member  for Hong Lim whether he is adopting  that

suggestion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am adopting the

course of action suggested by you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have notice of the motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of motion handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The notice of motion just handed in by

the Member for Hong Lim reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the ruling of the Speaker admitting the motion

of  the  Deputy Prime Minister in regard to the Member

for  Hong Lim be rescinded and that this Assembly  has

no  jurisdiction  to  deal  with  the  matters  raised

therein.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Order, as I did indicate, requires two

clear  days' notice of that motion. That will take  us

to Friday, the 23rd of December. It is now entirely up

to  the  Leader of the House to decide whether or  not

the  Member  for Hong Lim be given the opportunity  of

moving that motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it is not the

intention of the House to prevent the Member for  Hong

Lim  from speaking in this Chamber; neither is it  our

intention not to give him time to seek advice  on  his

motion.  As  he so decides, I will move, Mr  Speaker,

that  this  Assembly do now adjourn  to  Friday,  23rd

December.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We have not disposed of the motion.

Does the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister wish that  the

debate on the motion be adjourned, to start off with?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. If the House

assents,  we do wish that the debate on the  motion  I

have introduced today be adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The relevant Standing Order is Standing

Order 24, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At any time before the conclusion of the

consideration of any item of business any  Member  may

move  "That  the debate be now adjourned" ... and  if

such motion is agreed to the debate shall be adjourned

...  The Speaker shall call upon the Member in  charge

of  that item of business to name a later sitting  day

for its resumption...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the relevant portion of the Standing Order. So

the  first  thing, I think, is for the Leader  of  the

House   to  just  move,  "That  the  debate   be   now

adjourned", and we will deal with that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I beg to move, That the debate on

the  motion  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  be  now

adjourned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the motion by the Deputy Prime

Minister be now adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Debate to be resumed, what day?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Friday, the 23rd December, 1960.

adjournment?
