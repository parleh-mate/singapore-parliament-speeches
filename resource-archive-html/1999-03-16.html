<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MR HO JUAN THAI</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

if  he  will give a categorical assurance that Mr Ho  Juan  Thai

will not be detained under the Internal Security Act if and when

he returns to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Mr  J  B Jeyaretnam's request is ridiculous.  Mr Ho is not above

the  law.  The Government cannot give an assurance to Mr Ho that

amounts  to  perpetual immunity over the laws of the land  which

include the Internal Security Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Ho is genuinely interested to return to Singapore, he

should  take up the Government's offer of a one-way Document  of

Identity to return.  As mentioned to the House previously, Mr Ho

will  be  questioned  by the relevant authorities  for  possible

offences  under  the Immigration Act and the Enlistment  Act  as

well  as  over  his racially inflammatory speeches  at  election

rallies during the December 1976 General Election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Ho is guilty of any wrong-doing that warrants his

arrest  or  detention under any law, Mr Ho must  be  dealt  with

accordingly.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I tell

the  Minister of State that my question is directed particularly

at  detention under the Internal Security Act.  Is the  Minister

aware  that  for  altering the passport he could  be  prosecuted

under  the  Penal  Code  or the Passports  Act,  similarly,  for

evading  National  Service  under the National  Enlistment  Act?

What is the offence for which the ISD wish to question him under

the Internal Security Act?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think the answer makes it

very  clear.   The  ISD  would like to  question  him  over  his

inflammatory remarks made in 1976 during the general election.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister tell us what were these

inflammatory   speeches?   Were  they  not  what   the   present

Government is advocating, ie, he was calling for greater use  of

Mandarin  and, particularly, for students at Nanyang  University

to take their examinations in Mandarin, and not in English?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think Mr Jeyaretnam is

being  very  simplistic.  In fact, in an exchange with  Mr  Chua

Sian Chin, then Minister for Home Affairs in 1983, and also in a

written  reply  in 1982, they set out what Mr Ho Juan  Thai  had

said.  He had said that Government was out to exterminate, kill,

wipe out, Chinese culture, language and education and asked  for

the  Chinese  people to stand up.  These were very  inflammatory

remarks  made  during the general election to  a  big  crowd  of

people on four occasions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister please answer my

question?   Was he or was he not advocating the use of Mandarin,

particularly   for  students  to  take  their  examinations   in

Mandarin?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I have already told this

House  the  words that he had used, not advocating  the  use  of

Mandarin, but he accused the Government of exterminating, wiping

out, killing Chinese language, culture and education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government Parliamentary Committee has submitted

the  review  of the Vehicle Quota System and we have  made  some

specific recommendations with the terms of reference set by  the

Minister.   I will not go into the details of this report  which

have been variously carried in the press.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most impressive statements that I heard during

all those hours of discussions and dialogues came from a freight

forwarder.   After  all the feedback and complaints,  as  usual,

during  a 3-hour session, he stood up and confessed that in  all

his  more than 30 years of the freighting business in Singapore,

only  today,  in spite of so many vehicles on the road,  can  he

really be confident to plan and execute a freight operation from

one end of Singapore to the port, to time it such that there  is

a  minimum of delay and time loss, and in the shortest  possible

time,  in  order  for  his goods to go up the  container  vessel

berthed at the port just in time.  He does this every day in his

business.   He  attributed this to the VQS and the  Government's

forward  looking  systematic  policies  on  land  transport   in

Singapore.   It  is  the  power of  technology  and  system  and

political  will.  This was the greatest compliment I  heard  for

the  Minister and his Ministry.  Unfortunately, the Minister was

not there, and it is not in the report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report made several recommendations which I will just

highlight in order to give other Members the chance to have a go

at  it.  We recommended to retain the system, although  we  went

into  it  with  an  open mind.  We found large support  for  the

retention of the system with the lowest successful bid  approach

as against the pay-as-you-bid approach.  We recommended that the

Government should consider raising the cap of 3% in view of  the

ERP system which can address usage costs more efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recommended the merging of Categories 1 and 2, and

3  and 4 into two classes, the line being drawn at the 1,600 cc.

Ideally, we believe there should be one category of cars.  We do

not  recommend loading the already complicated COE  system  with

all kinds of social equity reasons and factors, so that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>

value,  benefit and costs are transparent and clear to all.   Of

course,  we cannot completely dismantle the present system,  but

the Minister should be clear of our direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By giving a bigger category size, ie, a larger number of

COE  quota  with  the  merged  category,  we  should  find  more

competition,  choice and a more stable outcome.   In  fact,  too

small  a  category  size  leads to  a  high  possibility  of  an

anomalous  outcome.   Merging the categories  also  gives  wider

choice  of cars, and a more competitive environment for business

benefiting the larger number of consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recommended to even out the surge in COE in the

year  2000 by distributing it over two years, namely,  2000  and

2001.  For everyone who owns or successfully bids for a COE, the

Government must also be able to justify to the larger population

who   use  public  transport  and  pay  taxes,  that  the   road

infrastructures  are  put to good use and  social  benefits  and

costs  must also be weighed against private benefits and  costs.

The  Government must be fair overall and not just please or  bow

to  one section of car dealers or population who may have  their

own preferences or legitimate interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are for a more dynamic mechanism with a revised formula

that  collapses  the time lag and allocates the distribution  to

reflect  changing preferences of the car buying public,  instead

of  being  locked  into  a distribution function  of  COEs  that

reflect preferences 10 years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also made a recommendation for a trial out of an open-bid system in the open category. I will go into this a while.

After  all  these recommendations, we ended with a  prayer.   We

hope  the  dealers  will  provide a more transparent  and  arm's

length,  above-the-table engagement with  customers,  especially

those  who  bid  on  their  own.  We  do  not  believe  all  the

unfavourable  comments  we  have received  on  the  dealers  are

justified,  and  we do not agree to the call to  ban  them  from

bidding.  We believe they perform a service in the economy.  The

solution is to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>

make  the  system more transparent and even out the  information

discrepancies arising from knowledge of market and experience in

bidding  or collusive power.  Ten years ago, the technology  and

processes did not allow such a wide area open bid to be possible

but  today  with  information technology  and  computing  power,

electronic bidding goes on all over the world, every  minute  of

the day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways in which an auction can be conducted.

It  puzzles  me  how  before  the model  is  even  specified  or

developed, a writer to the Straits Times yesterday can  talk  of

the flaws of an open-bid system.  Caricatures of it appeared  in

the  press, like frenzied bidding for some rare art piece or the

seventh moon or-kim.  However, it will not be the first time  an

electronic real time open bid auction is done in Singapore.  The

pig  auction in Singapore is done electronically on a real  time

open  bid  basis daily.  It has been done so for  more  than  10

years.   Do we find the prices of pork unduly higher because  of

some  cornering  of  pork  for market  share  or  some  frenzied

consumption  of  pork  over  the  last  10  years?   The  person

responsible  for  developing this open bid real time  electronic

auction  system for pigs more than 10 years ago is sitting  very

comfortably in the front bench as Minister and Government  Whip.

Of  course,  the  technology was different but  the  fundamental

concept is the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, rules apply for such bid processes. Hence, I am

confident  the  study  will come out with  a  model,  which  can

overcome the many fears expressed.  I wish to thank all for  the

feedback.   No  one can give you the outcome of a  bid  process,

whether  it is going to be high or low.  If he can, it has  been

fixed.   The COE allocation or bidding mechanism can  only  take

care  of  the  supply side.  We should make it more  stable  and

predictable, more transparent.  The demand side depends  on  the

buyers.   It depends on rationality, information power,  income,

economic  outlook,  expectations  and  the  value  perceived  by

buyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open-bid system gives a more transparent model with

information to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>

the  buyers.  The mandate to bid can also be given to  a  dealer

but the mandate is transparent between the buyer and the dealer.

This  way the buyer knows exactly what the dealer is bidding  on

his  behalf or whether it is within the mandate.  Alternatively,

the  buyer  bids  on  his  own.  In  a  close  bid  system,  the

information is not revealed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many kinds of auction systems that are practised

by businesses all over the world.  For example, there is the one-sided auction, the two-sided auction, the Dutch auction and  the

English  auction.   However, unfortunately,  what  we  are  more

familiar here is only the seventh moon auction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open bid model we are advocating that fits our system

is  the  one-sided open competitive bid auction, with the lowest

successful  bid.  It can be coupled with a Dutch  auction  where

you bid down, or an English auction method where you bid up.   I

suggest  we  leave  the  details and the process  to  the  study

committee,  which will come out with the proper model  that  can

address the real nitty-gritty issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of experimental economics is full of such case

studies.  There is a wealth of literature to draw on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All over the world today, consumers want to have the

information and the power to choose and decide.  Companies  with

hundreds  of billions of dollars of sales are studying ways  and

means towards a more efficient consumer response  using IT, with

more  rational  processes.  They are all re-evaluating  and  re-constructing   their  supply  chain  using  IT   for   efficient

processes.  All over the world, electronic bids are done on  the

Internet,  for  example, E-bay dot.com.  Business  process  will

have  to change to a more efficient way of doing things for  the

open world.  The same goes for the bidding system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans deserve and should be given the information

and the responsibility for their decision and action.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>

consumers  will have an important say in this and will determine

the  outcome  of  the bid which will reflect the  social  market

value.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up, Mr Chay. Dr Toh.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I sat on the VQS Review

Committee   as   a   member  of  the  GPC  for   Communications.

Unavoidable,  of  course,  I brought  in  my  experiences  as  a

consumer   advocate,  being  the  President  of  the  Consumers'

Association of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VQS is not a consumer issue directly. It is a

mechanism  to  allocate scarce resources.   It  is  a  mechanism

whereby  the Government decides that the growth of vehicles  has

got  to be controlled, and this control mechanism means that the

quota  is fixed as to who will get cars from this quota.  It  is

what the VQS is all about.  In the process of buying a car which

is,  of course, a consumer issue, the consumer wants to be  able

to  buy  with a free choice.  In other words, in an ideal system

he should be able to get a COE and then go round to shop for his

car.   And  if he leaves the COE with the dealer that  does  not

satisfy  his needs after maybe one, two bids, and one  month  or

two  months,  he  can  take  back the  COE  and  go  to  another

organisation that deals with a different car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that the consumer faces is that at this moment,

he  feels  that the system is stacked too much against him,  and

too  much for the dealer.  For example, COE, even though it  can

be  bidded in the name of an individual, IC number is given, but

the c/o address is always the dealer's address.  So the COE goes

to  the  dealer  and stays with him.  And that  means  that  the

dealer  has got quite a few COEs in his command.  He can command

and  manipulate prices, and he can hold on to the COE, and  tell

the consumer, "Look, you go to another dealer, you are not going

to get another car, because I have the COE."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another situation is where the consumer says, "I will get

the  COE myself."  And he brings this COE to the dealer, and the

dealer says, "Hey, you got your own COE, I am not going to  sell

you a car."  Or he says, "Yes, I will sell you the car, but I am

not  giving  you my special offer prices."  And this would  mean

that ultimately the consumer says, "I have no choice."  You  say

I  have a choice, but it is a Hobson's choice, it is not a  real

choice.   So it would be good.  And I think, having sat  on  the

VQS  Committee,  argued all these points, I  have  come  to  the

conclusion that actually, as many consumers do realise, the  VQS

is  a good system and it should be kept.  But I think we need to

address  some  of these issues so that ultimately the  consumer,

for  example,  knows that he really has a choice.  I  personally

feel, of course, that if you ban dealers from bidding, it is not

an  answer.  Because then we will create actually a new class of

professionals called car brokers, car dealers, COE brokers,  who

will  then  do  what the dealers are doing.  Because  ultimately

some  consumers  do  not have the time,  they  do  want  to  pay

somebody to do it for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government when it considers the

review of the open bidding system that we build in some measures

to  make sure that frenzied bidding, cornering of the market and

this  whole idea that consumers cannot bid because they have  no

information.  all  these  will  be  taken  care  of,   so   that

ultimately, even if there is a bid, the consumers know  that  it

is a fair and level playing field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for suggestions like scaling and pay-as-you-bid system,

I  would ask the Government to even consider if these things can

be worked into the open bidding system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, there has

understandably  been  much  concern and  anticipation  over  the

proposed  changes to the COE and the Vehicle Quota  System.   In

general, I am supportive of the recommendations made by the  GPC

Committee on revising the Vehicle Quota System.  However, I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>

my reservations regarding the proposed open bidding system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Vehicle Quota System is not perfect. We all

know that.  However, there are merits to the system, and it  has

served  our  purposes very well all these  years.   The  present

system  of limiting vehicle growth through a quota system should

stay.   However,  refinement or fine-tuning  may  be  necessary.

Changes  towards  more  transparency,  as  recommended  by   the

Committee,  whilst beneficial may impact greatly  upon  existing

users   and   consumers.   Hence,  I  believe  the   Committee's

recommendation  of  progressive change by trying  out  the  open

bidding system with only one category of vehicles at the  moment

is  useful, as it allows consumers and participants in  the  car

market  to  adjust  progressively towards a new  system,  if  it

works.   This  also allows for refinement to the  system  should

open  bidding  for  the open category be subject  to  abuse  and

manipulation later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the principles of transparency and gradual

change,  I  am  pleased  to  note that  the  Committee  is  also

recommending  collapsing the two categories down  to  two  broad

ones.   This  is  sensible in my mind, as congestion  costs  for

vehicles  are  not directly correlated with the size  of  engine

capacities for cars.  There had been occasions in the past where

due  to  affordability of the smaller capacity  vehicle  owners,

COEs  for  these smaller categories were higher than  those  for

larger categories.  Consumers who have no choice but to purchase

less  powerful cars unfortunately end up paying more  for  their

COEs,  compared to consumers who are able to afford  the  larger

cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the proposal to streamline the categories into

two  will  in part address this anomaly and flatten  the  spread

across the categories, not to mention the freak result of a  $50

COE.  However, I would like to raise a matter of serious concern

-   the   underlying  assumptions  of  open  bidding.   Firstly,

consumers  are rational.  We assume that they can make  informed

decisions that best reflect their self-interest.  Secondly,  the

transparency of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>

the  system in itself would cancel out possible abuses since the

free market competition will set the price.  Sir, the failure of

any or both of these conditions may disadvantage the majority of

Singaporean  car owners.  It is inevitable that there  would  be

asymmetry  in  information accessed by both the laymen  and  the

specialists  in the motor trade.  If buyers are allowed  to  bid

and  withdraw  at  will, which may happen  in  an  open  bidding

system,  there  could  be manipulation of  prices  by  concerted

parties who may have an interest in maintaining vehicle price at

a particular level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, the kiasu mentality of Singaporeans could

result  in  extensive  tendering, leading  to  misallocation  of

resources.  Since, in order to ensure that one gets the COE,  it

is  more  likely  that competitive bidding may  lead  to  higher

prices,  which  may not necessarily reflect an efficient  market

pricing  for  this reason, as well as the potential manipulation

of  prices  by interested parties.  This is a matter of  serious

concern  to many Singaporeans who have voiced objection  to  the

open  bidding system, considering the difficult economic  period

that we are all going through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I would strongly recommend that along with

greater transparency and open bidding, we also try out the  pay-as-you-bid system.  This would ensure responsible bidding and it

would  not  result  in artificially raising  the  average  price

through the possible anomalies highlighted above, benefiting all

users and consumers in the long run.  With a combination of open

bidding  and  pay-as-you-bid system, it  is  unlikely  that  the

"winner's  curse"  situation, as argued by the Committee,  would

result,  as consumers would be making bids responsibly based  on

up-to-date information, and can best reflect their own  interest

and demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, neither system is without its merits and flaws. I

would like to strongly recommend to the Minister that we use the

proposed  refinements of the categories to test the  pay-as-you-bid system

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>

which has a lot of support from the public.  For a start, we can

continue  with the status quo arrangement for the 1,600  cc  and

below   category.    We  can  also  take  up   the   Committee's

recommendations  for  open bidding to be experimented  with  the

Open  Category.  My proposal is that we use the same  period  in

assessing the open bidding system for the Open Category to  test

the  pay-as-you-bid system for the 1,600 cc and above  category.

This  will ensure that we can have a gradual approach to  change

while  evaluating all three systems together, in order  to  best

decide once and for all which is the best system for us.  Let us

try  out  the  three  systems  simultaneously  among  the  three

categories  of vehicles and review them, perhaps,  in  a  year's

time, to decide which is an ideal system for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will take up these suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I was one of the

members  in  this  Committee.  I rise  to  lend  support  to  my

Chairman.   And  I  would like the House to  know  that  we  did

deliberate  very seriously on this matter.  We invited  so  many

groups  of  people to come, representing people of  many  varied

interests, including the individual car owners.  So I would  say

that we did a very thorough study on this matter.  And I thought

that  at  this juncture, after having heard Mr Chew  Heng  Ching

mentioning  the  pay-as-you-bid system, maybe I  would  like  to

state  our Committee's reasons why we did not accept the pay-as-you-bid proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee actually received several suggestions to

replace the current single strike price system, with the pay-as-you-bid system, or its variations such as asking the top 10%  or

20%  successful bidders to pay their bid amounts.  We have given

these suggestions due consideration in the course of our review.

The  Committee is of the view that the pay-as-you-bid system  is

not   superior  to  the  current  system.   It   has   its   own

shortcomings.   But  some  of  the  feedback  received  by   the

Committee had expressed the following concerns about the pay-as-you-bid  system.   There  could  be  an  additional  source   of

discontent among the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>

successful  bidders as no one likes the idea of  having  to  pay

more  for  the  same  item.  Only the  ones  paying  the  lowest

premiums would be happy.  Some laymen might have difficulties in

deciding on the right price to bid, for fear that they might  be

penalised  for  bidding too high.  This could  lead  to  greater

reliance on motor vehicle dealers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pay-as-you-bid system will cause confusion in the motor

vehicle  trade and vehicle financing industry.  Some  economists

and  academics  have expressed the view that the  pay-as-you-bid

system could establish a stronger incentive for collusion  among

motor  vehicle  dealers to ensure that they  bid  close  to  the

lowest  successful price.  The Committee also felt that  it  was

not  fair  to  always  penalise the  top  10%  or  20%  bidders,

especially  if their bids are close to the lowest strike  price.

Based  on the statistics of past tender exercises, the Committee

noted the trend that bids were converging towards the low as you

bid.  Generally, the successful bids clustered around the 20% to

30% above the lowest strike price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the above into consideration, the Committee decided

that  the  current  method  based on the  price  of  the  lowest

successful bid should be retained.  I may not have given him the

best  answer he wants, but maybe later on in the course  of  the

debate  we  could discuss further.  But I do hope  the  Minister

will  really take into consideration all the proposals  that  we

have  made,  and  perhaps give them a try, especially  the  open

bidding system for the open category.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I read with great

interest the Report of the Vehicle Quota System Review Committee

and can appreciate the difficulties faced by the Committee as it

tried to grapple with and balance the various conflicting issues

about  social equity, car categories, quota size and the  myriad

of  factors  that  make  the subject  of  vehicle  ownership  in

Singapore such a talked-about and emotive one.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vehicle Quota System was introduced 10 years ago. For

all  its flaws and inadequacies, I believe the system is working

reasonably well.  Prices of COE have stabilised at a level  that

is appropriate in the light of the present state of our economy.

This  shows  that  buyers are rational and  notwithstanding  the

initial  fears,  prices of COEs had not shot  through  the  roof

except  for  a  brief period in the midst of a booming  economy,

rife  speculation  and  material excesses.   Over  the  last  12

months, prices have been moving within a band of between $20,000

and  $40,000.  There was resistance when prices hit the high 30s

and  when  prices came down to the low 20s, buyers  entered  the

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vehicle Quota System is maturing. We should give it

some more time and let it stabilise further.  At this stage,  we

should not make drastic changes merely for the change alone.  As

far  as possible, we should not introduce any more uncertainties

into the system.  Uncertainties leading to wide fluctuations  in

prices  are detrimental to dealers, owners, aspiring car  buyers

and  the financial institutions which finance them.  It can also

be  a  source  of  discontent.  How many of us have  experienced

situations where after we have bought an item, the price of that

item  dropped  the very next month because of  some  changes  in

Government  policy.   A recent example is the  prevailing  quota

premium  which fell significantly as a result of the  change  in

computation  from a 12-month to a 3-month moving  average.   The

converse  is when we have not bought the item yet and the  price

shoots up because of a change in policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to touch on three of the Committee's

observations which I have reservations about.  They are (1)  the

distribution of COEs among the different categories, (2)  merger

of Categories 1 and 2, and (3) the proposed open tender system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the first issue, in principle, I agree that

vehicle  quota should be distributed in such a way as to  better

reflect  the latest preference of motorists.  There  must  be  a

built-in mechanism to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>

let  the system respond in a timely manner to market trends  and

consumer  demand.  If the system is rigid and  based  on  quotas

fixed  by  the  authorities  from a top-down  approach,  drastic

corrective action will have to be taken from time to time,  like

the  one-time adjustment made in May 1994 when unused motorcycle

COEs   were   redistributed  to  other  categories.    This   is

undesirable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not agree with the Committee's suggestion for

two half-yearly quotas and the distribution among the categories

to  be  based  on the proportion of vehicles registered  in  the

respective  categories in the preceding six-month  period.   How

can  the  quota in any category change substantially  over  time

when the number of new cars registered in that category has been

fixed  in  the first place by the quota?  For example,  even  if

there  is the demand for 5,000 Category 1 cars, but if the quota

is only 2,000, then only 2,000 Category 1 cars can be registered

subject  only to those registered using Open Category  COEs  and

perhaps  those  COEs from higher categories if  this  option  is

allowed in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Government should study the feasibility of

allowing COEs from any category to be used to register  cars  in

another  category subject to payment of the appropriate transfer

fees  and  an  additional levy.  The additional levy  should  be

equal to the positive difference between the quota premium  paid

for the COE and the corresponding quota premium for the category

under which the car is eventually registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, quota categories. While I agree with the Committee

that some segmentation of the total COE quota is necessary, I do

not   agree  with  its  recommendation  to  merge  the   current

Categories 1 and 2 together.  Categories 3 and 4 could be merged

into  one.  But for social equity reasons, I believe the current

Category  1 should be retained.  This category caters  to  those

who  would like to buy an inexpensive car or a small car.   This

gives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>

the low-income group the opportunity to own a car.  Furthermore,

there  is  a  trend towards smaller cars especially for  getting

from place to place in an urban environment like Singapore.   To

group them into one category would mean that a buyer of a 800 cc

sub-compact  has  to  compete and bid in the  same  category  as

buyers  of  four-door saloons.  I think the gap  is  simply  too

wide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Option 3 as presented in the Committee's Report,

where  there would be three categories comprising lower,  middle

and  upper,  would  result in a more equitable  distribution  of

COEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the quota size, the undesirable effects of a

small  quota in the lower category can be mitigated by  allowing

COEs  from the two bigger car categories to be used to  register

cars  from the lower category but, if the premium for the  lower

category  is  higher,  then  an additional  levy  equal  to  the

positive difference between the quota premium paid for  the  COE

and  the  corresponding  quota premium for  the  lower  category

should be paid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue of the bidding mechanism, while a pay-as-you-bid system may lead to "winner's curse", there is a danger

that an open bidding system will lead to the "don't-want-to-just-miss-it"  syndrome, where bidders increase their bids by  a  bit

more  so as not to miss it.  If bidders are aware of the current

lower  strike  price,  they will put in a  slightly  higher  bid

price, thereby driving up the strike price.  On the other  hand,

under  the  present closed system, bidders have shown that  they

are rational and have placed bids at a level that is appropriate

under  prevailing market conditions.  If he is  not  successful,

the bidder has one whole month to cool down and rethink his next

bid  which  may or may not be higher as market conditions  could

have changed significantly in the meantime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would say that the man-in-the-street

is  suspicious that the underlying purpose of the review and any

consequential changes to the Vehicle Quota System is to increase

Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>

revenue  from  COEs.   This  perception,  if  untrue,  must   be

corrected.   If the objective of the review is to fine-tune  the

system  to  prevent freak results, like the $50 COE, I  hope  we

will only tinker with that aspect and not disturb the rest.  Why

burn the house down to kill the rat?

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, let me first start by

complimenting  the  GPC for Communications for  a  thorough  and

comprehensive Report on the Vehicle Quota System.  As one who is

not  intimately involved in the process, I would, however,  like

to  raise  some  questions  regarding the  Committee's  findings

whilst  I  agree  with  the spirit and  thrust  of  its  general

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a general question that arises: what is the

objective of this review?  What prompted the initiation of  this

process?   The  COE system has been in existence  for  nearly  a

decade.  Singaporeans, in general, have grown accustomed to  the

vagaries  of the COE process and, at the same time, dare  I  say

that  they have even grown accustomed to the levels of  the  COE

prices, although there may be some unusual occurrences from time

to  time.   So the question is: why a review?  Why now?   And  I

think  the more cynical have suggested that it might even be  an

effort  by  the Government  to conserve revenue sparked  by  the

freak $50 COE incident.  I would urge the Minister to vigorously

and comprehensively rebut such erroneous misconceptions and draw

attention to the true and meaningful purpose of this review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, perhaps we could understand better the

objective  of  this review if the Government was able  to  share

with  us how it would gauge the success of any changes that  are

implemented.   Would we measure the success of this  new  review

and  the recommendations by a lower variation in COE prices from

month  to  month?   Would we regard it  as  a  success  if  more

individuals   participate  directly  in  the   bidding   process

bypassing middlemen?  Certainly, for Singaporeans in general, it

would be a success if COE prices were lower.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, the recommendation on combining COE

categories  raises a question which my colleague,  Mr  Ong  Kian

Min,  has also raised.  What is the impact likely to be  on  the

buyers of smaller cars at the lower end of the spectrum that  is

merged?   Intuitively, it would suggest that the clearing  price

would  be  raised.  There would be a drag effect  upwards  given

that  people  tend  to bid for COE prices  in  relation  to  the

proportion  of  their  car  price.  That  being  the  case,  the

intuitive  conclusion one comes to is that  this  would  have  a

detrimental effect on those who buy smaller cars.  I would  like

to  hear from the Minister and the Ministry on evidence  to  the

contrary  in order to reassure buyers of smaller cars that  this

is not indeed the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the open bidding system, I have great sympathy for

the  recommendation  of  the  Committee.   To  me,  trained   in

economics,  I  think any system that introduces a process  where

more  information can be captured  before a price  is  submitted

should  work to the advantage of all.  However, given  the  vast

interest  in  the process and the sensitivities of many  parties

involved,  I  fully endorse the recommendation of the  Committee

that   this  be  tried  out  in  a  small  measure  first,   its

effectiveness evaluated thoroughly before the system is extended

to all categories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a question on the general issue of car

population.   A  fundamental premise underlying our  entire  COE

system is that our vehicle population will be increasing  on  an

annual rate of about 3%.  Given our finite space for roads and a

limited  capacity to increase the road space in  Singapore,  the

question is: can this 3% be sustained in the long term  and,  if

not,  what  plans  are there from the Ministry  to  adjust  this

percentage?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Sir, the Vehicle Quota System

Review  Committee  has  completed  its  deliberations  and   has

submitted  its  Report to the Minister.  I am a  member  of  the

Committee   and   would  urge  the  Minister  to   endorse   the

recommendations of the Committee.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the release of the Review Committee's Report and

in  fact  even before the release of the Report, there has  been

numerous  public debate over the merits and the shortcomings  of

the  current  system.  There was no lack of  ideas  of  how  the

current system can be further refined and improved upon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that when the idea of the Vehicle Quota

System  was first mooted, there were outcries from some quarters

that  the scheme was ill conceived and it was designed to enrich

the  Government's coffer.  Today, after the system has  been  in

place  for  a number of years, it has proven to be effective  in

controlling our vehicle population.  Bidding for COE has  become

a way of life for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, when the idea of a revision to the VQS is

mooted,  we  heard comments like, since the present  system  has

served  us  well,  why  change it.  And true  enough,  many  are

apprehensive of the impact of any proposed changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that what the VQS Review Committee has

proposed  is  a refinement of the current system.   It  has  not

proposed  a  fundamental change in the vehicle demand management

strategy.   It  has  reaffirmed the principle of  allocation  of

COEs,  which is to allocate a scarce resource through a  bidding

process.  While there were specific suggestions to fine-tune the

quota formula and to merge some categories of vehicles under the

quota  system, what catches the attention of the public  is  the

recommendation to review the allowable vehicle growth  rate  and

to  try  out an open bidding system.  To determine the allowable

vehicle growth rate, the Government will have to be more precise

in  its  projection  of the expansion of the road  network,  the

travelling  pattern of the population and anticipated  level  of

road congestions and other factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that we need a more accurate projection as we should

not  go  off  the  mark like the way we project  our  population

growth.  We were told that we have a population of three million

but all of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>

sudden, we were told that we are reaching four million soon.   I

wonder  which  Ministry is responsible for  this  unplanned  and

unanticipated fortune or misfortune.  Similarly,  for  the  open

bidding  system,  the  authority can make  the  system  work  by

thinking  through  all possible pitfalls and  devise  a  bidding

mechanism which would minimise abuse and minimise anxiety  among

the bidders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people think that the open bidding system is

inflationary.   It pushes up prices.  The Review  Committee  has

suggested that the Government try out an electronic on-line open

bidding system in the Open Category before extending it  to  the

entire  VQS.   I  suggest that in trying out  the  open  bidding

system,  the Government could introduce a number of measures  to

check  the inflationary tendencies.  For instance, the authority

can  limit  the number of times a person can up his bids  during

the bidding process.  This will prevent him from raising his bid

to  outdo others, and this point was raised by Mr Ong Kian  Min.

Another  way is to increase the frequency of inviting bids.  For

instance,  instead  of calling for bids once  a  month,  we  can

spread  out the quota allocation and call for bids on  a  weekly

basis.   So,  those who miss out this week can  bid  again  next

week.  There will be no need to panic and rush to secure COEs at

all costs and this will address the kiasu syndrome expressed  by

Mr Chew Heng Ching earlier on.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the authority must lay out clear rules and

regulations  and devise a fair and workable system.   Only  then

can  we assess more objectively the feasibility or otherwise  of

an open bidding system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> Mr Sin Boon Ann is not speaking. Dr Wang.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, one of the features

of  the  existing Vehicle Quota System is that  there  are  four

categories for cars.  Based on the road space occupied  and  the

congestion caused by cars, there is actually not much difference

between  a  car of one size and a car of a different size.   Why

then did

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>

we have a system of four categories?  Perhaps, we should take  a

moment  to  think about it.  I believe that a lot  of  political

wisdom has gone into that particular decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, I believe the society as a whole finds it

socially  acceptable to isolate the small car  owners  from  the

stronger purchasing power of the buyers of the bigger cars.   It

is also socially acceptable for larger cars to pay for its COEs.

So, if Ministry of Communications will do a survey, it will find

that  almost every Singaporean, including those who have to  pay

more, will grudgingly agree that it is a fair system, that it is

fair  for  big car buyers to pay more.  Fundamentally,  I  think

without  these four categories, perhaps it would have been  very

difficult for the public to accept the VQS as they did.  I would

like  to  remind the House that many Backbenchers in this  House

have  asked,  for  instance,  to create  a  separate  motorcycle

category  and  this is to segregate the big leisure  motorcycles

like  Harley  Davidson from the workhorse  individuals  use  for

transportation.  Segregation of the weak from being over-run  by

the  rich  is  the characteristic of a sense of  social  justice

imbued  in  the  typical Singaporean.  Therefore,  as  such,  we

should  not modify the VQS system without revisiting  this  very

fundamental rationale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the present VQS system has some weaknesses. It has

shown up and reflected by the freak result of this $50 COE,  but

that  freak  result  was  a convergence  of  many  factors,  the

economic   recession  being  one  of  them.   The   VQS   Review

Committee's  Report  has  pointed out that  the  current  system

allows  for too large a fluctuation in the yearly COEs  released

for ballot.  I can identify one other weakness, and that is, the

Open  Category,  which, by and large, favours the  big  cars  or

luxury  car  buyers.  Why do I say so?  If you look at  how  the

Open  Category  COEs were used, I believe the majority  of  them

were  used for the registration of big and luxury cars.  So,  in

effect, the Open Category increases the number of COEs available

for  these car categories.  To address some of these problems  I

have identified, my preferred proposal would be to merge all the

car

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>

categories  into  one but with one condition,  and  that  is,  a

strike price of the COE is meant for the registration of a small

car.   To  use  that COE to register a car of a larger  size,  a

fixed  premium  for the different classes can be pre-determined.

For  instance, we could establish a premium of 40% more for  the

registration  of medium-size cars, 60% more for a  big  car  and

100%  more  for a luxury car.  This will address the problem  of

the  freak  tender  result that I alluded to  earlier,  and  yet

retain  the  segregation of different classes of  car  purchases

that we have found to be so desirable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC Review Committee proposed two major changes on

changing  the open tender system to open bid system and  merging

the  four  categories  into  lower  and  upper  categories.    I

understand the GPC actually carried out many sessions with  many

users  and  stakeholders in the transportation  industry.  So  I

think  the  recommendation does carry some weight.   I  have  no

major  philosophical difficulty with the open bid  system.   The

major  reservation I have is with the merger of  four  different

classes  into two and in so doing, giving up the social need  to

segregate  the  buyers  of the different  categories,  the  same

problem that my colleagues have alluded to earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, the Minister will take my point into

consideration.   I  believe  once we give  up  this  fundamental

principle to segregate buyers of different categories  of  cars,

we have actually brushed off the political consideration that  I

have alluded to earlier.  Once we have accepted this, in future,

there is actually no reason why we should have two categories of

lower  and upper.  In fact, we might very well end up  with  one

altogether.   I  think it is important for me to reiterate  this

social  equity  factor and sometimes, it  is  this  factor  that

separates a successful policy from one that fails.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, it has

been  10  years since the Vehicle Quota System (VQS)  was  first

implemented  in Singapore.  During this period, the Ministry  of

Communications,   through   the   Feedback   Unit,    grassroots

organisations and various people,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>

have  collected feedback and suggestions on ways  and  means  to

improve  the system, and has actually acted upon some  of  these

suggestions to fine-tune our VQS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the present VQS is quite sound and has

effectively controlled the vehicle growth at an annual  rate  of

3%.   The tender prices have been stabilised, and our people are

already used to the system, and are familiar with the way it  is

operated.  As  such,  if we want to make  major  changes  again,

people will have to start all over again to get used to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are now facing an economic recession, some people

feel  that if we adopt an open bidding system for COE, it  would

turn  out  to be like the bidding at the  Seventh Month Festival

bidding,  where prices keep going higher and higher.   They  are

very  concerned with this possibility.  I hope that the Minister

will be cautious in studying the recommendation of the Committee

to change the bidding system so that it would not cause too much

inconvenience to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give my suggestions on the bidding system.

First,   increase the transparency of the tender  system.   Some

unsuccessful bidders suspect that the Ministry of Communications

conducted  the  tendering procedure under cover and  manipulated

the   bids   to  raise  the  strike  price.   They  claim   that

transparency  is  lacking  in our  tender  procedure.   I  would

suggest  that  the Ministry post all available  information  and

data  on  the  Internet for all to see, so as  to  increase  the

transparency  of  the  system and give  potential  bidders  more

information to rely on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, under the present system, car owners have to

either  scrap their old cars when they reach 10 years of age, or

to  renew  the  COE.   Now  that   we  are  facing  an  economic

recession, car owners find it difficult either to buy a new  car

or renew the COE by paying the prevailing premium. It has become

a  great burden to them.   I would suggest  that the present 10-year period for COE be extended to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>

12  years  or  even  longer.  This will lighten  the  burden  of

existing car owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, many people have suggested the pay-as-you-bid

system  (PAYB)  in  order  to  prevent  the  kiasu  people  from

submitting unreasonably high bids. But the Committee feels  that

this  may cause confusion among the finance institutions as  the

values  of  cars will be too diversified.  I think, if possible,

the  PAYB  could  be  pegged  to the present  system  of  lowest

successful bid.  In other words, taking "you pay as you bid"  as

the  basic  principle, and then tie it up with the principle  of

the  lowest  successful bid.  For example, if A bids $22,000,  B

bids  $50,000 and the strike price is $20,000, then both of them

will  pay $20,000 for the COE, and donate the difference between

the  bidded price and the strike price to charity.  I feel  that

this  will be in line with the PAYB principle, and at  the  same

time,  it  can  also achieve the objective of a  uniform  lowest

successful bid.  This will not cause any confusion to the second-hand  car  market  or to the finance companies.   It  will  also

equitably reflect the market value of cars and at the same time,

kiasu  bidders  will  be  forced to  exercise  more  caution  in

submitting their bids.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> Hon. Members will please note that Dr Michael

Lim's  name  was inadvertently omitted from this list  and  also

that  of  Mr  Sin  Boon Ann under item (b) of  the  Order  Paper

Supplement.  I now call on Dr Michael Lim.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing  me  to  join in the debate.  A land  transport  policy

affects the daily lives of most Singaporeans and hence it is not

surprising  that changes in land transport policies are  watched

closely  by most Singaporeans.  The report of the Vehicle  Quota

System   Review Committee was released recently.  I was  also  a

member of the Committee.  In view of the concerns that have been

expressed  on  some of the changes, I would like  to  take  this

opportunity  to  further  expand on the  proposed  open  bidding

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommended an open bidding system but it was

after a long

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>

debate  within the Committee that we finally agreed to  try  the

open  bidding system in the Open Category.  The reality is  that

although  the  open  bidding  system  is  more  transparent  and

provides more information to bidders, the playing field  is  not

level as motor dealers have an edge over ordinary Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if there was collusion, they could control the

outcome  of  the  bidding, having been given  more  information.

They  have the experience, the time to monitor the bids, a large

number  of COEs to have an effect on pricing and the ability  to

buffer COE prices with the profit from the sale of the car.  For

a  motor dealer, it is better to have a sale with a lower profit

margin than no sale and no profit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee had long debates on the merits and demerits

of  the  open  bidding  system and there was  genuine  and  real

concern that if manipulation can occur to the detriment  of  the

ordinary  Singaporean, it would have defeated  the  aim  of  the

exercise, which is to have a more transparent and level  playing

field for everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I wish to take this opportunity to stress to the

Minister   that   safeguards  against  manipulations   must   be

implemented.  Several possibilities were discussed but the  only

way  we can prevent market manipulation is to have a formula  to

penalise those who manipulate the market by running up  the  COE

prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Ministry may argue that we must let the

market determine the prices of the COE.  This, I agree but  with

caveats.  Unfortunately, despite the transparency, the odds  are

stacked  against  the ordinary Singaporean  and  therefore,  the

outcomes  can  still  be  manipulated.   My  fear  is  that   if

uncontrolled, the open bidding system can only lead to a running

up  of  COE prices unnecessarily.  The Government must  consider

some schemes to prevent this from happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the release of the Report, I have also given more

thought to this and I have a suggestion.  One suggestion which I

would like to recommend is that for each

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>

quota  category, let there be a two-tier scheme  with  a  lowest

successful bid for each tier.  Hence, for example, the  top  10%

of  the  successful bidders will have to pay the  price  of  the

lowest successful bid among the top 10%, and the other 90%  will

pay  the  lowest  successful bid.   However,  if  there  was  no

manipulation, it is likely that the bids will be within a narrow

band.   To  avoid penalising bidders if the band is narrow,  the

system  may  incorporate a clause which can state  that  if  the

difference  between the two lowest successful bids is  not  more

than  10-20%  of  the  lowest successful bid,  then  the  entire

category  will  only pay the lower of the two lowest  successful

bids.  This scheme will penalise those who run up COE prices and

yet  will not penalise buyers if bidding is done within a narrow

band.  This will also reduce the likelihood that COE prices will

run up.  It will also dispel the misconception that the exercise

is meant to increase Government revenue.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now one of my colleagues, Mr Goh Chee Wee, has

suggested   that  another  way  is  to  have  frequent   perhaps

fortnightly, weekly or monthly COE bids.  My only concern is  if

you do that, each time the category will be quite small, and  we

would have defeated the purpose of merging our categories, which

was to have a greater COE pool.  Because, as we discussed, if we

have  a  very  small COE pool in each category,  then  there  is

increased risk of manipulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations have been agreed and thought through

carefully.  Most of these measures can only be successful if the

Ministry  of  Communications not only adopt the  recommendations

but devise and set up the necessary administrative safeguards to

ensure   that   these   recommendations   can   be   implemented

successfully.   Ultimately, I believe that if  the  Ministry  of

Communications  follows  the  recommendations   and   adds   the

necessary  safeguards, the VQS will evolve  into  a  fairer  and

better system for all Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir,

first,  I  would like to thank all the speakers who  have  given

very  valuable  inputs and suggestions on the  VQS  review.   As

Members  will  recall, we implemented the Vehicle  Quota  System

almost nine years ago.  That was in May 1990.  At that time, the

Government  was  faced  with a dilemma of  how  to  control  the

vehicle  population.  We had previously relied on vehicle  taxes

to  do  this.  Before 1990, from 1975 onwards, the vehicle taxes

like ARF, registration fees, customs duties and so on kept going

up.   Every time the vehicle population went up unduly high, you

could  be  sure that in the next budget, the car taxes would  go

up.  But  in  spite of all this, the vehicle population  reached

double  digit  growth of something like 12%  per  annum  in  the

period 1982-1983.  Three years prior to 1990, the net growth was

almost  7%.   Obviously, we could not carry on  like  this.   We

either had to keep on raising taxes and ARF drastically in order

to  bring the growth down, or we had to fix an acceptable growth

rate, and let motorists decide how much they want to pay to  own

a car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government decided to go for the latter option. We

settled  one key parameter of the transport equation, which  was

the vehicle population and, at the same time, we provided a more

flexible and market driven solution to the perennial question of

how much should we tax car  ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the VQS is quite unique to Singapore. We were the

first  to implement such a system and up to today, we are  still

the  only  country in the world to do so.  Many people  come  to

Singapore  and  study  our system and  they  say,  "Oh,  what  a

wonderful system you have.  This solves all our problems."   But

when they go back, nothing happens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we had no other experience to rely on. We had to learn

as  we  went along, as it were.  Over the last nine years, there

were many changes in the system. These changes took into account

the  views  of  the public as well as responded to the  changing

environment.  Earlier on, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>

were  pressed  to make COEs non-transferable. From the  economic

point  of  view, Mr Iswaran will tell you that this is  not  the

most  ideal  solution,  because  COEs  as  a  commodity  should,

strictly speaking, be transferable, and there should be a market

for it.  But people felt that non-transferability was making COE

prices  go up too high.  We made COEs non-transferable for  cars

and  motorcycles.   Of course, as expected, this  brought  about

other consequential problems. We had to make the cars themselves

non-transferable.   When COEs could not be  transferred,  people

decided  that they would  take the COE, register a car and  then

transfer the car.  So we had to plug that loophole, and we did.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, there have been many other suggestions

made to further modify the system.  Pay-as-you-bid is a constant

refrain.   There  have  also been calls for  the  Government  to

prevent dealers from bidding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the ERP, there have also been

renewed calls to abolish the VQS, because with the ERP in place,

why  do  we need the VQS?  Although the VQS is working well  and

although  the prices have been relatively stable over  the  last

year or so, as many Members have pointed out, I decided that  it

was  timely, after almost 10 years of operation, to  take  stock

and to do a thorough, comprehensive review of the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the suggestions that were put to the Ministry

earlier, we had kept in view because we did not want to keep  on

making  changes every year.  But we decided that after 10 years,

after  watching  the system and seeing what are the  merits  and

demerits of the system, this was a sufficiently long time for us

to sit back and take stock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Mr Iswaran, the objectives of the review were two-fold. One is to review whether the VQS is still needed in view

of  the  ERP,  and whether it is still effective in meeting  our

traffic  management  objectives. Two,  if the  VQS  were  to  be

retained, how can it be further improved in order

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>

to make the system fairer and more objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To undertake the review, my Ministry turned to the GPC for

Communications  for assistance.  The GPC is  well  qualified  to

conduct  the  review because its Members are familiar  with  the

current  system.   Moreover, they have recourse to  a  group  of

resource  persons who would be able to provide expert  views  on

the  subject.  Last but not least, I felt that it would be  good

to  have a party other than the Ministry conduct the review,  so

that they can take a fresh look at the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the GPC has undertaken their task in

earnest.  I have been following their deliberations and  I  know

that  they  have actively sought the views of various interested

parties  as  well  as members of the public.  I understand  that

almost  100 written representations were received via fax,  mail

and  the  Internet. This is excluding the pile of feedback  that

the  Ministry  had  earlier collected which we dutifully  handed

over  to  the  GPC  Review Committee. They also conducted  three

dialogue sessions with interest groups, with academics from  NUS

and  NTU, with the Feedback Unit's transport group and also with

the  general members of the public. They spent a lot of time and

effort in arriving at their recommendations, and I would like to

place on record in this House my appreciation and thanks to  the

GPC,  especially to its Chairman, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, and to  the

resource persons for undertaking this important task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now give the Government's response to the

recommendations  of the GPC.  First of all, on the  VQS  itself.

My  Ministry agrees with the GPC that the VQS should remain,  as

it is one of the key pillars of our traffic management strategy.

I  note  that many other Members who have spoken today,  Mr  Ong

Kian Min, Mr Ang Mong Seng, among others, also share this view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system has allowed us to effectively manage the growth

of  the  vehicle population at a level that can be sustained  by

our road infrastructure and given the overall constraints of our

limited land.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>

I  am  gratified that almost all who gave feedback  to  the  GPC

agreed that the VQS should be retained, despite the introduction

of the ERP.  This is a significant vindication and reaffirmation

of  the  system.  As the Lianhe Zaobao editorial a few days  ago

put  it, motorists both love and hate the system.  They love the

system  because it works, and when they travel to  other  cities

which  are gridlocked, they really appreciate the quota  system.

But  they are not so keen when it comes to paying for COEs.   So

this  love-hate relationship, I think, is going to be a fact  of

life.  But I am heartened because when we first implemented  the

quota system, I do not think there was any love in sight at all.

If  anything, it was a hate-hate relationship.   Now, people are

beginning to appreciate the benefits of the quota system and see

the  impact and recognise that it works.  I think it shows  that

we  are  making progress.  It demonstrates that Singaporeans  do

appreciate  the need for Government to take tough but  necessary

measures from time to time to tackle intractable issues such  as

traffic congestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our land constraint, as many Members have heard me say

many times in this House, means that the amount of space that we

can  devote  to  roads must be limited.  The vehicle  population

grows at 3% per annum compounded, but our land is not growing at

3%  per  annum.   In fact, between 1995 and 2000, we  anticipate

that  our  road network will only grow something like  1/2%  per

annum, in terms of lane kilometres.  Already, 12% of our land is

set aside for roads, the same amount of land set aside for roads

as  for housing, 12%.  So there is not much room for us to build

more  roads.   We  can  reclaim at the margins.   We  can  build

interchanges,  flyovers, even underground roads,  but  our  road

capacity will expand at the most by something like 2%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to rely solely on the ERP to manage

congestion.   If  we did so, ERP charges would   be  many  times

higher  than what it is today.  Therefore, maintaining a balance

between ownership and usage management measures through VQS  and

ERP is the most prudent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>

approach to manage our traffic.  But the GPC feels that with the

Government's  ongoing  improvements  to  the  public   transport

system, expansion of road network, greater reliance on the  ERP,

the allowable vehicle growth rate, which is currently set at  3%

per  annum, could be reviewed upwards.  This is a recommendation

which has created some excitement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the growth rate of 3% was set at the time when the VQS

was  first  introduced, taking into account our long-term  road-building programme, our public transport developments as well as

developments in traffic management systems.  To the extent  that

these  factors have changed since the growth rate was  set  nine

years  ago,  the  GPC's recommendation to  review  the  rate  is

accepted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA recently carried out such a study/review using its

transportation model, and it simulated the impact of a 3% growth

rate  on the congestion levels of our roads, taking into account

the  various improvements in public transport, road  network  as

well  as the introduction of ERP last year.  The study concluded

that  if  the ERP coverage and rates are maintained  at  today's

levels,  the  congestion level on our road network  will  worsen

significantly over the next five years.  However, if we were  to

implement  a  more extensive coverage of ERP and, if  necessary,

higher  ERP  charges, we can sustain this 3%  growth  rate,  and

manage the congestion at localised bottlenecks. To increase  the

growth rate further at this stage would be unwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to maintain the 3%

growth  rate  until  the year 2005, because  we  take  a  5-year

planning  horizon.   We will review this growth  rate  regularly

after that.  If congestion eases following the expansion of ERP,

the  Government will release an additional 10,000 plus COEs.  My

Ministry  will  further  assess  the  situation  after  we  have

implemented phase 2 of the ERP.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to methods of COE allocation. The Government

agrees  with  the  GPC  that the market mechanism  is  the  most

efficient means for allocation of COEs.  COEs should rightly  go

to  those  who  value  the  right  to  own  the  car  the  most.

Competitive  bidding is the best way to achieve this.   It  also

ensures  that  the scarcity value of COEs accrues to  Government

and  therefore  to  society  as a  whole  rather  than  to  each

individual  if we were to use other allocation methods,  whether

it is queuing, lucky draws, or whatever.  How do we know whether

the  VQS system is efficient?  Is it by allocation of COEs?   Is

it by COE prices?  This is what Mr Iswaran wanted to know.  Some

other  Members have mentioned that there is a view,  among  some

people, that the changes are to maintain Government revenue from

COEs  by ensuring that freak results such as the $50 COE do  not

recur.   Members  have asked that we dispel the perception  that

these changes are to increase Government revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said on a number of occasions that the VQS is

an  instrument  to manage traffic.  It is not a tax  instrument.

Although COE revenue has become a significant part of Government

revenue, it is not a tax instrument per se.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COEs are a scarce commodity and they are a national

resource,  like  land.   Having decided that  the  best  way  to

allocate  this scarce resource is through the market  mechanism,

we must ensure therefore that the bidding system is an efficient

one,  which sets a fair price for the COEs.  We should not over-price  COEs but, on the other hand, neither should we  accept  a

price  which is below the fair market price of the COEs, because

COEs belong to Singapore and Singaporeans ultimately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the $50 COEs occurred in December

1997.   Did  that reflect the true value of COEs in that  month?

Obviously not.  If that were the case, then that would have been

the  benchmark  price  for  the next few months.  But  the  next

month,  the price bounced back to its original level.  If people

knew

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>

that  $50  would  be  the price for COEs in that  category  that

month,  I  can  bet  my bottom dollar that  everybody  would  be

rushing  to the nearest ATM to put in  their bid.  But this  $50

COE  did happen.  It is a weakness of the system.  This weakness

is something that needs to be addressed.  This is the reason why

I  set for the GPC the other objective of seeing whether the VQS

can be improved to make it fairer and more objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now respond to the specific recommendations

made  by  the  GPC to improve the mechanics of the  VQS  system.

First, the quota system.  The existing quota formula is based on

the  number of vehicles deregistered in the previous year.   The

GPC  has  proposed to change the formula to base it on estimated

deregistrations  for the current year instead  of  the  previous

year.   This will remove the one year lag between deregistration

and  recycling of replacement COEs. What this means  effectively

is that it will better match the supply with the demand of those

who   are   scrapping  their  vehicles.   This  is  a   sensible

suggestion. The Government accepts this recommendation and  will

implement  the new quota formula for this quota year,  beginning

May 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the 1999 quota will be based on projected deregistration

this  year plus 3% growth of the vehicle population as  at  31st

December  1998.  LTA will estimate the deregistrations for  each

year based on the trends of the last few years.  If there is any

discrepancy between estimate and actual, this will be  accounted

for in the following year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, smoothening out the peaks in COE supply. The

Government  agrees  in  principle  with  the  recommendation  to

smoothen  out the surge in COE supply in the year 2000  and  the

troughs   that  would  take  place  before  and  after.    Major

fluctuations in the year to year COE supply is likely to lead to

instability  in  COE  prices, if not  matched  by  corresponding

demand.   The  actual  figures will be announced  when  the  LTA

determines the quota for the year 2000 and 2001.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, distribution among categories. The GPC recommended

that  the  Government  consider a more  dynamic  and  responsive

mechanism  to distribute COEs to the different categories.   The

aim  is  a  laudable  one  which  is  to  reflect  the  changing

preference  of  motorists for different kinds of  vehicles.   We

agree  that the current system is not flexible enough  for  this

purpose,  but some of the projections that we have made  suggest

that any such proposed mechanism will have a major impact on the

vehicle   mix.   So  my  Ministry  would  like  to   study   the

implications  of this proposed mechanism and other alternatives,

if  possible,  to  the  current  distribution  method  with  the

objective  of  making sure that it is more responsive.   In  the

meantime, we will retain the current distribution method.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merging of quota categories. I think this is a

recommendation that has generated quite a lot of interest.   The

GPC  recommended  that  the number of  categories  for  cars  be

reduced  to  two  while the commercial vehicles and  motorcycles

remain  in  their separate categories.  Mr Ong Kian Min  and  Dr

Wang  Kai  Yuen, among others, have expressed concern that  this

merger  will  result  in  the buyers of  smaller  cars  in  each

category  being squeezed out by the buyers of the  larger  cars.

Both  Members have also recommended in one form or another, some

kind  of  a scaling factor so that big car owners will pay  more

than small car owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is no question that when the COE system was

first  formulated  there was this need to address  some  of  the

social equity considerations.  But from the land transport point

of view, it is also clear that there should only be one category

of  COEs from which all vehicle buyers will bid.  The reason  is

very  simple.  As far as congestion is concerned, it is the same

whether  you have a large car or a small car, so  the COE  as  a

proxy  for  the cost of causing that congestion should  be   the

same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a single category will also provide maximum

flexibility to cater to the changing preference for different

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>

types  of vehicles.  Having a large category, as Dr Wang pointed

out,  would  also  reduce  price fluctuations.   But  there  are

compelling social and business considerations to suggest that we

are  not ready to implement a single quota category system.   So

the recommendation to keep, for example, commercial vehicles and

motorcycles  separate  is  an acceptable  one.   The  reason  is

because  they  have different tax platforms from cars  and  they

also cater to different groups of motorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Ong's and Dr Wang's suggestion to

introduce  scaling  factors, I think this  suggestion  was  also

considered  by  the  GPC,   but it was not  accepted  after  the

Government gave its view that the VQS is not intended  to  be  a

progressive  tax measure.  Progressivity is already  built  into

the  cost of owning a vehicle, especially into our motor car tax

structure.   For  example, when you buy a big  car,  you  pay  a

higher ARF and more customs duty because these two elements  are

based  on  the Open Market Value of the car.  So we are  already

charging  a wealth tax on the large car owners via the  ARF  and

the  customs duty mechanism.  Furthermore, we charge higher road

taxes  when  these cars are put on the road.  So the  Government

feels  that there is really no need for us to introduce  another

progressivity element into another aspect of the land  transport

tax  structure or cost structure, which is in this case the COE.

This  is a deliberate decision that we have taken.  Yes, I agree

that people would not mind if Government were to say, "Okay,  we

are going to have a progressivity element into the COE structure

as well."  But is it necessary?  After all, when we first mooted

the  COE  system,  we  said  that  this  is  to  tackle  traffic

congestion.  Let us just leave it at that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, having said all that, it is true that a single car

category  will result in buyers of big cars squeezing out  small

cars.   So  as  an interim measure, the Government  accepts  the

GPC's  recommendations to reduce the number  of  car  categories

from  four  to  two.  We merge Categories 1 and 2 together,  and

then we merge Categories 3

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>

and  4  together.   Buyers of small cars, by which  I  refer  to

Categories  1  and 2, will not have to compete  with  buyers  of

bigger  cars,  those in Categories 3 and  4.   If  you  look  at

Categories 1 and 2, you will see that the quota premiums have in

recent  months started to converge.  There is still a difference

but  the difference has come down very sharply.  In fact,  there

was  even one occasion when, as Mr Chew Heng Ching pointed  out,

Category 1 COEs were actually higher than Category 2 COEs.   One

of  the  reasons for this was because there was  a  mismatch  of

supply  and  demand, and the supply of Category 1 COEs  is  very

small  every month.  In that particular month, when there was  a

surge  of  buyers for very small cars, Category 1 COEs  went  up

sharply.  Having a larger category for small cars, whether it is

below  1,000 cc or between 1,000 cc and 1,600 cc, will  help  to

moderate  upward pressure on the COE price for the  small  cars.

For  Categories  3 and 4, I think it is much less  controversial

because  the two COE premiums are generally similar and  so  the

merging of these two categories makes sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to the Open Category. The Government agrees

with  the  GPC that the Open Category should be retained.   This

mechanism of the Open Category was implemented when we segmented

all the car categories into various compartments.  Ideally, as I

said  earlier, they should all be one.  But because  of  various

considerations,  we  split  them up  into  six.   The  COE  Open

Category  is  a  mechanism to cater for changes  in  the  market

place.   If there is a change in demand for different  types  of

vehicles, the Open Category can cater for this because it can be

used to register any type of vehicle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As several Members have pointed out, including Dr Wang, the

Open  Category COEs have been used mainly for the  bigger  cars.

But  this  has  not always been the case.  In  fact,  in  recent

months,  and  last year especially, about 40% of  Open  Category

COEs were used to register smaller cars.  And in the past, these

COEs had also been used to register commercial vehicles.  So  it

is not clear cut.  It is not preordained that Open Category COEs

are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>

used  for  the  larger  cars.  Things do change  as  the  market

changes.    In  conjunction  with  the  review  of   the   quota

distribution  mechanism, my Ministry will review the  proportion

of COEs to be allocated to the Open Category.  At the moment, it

is  25%.   We will continue with the 25%, but in the review,  we

will see whether this figure should be changed.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taking all these factors into account, the GPC report,

the  Government's response, and based on this new quota formula,

I would like to announce that the total number of COEs available

for the next quota year from 1st May 1999 to 30th April 2000  is

68,191.  This quota is about 42% higher than the quota for 1998.

As  there  is  unlikely to be much change in the  month-to-month

quota,  there is no need to announce the quota every six months,

as the GPC suggested in its report.  Details of the distribution

will  be  announced by LTA shortly.  I just want to further  add

that  with  the  merger of the car COEs, the five categories  of

COEs will be renamed Categories A to E.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we had used the existing formula, the COE quota for

this  year would have been slightly over 70,000.  This is  about

4%  higher than the quota based on the new formula that  we  are

going to use.  In its report, the GPC had suggested that we do a

one-time  adjustment, that means, we add the difference  to  the

quota to make up this difference.  I have considered this.   But

since this year's quota is already significantly higher than the

1998 quota, I have decided not to make this adjustment.  We will

monitor the situation and, if necessary, inject additional  COEs

after the implementation of the ERP Phase 2 later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the auction method, again another relatively

controversial subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system used is the lowest successful bid (LSB)

method.   The  GPC recommended that this method be retained  but

also  recommended that an open bidding system be  considered  to

give more responsive information and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>

greater  transparency.  And it recommended that we try this  out

in  the  Open Category.  As Members are aware, there  are  many,

many  different auction systems in the world and  in  Singapore.

Some  are  used to auction hogs, some are used to auction  cars,

some  flowers, others stocks and shares, which  is a very common

example.   Each of these systems has its strength and  weakness.

So  we  need  to  look for a system that can suit  our  specific

situation, a system that people generally accept to be fair  and

transparent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many calls from Members in this House as

well  as  members  of the public to implement  a  pay-as-you-bid

system.  The main reason behind such calls is the belief that  a

pay-as-you-bid  system  will  result  in  lower  premiums.   The

thinking  is  that with the lowest successful  bid,  people  are

encouraged to bid high because they do not have to pay.  In  the

pay-as-you-bid   system,  everybody  is  more  responsible   and

therefore  you bid responsibly.  However, if you take  a  closer

scrutiny  of the results of the tenders for the last months,  if

not years, I think you will find that this is not the case, that

actually in the current lowest successful bid system, people  do

not  generally bid irresponsibly.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock  had  given

some  details earlier about some of the bidding patterns.  These

results  are available to members of the public.  In fact,  they

are released to members of the press.  Anybody who is interested

can  go  to the LTA and get all these details.  My Ministry  has

analysed  the numbers and we do not see any evidence that  there

is  this  very  irresponsible bidding pattern that  people  have

attributed to the lowest successful bid system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Government agrees with the GPC's recommendation that

we  do  not  implement the pay-as-you-bid in the closed  bidding

system.  There is no evidence to suggest that the pay-as-you-bid

system  is superior to the lowest successful bid system. On  the

other  hand,  there are several disadvantages of the pay-as-you-bid  system.  These are cited in the GPC report and I  will  not

repeat them here, except to say that I agree with the reasons.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also agrees with the GPC that the open

bidding  system  merits  serious  consideration.   With  greater

transparency and more information, individuals will be  able  to

make  more  informed and rational decisions based  on  the  full

knowledge  of the prevailing market situation.  Many Members  in

this House, including Dr Toh See Kiat and Mr Chew Heng Ching, as

well  as many others outside, have expressed fears that an  open

bidding  system  will irrationally drive up prices,  leading  to

higher  premiums.   I  think  all  of  us  attend  Seventh  Moon

auctions.   Most of us do anyway.  We all cheer when the  prices

go up.  The organisers are happy.  The beneficiaries, whether  a

charity  or  a  grassroots organisation, are  also  happy.   The

successful  bidders are also happy.  Because  he  is  a  willing

buyer  of  a product that is being sold to him.  It is a  scarce

commodity.   Whether it is "or kim", a piece of black  gold,  or

whether  it is an engraved plaque that somebody has put  up  for

auction,  this  scarce commodity has been sold  to  the  highest

bidder. Nobody twisted his arm to bid for it, but he was  happy.

So it is with COEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open bidding system, people who value or who want

that COE in that particular month will go for it.  They will bid

high for it.  That is what an auction system is all about.   And

the revenues from COEs also go towards a good cause, whether  it

is  for  roads,  MRT, schools, or other public projects.   So  I

think  we  should  not  get carried away.  The  bidding  system,

whether  it is a closed system or an open system, is essentially

an  auction  for  a  scarce commodity.  In itself,  any  auction

system,  whether it is an open or closed bidding system,  should

not  lead  to  higher prices.  The price, in this case  the  COE

premium,  ultimately will be decided by the  bidders,  based  on

information that are available to them, the supply of COEs,  the

market economy, or their own situation, as Dr Wang pointed out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a closed bid, such information is not readily available.

So there is that element of luck involved.  You put your bid in.

If you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>

are  more  informed,  you tend to have a higher  probability  of

success.   If you are less informed, chances are that you  would

not  get  your COE.  But in an open system, the bidders will  be

fully aware of what the prevailing bids are.  Their own bid will

also  be  a deliberate one.  Every one will have easy access  to

the  same amount of information.  So in that respect, I  support

the  view of the GPC that an open bidding system will result  in

better  informed and, hence, more rational and more  responsible

bidding.   I  think this is a worthwhile objective  which  every

vehicle buyer will support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand and it is natural that there will be some

anxiety  and  apprehension  about  new  systems.   Some  Members

including Mr Ong Kian Min have asked: why change, why not  stick

to  the same thing, why introduce uncertainty? The answer is, if

we  can  have  something better, why not?  So is it  better?   I

think  that is a key question.  Is it better than what  we  have

today?   Is it really a new system?  People are anxious  because

they  say this is something new.  I think Mr Chay did point  out

that  this is not a new system. Share markets, currency  markets

trade  daily on stock and monetary exchanges on an open  bidding

system.   There are many, many sites on the Internet where  open

electronic  bids are quite common. E-bay is one  that  comes  to

mind.   I  think  there are many others, both  overseas  and  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars are now being sold on an open bidding system

electronically.   Traders in New Zealand  buy  second-hand  cars

from  Japan, and they bid for them on an open electronic bidding

system, a system which incidentally is managed and operated  out

of  Singapore.  Second-hand motor traders in Singapore, I  know,

are  now  thinking of using a similar system to allow people  to

buy  and  sell second-hand cars, again using an on-line  auction

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not think there is really that much to fear about

an  open bidding system transacted on-line.  However, I do agree

that  there  are many technical issues that need to  be  settled

before we go ahead with this system.  We need to settle things

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>

like  how  to  prevent  last  minute  bidding,  how  to  prevent

manipulation,  and so on.  My Ministry will study the  mechanics

of  this open bidding system in greater detail.  And we hope  to

introduce  a  trial  of this system within a  year.   While  the

Government  is  accepting in-principle the trial,  we  have  not

finalised whether this will be held in the Open Category, and we

are  open to suggestions on how to implement the trial.  I would

like  to  assure  Members  that the  Government  will  carefully

consider  all  the possible pitfalls of the open bidding  system

before we go ahead with it.  As Dr Toh See Kiat mentioned, there

are many reservations or possible pitfalls in such a system.  In

the  meantime,  we  will stick with the current  closed  system,

based  on  the lowest successful bid price.  We will not  change

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as information is concerned, Mr Ang Mong Seng asked

for more information.  We will gladly give members of the public

all  the information that is already available at LTA.  We  will

try to put them onto the LTA web-site.  In fact, many members of

the  public who were involved in the dialogue sessions with  the

GPC  were not even aware that information of the tender results,

including  their  own tenders, with their IC numbers  and  their

tender  price,  were  available at LTA.   Such  information  was

available to members of the public but they were not aware.   So

we  will  make this information more available on the  LTA  web-site.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that the review of the VQS

has  been  a worthwhile exercise.  There is a general  consensus

that  the  VQS  should be retained.  It is serving its  purpose.

Nevertheless, there are several recommendations to  improve  the

system.    The   Government   has   accepted   most    of    the

recommendations.   Others  would  be  considered  for   possible

implementation  at  a later date, such as open  bidding.   I  am

confident  that these changes will result in a system  which  is

fairer  and more efficient and which, hopefully, we do not  need

to tinker with for quite a long while.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay, would you like to continue?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to raise a question

on  Electronic Road Pricing.  The Government intends  to  extend

this ERP system.  I have received feedback from a member of  the

public.  According to this gentleman, he agrees that ERP and COE

systems  are necessary features.  But what are the criteria  the

Government  sets for evaluation before it extends the  ERP?   By

what  performance indicators do we measure whether the extension

of  the  ERP  is  justified?  When traffic  flow  in  a  certain

location is below the standard set, his question is: who  is  at

fault?   Is it because the authority did not build enough egress

or  ingress  roads to relieve the choked points?  Or were  there

not  sufficient improvements to public transport so that  people

have  to  continue to drive along that patch  of  road?   Should

there  therefore not be a built-up or a monitoring  period  when

information is transparent to the public as to the traffic  flow

situation and the alternative measures that are  in place before

raising the ERP charges once the traffic flow in that area drops

below  a certain target?  I hope the Minister can enlighten  the

House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I would like to reiterate my

support for the COE and the ERP.  Both measures are necessary to

control  our vehicle population and restrain road usage  in  the

long  term.  Indeed with the ERP, motorists are now more careful

in  planning their roads.  Some have even shifted to taking  MRT

and buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two concerns by Singaporeans

arising from the ERP.  The first concern relates to the loss  in

revenue  to  the  Government as a result of  the  ERP.   It  was

reported  recently in the local press that the  Government  road

revenue  actually dropped to $5.8 million a month on the average

under  the  ERP system as compared to a revenue of $9.3  million

per  month  under  the ALS system.  Some motorists  are  of  the

opinion, Sir, that because of this drop in revenue, the LTA  may

have  to  quickly  adjust the ERP charges  upwards  as  well  as

install more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>

gantries  to collect more revenue.  In doing so, the  Government

will  recover the shortfall in road revenue.  I would  like  the

Minister's  clarifications on this observation and reassure  the

House that the ERP exercise is not driven by revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern, Sir, relates to the congestion on the

CTE despite the introduction of ERP there.  There has been a lot

of  concern from the public that one of the reasons why  pricing

on  the  CTE  has  not  had  a significant  impact  in  reducing

congestion is mainly due to the lack of a better alternative  or

alternatives.  I believe the North-East MRT Line when  completed

will  present a fairly good alternative, but that is  some  time

away.   In the meantime, Sir, demand for use of the CTE  appears

to  be  very  price  inelastic.  Sure, at each  level  of  price

increase, some motorists would be priced out.  However, we  have

to  consider, Sir, at what cost, especially in the light of  the

current economic difficulties faced by motorists and businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CTE is inevitably a crucial part of our road

system  and we should perhaps avoid the regressive use of  price

as  the  only  consideration.  Any further hike in  ERP  charges

along  the  CTE  could  lead to increased  cost  burden  to  our

motorists and businesses if there are no better alternatives  or

transport  options.   I  think we could afford  some  degree  of

tolerance  for  some form of congestion along the  CTE  until  a

better  alternative  transport  system  is  made  available.   I

therefore  urge  the Minister to go slow on increasing  the  ERP

charges along the CTE.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, the general understanding of the

rationale of the ERP system is that it is a device, a mechanism,

to  manage traffic flow to keep it smooth in order to not hinder

productive  activity  and facilitate economic  growth.   So  the

logic  of  the  focus of the scheme in the past  was  geographic

focus in terms of CBD areas and the arterial roads leading  into

the  CBD and its focus on time in terms of peak hours and office

hours  was quite apparent.  And I think in general, Singaporeans

have come to regard the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>

ERP as a system to redistribute road usage in space and time  in

support of an economic objective.  But recent announcements  and

progressive changes in the system appear to suggest  that  there

has  been  a deviation from that original purpose.  For example,

the  system  has  been  extended from the morning  peak  to  the

evening peak to the intervening office hours to the CTE and  the

ECP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also announced that the scheme may be

extended  to areas fringing the CBD areas and also to  the  AYE.

This   suggests  that  the  focus  has  now  become  purely   on

optimisation of road usage.  It may be measured in terms of  the

traffic flow, speed of traffic, etc, but without regard  to  how

important  regulation of road usage in these  areas  is  to  the

overall economic objective.  I would venture to suggest that  as

we move further away from some of the core economic centres, the

economic  rationale diminishes and it becomes more of optimising

a  scarce resource, in this case, roads.  If we take that  logic

to  the  limit, then we would have 24-hour coverage  island-wide

for the ERP system and I assume that is not the objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Minister for a clarification on what

basis  the ERP system coverage will be extended and an assurance

that it will not indeed be a 24-hour coverage island-wide.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the ERP

system has been well-received.  The Ministry and the LTA deserve

to be congratulated for the smooth implementation of the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one now doubts the usefulness of the ERP in regulating

traffic.   Of  course, it can be improved, as some Members  have

already pointed out.  For example, in the case of the CTE,  some

serious  thoughts  need  to be paid to  the  heavy  built-up  of

traffic in expressways around 7.00 am or around 5.00 pm or  6.00

pm  near the Braddell areas where vehicles virtually crawl along

for  about  a kilometre.  But on the whole, one may be satisfied

with the general effectiveness of the ERP.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we read of complaints about ERP and the in-vehicle unit (IU). Specifically, there were complaints about

the  time  it  takes  for  the cashcard to  be  readable  before

reaching  the  ERP gantries.  Quite a few people remain  unhappy

even after LTA has replied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to raise two issues. The first is by treating

defaulters who did not insert their cashcards in time as  having

committed  a  criminal  offence.  The second  related  issue  is

fining  them  $30  for  the offence.  This  was,  I  understand,

already reduced from $70.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the use of the criminal law should be carefully

controlled.  In the case of traffic offences, the primary reason

for  using  the  criminal  law is to  protect  the  public  from

speeding or drunk drivers where road safety is an issue.  We can

and  should contrast that with the ERP, which is solely for  the

purpose  of  regulating traffic.  It is one of those  victimless

crimes  where no one is seen to be suffering directly  from  the

act in question.  In such a case, I believe that it is wrong  to

criminalise such conduct.  No one with any sense would be trying

deliberately to cheat a sophisticated electronic system such  as

the  ERP,  at least not with a simple method of not inserting  a

cashcard.   In  other  words, I believe  that  the  few  hundred

drivers  who are booked daily for not having cashcards in  their

IUs  are  just  careless.   Should such carelessness  attract  a

criminal sanction?  I think not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the solution lies in treating

such  cases  simply as deferred payment cases.  The  ERP  system

already takes a record of the so-called offending vehicle.   The

details  of  the  driver, etc, are easily  obtainable  from  the

records  of  the  LTA.  The driver can be billed  later  and  an

additional  administrative surcharge can be made.  Interest  can

be  charged on outstanding transactions.  For example, one could

say  that  LTA  has  to take steps to recover  the  minimum  sum

payable  with at least $5 plus an entry charge.  I have  to  say

that  I  look forward to the day when drivers can choose to  pay

either  through cashcards or, if not, through a billing  system,

say, at the end of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>

each  month.   To  minimise  inconvenience,  LTA  may  wish   to

stipulate that any such person choosing this method has to do it

by  GIRO and subject to an administrative charge.  At least, one

would have a good idea of the monthly cost of using a car in the

various ERP zones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the argument further, anyone who defaults on a

deferred  payment may not be permitted to renew the car  licence

without  full payment plus interest, some other surcharge,  such

as  that  applied in credit card transactions.  In the  case  of

foreign  cars without IU devices, it may indeed be a  preferable

way  of charging them.  They can pay when they leave or the next

time  when they enter the country, if they come back at all.   I

do  not think that there will be an enormous problem with  this.

As  it  is, foreign cars coming into Singapore have to  do  with

temporary units, which are costly, and I believe unfriendly.  It

follows  from what I have said before that I think the $30  fine

is  too  much.  Once again, we are not really dealing  with  the

road safety issue.  We need not fine drivers so heavily for  the

so-called offence.  The fine should be immediately reduced to  a

lesser  sum  which  I  think  should  be  the  entry  fee   plus

administrative charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that had LTA taken this view that we are

not   talking  about  criminal  sanctions,  it  would  not  have

generated the somewhat heated exchange between LTA and those who

have written to the press.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one acquaintance of mine referred to the ERP as

standing  for "Excessive Recurring Penalties".  I hope  that  it

can  instead  stand for "Effortless, Reasonable Pricing"  and  I

urge the Minister and the LTA to consider this seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since

its implementation, the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system has

been  proven  to  be  significantly effective  in  changing  the

travelling  pattern  of  road  users  and  in  alleviating  road

congestion.   I  can remember that prior to the introduction  of

the  road pricing system, driving along CTE between 8.00 am  and

<br>9.30 am was a nightmare.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>

Now,  we  can even accurately forecast the number of minutes  we

need  to  travel from the north to south to get  into  the  city

area.   As  such,  I  agree with the Government's  intention  to

continue  developing  this scheme and  to  expand  the  area  of

coverage of the ERP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I hope that the Government will not treat the ERP

as  a  panacea for all ailments.  In my view, the ERP is only  a

convenient  and inexpensive "Po Chai Pill".  If the  problem  is

not  very  serious, it can be taken for some quick relief.   But

for  the  heavily  congested bottlenecks, we have  to  think  of

something else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give you an illustration. Blockage of cardiac

blood vessel is quite common nowadays in Singapore.  During  the

initial  stage of blockage, it can be cured by medication,  just

spend  more  money and take the more expensive special  medicine

for  it  and the blood vessels may be cleared.  However, if  the

condition  turns worse, then the patient will  have  to  go  for

surgery  and  the specialist will insert a metal  stent  in  his

blood  vessel.  If our roads are in such a situation, LTA should

consider  building  some  viaducts  or  tunnels  to  clear   the

congestion.   As for total blockage where the blood vessels  are

beyond remedy, a bypass cannot be avoided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consider the Northeast part of Singapore where my

constituency  is  situated.   With  the  rapid  development   of

Hougang,  Sengkang and Punggol 21, some 1,000 residential  units

are  being  churned out every month.  What we need  there  is  a

bypass.   Apart from the NEL (North-East Line), we need  also  a

NEE  (North-East Expressway) because the CTE is fast becoming  a

totally blocked artery which is beyond remedy.

<br>2.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me

to  join  in  the  debate  at this point  of  time.   Since  the

introduction  of  the ERP, we have various  successes  with  the

implementation.  In some cases, the ERP has an effect of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>

smoothening traffic flow and in other cases, the situation seems

to  have worsened.  At the sitting of Parliament in October last

year, the Minister for Communications did mention that since the

implementation of the first phase of ERP in September 1998,  the

CTE  traffic  congestion  had worsened with  the  average  speed

falling  to  35  to  50 kilometres an hour which  is  below  the

optimal level of 50 to 55 kilometres an hour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that the LTA would be looking at

the CTE problem closely and would make the necessary adjustments

on ERP rates in order to smoothen the traffic flow.  Since then,

the ERP rates to the CTE have been revised.  Goods vehicles have

had  their charges increased because it was discovered that  the

goods vehicles were primarily contributing to the congestion  at

the CTE during peak hours.  Since the revision of rates, it does

not  appear  to me that traffic flow along the CTE  during  peak

hours  has  improved substantially.  I do not have the  relevant

data   or   statistics.    However,  based   on   my   empirical

observations, I notice that between 8.30 am and 9.30 am, traffic

is  at  its peak despite the revised ERP charges.  Traffic along

the  CTE is at times bumper to bumper, and it stretches all  the

way from Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 to the Balestier turnoff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Communications whether

the  traffic  situation  along the CTE  has  remained  the  same

despite  the  revision  of the ERP rates  and,  if  so,  whether

further  measures can be taken to smoothen the flow  of  traffic

along  the  CTE.  And like my colleagues before me, I  certainly

hope  that the further measures taken by the Ministry would  not

result  in additional or greater charges to the motorists  using

the CTE.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, when we were discussing the Vehicle

Quota  System review, I mentioned that the Vehicle Quota  System

is one of the key pillars of our traffic management strategy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are talking about the second pillar of our traffic

management strategy which is electronic road pricing.   I  think

the difference between what we introduced last year and what  we

have  been  practising for the last 24 years is simply  that  we

have  mechanised it.  We just added the "E" to  the  "RP".  Road

pricing is something that we have practised since 1975.  With 24

years  of  experience  in road pricing, there  is  no  doubt  in

anybody's  mind now that it works.  Motorists who use our  roads

now  are more conscious about planning their journeys and  those

who do not find it worthwhile will either change the time of the

journey  or  they change their routes. There is  something  else

which the Ministry would like to see more of, that is, shift  to

public  transport  or car pool. Those who are  prepared  to  pay

enjoy  a  relatively  smoother and faster  ride.   But  is  that

sufficient?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to take Mr Chay's query on how

we are going to assess the criteria of adjusting ERP, whether it

is  the  rates  or  the  locations.  As far  as  the  rates  are

concerned,  the  objective of ERP is really to smoothen  traffic

flow,  that is, to optimise the usage of our roads.  I  use  the

word "optimise" because this means that we do not want the roads

to  be  under utilised, as much as we do not want it to be  over

utilised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, LTA mentioned that it will be reviewing the

ERP  rates on a quarterly basis and this will be done  based  on

the  prevailing  traffic  conditions.   LTA  has  finalised  the

criteria governing ERP rate changes and will be announcing  them

shortly.  The first rate adjustment will be made on  1st  April,

next month.  As I said earlier, we do not want roads to be under

utilised,  neither do we want it to be over congested.   So,  if

roads  are  under utilised in this review, rates will  go  down.

Conversely, if congestion has worsened, rates will go up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew and indirectly, Mr Iswaran, also expressed some

concern about the side effects of the ERP. For example, will  it

move  congestion away from those roads that are priced to  those

that are unpriced outside the CBD area?  With road pricing,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>

motorists  have  a  choice.  They can  either  choose  a  smooth

journey  or  they can use the unpriced roads and  tolerate  some

congestion  or  some delays.  Whether that congestion  level  is

tolerable  or  not, really depends on the individual  motorists.

Some  are  prepared to tolerate very high levels of  congestion,

others  do not want to see a single traffic light.  So, this  is

what  was  taking  place in the early stages  of  road  pricing.

However, over time, we must expect that the unpriced roads  will

become   more  and  more  congested.   Our  vehicle   population

continues  to grow, 3% on the average per annum compounded  over

the last nine years, more than that earlier.  According to LTA's

traffic  surveys,  the  traffic  conditions  outside  the  city,

between   the   CBD   and  the  outer  ring  zone,   have   been

deteriorating.   In fact, the roads just outside the  restricted

zone  have  become  more congested than those within  the  zone.

Currently, the traffic in the region between the CBD  and  outer

ring roads --- a series of roads which include Queensway, Farrer

Road,  Adam  Road, Lornie Road, all the way to  Braddell,  Upper

Aljunied, Mountbatten and Fort Road --- areas like Thomson Road,

Upper  Serangoon Road, MacPherson Road, Rochor Road, these areas

are  all beginning to experience more and more severe congestion

during  peak hours.  LTA has measured some of the travel  speeds

in these areas and some of them have actually fallen below 20%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you project the situation forward, if you do a

simulation,  you will see, and this is what LTA has  done,  that

the  congestion  level of these roads will worsen  significantly

during  the next few years if nothing is done.  What  does  this

mean?   Even if you have a very congestion free CBD, if you  are

driving  into the CBD from outside, you will find that  it  will

take  you  longer to get to your destination.  You have  got  to

battle  through the jams on the outer ring roads before you  can

even get to the CBD.  And obviously, this is going to completely

nullify  the  positive effects of the various measures  that  we

have taken to keep the CBD congestion free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with road pricing and with traffic

congestion tells us that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>

have  to nip this problem in the bud before it gets worse.   So,

we  have to move away from the idea that ERP is only for the CBD

and expressways.  Indeed, if we look back at our history of road

pricing,  as Mr Iswaran pointed out just now, it was clear  that

as  vehicle population grew, congestion slowly but surely spread

from  the  CBD  onto  the ring roads, and the  expressways.   We

started  out  with ALS in the CBD in 1975 for the  morning  peak

only.  As traffic grew, we extended the ALS to the evening  peak

in  1989.  In 1994, traffic started to build up again in between

the  two  peaks, so we had to implement ALS throughout the  day.

Then, the expressways became congested.  So we implemented  road

pricing  on  the  expressways, first, on East Coast  Parkway  in

1995, then on the CTE and the PIE in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost unavoidable that we will have to tackle the

increasing congestion problem on the ring roads.  To  answer  Mr

Iswaran,  while the policy objective of the ERP has not changed,

it  remains one of optimising road space. We will have to extend

ERP to tackle congestion where and when it exacts a toll on road

users, and consequently, on the economy and our way of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congestion has moved beyond the CBD and the expressways to

the ring roads.  We have to expand ERP in tandem.  Whether there

will  be a 24-hour coverage of the ERP throughout the island  is

not  for me to say now. But if we had traffic congestion for  24

hours  a  day, do you think we should also have ERP 24  hours  a

day?  I think that is an interesting question, which I will  not

answer   now.  But  if  the  situation  arises  where  we   have

intolerable  traffic congestion and our roads  are  clogged  and

there is a cost associated with that, should not we make use  of

all the available measures to tackle the problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second phase of the ERP implementation plan, LTA

has  recommended implementing this additional cordon outside the

CBD.  This will be done progressively with effect from September

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>

1999.    The   cordon   will  include  the  existing   congested

bottlenecks  like  the  PIE at Adam Road  in  the  direction  of

Changi,  Thomson Road, Bendemeer Road and Kallang  Road  towards

the  city.   The  exact gantry locations and the ERP  rates  are

still  under  study  and will depend on the  prevailing  traffic

conditions  at  those points during morning peak periods.   This

cordon, to answer Mr Iswaran, will also include a point  on  the

AYE.   I  previously indicated that the AYE would  be  the  next

place   where   road  pricing  could  occur   because   of   the

deteriorating traffic conditions on the CTE which is at  present

the only major expressway into the city not subject to ERP.   We

have  tried to delay it for as long as possible but the  traffic

situation  there  has  reached  a  stage  where  it  has  become

necessary  to  introduce  ERP on the  AYE  as  well.   LTA  will

announce  details of the gantry positions and the  rates  to  be

applied for the ERP Phase II in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the problem on the CTE. It appears to be a

peculiar  problem. It has generated interest  among  Members  of

Parliament  whose constituencies are in the north and north-east

areas.   Mr  Chew Heng Ching, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Sin  Boon

Ann  pointed out correctly that the ERP on the CTE alone is  not

solving  the  problem.  The LTA is aware of  the  problem.   The

congestion is caused by several factors.  Firstly, in the  early

stages,  because  of the pricing that we introduced,  many  more

taxis  and  commercial vehicles made use of the CTE relative  to

the  number of private cars.  That was resolved last  year  when

the  ERP  rates  for  these  vehicles  were  raised.   This  has

alleviated, but not solved the problem because there  are  other

reasons for the congestion on the CTE.  It is an expressway with

many entrances and exits and serves very huge housing estates in

that  part of Singapore - Sembawang, Yishun, Ang Mo Kio and even

Tampines  and Pasir Ris.  These are all in the north and  north-east. CTE also links a number of major material roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens is that many motorists exit the CTE before the

ERP  gantry  point at Braddell and this causes a big tail  back.

The  exit  at Braddell Road is also a very congested and  narrow

exit.  LTA will, first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>

of all, expand that CTE-Braddell Road interchange.  Tenders have

been called this year, work is starting middle of this year  and

should  be  ready by the year 2002.  But Mr Yeo  Guat  Kwang  is

correct to say that there has to be a whole series of solutions.

It  is not just one solution alone.  The longer-term solution is

to  provide more public transport options for people  living  in

north-east and this is where the north-east MRT line is going to

be  useful.  The north-east MRT line will be ready in 2002.   In

the meantime, before that is ready, before the CTE-Braddell Road

interchange is implemented, some other solutions will have to be

found  and  this  will  include increasing  ERP  rates  for  all

vehicles and implementing additional ERP gantries along the CTE.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also suggested an additional expressway, which he

called  the North East Expressway.  He will be pleased  to  know

that  there is indeed a plan for such an expressway in the long-term  transport  plan to serve the north east  area.   In  fact,

there  will be two expressways.  One will be called the  Kallang

Expressway and the other will be the Paya Lebar Expressway.  The

Kallang  Expressway will connect the East Coast Parkway  to  the

Pan-Island  Expressway.   So it will divert  traffic  down  this

route.  The Paya Lebar Expressway will be a continuation of  the

Kallang   Expressway  northwards  to  link  up   with   Tampines

Expressway.  Alignments of these expressways are being finalised

and are expected to be completed by 2006.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to a very interesting proposal by Prof.

Chin  on  ERP violations.  Yes, I agree that ERP violations  are

mainly  due  to  forgetfulness or carelessness on  the  part  of

motorists.   I  do  not think anybody wants  to  cheat  the  ERP

system.   In fact, they know that there is a very low chance  of

success  if  they want to do that, which is a testament  to  the

technical integrity of the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, when we had the ALS system, paper licence

system, the fine for going through the gantry without displaying

a licence was $70.  We reduced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>

the  ERP  composition fine to $30 in May last year.  Prof.  Chin

thinks that $30 is still too much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the full implementation of ERP in September last

year,  the  number of cases has dropped from about  1,200  cases

daily  to  less than 800 cases a day now.  If you look at  these

800  cases, this is something like 0.3% of the total  number  of

transactions we have every day going through the gantries.  More

than  99%  of motorists have no problem in ensuring  that  their

cashcards  are properly inserted. I am sure that over time,  the

habit  of  inserting  cashcards into the IU before  beginning  a

journey will be well formed.  But I do sympathise with the point

of  view  of  Prof. Chin. If we can come up with a  fair  system

which  does  not  take  up  too much  administrative  effort  or

resource,  to allow motorists who forget to insert the  cashcard

to   somehow  pay  for  the  outstanding  ERP  charge  plus   an

administrative  surcharge  -   I am glad he  mentioned  that   - then I think it is an idea worth looking at. I will ask the  LTA

to look into this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other option he suggested of having a monthly

billing  system, I am not so sure whether this will  be  a  very

popular option.  We did discuss this when we first designed  the

ERP  system  and  we toyed with the option of having  a  monthly

billing  system  where  everybody gets a monthly  bill,  and  no

worries  about inserting the cashcards or forgetting  and  being

fined.  But we opted for the smartcard system because of several

reasons.   First, we wanted to do away with this very  expensive

and elaborate central accounting system, because this is what we

need  in order to keep track of all the 700,000 motorists  going

through the gantries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and this is an important point, we wanted to make

motorists aware and more conscious of the cost of motoring, that

every  time you pass through a gantry, you are aware that it  is

costing you something.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it helps us to move towards a cashless society by

encouraging the use of smartcards.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and this is not a trivial consideration, with a

monthly  billing system, privacy could be an issue if  motorists

are  concerned  about  having details of their  movements  being

recorded.  According to some accounts, the main reason why  road

pricing  was rejected very early on in Hong Kong was because  of

the privacy consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the complexity of the system, we did not want, in the

initial stages, to complicate the system further.  But I do  not

rule  out  the fact that as motorists become more aware  of  the

system, as they become more used to it, as the system beds  down

more, we can consider introducing some of these refinements that

Prof. Chin suggested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, we have achieved a major milestone in

land  transport policy when the ERP system successfully replaced

the  manual ALS and RPS systems last year.  Technically,  it  is

working to our satisfaction.  From the transport perspective, it

is  achieving its purpose of spreading traffic and  keeping  our

roads  free  flowing.  And, most importantly, 700,000 motorists,

who  have  IUs fitted, have become familiar with the system  and

the majority have no problems with the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our vehicle ownership and usage management

measures may seem harsh at times, motorists understand that they

are necessary if we are to keep our goods and people moving, our

economy  buzzing,  our  quality of life  improving.   These  two

traffic management tools must not be seen in isolation.  They go

hand  in  hand.   The  3% per annum compound growth  in  vehicle

population for the next five years can only be sustained  -  and

this  is for Mr Iswaran's note  -  if we expand the ERP.  I hope

that motorists will not simply divert their trips from ERP roads

or  ERP hours but seriously consider alternatives such as public

transport and car pooling.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

what is the rationale for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>

allowing the bus transport companies to bid to operate the North

East Line when the SMRT is not.  The bus companies will have  to

bring in foreign train operators to run this service.  Is  it  a

kind  of  discrimination on SMRT?  And how are we so  sure  that

SMRT  will  not be able to provide a better low-cost service  on

rule-based competition compared with the foreign operators?

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am urging the

Minister  to consider the setting up of a classic cars  category

so that there will be a population of home grown older cars as a

record  of  our  heritage.  Currently, there is  a  category  of

vintage  cars.   These  are  cars  manufactured  prior  to  31st

December 1939.  There are 92 such cars in Singapore, and most of

them  are  on special terms of restricted use to enjoy  a  lower

cost  of  keeping them in Singapore.  Vintage cars on restricted

use  can  be  put  on our roads 28 days per calendar  year.   In

return  for the restricted use, they are exempted from the  VQS,

ie,  owners  need not pay the PQP to retain their  registration.

Road  tax  is paid on a day basis to cover those days when  they

are  on the road, and the fee to register a vintage car is  only

$140.  But the car cannot be sold or transferred in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been much emphasis placed on

reclaiming  our heritage.   Much effort and money are  allocated

to  the conservation of buildings. Very often, when there  is  a

need  to showpiece the history of motoring in Singapore, members

of  the vintage club are approached to participate and to parade

their  cars.  Sadly, nothing is being done to enable  people  to

retain  better  old cars.  In wanting to keep our population  of

cars  young  and therefore relatively trouble free, we  overlook

that  there  are  people who maintain their  cars  in  excellent

condition.  Enthusiasts spend a lot of energy and money to  keep

their  cars in pristine condition.  To quote an example, I refer

to the 130 Minis owned by 135 members of the Mini Car Club.  All

the  Minis are in extremely good condition, their members having

made great effort to trace and import original parts to preserve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>

their  Minis in almost as good as new condition.  It  is  merely

their enthusiasm that keeps them going.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose the establishment of a classic car

category.   The definition should be based on age, and  I  would

suggest  an  age  of  40 years.  No car can  survive  that  long

without proper care and attention.  Thus, there is no danger  of

such cars breaking down frequently and causing congestion on our

roads.   To  help  the enthusiasts with the cost of  maintaining

such cars in good condition, I would like to suggest that for  a

restricted  use of 90 days per calendar year, they  be  exempted

from  paying the PQP and the road tax be paid only for the  days

of  use.  The registration fee should also be retained at  $140.

The  restricted  use for vintage cars should be revised  on  the

same basis as that for the classic cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as motoring is clearly an important subject for

Singaporeans,  it  is right to allow the creation  of  a  living

record  of  our  heritage  in  motoring.   As  in  our  historic

buildings,  before we lose more of our classic cars,  we  should

take immediate steps to preserve what is left.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister to give this proposal serious

consideration.   Only  the enthusiasts  and  people  willing  to

invest  time, effort and money would bother to keep  such  cars.

It is safe to say that there are sufficient measures such as the

PQP  and  premium  on road tax payable in the initial  years  to

ensure  that only the better cars will be kept up to and  beyond

40  years.   In  the hands of enthusiasts, these  cars  will  be

better  maintained than a much younger car in the hands  of  the

average motorist.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we have clearly seen

a  marked  improvement to our public transport system  over  the

past  decade.  Our people are now enjoying more comfortable  and

convenient  services.  Our bus services have  been  continuously

improved,  and the MRT network is expanding all the time.    The

"Star of Tomorrow" - the LRT will be making its debut soon.  For

all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>

these,  credit  must  be  given to LTA  and  all  our  transport

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our strive for excellence and our spirit of wanting to

do   better  than  the  best,  I  hope  that  the  Ministry   of

Communications  will  continue to  explore  ways  and  means  to

further improve our public transport system, particularly on how

to  enable our commuters to reach their destinations faster  and

let  our  workers reach their places of work in a shorter  time.

We  have  to  work harder on this.  Between comfort and  shorter

travelling time, I think I will choose the latter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a random survey I conducted on our workers, I

discovered  that they have to spend a lot of time  on  the  road

going  to  and  returning  from  work.   Let  me  give  you   an

illustration.  A worker who goes from Choa Chu Kang to Tuas will

need   about  1  hour and 30 minutes (including waiting/transfer

time).   From  Jurong East to Tuas, it takes  about  1  hour  20

minutes.  For those who live in Yishun and if they want to go to

Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park, or for those who stay in Bedok going

to  Loyang  or  Upper Changi Industrial Estate, they  will  need

about  an  hour  on  the road.  I hope that the  authority  will

seriously explore more effective ways to shorten the time needed

by our workers on the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of the welfare of our workers, I would again

earnestly  urge  the  Ministry of Communications  to  build  MRT

stations at industrial estates along the MRT lines, such as  the

Sungei Kadut Industrial Estate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, before I move on

to  my  amendment, I would like to associate with the sentiments

of  Mr  Gerard  Ee.   I  hope the Minister  will  give  him  due

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on public transport, I applaud the Ministry for having

given Singapore one of the best public transport in this part of

the  world.  Having said that, let me say that there is  further

room  for  improvement.  I agree with Mr Yeo earlier.   We  must

devise  means and methods to shorten the time of travel on  bus.

Sir, I would urge the Minister to give consideration to one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>

area, ie, perhaps the bus companies could work out a schedule so

that  passengers who are sitting in the office  could  find  out

from  the  Internet what time a bus would reach its destination.

If we know this, Sir, it will save travelling time.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter is a more difficult issue, but I would

urge the Minister to consider.  At the present moment, we have a

duopoly, TIBS and Singapore Bus Service.  May I ask the Minister

to  give consideration to the possibility of having a third  bus

company  or  a fourth bus company.  We know monopoly  is  not  a

healthy  sign and it will be good for Singapore in the long  run

to have more bus companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which has not been explored is that we should

help  the  public  transport.  To relieve  congestion  from  the

roads,  cycling should be encouraged for short distance.   Going

to  the  wet  market or buying something in the provision  shop,

even  for  a short distance of half a kilometre, or two  hundred

metres,  people  still  go by car.  I see  my  good  friend,  Mr

Yatiman  Yusof  nodding his head.  I hope he  is  supporting  my

suggestion.  He is championing the cyclists' cause and  I  think

it is healthy to cycle.  Many of us, when we were young, used to

cycle  to  school.   I think that is not done  now.   We  should

encourage cycling.  It is also a way to save the environment  as

well.   If  we  have  less  pollution, it  will  be  better  for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head I (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I would like the

Minister to give us an update of bringing the Woodlands MRT line

to  Johor  Baru.  It was reported in the Straits Times in  March

1991  that the Woodlands MRT line was designed to make  it  easy

for the authorities to build an extension to Johor Baru.  It was

also further reported that the possibility of expanding the  MRT

from  Woodlands  to Johor Baru was endorsed  and  agreed  to  in

principle  by  Malaysian and Singapore Ministers  and  the  then

Johor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.  The Woodlands MRT

line  has  since been successfully constructed and has  been  in

operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think that bringing the MRT line into Johor

Baru and beyond, say, to Scudai is a very good idea.  If not for

anything else, this MRT line shall alleviate the traffic jams at

the  Johor-Singapore Causeway.  The traffic jams at the Causeway

of  late  appear  to be on the Singapore side of  the  Causeway.

Last  Saturday,  13th March, at about 4.30 pm, I personally  was

caught  in a nasty traffic jam for one-and-a-half hours  at  the

stretch  of  road  from  the exit of the BKE  to  the  Singapore

Immigration  Checkpoint.   I  noticed  that  at  the   Singapore

Immigration Checkpoint, only about six or seven booths,  out  of

about  28,  were  in  operation.  What astounded  me  was  that,

despite  the  heavy traffic, the Singapore authorities  did  not

deploy  enough traffic police to direct the flow of traffic.   I

saw  only  two uniformed policemen were on duty at the point  of

entry into the immigration area.  At that point of time, it  was

utter  chaos  at  that  stretch  of  the  road  leading  to  the

Immigration Checkpoint.  Cars were vying with each other to inch

their way forward.  Five rows of them were packed on the stretch

of road which was only designed for four

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>

rows  of  cars at the most.  On top of that, there were hundreds

of  motorcyclists weaving their way forward between cars and  in

full  throttle with each of the motorcycles emitting thick black

smoke.   The  atmosphere there was filled with black  fumes.   I

pity  those  two  policemen who were on duty there.   They  were

subjected  to  breathing the unhealthy air  filled  with  smoke.

They  were breathing without any protection.  Their health  will

surely be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do think that an MRT line going into Johor is a good

thing.   It  not only helps to solve the constant traffic  jams,

but it shall surely increase the business between Johor Baru  on

the  one hand and the Woodlands Town Centre and Singapore  as  a

whole  on the other.  It shall also bring the people of Malaysia

and  Singapore  closer  and  the relationship  between  the  two

countries can further be strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there are steps

taken since 1991 to construct the MRT into Johor Baru.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over

the  last  one year or so, many Singaporeans who were retrenched

or who were worried of being retrenched have been taking up taxi-driving for a living. Therefore, the taxi-driving profession has

many "new talents" coming in.  Many of them were former managers

or  professionals.   These "new talents" are somewhat  different

from the foreign talents that we were talking about the last few

days.   Although  the  entry  of  these  newcomers  has  created

competition  against the old-timers, our existing  taxi  drivers

sympathise  with  them because they understand  that  these  ex-managers  and  ex-professionals too need to  earn  a  living  to

support  their families.  On the other hand, the commuters   are

happy  because  there  are  now more taxis  available  to  them.

Talking  about  foreign talents, our taxi drivers  do  sincerely

welcome  them to Singapore, because most of these foreigners  do

not  drive  and  they take taxi all the time,  giving  our  taxi

drivers more business.  With more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>

taxi drivers available, it also resolves the previous problem of

matching taxis with drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one thing we need to improve upon. This is the

time  when  the  taxi  service industry is  undergoing  a  major

reform.   We should take away some of the old regulations  which

are  becoming obsolete by now, so that our taxi drivers can also

contribute  towards  our  move  towards  a  world-class   public

transport system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing rule requires every taxi driver to undergo a

refresher course once in every 10 years.  I think this ought  to

be  reviewed now.  The taxi service industry  is moving  towards

more  high-tech operations, such as computer-aided  distribution

of  service, satellite calls, etc.  Taking a course once in  ten

years  cannot keep the drivers abreast of the latest technology.

Moreover,  taking a refresher course once in 10 years means  the

driver will have to go for courses five nights in a row.  It  is

very  inconvenient to the taxi drivers.  Perhaps, we could  have

it  once every five years for two nights in a row, or maybe once

every  two  years  for a one-night course.  I think  this  taxi-driver  refresher  course should be  treated   as  part  of  the

"Lifelong Learning Scheme"  so that taxi drivers can enjoy  some

sort of subsidies.  At present, they have to pay the full course

fees  on  their  own.   I feel that our taxi drivers  should  be

allowed  to take up the various training courses like the  other

Singaporeans.  Actually, in driving a taxi, you have to use your

brain  too.   You  have  to  map out the  route  which  is  less

congested  and  drive your passenger to his destination  in  the

shortest  possible time.  As a matter of fact, the taxi  service

industry is one of the first industries to be computerised.   It

is  the philosophy of the taxi drivers that with the combination

of  the  "electronic brain" (Chinese expression for "computer"),

and  the  human  brain, we can provide better services  for  our

commuters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I urge hon. Members to be brief so that

we   can  take  the  replies  from  the  frontbench  before  the

"guillotine"?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, by and large, the bus service in

Singapore is very good by international standards.  Most of  the

complaints  tend to centre around the crowded buses during  peak

hours.   But  what  prompted me to speak  on  this  cut  is  the

perceived  poor  responsiveness of the system  with  respect  to

population   shift,  especially  when  new  HDB  precincts   are

completed  and the population moves in.  I am not  referring  to

new town development but precinct development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me relate my experience in Toh Guan Estate in my

constituency.   In that particular estate, about 5,000  families

have  moved into the 30-plus HDB blocks.  During my house  visit

in   August  last  year,  almost  every  family  in  that  block

complained  about the lack of transportation service from  their

home to the nearest market.  After that, during the block party,

more  than 100 housewives surrounded me and said, "We have  this

problem."   Experienced though I am, as an MP, I think  any  one

who  is  faced with 100 angry housewives would find it difficult

to handle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I brought up the issue with SBS, it came back with

a  very  polite reply, saying, "There is no problem.   Residents

can  take  this  bus,  that way.  They can change  bus  at  that

location  to  get to their market."  When I brought  up  to  the

Public Transport Council (PTC), PTC came back with a very polite

reply,  again, saying, "All the established standards have  been

met and residents will have no problem taking the bus from where

they want to go to where they are."  Finally, after a lot of to-ing  and fro-ing, I am grateful to report that a new bus service

has  finally  been introduced on 7th March this  year.   What  I

would  like  to  do  here  is to urge the  Minister  to,  maybe,

communicate  with  the  PTC  to  establish  a  new  standard  to

anticipate  new  demands rather than the Members  of  Parliament

bringing  up the problems and then the system responds to  these

problems.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

going  to  speak  on  what would appear to be  a  small  matter,

something concerning a difference of 30 cents only.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that most of our NUS students use public

transport  to get to their campus, in particular, many  of  them

use SBS bus service No. 96 from Clementi Bus Interchange to Kent

Ridge.   Whether it is an air-conditioned service  or  not,  the

minimum charge is 60 cents.  Many students feel that the fare of

60  cents   is  very  expensive  and  unreasonable  because  the

distance  is  so  short.  They are  asking for the  fare  to  be

reduced to 30 cents, as in the feeder service.  Although  it  is

just a difference of 30 cents, to the NUS students 30 cents  per

trip, when accumulated, can mean  a lot of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have made representation to SBS, but the company had

turned  them  down  and the explanation given  is  unconvincing.

SBS's justification for sticking to the 60-cent minimum fare  is

that bus service No. 96 is operated from Buona Vista Interchange

and  not a loop service from Clementi Interchange to Kent Ridge.

Technically, it is not a feeder service.  It cannot qualify as a

feeder bus service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this current economic crisis, the Ministry of Education

has  already frozen the incremental university tuition fees.   I

hope  the  Ministry of Communications would take up  the  matter

with SBS so as not to give our NUS students the feeling that SBS

is  operating  on a monopoly and any hope of fare  reduction  is

out of the question!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I have more or

less the same issue as Mr Peh and, that is, the issue of whether

deregulation  of bus services would indeed lower  the  costs  to

commuters and also encourage enterpreneurship as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, there are two bus operators, SBS and

TIBS,  together with some Scheme B operators and private shuttle

services.   But  as far as I understand, there  are  no  private

operators running services along trunk routes or along  selected

routes which are not feeder services.  It would seem to me  that

selective allowance of private operators would improve  services

to commuters without severely affecting the profitability of the

present bus companies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>

I am aware that bus companies use the profitable routes, such as

the  trunk  services,  to cross-subsidise  unprofitable  routes.

However,  I  am  not  convinced that  deregulation  of  selected

services  would,  in  effect, result  in  a  loss  of  financial

viability of the two major bus companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A service precisely in point is the one from the Clementi

Interchange  to  the NUS campus that Mr Peh talked  about.   One

specific  suggestion I have is to open up  the  route  from  the

Clementi Interchange to the NUS campus at Kent Ridge to  private

operators and see whether this would indeed result in a fall  in

bus fares and an improvement in service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek clarification regarding the

Minister's  statement that the longer term plan is  to  have  at

least  two  main  operators running both  rail  and  bus  lines,

together  with several smaller bus operators, and  whether  this

plan in effect means a deregulation of bus services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the present bus structure is such

that  the minimum one passenger pays for four fare stages is  60

cents.  But I urge the Minister to reconsider the position.   We

should possibly allow two or three fare stages for 40 cents  and

then  go  up  gradually.  Now, it is actually 60 cents  for  the

first  four fare stages and another four fare stages.  Could  we

have  two  fare stages at one fare and then the other  two  fare

stages?   So  it  would  be equitable and  fair.   I  share  the

sentiments of both my colleagues, Dr Lee and Mr Peh.  It is most

unfair  to travel a short distance and pay so much.  Why  do  we

not  follow telephone usage?  The longer you use, the  more  you

pay.  It is only fair and equitable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in the interest of time, I will give

a  very  brief  response  to an issue  which,  I  think,  really

requires  much  more time. This is the issue of  multi-modality.

Both Dr Lee and Mr Chay Wai Chuen touched on this issue in their

questions.  The  purpose of this move towards multi-modality  is

really  to improve the overall public transport system.   I  use

the  words  "public transport system" because, right  now,  what

happens is that we have operators that run buses and we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>

operators  that run trains.  We do not have operators  that  run

both.   This is really not ideal from the point of view  of  the

commuting  public.  And, indeed, neither is it sustainable  from

the point of  view of the industry as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members will recall, as we extend our rail network, what

happens  is  that the buses will lose their market  share.  Over

time,  as  we envisage a more extensive rail network, the  buses

will  gradually  lose  more  and more  of  their  market  share.

Eventually, what we are going to see, if we do not do  anything,

is  that  the  bus operators will lose their ability  to  cross-subsidise.  In fact, there is a lot of cross-subsidisation  that

goes  on  within  the system.  But if all the major  routes  are

taken  over  by  trains, the bus companies will lose  their  so-called   lucrative  services,  the  cream  of  their   services.

Eventually, the ability to provide those services which  Mr  Rai

and Dr Lee talked about and which are losing money, that ability

to  cross-subsidise will be gone.  So that is another reason why

we are moving towards this system of multi-modal environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, buses and trains will be operated by a

single    operator.    There   will   be   better   integration,

synchronisation of timing, and, hopefully, integration will also

lead  to better fare systems.  These changes in the fare systems

that  we  are  talking about today can be looked at  in  a  more

comprehensive way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move towards this structure, the first step is that we

have invited SBS and TIBS, who are both bus operators, to tender

for  the  operation of the North-East MRT Line as  well  as  the

Punggol  and  Sengkang LRTs.  This is not to  suggest  that  the

SMRT,  as Mr Chay asked just now, is not doing a good  job.   On

the  contrary, it is doing a good job.  However, we  are  taking

this opportunity to look at a new structure for the industry and

taking this opportunity, with the advent of the North-East Line,

to encourage bus operators to go into train operations. And vice

versa because we will also be encouraging the train operator  to

do likewise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a step towards deregulation? This will allow us to

deregulate because once we have a multi-modal environment and we

have  two or more multi-modal operators, I envisage that we will

also  have  room  to accommodate smaller single mode  operators,

essentially   bus  operators.   We  already  have  private   bus

operators.   Scheme B operators are already covering  or  plying

some  of  the routes.  But they are not sufficient to give  that

competitive push to the major operators.  I recognise that.  And

in  this multi-modal environment, I hope that we will be able to

further  deregulate bus routes and allow more direct competition

amongst single mode bus operators and multi-mode operators.  But

this  has to be done in a managed and sustainable manner and  my

Ministry   will  be  reviewing  the  regulatory  and   licensing

framework to achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask my Minister of State and Parliamentary Secretary

to answer the other questions.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun):</b> Sir, Mr Yeo, Mr Rai and Dr Wang commented positively on

the development of our public transport industry.  Nevertheless,

they  asked  that we continue to improve and shorten the  travel

time.  Let me say that, in fact, there are a few things that  we

are  doing  to improve public transport.  Firstly, the  Minister

has mentioned about the public transport industry restructuring,

which  we  have  started.  That will bring in more  competition.

Secondly,  the Minister has also announced that LTA is embarking

on  a  comprehensive development of rail systems.  If we have  a

comprehensive rail network, it will help to reduce  travel  time

as  we  rely  more on rail and less on bus services  which  have

limitations due to routing and traffic jams. Thirdly, we will do

all  we can in using technology to improve the services for  bus

commuters.  One good example suggested by Mr Rai is to have  the

bus  schedule  and  bus arrival times to be  made  available  to

commuters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>

For his information, LTA is currently developing a system called

the Travel Information System (TIS).  LTA will work with the bus

operators  and  use  satellites, GPS,  and  so  on  to  estimate

accurately  bus  arrival times at every  bus  stop  and  we  can

display  them at bus stops and over the Internet as  well.   All

these will work towards improving the bus services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also answer the question by Dr Wang Kai Yuen about

whether PTC can be more responsive to the needs of residents for

bus  services in new towns.  Let me inform him that  before  the

people move into a new town, the bus operators, LTA, HDB and JTC

will  come together and draw up a conceptual plan for the  town.

These  plans  will  have  to be approved  by  PTC  and,  in  the

beginning,  the services will be such that it will  cater  to  a

smaller  population in the town.  But as the town  develops  and

more  and more people move into the town, the bus operators  and

PTC  will  monitor the transport needs very closely and  upgrade

the  bus  services accordingly. That is why as  the  Member  has

pointed  out that on 7th March, a new bus service was introduced

in  the  Toh  Guan Estate.  That was because of this  procedure.

But  I  would  ask  PTC to see whether we  can  improve  on  the

responsiveness and whether we can provide bus services  earlier.

Undoubtedly, in the beginning, because the population is  small,

there  will be some inconveniences and you cannot introduce  bus

services  in very fine increments and so there is this  problem.

Nevertheless,  I  will ask PTC to see whether  we  can  be  more

responsive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh talked about bus service No. 96 from Clementi

Interchange  to NUS and asked whether it could be changed  to  a

feeder bus service and reduce its fare to 30 cents.  Feeder  bus

services  are generally for travel within the town and  this  is

the  definition  that the bus company and  PTC  agreed  to  and,

therefore,  this  service, as Mr Peh has  pointed  out,  is  not

considered  as  a  feeder  service.  We should  not  arbitrarily

convert trunk buses to feeder buses because feeder services  are

generally  not viable and heavily subsidised by other commuters.

If we change that, there are many other short distance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>

services  that can also be changed to feeder service,  and  that

will  have  a  serious  impact  on  the  viability  of  the  bus

companies.  NUS students who use buses frequently could consider

purchasing  concession bus stamps, which offer unlimited  travel

of  SBS and TIBS buses for a monthly fee of $44 to $50, and they

can  travel as much as they want on all the trunk and feeder bus

services.  And to help the commuting public during the  economic

crisis, the transport operators have offered a 5% rebate for all

farecard top-ups and concession bus stamps are also given  a  5%

discount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to answer Mr Rai's point about distance-based

fares.   Yes,  in  fact,  we are moving  towards  distance-based

fares,  but  the bus fare structure is based on two  components.

One is the upfront component and the other is the distance-based

component.  The reason why we need to have an upfront  component

is because whether you travel a long or short distance, there is

a  certain  amount  of overheads bus companies  have  to  incur.

Therefore, it is unreasonable to ask the bus companies to charge

very  small  bus  fares  for a very short distance  because  the

overheads incurred are much more than that.  That is the  reason

why  we  have these two components.  For longer distance travel,

we  have increased the number of fare bands from 5 to 7 and that

is in line with Mr Rai's suggestion of a distance-based concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Communications  (Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):  Sir, on classic  cars,  we

take  note of the request but we will address it in view of  our

greater  emphasis on usage rather than ownership  measures.   On

taxi-driver's refresher course by Mr Seng Han Thong, I will  ask

LTA to study how we can incorporate some of his suggestions.  On

the question by Mr Chiam, it was a suggestion by Malaysia but we

have  not received any formal proposal.  Hence there is  nothing

on the table yet for us to discuss.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me thank the Minister for the amendments to

the   Environmental  Public  Health  Act  relating  to   heavier

penalties  for  illegal dumping.  The Bill  is  due  for  second

reading  later this week and I am very sure that we will welcome

the enactment of heavier penalties for illegal dumping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal dumping is not only against the law but also a

crime  against  the  community  and  environment.   Such  crimes

against the environment sometimes may have long-lasting effects,

especially when the wastes illegally dumped contain toxic matter

and/or  heavy  matter.  As a community, we must  never  tolerate

illegal  dumping.   We should not take this  as  a  small  petty

offence.  However, for the law to be effective, the perpetrators

of  these  illegal  acts  must  be caught.   Unfortunately,  the

authorities cannot be in all places at all times to catch  these

offenders.   The authorities need the help of the  community  to

catch these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest that the Ministry of the

Environment  look into some form of empowerment to be  given  to

the  community to assist them catch these offenders.  Right now,

I  do  not  have any concrete ideas of what type of  empowerment

would  be  needed.  Certainly, I do not propose  empowering  our

average Singaporeans to personally confront these offenders.  It

will  be  just too risky to do so.  All I am suggesting at  this

point  is  for  the concept to be studied and accepted,  and  if

needed, I will be most

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>

pleased to help contribute concrete ideas on the form that  such

empowerment should take.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, illegal

dumping  of  construction  and other waste  materials  has  been

repeatedly  reported  in  the local newspapers  recently.   This

takes  place  in vacant lands near residential housing  estates,

lorry  parks or any places where illegal dumping could  be  done

without being caught.  I observe that there are mainly two types

of  dumping behaviour. One is the small-timer who just wants  to

save  some  money by not disposing their waste at  the  official

dumping  ground and indiscriminately disposing their  wastes  as

and  when  it  is  available.  Usually, the truck  drivers  just

unload  the  wastes and they carry it to any vacant  land  where

they could be undetected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type, I think, is more important and deserves

some  attention.  There are illegal dumpings which  are  planned

and  well-organised.  They could be operating as  illegal  waste

collectors  and  landfill  operators for  significant  financial

gains.  One example where this could happen is when a company or

individual tenders for a piece of land which is of low lying and

can  be used for agricultural purposes, and the operator can use

the  premises  as an illegal landfill and for the collection  of

construction wastes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is that a company can disguise itself as

a town council or private estate conservancy contractor and make

use  of  the rubbish bin centres and facilities provided by  the

Ministry of the Environment for illegal disposal of their wastes

collected   either   from  a  commercial  or  industrial   waste

collection service.  In other words, the company is making money

from  the collection of wastes from other places and the  people

living  in  housing estates and the Ministry of the  Environment

are made to bear the cost of the final disposal of the wastes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irresponsible waste disposal will cost much more money for

the people who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>

subsequently have to put in the effort to clear the mess created

by such illegal dumping.  In the illegal landfill situation, the

problem resulting from illegal landfill could cause pollution to

our  water  resources. As the Chairman of the GPC has mentioned,

sometimes, illegal dumpings of wastes contain traces of toxic or

hazardous  material  and it could cause our environment  greater

and, long-term damage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how many such illegal

dumpings  have been detected in the past one year.  For  illegal

landfill activities, like the one I have described  where it  is

carried  out in certain low-lying areas which could be used  for

agricultural purposes, what would the Ministry do in controlling

such  unauthorised landfill activities?  Under the current  law,

in  what ways could such an environmental culprit be effectively

dealt with?

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Several countries in the region had

been  hit  by  very  unusual food-related diseases.   A  notable

example in the past few years were:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in 1996, an outbreak of food poisoning in Japan caused

by  E-coli resulted in about 9,000 cases and 12 deaths.   School

children  were also implicated and schools had to be closed  and

disinfected to contain the outbreak;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) in 1997, Hong Kong had the chicken flu. 18 persons

were  infected  and  6  of them died.  To  break  the  chain  of

transmission, the authorities had to destroy about  1.5  million

chicks;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) in 1998, the fish farming industry in Hong Kong was

hit by the algae bloom known as red tide.  About 1,500 tonnes of

toxic farm fish had to be destroyed;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) currently, Malaysian pigs have been hit by a virus

outbreak  known  as Japanese encephalitis.  At least,  34  human

deaths have been attributed to infection by this virus since the

outbreak last October;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) only yesterday, I read a newspaper report about the use

of growth stimulants

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>

in  pigs  in Malaysia.  According to the report, the residue  of

stimulants  used could damage the health of consumers.   Perhaps

it  is worth reading a part from the report.  I quote, "We  want

to  tell  the  world our experience with pigs, fed  with  growth

stimulants.   We  can distinguish pigs fed with  such  chemicals

from the deformed reproductive organs of the female pigs. We can

imagine  the  harm  it  could  do to  humans  who  consume  pork

contaminated with growth stimulants."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, sometime ago, there was a spectre of the mad-cow

disease  in  the United Kingdom.  The funny thing is that  these

viruses affecting cows and chickens were not supposed to  affect

humans. But, somehow, some form, perhaps mutated because of  the

drugs  and chemicals given to the animals, had managed  to  jump

the  inter-specie  gap.   It  is enough  to  make  a  person  go

vegetarian.  But even so, it may not be of much help seeing  the

E-coli  outbreak  was  partly caused by contamination  in  white

radish  sprouts,  a  vegetable.   Also,  what  new  diseases  or

outbreaks the introduction of laboratory altered genes into  our

food would generate is beyond anybody's guess at this stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions to the Minister are these: What is the

Government's  policy  on these issues?  If  outbreaks  occur  in

Singapore,  are  we  truly prepared for  them?   Should  we  not

legislate  for the labelling of genetically altered food?   With

labelling, at least the consumers have a choice.  To  take  this

point   further,  should  we  even  stop  the  import  of   such

genetically  altered food?  Would the Ministry  promote  an  on-going programme to educate the public on these matters?

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I endorse the

Ministry's  measures  to  assess the hygiene  standard  of  food

stalls.  But many hawkers are unhappy with the grading criteria.

I  think  the  Ministry of the  Environment  should  review  the

criteria  so  that  we can reach a standard acceptable  by  both

hawkers and the consumers, as well as the Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I observe that not many stalls are graded A or

B.   Under  the   present grading system, not only  the  hygiene

aspect  is considered, but the  display of food, attire  of  the

hawkers,  general  cleanliness of the stall,  layout  and  other

factors  are  also taken into consideration.  If we compare  the

hawker   stalls  with  fast  food  outlets,  restaurants,   air-conditioned  food courts, we find that it is unfair  and  biased

against   the   poor  hawkers.   Because  of  their   favourable

conditions,  the operators  of fast-food outlets and  food-court

stalls are in a better position to secure A or B grades from the

authority.   But to the neighbourhood hawker stalls, to get A or

B  grades   is not so easy.  It is unfair.  Unlike the fast-food

chain  or  restaurants, these hawker stalls   do  not  have  the

financial  backing,  neither  do  they  have  the  advantage  of

advanced technology  to help them with their chores.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the hawkers have to do everything by themselves,

from  dawn  to dusk.  They are the bosses as well as the  cooks.

They  have to serve the customers as well as to wash the  dishes

and clean the stall.  So if you want the ordinary hawkers to  do

everything to qualify for a A grade, it is almost impossible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell Members about the Whampoa Hawker Centre, a

hawker centre in my Constituency, which is generally regarded as

one  of  the  best in Singapore. During  my visit to the  hawker

centre, I found a lot of people queuing up in front of a certain

stall  which  was  graded C.  The stall has  attracted  a  great

number  of  patrons.  It enjoys the best business in  the  whole

hawker  centre.   I discussed this phenomenon with my grassroots

leaders and they told me that business is so good for this stall

that  the stallholder simply cannot find time to keep his  stall

in  the conditions favoured by the Environment officials.  There

is  no  way he is going to earn himself a A or B grade.  On  the

other  hand,  those stalls where business is not  so  good,  the

stallholders  have a lot of time to clean up and dress up  their

stalls to the delight of the officials, and they get their Grade

A certificates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grassroots leaders told me that this is an irony. When

the customers come to the hawker centre, they look at the stalls

which  are graded C.  Their business is so good that   there  is

always  a long queue.  The logical conclusion is  that the  food

at these stalls  must be good.  But when you look at the A-grade

stalls,  there  is  no queue and, therefore, the  food  must  be

lousy.  Do  not  buy  from them.  Do not patronise  them.   This

defeats the whole purpose of the grading exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even puzzling to note that the stall at Block 90, #01-171, which was recently adjudged by the Town Council as the

cleanest  hawker  stall in Whampoa Drive Food Centre,  has  been

given  only  a  C  grade  by the Ministry  of  the  Environment.

Frankly, I do not know how the Ministry officials derive at  the

A, B or C grading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also visited the hawker centres in Queenstown, Bukit

Ho  Swee  and  some  other places.  I observe that  some  hawker

stalls  which  are  very dirty are awarded B grade,  while  some

stalls  which are cleaner get only the C grade.  I do  not  know

how the standard is fixed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of the Environment can look into this

question  and see whether we can do away with the  A,  B  and  C

grades.   Since A, B and C are  all "pass" grades, a P grade  is

good  enough.   For those who do not make the pass  grade,  just

give  them a "F" for failure.   The customers would know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Ministry of the Environment can look into

the matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, last year, we were spared the

haze  of previous years, not because the problems at source were

resolved  but because of two factors.  The first was the  effect

of  La  Nina, which accounted for a very wet period during  what

otherwise would be a dry season.  The other was that large-scale

burning  of  forested  land by plantation owners  did  not  take

place, not because they realise that it was criminal to burn the

forest, but because they were not investing in new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>

planting areas.  We certainly cannot depend on these two factors

for the prevention of future occurrences of the haze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister could tell the House what steps have

been  taken  to prevent future occurrences.  Are the Indonesians

cooperating  on  this  issue?  Have we  been  able  to  rope  in

international agencies and non-Government organisations to  help

Indonesia, Malaysia and ourselves to tackle this problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, like Mr Heng, I

am speaking about the haze.  It is clearly a problem that is not

within  Singapore's  exclusive control.  This  demonstrates  the

interdependence of the environment.  This also becomes a  larger

problem because our neighbour, Indonesia, is implicated in this.

The  problem  has gone for now.  The skies are  blue.   But  the

roots of the problem remain.  And as indicated by the return  of

the  fires at the end of November/December, the problem at  root

is  still  there.  This  problem at root is  the  incapacity  or

unwillingness  to enforce laws made by Indonesia  in  Indonesia.

It  is  tied  not  just  to  the air  but  to  forestry  and  to

agriculture, and to the profit motive that those who  clear  the

land  for  forestry or agriculture save money by using fire  and

this,  of  course,  is  tied  up  to  the  problem  of  KKN    - corruption,  cronyism  and nepotism in Indonesia.   And  it  may

indeed worsen given the lack of controls in Indonesia today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to advise the House on how we are

working with the Indonesian authorities to-date, and how we  are

engaging  the  Indonesian government to give attention  to  this

problem; even today, given the other challenges Indonesia faces.

I  would ask the Minister particularly to consider that we  need

to  work with whatever and whoever rises in Indonesia after  the

coming elections.  Whoever they may be, we should work with them

as  long  as  they are genuine in the desire for change  and  to

tackle the challenge of the haze.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I think that we should do more to hold

responsible  those  who  are indeed  guilty  and  relentless  in

flouting  the  Indonesian  laws.   More  specifically,  I  would

suggest  to  the  Minister that in the coming  year,  we  should

continue  to  work to strengthen ASEAN as well as to  work  with

international  agencies.  By these, I do not  mean  just  United

Nations  Environment Programme we have worked with  before,  but

also  the  World Bank and the IMF to tie together the change  in

the  economics  of  Indonesia together with the  environment  to

genuinely search for sustainable development.  Otherwise, Sir, I

think  we  will  see the return of the fires with  the  economic

changes and the environmental changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the disaster is not just for Singaporeans or

Malaysians affected by the haze.  This has been disaster for the

Indonesian  themselves.  It is moreover not a natural  disaster,

but a man-made one.  Disasters can spur action to prevent future

recurrence.  Or when the skies are clear, we and our  neighbours

may  forget.  I therefore ask the Minister to look to  the  long

term and to continue and indeed strengthen and widen our efforts

in this regard.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I am speaking on the topic

of diesel vehicle pollution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the diesel technology has advanced, and all well-maintained diesel vehicles should not emit any visible diesel

smoke  from the exhaust.  Every now and then, when we travel  on

our  roads, smoky exhausts from lorries could be easily spotted.

If one is a bit more observant, he should be able to spot one or

two  of such cases on every trip when he goes to work.  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister whether we have relaxed the  vehicle

emission  standard for diesel smoke in this period  of  economic

downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, the oil companies announced an increase in the

diesel price.  The reason given was that the sulphur content  in

the  diesel had been further reduced.  I would like to  ask  the

Minister  what  is  the  impact  on  the  improvement   in   the

environment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>

when  the  sulphur content in the diesel fuel is reduced.   Does

the  increase  in the diesel price add any burden to  the  fleet

operators during this economic downturn?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many diesel engine technologies aimed at the

post-treatment   of  the  diesel  engine  exhausts   to   reduce

pollution.  This includes the diesel particulate traps  and  the

diesel catalytic converter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petrol car owner has been asked to compulsorily install

the  3-way  catalytic converter and also use unleaded petrol  in

lowering  exhaust pollutants.  However, diesel  cars  and  truck

owners  are  quite  favourably  treated  by  the  Ministry   for

continuing to emit the much higher level of pollutants into  our

environment.   In  view of the available technology,  would  the

Government  consider  a stricter emission  standard  for  diesel

vehicles,  like  the implementation of the compulsory  catalytic

converter  and diesel particulate trap for all newly  registered

diesel vehicles in the future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, my

views on the detection of black smoke from vehicles is different

from  my  other colleagues.  First, I would like to  declare  my

interest  as  the Executive Secretary of the National  Transport

Workers' Union and Adviser to three taxi operator associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring to the notice of the House the

unhappiness  of many drivers of diesel vehicles with  regard  to

the penalties for emission of black smoke.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, vehicles which emitted black smoke with

Hartridge Smoke Unit (HSU) reading of 84 and below, the fine was

$150  each for the driver and the owner.  Since 1st August 1998,

the  Ministry  of  the Environment has revised the  penalty  for

black  smoke  emission.  The current penalty for offenders  with

HSU reading of 84 and below is $150 for the driver and the owner

in the case of a first offender.  For repeat offender within two

years,  the  driver and owner have to face fines of  $500  each.

For HSU reading of 85 and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>

above, the fine for a first offender is $300 each for the driver

and owner, and $500 each for a repeat offender within two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big amount to the taxi drivers. They feel that

such  a penalty is too stiff.  They have remarked that the fines

for speeding and other traffic offences which may result in loss

of  lives are not as severe as the penalty for emission of black

smoke.  Why is the penalty for such an offence more severe  than

the other life-threatening traffic offences?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, they feel that poisonous gases such as

nitrogen  oxide,  hydrocarbon  and  carbon  monoxide  which  are

emitted  by  petrol-driven vehicles are more  harmful  than  the

black  smoke.   These toxic gases are not visible to  the  naked

eye,  and that makes detection difficult.  Even at the statutory

roadworthiness  inspection  for  vehicles,  these  defects   are

classified  only  as minor faults that require no  rectification

and no fine will be imposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister enlighten the House on what are the

practices of other more advanced countries such as Japan, Europe

and the USA with regard to the enforcement of the rules on black

smoke emission?  What are the rationale, standards and practices

adopted  in imposing the penalty fines?  How many countries  are

using the Hartridge smoke meters?

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, the Chicago Convention on

International Civil Aviation has established April 2002  as  the

deadline  for the world-wide withdrawal of larger,  older  civil

aircraft for use by operators.  The main reason for this move is

noise.   The larger older aircraft are much too noisy.  However,

the  United  States has set its own deadline  at  31st  December

1999, that is,  end of this year.  As most of these larger older

aircraft are currently used in the US, there is fear that  these

aircraft  may be sold for use outside the US after  the  end  of

this year, ie, after the US

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>

deadline  but before the Convention-set deadline of April  2002.

Sir,  the  fear is so real that the European Union has acted  to

prevent  the transfer of these aircraft from the US to  the  EU.

Although this appears to be a Ministry of Communications' issue,

the  real  issue here is noise.  I am concerned with  the  noise

pollution which would be generated should these aircraft come to

Singapore.   Since noise pollution comes within the  purview  of

the  Ministry  of  the  Environment, I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the noise pollution standards set by the Ministry of

the  Environment stringent enough to prevent these aircraft from

using Changi International Airport?  If not, should we not  take

preventive measures to stop these aircraft from coming here?  My

question  must  be  taken within the context of  the  following:

There  are  many of these aircraft.  If they are not allowed  or

not permitted for operations in the huge first world markets  of

the  US and Europe, then there is a strong likelihood that  they

would be used in the third world market, including Singapore.  I

think we should take some preventive measures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Shriniwas Rai, can you take your two cuts

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, Mr Heng Chiang Meng earlier spoke of

illegal  dumping.   I am coming to the problem  of  keeping  our

rivers clean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of the Environment has spent millions of

dollars and it has done a good job in keeping our rivers  clean.

We  no  longer have the foul smell we used to get.  But what  is

happening  now?   We can see discarded furniture and  everything

one  can think of being thrown into the river.  I live near  the

Whampoa  River  where  I  go for a walk  almost  every  morning.

Sometimes,  the  river is clean and sometimes it  is  dirty.   I

think public education plus penal provision would be good.   May

I  suggest  to  the  Minister that a Community  Watch  Group  be

formed?   It  should also consider  appropriate  legislation  to

punish  the  culprits.  In contrast to the  Whampoa  River,  the

Singapore River is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>

cleaner.   I  do  not know why but the Minister  could  probably

explain to this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important for us because I hope to urge the

Minister to allow boating in the river.  But as it is now, I  do

not think it would be feasible.  Can we one day, like many other

cities in the world, have boats in our river?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I move to littering. Despite many years of effort,

littering still exists and it is a social disgrace to see people

throwing papers and bus tickets.  Last year, the Senior Minister

of State explained to this House the efforts of his Ministry.  I

am  glad that the Ministry takes this seriously.  Here again,  I

have a novel suggestion which the Minister may want to consider.

Authorise some of our national servicemen, especially  those who

have  served  in the Police Force, to book these people  because

only  when it hurts their pockets will Singaporeans learn  their

lessons.  No amount of campaigns, Sir, after so many years since

SM Lee Kuan Yew started the campaign will help. I am saddened to

say that we have progressed but we are retarded because of these

social culprits.  May I ask the Minister to use his power to see

that this social evil is eradicated once and for all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Although I have been bringing up this

issue of tax incentives for pollution prevention and control and

for  environmental protection for several years already, I  want

to do so again this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is well aware of this issue and the arguments

for  it.  I just want to remind him that he is not doing  enough

to  encourage the move towards greater environmental protection.

Compared  to  the  tax  and  other  financial  incentives  given

annually  to promote the financial centre, the Green  Sector  is

not  even  getting peanuts.  Yet, environmental issues  are  the

most  pressing  issues facing mankind today.   By  actively  and

aggressively  promoting  the growth of  the  green  industry  in

Singapore,  we  can  achieve two desirable goals.   One  is  the

growth of the industry and its related clusters to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>

serve  the  region and, of course, to serve Singapore.   We  can

become  the green hub of the region.  It will add another  layer

to our industrial base, thereby adding diversity to our economy.

Given the worldwide trend towards environmental protection,  the

economic and business benefits to Singapore would not be small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other goal is the encouragement of our companies to

invest  in  environmentally friendly machinery and processes  in

their operations.  This can only result in a cleaner and greener

environment for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely these are desirable goals to strive for. However,

there  is  a  need to have a champion, just like  that  for  the

financial  centre.  I truly hope that the Minister will  be  the

green champion.

to  award  the tender to private refuse collectors  in  Tampines

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private refuse collector has already been in operation

for  a few months now. I would like to know whether the job  has

been  carried  out to the satisfaction of the  Ministry  of  the

to  avoid  manipulation  by  the private  companies?   Will  the

Ministry  consider allowing more private companies to take  part

in future tender exercises?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister tell us whether privatisation of refuse

collection  would  result in a cleaner environment  in  our  HDB

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b>

First, I would like to thank all the Members who have spoken for

their views and suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the first two speakers' points on illegal

dumping.   I totally agree with Mr Heng that illegal dumping  is

something  which is totally irresponsible and which is something

that  we should do our best to stamp out.  It is not just costly

to  remove  the illegally dumped materials but in  the  process,

quite  often, the culprits end up damaging the environment quite

badly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this problem, we really need to address two

challenges,  both  of which Mr Heng has also  touched  on.   The

first  is  catching the culprits red handed.  This, as  Mr  Heng

pointed  out,  is difficult because they tend to  work  late  at

night  and  usually  in deserted areas.  Mr Heng  has  suggested

empowering the community to help us solve this problem.   It  is

definitely  an attractive suggestion.  I would get my  staff  to

work with him because the more eyes and ears we have within  the

community,  the  easier would it be for us to catch  them.   Not

only that, knowing that there are more people on the lookout for

them, the culprits would be also more deterred from engaging  in

such activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second challenge that we have to cope with is how to

make  sure that the gains are dwarfed by the penalties.  At  the

present  moment, the penalties are actually quite  low  because,

for  the  first  offence, the maximium  fine  is  only  $10,000.

Typically,  the courts have been imposing fines of about  $1,000

to  $7,000, which means that the penalty is actually  very  much

dwarfed by the potential gain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already tabled the Bill for amending the relevant

Act.   Once  the  Bill is passed, the penalties  for  the  first

offence  would be increased from the current $10,000 to  $50,000

plus  the  possibility of imprisonment of up to 12 months.   For

those who are caught for the second and subsequent offences, the

fines  would  be  increased from a maximum of $20,000  today  to

$100,000  plus  a mandatory jail sentence.  The  mandatory  jail

sentence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>

would  be  not less than one month and not more than 12  months.

The  law  would also be amended to allow us to more  effectively

seize  the  vehicles  that are being used.   With  the  enhanced

penalties  and  with the more effective feedback  mechanism,  we

should be able to better contain this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has also asked about illegal dumping

activities  and  he  asked how many cases  of  illegally  dumped

materials  on  agricultural sites were  caught  last  year.   We

mounted  ambushes  at  several sites last  year  and  caught  21

offenders.  They were fined between $900 and $8,000 each and two

vehicles were seized.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what are the other penalties, the Land Office will

normally  repossess the site.  There were seven cases last  year

that  were  repossessed.  It is not only that.  The Land  Office

will also forfeit the three months' rental deposit as a penalty.

The  culprits will also be asked to reinstate the land.  So with

the  enhanced  penalties under the new Bill, plus  more  regular

inspections, we should be able to contain this problem as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me move on to the issue of haze. Mr Heng Chiang

Meng  and  Mr  Simon Tay have spoken on this.  As  Mr  Heng  has

rightly  pointed  out, the La Nina phenomenon  has  given  us  a

slight  reprieve  because with the wetter than  normal  weather,

which  is  expected to last until mid year, we should be  fairly

free from regional haze.  The normal weather pattern is expected

to  return  in  the  second half of this  year  and  this  would

coincide  with the dry weather as well.  With the onset  of  dry

weather, we can expect to see burning activity starting again in

Indonesia and therefore we should be prepared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we been doing to get ourselves ready for this?

The  key  activities  have been taking  place  in  the  regional

setting.  We  have finalised the regional haze action  plan  and

Indonesia's  role  is  to  establish  a  proper  fire   fighting

procedure  as  well  as  to ensure that  there  are  appropriate

enforcement procedures against the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>

illegal  burning.  Because of the economic crisis, we fear  that

there  is a lack of political will in the  Government to  ensure

that  these  two roles are being catered for.  For  example,  in

working  with the Indonesians, what we have found is that  there

is  really  no clear organisational structure in terms  of  both

enforcement and fire fighting.  So when a fire breaks out, there

is  confusion as to which body is responsible for first spotting

the  fire  and,  secondly,  taking action  to  fight  the  fire.

Thirdly,  who will now step in to investigate, find the  culprit

and  charge them in court?  There is no proper structure.  Also,

in  our dealings with the Indonesians, we realise that there are

actually  many people who are quite concerned about this.   They

are in charge of departments and they want to do something.  But

unfortunately, because of the economic crisis, they are short of

funds  and  therefore they are unable to purchase the  necessary

equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been working with the ASEAN members on this issue.

We  will  continue to urge Indonesia to strengthen their efforts

against  illegal burning and to urge them to set up  the  proper

organisational structure.  We have also proceeded to  help  them

purchase some of the equipment.   For example, we have over  the

last year supplied them with communications equipment which will

enable  them to spot where the fires are burning and  relay  the

information   down  to  the  ground.   All  the   communications

equipment  are now in place.  We now have to see how do  we  get

them  to  make  good use of this equipment. This  is  where  the

political will comes in.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the funding, we have been working with various

international agencies, like UNEP.  And I understand  that  UNEP

will  be working with other UN and international bodies as  well

on  the  funding, and to work with the donor countries to assist

Indonesia  to  enhance  its ability and capacity.   So  we  will

continue to work through all the various organisations and  with

our  neighbouring  countries  to ensure  that  there  is  enough

pressure being exerted on Indonesia to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>

take  this  problem seriously, because this is a  problem  which

affects not just us but, more importantly, it affects themselves

to a much greater degree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On diesel emissions, it is interesting to see the two

opposing  views.   One is from Prof. Low Seow  Chay  who  firmly

believes  that  we should take firm action to ensure  that  this

pollution  problem is being tackled effectively.  And the  other

view  from Mr Ong Ah Heng who asks us not to be too harsh.   Let

me start with the points raised by Mr Ong Ah Heng first, because

I think it is important for us to understand why this problem is

an important one that needs to be tackled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, diesel smoke contains very fine particulates

of less than 2.5 microns, or what we call PM2.5.  The studies in

the  US  and  elsewhere  have linked PM2.5  to  an  increase  in

respiratory diseases and mortality.  So contrary to what Mr  Ong

believes,  PM2.5 diesel particulates are actually  dangerous  to

health.   Therefore,  it is prudent for us to  keep  the  diesel

smoke  to  as  low a level as possible in order to  protect  the

health  of our people.  This problem is not a difficult  one  to

overcome  because  this diesel smoke can  be  minimised  if  the

engines are properly maintained.  And therefore we have  put  in

place  penalties  to  act  as deterrence  against  irresponsible

behaviour by owners and drivers of diesel-driven vehicles.  Yes,

the  penalties may be harsh, but the penalties can  be  avoided,

and I think that is a key point.  The taxi drivers and the lorry

drivers can avoid paying these penalties by ensuring that  their

vehicles are maintained regularly and properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong also mentioned about the penalties being

enhanced.  Actually the enhanced penalties are still lower  than

what  the courts were imposing, because the courts were imposing

penalties  from $600 to over $1,000.  Whereas now by compounding

the  offences, the offenders do not have to appear in court,  so

actually  we  are  saving them time.  Secondly,  the  compounded

penalty  is only $500.  In actual fact, the penalties have  been

reduced rather than increased.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked why petrol-driven vehicles are not

required  to  go for a re-test, if they fail the emission  test.

Contrary  to  what he believes, the carbon monoxide  test  is  a

mandatory  one.  And if petrol-driven vehicles fail  the  carbon

monoxide test, it is mandatory for them to go for a re-test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked what is the practice of the advanced

countries.  The advanced countries, in fact, have more stringent

emission  standards than ours.  And because their standards  are

more  stringent, the likelihood of the vehicles  emitting  black

smoke  is also reduced.  Also, I understand that they have  very

strict controls on maintenance of the vehicles.  As to how  many

countries use the Hartridge smoke meters to measure the  density

of  smoke  emission, I am happy to let him  know  that  all  the

developed  countries use the same Hartridge  meters  as  we  are

using.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has asked whether we have relaxed the

vehicle emission standards because of the economic slowdown.   I

would  like  to assure him that we have not.  In fact,  we  have

recently moved to reduce the allowable sulphur content in diesel

from  0.3% previously to 0.05% since 1st March this year.   This

lower  sulphur  content  would reduce the  emission  of  sulphur

dioxide,  which  is  another  very  undesirable  pollutant.   It

reduces  SO2  by  80%,  and the particulate  emission  from  the

engines by 50%.  So this reduction of sulphur has got benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked about the impact of the price increase. In

fact,  owners  of  diesel-driven vehicles  are  having  a  price

reduction.  Because even though the price of diesel has gone  up

by  2  cents,  we have removed the tax on diesel.  So  net,  the

owners still have a saving on the price of diesel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Government considering stricter emission standards?

Yes,  with  the introduction of the 0.05% sulphur in diesel,  we

are now able to consider stricter

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>

emission  standards.  These standards have,  in  fact,  been  in

place in Europe since 1996.  As Prof. Low has mentioned, the new

vehicles,  in order to meet these standards, would  need  to  be

fitted with a catalytic converter and a particulate trap.  As to

when  we are going to introduce the new standards, we are  still

studying them, and we will be announcing the decision shortly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked about the noise pollution from

aircraft.   He  asked whether the noise pollution standards  are

stringent  enough for us to prevent these aircraft  from  flying

here.   I  would like to assure him that the likelihood  of  the

older  aircraft being diverted to Singapore is very,  very  low,

because  today  more  than 90% of the aircraft  using  Singapore

Airport are the newer aircraft classified under Chapter 3 of the

Convention.   This  is because most of the airlines  that  serve

Singapore Airport are the major airlines, and these are the ones

that  are in the process of continually upgrading their aircraft

and  using  newer aircraft.  So despite the move by  the  US  to

phase out the older aircraft by end of this year, the likelihood

of these aircraft being moved here is very, very low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai has talked about littering and clean

rivers.  Sir, I will take both of them together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I totally agree with him. I share his concerns about

the littering that is taking place in Singapore, despite several

decades  of Keep Singapore Clean Campaign.  We have done surveys

amongst the teenagers. And what we find is that the awareness of

the  need to keep Singapore clean and the need to not litter  is

very  wide.   That  means all teenagers know about  it,  because

through  the schools and public campaigns, they have  been  made

aware.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the data on litterbugs, what surprises us

is  that  two-thirds of the litterbugs are aged below  30  years

old,  ie,  these are the ones who have gone through  the  school

education and the public education programme.  So it is not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>

lack   of   awareness.   I  think  it  is  a  lack   of   social

responsibility.  The fortunate part is that litterbugs are still

the minority.  The majority of Singaporeans are very proud about

the  clean  environment and they do take efforts not to  litter.

The  question  is how do we deal with the negative  attitude  of

this  small group of dirty Singaporeans.  Our approach,  as  has

been  mentioned  by Mr Rai, is education.  I think  we  have  to

reach  out  not just to educate Singaporeans but to create  peer

pressure on those who are inclined to litter.  And what  we  are

looking now is how do we involve the community in a much greater

way.  For example, the Keep Singapore Clean Campaign, which  has

been  driven by my Ministry primarily, I have asked my officials

to  make  that  into a civic movement, and to let the  community

leaders drive this campaign from now on, rather than to  let  it

continue as being a Government campaign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken steps to enhance the penalties, which I

think  is  important.  We need both the carrot  and  the  stick.

Currently,  the  offenders are only given  the  Corrective  Work

Order.   Under the revised penalties, the recalcitrant would  be

liable to both the CWO and a fine.  And the maximum duration for

the  CWO would be increased from three hours to a maximum of  12

hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about the dumping of bulky items like furniture.

We  are  also increasing penalties for illegal dumping of  bulky

items like furniture on the roadsides and void decks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his unhappiness about the Whampoa River being dirtied, I

also  share his concerns.  We have spent 20-over years to  clean

up the rivers.  Today, one can actually swim in the rivers.  And

yet  people still do litter.  How big is the problem?  To ensure

that  the litter does not get into our water resources,  because

40%  of Singapore is a catchment area, and the drains and canals

in  this  part of Singapore drain into our reservoirs,  we  have

placed float booms and gratings to collect the litter.  I  think

it  will surprise Members to know that each day, we collect over

40  tonnes  of litter from the canals and the rivers, enough  to

fill 10 truck loads.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I would like to join Mr Shriniwas Rai in urging

Singaporeans to exert peer pressure, because we cannot be around

everywhere  all  the time to spot the litterbugs.   Singaporeans

can.  Let us all join together in this exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tax incentives - this is a perennial subject. I am

glad we have a champion in Mr Heng Chiang Meng on tax incentives

to  promote the environmental protection industry.  I would like

to assure him that all the incentives that are available for the

manufacturing  sector  and  the  service  industries  are   also

available   to   the   environmental  protection   industry   or

environmental  technology industry.  Indeed, EDB  also  keeps  a

look-out  for potential companies to bring to Singapore.   I  do

not  have the data here, but I was given a briefing recently and

was  told  that, in fact, the number of large companies  in  the

environmental  technology  field  that  are  now  operating   in

Singapore  has been steadily increasing.  So we are seeing  more

companies  moving to Singapore to serve not just  Singapore  but

also  the  region.  And I think in the process,  our  own  local

companies will also benefit from the technology transfer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also encouraging companies to invest in pollution

control  equipment.   For example, we have  now  introduced  the

accelerated  depreciation  allowance scheme  to  companies  that

purchase  such equipment.  This year, the Finance  Ministry  has

supported  my  Ministry's  proposal to extend  this  accelerated

depreciation  allowance  to  the  purchase  of  new   commercial

vehicles  that  are being used to replace the old  diesel-driven

vehicles.  So we will continue to look for more ways to help the

industry  and we will continue to work with the key  players  in

the industry on how ENV can assist them further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to ask my Senior Minister of State to

answer the other questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek bin Saniff):  Sir, first, let me thank Mr Heng Chiang

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>

Meng  for his valuable observation regarding food safety or food

hygiene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent incidence cited by the MP has highlighted

how  inadequate control on food safety can give rise to  serious

problems  even  in developed countries with good  public  health

services.  While Singaporeans today enjoy a food supply that  is

among  the  safest  in the world, we are constantly  facing  new

threats  of  massive  outbreaks  of  food-borne  diseases.   Our

emphasis  in  Singapore  is  on vigilance,  control  and  public

education  that  range from checking the  source  of  food  from

overseas  suppliers  to the education and enforcement  of  local

food  manufacturers and food handlers in our food centres.  This

is backed by a system of infectious disease notification so that

we  can  act  swiftly to contain any outbreak should  it  occur.

Firstly,  my  Ministry closely monitors the food  situation  and

emerging  food-related  diseases in the  region  and  worldwide.

Officers  in my Ministry also keep in close contact  with  their

counterparts in the region.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the PPD is also very stringent in its control on

the  import of meat, fish, vegetable and other primary products.

Only  produce  from approved sources is allowed  to  enter  into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, my Ministry and the PPD has a structured system

for  surveillance  and regular inspection of food  manufacturers

and  retailers to ensure that food is prepared under  clean  and

hygienic conditions.  Through public education, training courses

for  food  handlers,  food  factory programmes  and  enforcement

action, a high standard of food hygiene is maintained.   We  are

vigilant on high risk food and we would not hesitate to  act  if

there is an unacceptable risk to our public health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, in spite of all that we can do, on the

preventive  side, we must make preparations should  an  outbreak

occur.   ENV has therefore established an inter-agency  response

procedure involving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>

MOH and PPD to handle food-related incidents.  This will enhance

our   level  of  preparedness,  as  a  nation,  to  handle   any

contingency.   Because  of  our high standard  of  environmental

sanitation   and  food  hygiene,  our  risks   are   low.    Our

environmental  health  surveillance  capabilities  have   gained

formal   international  recognition  when   the   World   Health

Organisation  designated the Ministry's Epidemiology  Department

as a regional coordinating centre in 1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Peh Chin Hua is a very hardworking MP. I must say

that  the criteria used in the assessment are strictly based  on

hygiene-related   matters   such   as   (1)   housekeeping   and

cleanliness,  for  example, whether the  storage  cupboards  are

clean and not infested with cockroaches and other vermins;   (2)

food  and personal hygiene, for example, whether raw and  cooked

food  is  properly stored and whether the food handler  observes

personal hygiene and cleanliness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-hygiene related matters are not part of the assessment

criteria.   For  example, we do not assess  how  the  hawker  is

dressed  but  he  must be clean.  If he wears clothes  that  are

filthy  and  dirty, then of course this would not do.   How  the

goods are displayed and how the stall is organised are also  not

factors  that will determine the grade of the outlet so long  as

food  hygiene is not compromised.  Ultimately, we would like  to

see  all  our food vendors committed to a high standard of  food

and  personal hygiene regardless of the type of food and the way

that they are selling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several questions that are asked. I would like to

congratulate  his  colleagues for having their  own  assessment.

But  I  must  say  to  Mr  Peh  that  that  is  more  for  local

competition.   Most probably, everybody knows the time,  and  so

forth.   Whereas as far as ENV is concerned, we assess over  the

whole  year.   If I am not mistaken, Mr Peh also suggested  that

there  should  be  a  category "P"  and  "F".   Sir,  it  was  a

remarkable coincidence that when we embarked on our scheme,  the

County of LA was also having the same grading system.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>

extended  this system to the City of Los Angeles.  Nevertheless,

I will ask my officials to look into Mr Peh's suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There is still another amendment, Mr

Sidek.  Do you need some more time?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> I have one more answer.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Let me assure Mr Ang Mong Seng

that  we  have  eight  waste  collection  companies,  five  from

We  are now looking into the next exercise.  As of now, we  just

have  reached the Tenders Board level.  We will finalise it  and

give him the answer in another 10 days' time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister and his

Senior  Minister  of State for their replies and  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Kenneth Chen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code MC 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, year after year, I have spoken on this subject. But

unfortunately,  the  dengue  fever  cases  are  always  on   the

increase.   Once again, I would be brief.  I wonder  whether  we

should accept this because I have been assured that the Ministry

has  done  its best and this increase is a world phenomenon.   I

would  like to make two points.  One of the more effective  ways

to  reduce the breeding activities is by fogging.  Nowadays, the

Ministry only does it when there is a complaint.  Can I ask  the

Ministry  whether  it  can  have  a  fixed  schedule  to  do  it

regularly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to make is that the increase

in  dengue  cases  reported in Singapore is mainly  in  the  HDB

estates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>

nowadays  and  it  seems that the trend  is  going  upwards.   I

understand  that  the Town Council of Marine Parade  is  working

very  closely  with  the  Environment  Ministry  and  they  have

achieved some success.  Does the Ministry have a plan to involve

all the town councils in Singapore so that they can benefit from

this  close cooperation?  I hope that, next year, I do not  have

to bring up this subject again.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, I will make it short. We

will  most  certainly take up Mr Kenneth Chen's suggestion.   We

will have a more coordinated approach with the town councils  on

dengue  control in the town council estates.  In fact, there  is

already  a standing arrangement where the town council  officers

are  invited  to  join in on inspections or ground  surveillance

carried  out  by  officers in my Ministry.   During  this  joint

inspection,  my  officers will show the  town  council  officers

where  to  look  for  potential breeding  grounds  and,  in  the

process, train them on vector control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will also work with the Contractors'

Association and the professional bodies to get them to pay close

attention to housekeeping in the construction worksites  and  to

consider  features  in  their design that will  not  unwittingly

create potential breeding places.  We will also upgrade the pest

control  industry  so  that  they can  help  us  by  being  more

effective  in  their vector control work.  Most importantly,  we

will continue to get the community behind us to give support and

help us eradicate the Aedes mosquitoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, greater attention is also given to boost research in

vector  control.   We  are  working closely  with  the  tertiary

institutions to better understand the diseases and  vector.   My

Ministry  will also continue to invite world renowned scientists

to review and discuss with our professional staff the strategies

that we are adopting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the long-term success of dengue prevention and control

demands the full support of every one in the community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. "Guillotine" time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the outset, I would like to state that the Ministry

of  Community Development has been given less budget than  other

Ministries.   I  hope  that  the Minister  for  Finance  can  be

persuaded  next year to allocate more budget to the Ministry  so

that  it  could  carry out more programmes in  the  people  care

sector.   This is very important because, in the new millennium,

we  will  be  meeting new challenges related to the dual  career

families, the aging population and the immediate concern is  the

problems  of  the older retrenched workers.  So I hope  that  my

parliamentary colleagues will be able to join me to persuade the

Ministry  of  Finance to allocate more funds to the Ministry  of

Community Development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the two cuts?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, it is time to set up a central body to

mobilise  more volunteer manpower to be involved in  our  social

and welfare service organisations.  Such a central body can help

to  coordinate,  inform and promote volunteerism  in  Singapore,

especially to meet future demands for volunteers and to help run

many  social programmes in the neighbourhood of various  housing

estates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you know, the profiles of our neighbourhood are

changing.    Some  are  ageing  and  there  are   mobility   and

transitions  in  these neighbourhoods.  We need to  examine  and

study them in greater detail to see what we can do to respond to

the new service needs in these areas and the types of programmes

that  we  can  get people to organise and tackle them.   As  you

know,  Sir, your neighbourhood is also ageing as well  as  mine.

It  is very important that we appreciate and understand this  so

that  we  will be able to persuade more people to  join  in  the

volunteer work for the care of the people sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our volunteer participation, at this moment, is only 1:10.

We  should try to increase this participation level to at  least

2:10  in  the next five years.  In many advanced countries,  the

participation rate is about 3:10.  So we have a long way to  go.

A  central body to mobilise people of various social, ethnic and

religious  backgrounds  to volunteer  helps  to  achieve  a  few

objectives.  First, it promotes social integration and  prevents

social  division.   This is very important  in  the  context  of

Singapore.   We are living in a multi-racial society.   We  have

different  social  classes living in different housing  estates,

and  therefore it is very important that we examine  this  issue

very  carefully  and  see  how we can manage  these  challenges.

Failing to do this may have unintended consequences in terms  of

social division, tensions and other related problems that we may

meet.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the establishment of a central body, where

we  can  mobilise  volunteers  to participate,  is  crucial  and

important to us.  At the same time, this central body is able to

involve  people and strengthen the bonds among people living  in

the  various  neighbourhoods.  People bonding  is  critical  and

therefore  we should try, through this central body, to  enhance

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can encourage self-help and community problem-solving.

I see we are always being accused that by providing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>

funding support to the people care sector, we are moving towards

welfarism.  I do not think so.  By encouraging people to play  a

role to organise themselves, to participate in community problem-solving, in fact, helps prevent social problems from arising.  I

feel  prevention  is better than cure and I  hope  that  we  all

believe  in  it,  and  if we believe in  it,  we  should  deploy

resources  to  the very area that we can build participation  of

people to be involved in building a caring community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, by having such a central body, it will reduce

human  barriers  and  human  barriers  can  be  broken  down  by

encouraging more people to volunteer and help one another.   And

this is what we want of Singapore and I hope that we can help to

promote it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many calls by voluntary organisations for the

establishment of such a central body because at the  moment  the

mobilisation  and recruitment of volunteers, and the information

to people about where to volunteer are very much segmented.  The

need  for a central body is very crucial and important in trying

to  get  more  people to be involved in the people care  sector.

When we do this, in the long run, we will be able to promote the

social  help  of our community and we would be able  to  enhance

more effective problem-solving in the various neighbourhoods  of

our housing estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is related to the grants to voluntary

organisations.   Many requests have been made to the  Government

to  review  grants  to  voluntary  welfare  organisations.   The

appeals are loud and clear and I am sure many of you have  heard

this  in  the  course  of your work with the  various  voluntary

bodies  in  your own constituency.  We should send a message  to

the  Ministry  of  Finance to see whether more  funds  could  be

allocated to this aspect of work.  I am afraid that it  has  not

been  heard  for some time and I hope that this time round,  the

Government  will  hear  and accede to the  appeals.   We  cannot

expect  voluntary  organisations to do more  without  additional

financial grants.  To do more they will, if they are persuaded,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>

encouraged, but you cannot do anything without funding and other

related support, both capital and operational costs.  And I feel

this  is  essential if you are going to encourage more voluntary

organisations  to  be formed and to take an active  interest  in

community problem-solving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More time is spent by volunteers and staff on fund-raising

and  by  doing  so  at  the sacrifice of  managing  the  service

delivery of organisations and be able to think ahead on  how  to

respond more effectively.  Although they may be able to know the

new  problems, they are unable to respond as quickly as possible

because  of  the limitation of funds.  At times,  the  efficient

running  of  the organisations is sacrificed at the  expense  of

spending a lot of time on fund-raising, which is necessary.  But

too  much effort spent on fund-raising during a very competitive

period  means  that  there is less time for  people  who  manage

organisations to plan ahead in terms of what needs to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental question that we should ask is: do we want

more  voluntary welfare organisations to be established  and  to

take  on  additional functions?  If it is positive towards  this

question,  then the answer is how do we go about to enable  them

to  take on additional responsibilities?  At this juncture,  the

Ministry of Health wants these organisations to do more with the

new  health  care programmes for the elderly.  The  Ministry  of

Home  Affairs,  on  the  other hand, has started  programmes  of

neighbourhood  policing  and community focus  programmes.   This

would  also require the mobilisation of help from various social

organisations,  and  this  is  also  demanding.   Finally,   the

Ministry  of   Community  Development  is  moving  towards  more

neighbourhood care and programmes.  This will also  require  the

participation   and  efforts  of  many  social   and   voluntary

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that we need to examine this question of

providing  grants to voluntary organisations more seriously.   I

would  like  to  state that it is no fun not to  be  given  more

funds, and yet asked to do more by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>

Government.   I  state that fund raising is trying,  competitive

and  time-consuming  and I hope that the Deputy  Prime  Minister

would  be  able to persuade the Ministry of Finance  to  release

more  funds to the people care sector because we could  be  more

proactive  and  be able to meet the needs of the  families,  the

aging  population  and  the older unskilled  workers  that  were

retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our voluntary organisations to be viable and responsive

to  the emerging needs of the neighbourhood.  I am sure you  all

agree  with me that this is the thrust that we should take.   It

is necessary to revise the funding formula for government grants

because  the  Ministry  of Health has a different  formula.  The

Ministry  of  Community Development gives  a  different  funding

formula  to  the  Community Development Councils  and  it  gives

another  funding formula to the voluntary sector.  There  are  a

number  of  funding  formulas.  But,  none  of  these  help  the

voluntary organisations at this juncture.  We should look at the

revision of the funding formula seriously.  By doing so, we  can

generate  more  enthusiasm  for the voluntary  organisations  to

improve  and extend their services.  I suggest that a 75%  grant

for programme cost would be reasonable and realistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In granting more support to the social and voluntary

organisations,  we  can  prevent social divide  amongst  various

ethnic  groups and the community.  We can reduce ethnic tensions

from  surfacing  in  future when we have more voluntary  welfare

organisations  to  mediate and solve problems faced  by  various

disadvantaged  groups.  I foresee this can be  a  serious  issue

that we should avoid.  There are other new issues and challenges

and  we  do  not  want  to have a wider  social  divide  in  the

community  in  our  society.   And  therefore,  the  support  to

voluntary  organisations would be useful and important.   Social

abrasions  can  be  reduced  with  some  generosity   from   the

Government.   We  should not be just seen as  taking,  but  also

giving  where  and when necessary.  This should be  the  thrust,

both

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>

giving and taking, and it is essential.  I am sure through  this

process,  we  will  be  able  to  build  a  more  cohesive   and

progressive community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the point that I

wish to actually speak about has, in fact, been advocated by the

MP for Tanjong Pagar, Dr S Vasoo, and that is the creation of  a

centralised  body to promote volunteerism.  It is  a  recognised

fact  that  in  spite  of  vigorous upliftment  efforts  by  the

Government  and the respective ethnic communities in  Singapore,

there  would always be people who have difficulty  to  cope.   I

believe it is therefore important that we cast the net wider  to

help  the less fortunate improve themselves.  This is especially

important  as  we  continue  to push towards  a  knowledge-based

economy.   There would be emerging social problems,  contributed

primarily by structural unemployment.  If these problems are not

properly  identified and strategies carried out at  an  advanced

stage,  these  problems could multiply, sap  our  resources  and

limit our capacity for further progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that Singapore 21 was launched to cast new ideals

for  the  21st Century Singapore, consistent with Prime Minister

Goh's  desire  to  have  all Singaporeans  join  hands  to  make

Singapore  our  best  home.  To make his  vision  a  reality,  I

believe  that a strong spirit of volunteerism must also prevail,

and  what  is more important is that it must transcend good  and

difficult economic times.  The strong and the successful must be

prepared  to  come  forward to assist  the  weak  and  the  less

fortunate.   Beyond Singapore 21, we need to  also  ensure  that

there is always a dedicated pool of volunteers who are committed

to the cause of the community and who will readily be around, no

matter what the economic conditions may be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to, once again, reiterate and echo

what  Dr  Vasoo had earlier on advocated, that is, the formation

of  a  centralised  body,  who could devise  schemes  to  build,

encourage and support a strong volunteer movement.  This  body's

primary objective should be to promote

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>

and  inculcate the spirit of volunteerism that is resilient  and

that will complement Government's and other civic organisations'

effort so as to develop a more cohesive and gracious society  in

21st Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, the range of social and

welfare services provided by many well meaning voluntary welfare

organisations is commendable.  The allocation of these resources

is currently performed by the Ministry of Community Development.

The   question  we  have  to  ask  ourselves  is   whether   the

availability and the demand matches.  The question  is  all  the

more  important as it is more difficult to get funding  in  this

current  economic  climate.  Are we allocating scarce  resources

efficiently?  I am of the view that this is not always so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the Before-and-After-School-Care Centres (BASC)

that  have  closed down, day care centres that are underutilised

and  the  long queues and waiting period for childcare  centres,

and  one  will  begin to understand why such resources  are  not

optimally allocated.  It is the norm that the GRO advisors get a

letter from MCD informing them that they have decided to set  up

a  certain  service  at a location without  asking  the  advisor

whether  the  service is required and whether  the  location  is

appropriate.   It  is  frustrating to  VWOs  that  having  spent

considerable  effort raising funds, time and  energy  developing

the  centre, only to find that the service is not required.   It

is  not only a waste of resources but also very disheartening to

VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for MCD to work more closely with the GROs. The

advisor  of  the  GROs will be familiar with the  needs  of  the

people in his estate and will be able to advise on not only  the

type  of  service  required, but also the quantity  of  services

required  and where the optimal site will be.  I would urge  the

Minister  to  look at the way that such resources are  allocated

and  perhaps work more closely with the advisors of the GROs  to

have optimal allocation of these scarce resources.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, our Government has always believed in

the principle that members of the community must play a part  in

helping  to care for the less fortunate members of our  society.

This  is  to ensure that the social problems which we  encounter

are  not  conveniently  passed on  to  the  State.   This  would

include, for instance, caring for the elderly citizens and those

who  are  handicapped.  In adopting this principle of co-sharing

the  responsibility,  the  Government  has  had,  amongst  other

things,  to work with voluntary welfare organisations in funding

some  of  these  programmes.  Customarily, our Government  would

match  the  sum  of  money  raised by  these  voluntary  welfare

organisations  to increase the resource pool available  for  the

social programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, therefore, many VWOs are engaged in fund

raising  exercises in order to increase the resources  available

to  fund  the  programmes.   The NCSS,  which  is  the  umbrella

organisation covering many of these VWOs in Singapore, is one of

the  largest  recipients  of  public  donations  and  Government

funding for social programmes.  One has no doubt that the  money

that has gone into the NCSS is well used and well managed by the

NCSS   to   assist  its  member  organisations  in  its  various

activities.   The  sums  received  by  many  voluntary   welfare

organisations  are  not small.  However,  following  the  recent

episode  wherein a member of the public had wrongly accused  the

CEO of NKF of misusing the Foundation's funds, many Singaporeans

have indeed begun to ask whether there are proper guidelines  as

to  how the money that is given by members of the public and the

Government should be spent, and whether there is an audit system

in  place to ensure that these guidelines are adhered to.  These

guidelines  must surely be based on the principles of  achieving

greater effectiveness and efficiency for the VWOs, so that every

dollar  given  can be stretched longer.  If there  is  assurance

that  taxpayers' money and donations by members  of  the  public

would  be made to good use, I am sure that it would serve as  an

encouragement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>

for many more people to put in money into the organisation for a

useful and proper cause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if it was discovered that the money

donated  to an organisation is not very well managed,  then  the

organisation concerned should change its principal  officers  or

suffer the consequence of not having any public support for  its

activities.  MCD should therefore perform this watchdog function

in  ensuring that the money granted to these organisations would

be put to proper use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Community Development

whether  the  Ministry would consider implementing a  system  of

audit  control on all voluntary welfare organisations to  ensure

that these organisations are administered in accordance with the

guidelines  and  standards set by the  Ministry,  and  that  the

grants  given by the Government and donations by members of  the

public are properly used.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, social workers work

quietly  and spontaneously, sacrificing their time to serve  the

unfortunate  people  in society and bring  them  warmth.   Their

spirit  is worthy of our emulation.  But social workers  in  our

society  have  not  been  given  due  social  status,  and   the

Government's  recognition for their contributions is  also  very

limited.  Of course, social workers do not expect the Government

to give them any benefit, neither do they work as volunteers for

the  so-called benefits.  But I feel strongly that it is  unfair

to  these  noble  voluntary workers not  to  be  given  the  due

recognition from the authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, grassroots leaders enjoy free parking

facilities in their constituency, whereas  social workers do not

get   such   concession.   Sometimes,  because  of  their   work

commitments,   they  are  fined because the  validity  of  their

coupons  has expired.  They work for free, and yet they have  to

incur out-of-pocket expenses.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>

Government  has  given  money  for  the  construction   of   the

Grassroots'  Club,  so  that grassroots  leaders  can  have  the

prestige of having an exclusive club of their own.  On the other

hand,  the  Government does not even give a thought to   provide

similar facilities to the voluntary social workers, so that they

can mingle together and exchange experiences and information and

strengthen their determination to serve the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry of Community Development

consider  building a similar club for social  workers.   Why  is

there  such  a  difference in treatment?   Is  it   because  the

grassroots organisations are serving the interest of the PAP and

are therefore given these special privileges?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in my

maiden  speech in November 1997, I called for the need  to  give

greater  recognition to professional social workers  to  enhance

their  image  and  standing,  and to  invest  resources  at  the

tertiary level to develop competent professional social  workers

to meet the long-term need of the social service sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, a number of initiatives were undertaken

which gave the sector a boost.  Inviting social workers to  have

tea  with  the President at the Istana was a huge success.   The

Outstanding  Social  Worker award was yet  another  recognition.

Giving scholarships to students studying social work was a great

incentive to attract more students into the field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me, Sir, to highlight my continued concerns on

skills  development and professionalising the service  delivery.

First, what is the progress in reviewing the status recognition,

remuneration and benefits of social workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the shortage of qualified social workers is still a

problem.   The  Family Court, for example,  currently  has  nine

counsellors.   There are six more vacancies to  be  filled,  but

there  are no takers.  I was told that it was difficult to  find

suitable counsellors.  This seems to be a common

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>

story for most VWOs and the inadequacy became more apparent when

specialised  care  is  needed, like speech  therapists  for  the

mentally  challenged, specialised treatment  programme  for  the

autistic,  trained  placement officers  to  help  integrate  the

disabled  in  employment situations, trained social workers  for

rehabilitating  men  in  jail  who  are  coping   with   violent

behaviour.   The list goes on.  My question to the Minister  is:

has  the  Ministry carried out an in-depth study to address  the

manpower shortage of the social service industry as a whole?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is skills development, an ongoing concern

due to the increasing need for a continuum of services to attend

to  the  problems of the young, the youths, the elderly and  the

disabled.   Could  the Minister inform the  House  what  is  the

progress  in developing the formalised and specialised  training

for social workers as well as volunteers?  Is there a broadening

of post-graduate social work training modules at the polytechnic

and university levels?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, having nine months more to go before the new

millennium comes, would the Ministry seriously consider  setting

up  Social Services 21 and identify urgent service gaps  whereby

grassroots    social    service   professionals    could    make

recommendations  and  propose an integrated  programme  for  the

sector?   This could help minimse some of the frustrations  felt

by VWOs, earlier mentioned by Dr Michael Lim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that social work development is a critical

component  in our overall perspective of managing and  enhancing

social  cohesion in Singapore.  As we invest huge  resources  in

training and retraining of workers in the manufacturing  sector,

we  must  continue  to also adopt a development  perspective  by

investing  resources  on  short-term  strategies  and  long-term

programmes in professionalising the social services delivery.  I

hereby support Dr Vasoo's call for more allocation for MCD.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as

we step into the new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>

millennium,  we are likely to face the impact of a new  economic

system.   With globalisation, regionalisation and the challenges

of  the  new information technology, how are we going to enhance

the  social cohesion of our multi-racial society?  What type  of

changes  can be expected in our family lives? How do we  sustain

and   pass   on  our  traditional  values  from  generation   to

generation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt our social and legal structures are very good.

However,  we  need  to  instill some kind  of  catalyst  in  our

families  and society to strengthen human bonding, ie,  to  make

our  families  and society more humane, and also  to  strengthen

family ties and friendship among our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we participate in nation building, it is the duty of

every  one  of  us, first, to keep our families in  good  order.

Every one of us should play a part in it.  There is a saying  in

Hainanese  to the effect that if you have money, you  contribute

money.  If you have strength, you contribute your strength.   If

you  have  no  money  and no strength, you just  donate  aerated

water.    In  the good old days, provision shop owners  may  not

have  the money to donate or time to spare, but they had  plenty

of soft drinks or "aerated water", as it was then called.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear our friends complain that the CDC has not

done  enough, or that the voluntary organisations have not  done

enough.   It  is  easy to point an accusing  finger  at  others.

However,  when we ask our friends to take part in the activities

of   these  organisations, they would say, "I am very  busy.   I

have  to  work overtime.  I have to look after my  children.   I

have  to go for training, etc."  But if we look at it seriously,

if  everyone can contribute, say, one or two hours in a week, or

at  least  in a month,  to participate in social work,  it  will

make a lot of difference.  In other words, since they can afford

to  play  9-hole or 18-hole of golf every week, borrow  so  many

video  tapes  to  watch, or  watch so many TV programmes,  I  am

quite sure they can arrange their time and set aside a few hours

to do social work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the family as the fundamental building block of

society.  Because of very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>

busy  work schedule or other commitments, our parents,  brothers

and  sisters may not have met even once in a year.   So  we  can

start, first of all, from the family activities.  Whenever there

is  a function or some celebration, we have to eat.  So, why  do

we  not  take  the  opportunity to eat together?   We  can  also

observe the various religious or cultural rites and rituals.  If

we   are  not  restricted  by  our  religious  beliefs,  we  can

participate  in activities in the churches, mosques or  temples.

We  can also participate in the various cultural activities.  We

can  also   visit  our  relatives during the  Chinese  New  Year

period.  Nowadays, we are quite used to celebrating the  various

festivals together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, participation in community organisations. Now, we

have  CCCs,   RCs, CCMC, Senior Citizens' Clubs,  Youth  Groups,

Women's  Group  and all that.  We have the whole  set  up.   The

important  thing  is  whether  or  not  we  have  the  time   to

participate in their activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to raise is that when we

participate,  of  course, it is best  if  we  can  do  it  on  a

voluntary  basis.  But we can also set up a points  system  with

the help of the computer.  In Japan nowadays, some townships are

already  adopting the points systems where the organisers  would

record  the  number  of  hours a person  participates  in  their

activities.   These  points would be  accumulated  to  give  him

credit  for  any  service  that he may require  in  future.  For

example,  if he needs to go to a day-care centre, he will  enjoy

priority  or concessions if he has accumulated a certain  number

of  points  through  his previous voluntary  services  rendered.

This  will serve as a form of reward for his past contributions.

Of course, the reward is not  the ultimate objective, but a sort

of   encouragement  or  incentive.   Perhaps,  the  Ministry  of

Community Development could consider adopting this points system

to  encourage and reward the voluntary welfare officers, so that

social  service will become a norm rather than an  exception  in

our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, we are all pursuing the 5 Cs. But we should also

pursue the 6th C,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>

which is community work.  In the old days when we had the family

planning  campaign, there were advertisements with catch-phrases

: "Boy or girl, two is enough" or "More children less to share".

In  our society now, everybody wants to live a good life.  Maybe

the  Ministry  of Community Development should start  a  "Family

Life  Planning" campaign along this line.   We should reach  out

to  the  people.   We  should  teach  our  people  how  to  live

harmoniously   with  their spouses,  how to live  together  with

their  families and neighbours, and how to enjoy the company  of

their friends of different races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often, we criticise our younger people and tell them

"You must not do this, you must do that."  But, in fact, we  are

not  doing  what we preach. We should set an example  ourselves.

The  Japanese say, "You are a mirror to your children".   So  we

have to teach by example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day Dr Aline Wong was talking about AIDS. In

America  there are certain sects which say that they   can  have

casual  sex  so long as they use condoms.  But I tend  to  agree

with   Mr  Bernard Chen.  He said that we must set  the  example

ourselves.   AIDS can be prevented so long as you do  not   have

casual  sex.   We must inculcate in our youths the right  values

and  moral  obligations to do what is right and to  avoid  doing

what is wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that when the year 2000 arrives, we can be fully

prepared,  on  the  one  hand, to enjoy the  economic   benefits

brought about by high technology and, on the other hand, provide

more  comprehensive "Life Education" and "Family Life  Planning"

to  our people, so that everyone will become active participants

in  our family and social activities; everyone will optimise our

"human  bonding" to make Singapore a more humane,  friendly  and

compassionate society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in his Chinese New

Year  message,  Prime Minister Goh mentioned the  importance  of

community  bonding.   In  this current economic  recession,  the

people of Singapore have demonstrated the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>

importance of community bonding as they go along with the  cost-cutting  package  to save our economy.  In one heart,  they  are

prepared to make sacrifices for the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community bonding does not come by itself. It has to be

cultivated   through  education  and  nurtured  through   active

participation in grassroots activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On how to enhance our community bonding, I have the

following suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In the various constituencies in Singapore, we have

different  levels of grassroots organisations.  I do  not  think

many  people would know how many grassroots organisations  there

are   in  our  constituencies.  Nowadays, we  have  often  heard

people  talking about their aspirations to have  5Cs or  6Cs  in

life. .  In my constituency there are 12Cs - the CCC, CCMC,  RC,

WEC, YEC, CSC, CDEC, CDC, SCEC, MAEC, IAEC and NC.  Yes, we have

12   different   kinds   of  grassroots  organisations.    These

organisations are actively organising all sorts of activities to

bond  our people together and in the process build up our social

cohesion. When I speak to our young people about kampong spirit,

they  find  it  to  be  a  very abstract concept.  They  do  not

understand  the meaning of kampong spirit.  When  I  asked  them

whether they have the spirit of solidarity, they understand.  So

we   must  find  some  different  ways  to  educate  our   young

generation.   If we can bring all these grassroots organisations

together  to  build a "Unity Circle", it will  help  to  further

enhance  our community bonding.  We can also build our  national

bonding.   If the People's Association can give some  incentives

or  awards, like what we  have been doing in companies and  work

places  to  encourage our workers to enhance their  productivity

and  efficiency. I hope the Minister will consider some kind  of

incentive schemes for such activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) When the National Day Parade is held at the National

Stadium,  because  of  the  limited  number  of  seats,  we  can

accommodate  only a small portion of  the people  in  Singapore.

Although we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>

direct TV telecast, it is like watching a football match on  TV.

The   viewers  cannot  feel  the  atmosphere  in  front  of  the

television  set.  National Day is a most important  day  in  our

country's calendar.  To enable all our people to take  part  and

to  inculcate  patriotism  in  them,  I  suggest  that  all  the

constituencies  in  Singapore organise their  own  National  Day

Parade  or at least a National Day Observance Ceremony, so  that

more people can come forward and be part of the  celebration  of

our National Day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the past, at our National Day Parades, apart from

the  programme at the parade ground, there were also processions

of  uniformed groups marching into the city and to  the  various

housing  estates.   This will enable  our  people  to  feel  the

festivity  of  our National Day.  I hope in future National  Day

Parades,  there  could  be  displays  of  some  of  our  defence

facilities  and  weapons, to strengthen our people's  confidence

in our defence capabilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, could you take your two topics "Role

for the future" and "Eldercare" together?  The Minister wants to

reply after the topic "Eldercare".

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Caring for the elderly in

Singapore needs a new approach if we are to cater for the  fast-increasing numbers of a very expectant group of senior citizens.

Sir,  the emergence of this new group and a very different trend

in  requirements will dawn on us very fast indeed.  Only through

good  foresight and fast planning will the Ministry of Community

Development (MCD) stay relevant in the new era.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MCD should serve as a centralised body in

Singapore  to  effect  a coordinated plan towards  care  of  the

generally  well  elderly.  Care of the  elderly  is  no  more  a

question  of simply providing necessities like food and lodging.

Care of the elderly is about quality of life provided through  a

holistic  approach  or total care concept of  catering  for  the

physical, social and mental aspects of life.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of our elderly, 95% of them in fact, are

ambulant and in reasonably good health. Only 5% of them  require

institutional  care  either  because  they  are  disabled   from

illnesses,  or because they are too frail.  Our aim,  therefore,

is  to try and keep the 95% of elderly who are "relatively well"

remain  happy  and healthy.  Programmes need to be  revamped  to

achieve these targets.  The success of these new trends of  care

will  not only make our elderly happier and healthier, but  they

will also:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) reduce the burden on many family members who would

otherwise have to look after the elderly themselves; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) benefit the nation through reduction on use of high

cost care in the healthcare institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development should just focus on

the ambulant and relatively well elderly and leave the dependent

elderly  to  the  Ministry of Health.  Sir, I believe  that  MCD

should go this way in order to stay even more relevant and  cope

with the changing social trends and changing demographic profile

in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to go on to my next cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an increase in the life expectancy of our

people  now  to about 80 years in age.  The majority of  elderly

will  now  have  about 20 years more to live  after  retirement.

This  is  very much the resultant effect of modern  science  and

technology.   Sir, to most of the elderly folk, the  quality  of

life  rather  than longevity becomes the issue that  matters  to

them.  It will be good, therefore, to revamp our system so as to

enable  quality  living  for  our  elderly.   The  Ministry   of

Community  Development could aim towards  promotion  of  quality

lifestyles so that as many elderly can stay happy and healthy in

the community for as long as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that we set certain broad

guidelines to achieve our objective:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Promote positive attitudes towards ageing through public

education  targeting a change of mindset in both the  young  and

the old in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Help the elderly to be engaged within the community for as

long  as  possible.  This can be achieved by  (a)  getting  them

involved  in  the  neighbourhood CARE (Centres of  Activity  for

Retired  and  Elderly); (b) encouraging a buddy-system  type  of

caring  for  each other; (c) involving them in new hobbies,  and

(d)  getting  the various voluntary care groups  coordinated  in

their efforts.  Ideally, every constituency should have at least

one of such centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Limit and delay the onset of disabilities in old age, which

more  often  than not are due to diseases.  It is  important  to

have  healthy lifestyles and preventive healthcare.  Watch their

daily  food intake, ensure them daily exercises, and  give  them

enough  mental  stimulation.   All these,  together  with  early

detection and treatment of diseases, will dictate the numbers of

the sick dependent elderly in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide financial, personnel and logistical support to

achieve   our   aim.    The   MCD  should   support   grassroots

organisations,  non-profit  organisations  and  other  self-help

groups run CARE.  A lot of people may have the interest but they

need  the  know-how and the financial help.  Providing care  for

the   elderly  can  be  rather  expensive  because  the  elderly

frequently  do  not  have enough funds when  they  retire.   The

elderly,  as  a socio-economic group, also do not  get  much  in

terms of priority for their well-being and general care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Provide elderly-friendly features in their habitat to

enable  them to stay for as long as possible in their own homes.

Here, the MCD can help by providing the information, the advice,

and the expertise to those who need the help.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that we succeed in this area of

eldercare.   It will be a big task because we are  expecting  to

have  about  one million sixty-plus citizens by the  year  2030.

The MCD would have succeeded in this area if the quality of life

amongst  the  elderly  has  been  improved  and  the  number  of

dependent  elderly  has been reduced.  The rewards  for  society

from the multiple effects of good health, quality lifestyle, and

less  expensive healthcare will be enormously significant.  Sir,

I urge the MCD to prioritise this area and make good eldercare a

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could I move on to my last cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, for six years, Mr Lee Tan Lim (not his

real  name), aged 96, faced a wall of silence from his son,  his

daughter-in-law and their three children.  For  six  years,  his

wife  was  slapped on the wrists each time she failed to  follow

her  daughter-in-law's orders.  They fended for themselves  with

money  saved  from  "hong  bao" given  by  their  daughters  and

friends.  They bought their own food and paid for their  medical

expenses  with money they have saved.  Their son and his  family

abused this elderly couple in both emotional and physical terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate response from most people would probably be

that  the  aforesaid  is a rare and unusual  situation.   Is  it

really   that   rare  and  unusual  though?    Statistics   from

Subordinate  Courts  show  that  one  out  of  every  34  police

protection order (PPO) applications filed here between  1st  May

1997 and 30th June 1998 is from a parent.  It works out to be 86

cases.  According to Tsao Foundation's Hua Mei Mobile Clinic,  a

non-profit  organisation devoted to the care and  well-being  of

the  elderly, they see about 10% of "elderly abuse" patients  in

their  practice.  Research has found that almost one out  of  26

people  aged  60  and above in the United States  is  an  abused

person.   Studies  in Japan show that those most  vulnerable  to

abuse are in the over-75 age group, and the most common type  of

abuse is neglect.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that "elderly abuse" is a silent tragedy

in  Singapore  because most people shy away  from  making  their

problems  known.   In Singapore, "elderly abuse"  is  definitely

under-reported.   It  is  Asian  culture  to  cover  up   family

problems, to avoid being stigmatised and to spare themselves  or

their  families from public embarrassment.  The other reason  is

that  the present generation of elderly is also a "hardy  breed"

and  some  do  not see such behaviour as abuse.   Sir,  "elderly

abuse"  can  be  physical,  with injuries;  psychological,  with

anguish  and emotional trauma or material, with neglect  of  the

elderly who are left with no comforts, funds or resources.  Tell-tale  signs  of  abuse  would  be  poor  hygiene,  malnutrition,

dehydration, unexpected injuries, depression, physical  as  well

as social isolation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not treat "elderly abuse" as a non-existent

issue.  We need a national effort in tackling this problem.  The

law,  Part VII of the Women's Charter, has been amended in  1997

to  address the relevant provisions for the protection of abused

parents.   The Ministry of Community Development could spearhead

the next move by:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) making concrete plans and creating a body to promote

public awareness of "elderly abuse"; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) coordinating the activities of various organisations,

including  hospitals, voluntary organisations, social and  legal

service  providers, as well as programme and  research  resource

centres to facilitate assistance to the abused elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is of paramount importance that a civilised country

like ours does not turn a blind eye to this social ill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, according to the

United  Nations, the number of people aged over 60 will increase

from the present 550 million, or 10% of the world population, to

1.2  billion, or 14% in 2025.  Singapore society is also rapidly

aging.  Projections are that our proportion of the aged, defined

as persons aged 60 and above, will increase from the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>

current  10%  to  26.1% in 2030, or one in every  four  persons.

This  makes  Singapore the fastest aging society in Asia,  after

Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of this demographic change will be pervasive.

The  needs  of  the  elderly  in the areas  of  the  employment,

financial  security, healthcare, community support  and  housing

will  be  all  the  more  accentuated  and  urgent.   The  aging

population  will not be an issue which just concerns our  senior

citizens  and the families but every aspect of our society.   As

senior  citizens  grow  to  be an even  larger  portion  of  our

population, we must ensure that senior citizens are able to lead

meaningful  and fulfilling life in their own age.   Family  ties

must be strengthened so that this becomes the primary source  of

support for senior citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that senior citizens are able to live

productive  and  active  life so that they  continue  to  be  an

integral  and  contributing  part of  society.   Employers  must

recognise  that senior citizens can be as productive as  younger

workers  can,  particularly in a knowledge-based  economy.   The

retail  industry must make available accessories and  implements

that  can  help the elderly remain independent.  Developers  and

town  planners  must  make home and public  facilities  elderly-friendly.  Together, all sectors of our society must prepare for

an aging population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has realised the need to prepare for

the  challenges of an aging population.  In October it set up  a

high-powered   Inter-Ministerial   Committee   on   the    Aging

Population.  May I ask the Minister what progress has been  made

so  far?   In  preparing  the master plan  of  service  for  the

elderly,  I hope the Government can take into consideration  the

different  needs  of different groups of senior  citizens.   The

needs of the senior citizens in the next millennium will be very

different from those of the senior citizens that we know  today.

They  will be healthier, better educated with bigger and  buying

power because of CPF savings and investments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government in its deliberations does not just

concentrate  on  material  well-being  but  also  consider   the

spiritual  and  intellectual  well-being.   Keeping  busy,  both

physically and mentally, is important for senior citizens' well-being.   There should be opportunities for many of  them  to  go

back  to  school to study subjects of interest which they  could

not  pursue  in  their younger days due to the need  to  earn  a

living.   Along  this  line of life-long learning,  I  hope  the

Government can consider setting up a Senior Citizens University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aged must not be seen as a problem. They present

opportunities  and challenges and these must be  identified  and

taken up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the trend of an aging

population in Singapore has already attracted our attention.  By

year  2030, 20% of our population will be above the age  of  60.

Of  course,  we cannot wait until it happens before  we  do  our

preparation work.  We must immediately make all plans  to  cater

for this situation.  Recently we have set up a Committee to look

after  the  aged.  Although this is a new organisation,  I  hope

that  when the Minister formulates any policy, he would  consult

the  grassroots organisations of the various constituencies  and

collect  more  feedback from the ground.   Only  then  will  the

policies they formulate be more relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people grow older, their mobility will become more and

more  difficult.  For those who live far away from the community

centres, they will have problems getting there.  However, in our

housing  estates, we have one Residents' Committee in  every  10

blocks.  So can I suggest that the MCD work out some plans  with

the   Ministry  of  National Development  to  set  up  a  Senior

Citizens' Corner or Senior Citizens' Club near every RC  centre,

so  that  our RC members can look after the senior citizens  and

encourage them to participate in the activities of the  RC.   In

this  way, we can prevent the old folks from being cut off  from

the community.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, 85% of the population live in HDB estates.

Recently,  I  heard  from the Minister for National  Development

that he was going to reduce the prices for studio apartments for

senior citizens.  That is a piece of good news.  But even  then,

we  cannot ensure that every senior citizen could afford to  buy

this studio apartment.  While we are considering the problems of

the  senior  citizens,  the Government  should  also  study  the

purchasing  power  of  the  senior  citizens  for  these  studio

apartments.   Perhaps some of these senior  citizens  could  not

afford to buy the studio apartments. Will there be other ways to

help them purchase these apartments?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are always talking about moving towards a knowledge

economy  where the emphasis is on  high-tech industries.  We all

know  that  when the senior citizens get older, their memory  is

not  so good and they may not be able to react so quickly to the

changing  technology.  So on the one hand, we  want  to  develop

high  technology, but on the other hand, we must  also  consider

that  with our aging population, more and more people  may  have

problems  coping with advanced technology.  I think we  have  to

strike a balance there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are studying the problems of our senior citizens,

one  important  point is their mental health.   There  are  many

things which senior citizens could do but younger people cannot.

So  when  we are setting the rules, we should also consult   the

senior  citizens, because if we leave it all to the young people

to  plan the activities for the senior citizens, it may  not  be

appropriate.  Of course, we have just started this Committee  to

study  the  problems of the elderly. I hope  that  when  we  are

planning   future activities, we should have more  consultations

with  our  grassroots leaders and the Committee members  of  the

Senior  Citizens' Club.  Only then, can we come out with  better

development  plans  which  are relevant  to  the  needs  of  the

elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi):    Sir,  before  I  reply  to  the  specific   Members'

questions,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>

let me acquaint the House with how MCD is positioning itself for

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past week in this House, several Members have

expressed  concern  about whether we are doing  enough  to  help

retrenched  workers and their families.  Let me  assure  Members

that   the   Government  and  the  community  will  help   these

Singaporeans get back on their feet.  The present safety net  is

adequate  and  there are many existing schemes offered  by  MCD,

voluntary and community organisations to help retrenched workers

and  their  families who are in financial difficulties.   Should

the  situation  worsen and we need more funds, my Ministry  will

not hesitate to request for supplementary budget.  But, Sir, the

best  approach, as has been mentioned quite often today  and  in

the  past  week,  is  to  equip them with the  necessary  skills

continually,  so  that they remain employable and  are  able  to

provide for themselves and their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have also noted that we must look beyond

the  current  crisis, to address broader trends  and  challenges

which could unravel our social fabric.  My Ministry shares these

concerns  and  has  repositioned itself to meet  the  challenges

ahead.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complex demographic and socio-economic trends are reshaping

our  society.  We must anticipate and manage the risks that they

bring.   Instead of dealing with social problems downstream,  we

must  proactively  shape the nature of  the  society  we  desire

upstream.  We need to build and accumulate social capital to see

us  through  the ups and downs on our journey to make  Singapore

"Our Best Home".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can we do this? My Ministry will pursue three

strategic  thrusts  to  enable each  and  every  Singaporean  to

contribute to our social capital.  We must:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Support and strengthen the traditional roles of the

family in care giving and inculcating values in our young;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Anticipate and prepare for an ageing population; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Build up a dynamic and vibrant people sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD has restructured itself to provide focus and direction

to deal with these new challenges.  Let me elaborate.

<br><br><i>Strengthening the Family</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, strategic thrust in strengthening the family.

Society  cannot  be strong if the family is  weak.   Today,  the

Singapore  family, though basically healthy, is under increasing

pressure.   You  are  familiar with the  trends  -  dual  income

families,   increasing  nuclearisation  of   families,   smaller

families,  rising  divorce rates, rising  juvenile  delinquency.

Parents  do  not  spend enough time with  their  children.   The

extended  family is in retreat.  This has led to an  erosion  of

the  traditional  role  of parents and the  extended  family  in

shaping the character and values of their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is taking a proactive and developmental approach to

develop programmes to inculcate family values and provide social

infrastructure to support families.  Our approach  is  two-fold,

developing  our  "heartware" through family life  education  and

building up the "community infrastructure".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family life education is three-pronged: helping couples

strengthen  their  marriages,  imparting  parenting  skills  and

inculcating  family  values.  And MCD's family  life  programmes

will  equip  couples, parents and the young with the values  and

the skills for healthy family living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busy families need strong community support to help them

manage  the many competing demands and pressures of urban  life.

While the family has primary responsibility for care-giving,  it

should have access to good and affordable care options for their

children.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, my Ministry reviewed its child care policy. We

will  develop more child care centres, improve the standards  of

programmes  and  manpower and provide more  help  to  low-income

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Sir, my Ministry will review Family Service

Centres  and  Before-and-After School Care  Centres  to  enhance

their effectiveness and increase supply.

<br><br><i>Anticipating the Ageing Population</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to our second strategic thrust, which is

to  prepare  for the unprecedented ageing of our society.   With

the number of older Singaporeans set to triple by 2030, the baby

boom  of the 1950s and 1960s will now become the seniors'  boom.

We  must plan ahead to minimise the potential downsides and even

capitalise  on the opportunities that an ageing population  will

bring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues of our ageing population demand focused

attention,  coordinated  action  and  creative  solutions.    My

Ministry  recently  formed the Elderly Development  Division  to

provide focus and direction to MCD's role as the lead Government

agency on ageing issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also review existing programmes for the

elderly  with  a view to developing a five-year services  master

plan  for the years 2001 to 2005.  We want to strengthen  public

education, help the elderly to lead active and fulfilling  lives

and  develop  a  strong, well coordinated network of  community-based services to support the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At another level, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the

Ageing  Population,  chaired by Mr Mah  Bow  Tan,  Minister  for

Communications,  with  Mr Yeo Cheow Tong and  myself  as  Deputy

Chairmen,  was  formed last October to set national  directions,

and  to  ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach  across

the   public,   private  and  people  sectors.   MCD's   Elderly

Development Division will coordinate the implementation  of  the

IMC's recommendations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Developing the People Sector</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the third strategic thrust, that of

developing  the  people sector.  A vibrant  and  dynamic  people

sector  is an important pre-requisite for community bonding  and

nation  building.   When  people  come  forward  to  serve   and

contribute  to the community, they develop a sense of belonging,

ownership  and  national identity, in other words,  the  "social

glue" that bonds Singaporeans.  My Ministry's new Community  and

Social Sector Development Division will promote and nurture  the

growth of the people sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key initiative is to establish a national body to promote

volunteerism  as a way of life in Singapore.  I would  elaborate

on this later.  It will be a promotional and resource centre for

Singaporeans  and  corporations who  want  to  be  part  of  the

volunteer   movement.   It  aims  to  increase  the   level   of

volunteerism  in all areas - social service, the  arts,  sports,

etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will work with the VWOs and community organisations to

identify  and  implement  new social services,  improve  service

delivery,   set  appropriate  standards  and  provide   manpower

development and training programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people sector to take a quantum leap forward, it

has to attract strong and able leaders.  Like the private sector

and  also the public sector, the people sector too must have its

share of top talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I have described are MCD's new initiatives in the

area  of  community  development.  When Singapore  first  gained

independence,  the  social challenges facing  us  were  stark  - racial  tension,  communal  strife,  poverty  and  unemployment.

These  problems  have largely been addressed.   Today,  the  new

social  challenges facing us are far more complex  and  no  less

consequential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House, we must deal with these new

challenges  as decisively and as wisely as the first  generation

of  Singapore leaders.  What I have sketched out for you so  far

today, is my Ministry's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>

approach  to  address these challenges.  We believe that  social

capital   is   accrued   by  developing   socially   responsible

individuals, building strong, stable families and by fostering a

caring and compassionate community.  By working together,  I  am

confident that we can achieve these desired outcomes and build a

cohesive and resilient society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now address the specific questions raised by

Members.   Dr  Vasoo  and  Mr  Ahmad  Magad  asked  whether   an

institution would be formed to promote and develop volunteerism.

In  October last year, I mooted the proposal for a national body

to  promote  volunteerism as a way of life  in  Singapore  at  a

seminar  organised by the IPS.  When I mooted  the  proposal,  I

asked  for suggestions and feedback on how the setting up  of  a

national organisation could be facilitated.  I believe  that  Mr

Ahmad  Magad  and Dr Vasoo are referring to such an  institution

when  they suggested the creation of a body to work out  schemes

to   encourage   volunteerism  and  inculcate  the   spirit   of

volunteerism among Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS conducted a survey in January this year and focused

group    discussions   last   month   among   volunteer    youth

organisations.   Members may be pleased to know that  there  has

been a lot of interest in support of the proposal to have a body

to promote volunteerism more widely among Singaporeans.  It will

be  a  resource  and  information centre  that  will  facilitate

networking  and encourage more people to volunteer by  providing

information  and advice on volunteer opportunities with  further

consultancy for volunteer initiatives.  The centre will  provide

training  and  research  and develop good  volunteer  management

practices.  It will serve both the volunteers and the  volunteer

user organisations.  The body will be volunteer-driven.  But the

Government  will not let it flounder because it  will  give  its

support and the resources required, especially to start it off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang asked about improving our social service

sector.  Two events have marked the increasing significant  role

that social workers are playing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>

The  first  was the tea hosted by the President of Singapore  at

Istana  last  year, as the Member has mentioned in  her  speech.

The  second  was the launching of the Outstanding Social  Worker

Award,  singling out those with distinctions in the  service  to

the  profession, the community and the public.  The  Member  was

also involved in this project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training for both professionals and volunteers is

important.  In the past year, MCD organised specialised training

for  the  sector  in  the  areas of  child  abuse  and  juvenile

delinquency.  These are specialised courses.  At another  level,

the  Executive  Directors  of agencies  attended  a  first  ever

Directors' seminar of the sector in October last year.   Earlier

this  year, the staff in the social sector also began the  post-graduate  diploma  in  social work.   These  courses  were  over

subscribed.   I am told that 133 people vied for  the  first  50

places  in  the  post-graduate courses and  the  rest  would  be

trained   in   subsequent  courses.   There  was  training   for

volunteers,  and MCD organised two workshops last year,  one  in

May and another in November, which were jointly organised by IPS

and  the NCSS.  In December last year, MCD, together with  NCSS,

also launched two handbooks on volunteerism.  One is a guide for

volunteer coordinators to emphasise guiding principles  in  good

volunteer management.  The other is a handbook on motivating and

sustaining volunteers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look into ways to professionalise the social

service sector and ensure that we get the top people to join the

sector  so  that they can give better service to the public.   I

was  told  that in the US, in fact, MBAs join the people  sector

and  they  give  the kind of quality, push and  drive  that  the

people sector requires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked for more funds. By the way, I would like to

thank  Dr  Vasoo  and also Mdm Claire Chiang for their  spirited

appeal for more funds for my Ministry from the Finance Ministry.

I agree with Dr Vasoo that the VWOs should focus

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>

more  on  providing service and looking after the needs  of  the

disadvantaged Singaporeans rather than spend too much  time  and

effort  in  raising  funds.   Fund  raising  by  itself  is  not

undesirable,  and I am sure the Member would agree,  because  it

could  tap  on  donors  who prefer to give  to  their  favourite

charities  and educate the public on worthy causes  to  support.

It  also  rallies the community effort and creates a rich  civil

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fund raising by charities has been affected with the

current economic downturn.  But it is heartening also that  some

agencies  are still successful in their fund raising efforts  by

organising novel and creative activities and events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Health Care for the

Elderly has recommended a review of the Government subvention to

VWOs.   This  takes  into consideration  the  growth  in  social

service  required because of our rapidly ageing  population  and

the  lower  ratio of working persons per elderly in the  future.

My  Ministry  will  be working with the Ministry  of  Health  to

follow  up  on this recommendation.  The Members can be  assured

that we are addressing the funding requirements of our VWOs, and

the   IMC   will   also  be  looking  into   this   issue   more

comprehensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I carry on, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is one more minute left.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Can I stop here then?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. Do I have the consent of the Members

concerned?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the Committee

and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>

Committee  of Supply has made further progress on the  Estimates

of  Expenditure for the financial year 1999/2000, and ask  leave

to sit again tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
