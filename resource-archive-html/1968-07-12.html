<div align="center"><b>IMPROVEMENT OF DRAINAGE SYSTEM IN JOO CHIAT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development whether he is aware  that

the  drainage  system in the Joo Chiat Constituency

is   inadequate  and  whether  and  what  steps  he

proposes to take to improve it.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

hon.  Member that the drainage system in Joo  Chiat

Constituency is inadequate. This situation has been

made   worse   by  indiscriminate  and  thoughtless

dumping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



of rubbish into the drains by some residents of the

area.  The  lands in this area are  generally  low-lying  and  the drainage system rather  antiquated.

Overall  radical  improvement  would  be  extremely

costly and could only be carried out in conjunction

with  an urban renewal scheme. However, the  Public

Works  Department  is at present  taking  steps  to

carry  out  minor improvements to the  main  outlet

drain  running  parallel  to  Haig  Road  and   the

subsidiary drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department is also stepping up the making up

of  private  streets  in  Joo  Chiat.  These  works

include the making up of earth drains into concrete

ones.  When  these  earth drains are  reconstructed

together  with  the other minor improvement  works,

the  situation  should  improve.  However,  as   my

colleague, the Minister for Health, has pointed out

the  other day, the residents of the area must help

to  do their best to see that rubbish is not thrown

into the drains.

<div align="center"><b>CONVERSION OF JALAN BAHAR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INTO DUAL CARRIAGEWAY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development when work will commence on the

conversion  of the reserved portion of Jalan  Bahar

in the Jurong Constituency into a dual carriageway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  existing single 24 feet wide carriageway

of  Jalan  Bahar  is sufficient to  cater  for  the

present volume of vehicular traffic. However, if in

the  future  the  need  for  a  second  carriageway

arises, Jalan Bahar can be easily converted into  a

dual  carriageway  as all the necessary  earthworks

and  kerbs have already been completed and only the

metalling need be done.

<div align="center"><b>UNAUTHORISED STRUCTURES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN ALSAGOFF ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

Minister  for Law and National Development  whether

he can confirm that the many structures, erected in

Alsagoff    Estate   in   the   Kampong   Kembangan

Constituency and used as metal-works and saw-mills,

are authorised structures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, most of the structures erected in

Alsagoff  Estate in Kampong Kembangan  Constituency

are unauthorised. Many of these structures are used

as metal-works and saw-mills. Court action has been

taken  in respect of most of these structures,  and

the   Chief  Building  Surveyor's  Department  will

continue to take such action in this area which has

become    somewhat   notorious   for   unauthorised

structures.

<div align="center"><b>RECONSTRUCTION OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TEMPORARY DWELLING STRUCTURES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Policy on submission of plans)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister

for Law and National Development what is the policy

of  the  Chief  Building Surveyor's  Department  in

regard   to  the  submission  of  plans   for   the

reconstruction of temporary dwelling structures  in

Alsagoff Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The policy of the Chief Building

Surveyor's Department with regard to the submission

of   plans  for  the  reconstruction  of  temporary

dwelling structures in Alsagoff Estate is the  same

as  that  for  all  other areas  in  the  Republic.

Applications   for  reconstruction   of   temporary

dwelling  structures are required to  be  submitted

with the following documents:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the sketch plan for the proposed

structure;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a temporary permit licence issued by the Chief Building Surveyor's Department to prove

that  the  existing structure is an authorised

one; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) either ground rent receipts and/or property

tax  receipts  to  prove  ownership  of  the

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction or reconstruction of temporary

structures  without  the Chief Building  Surveyor's

permission is an offence under the law. In order to

contain the growth of unauthorised structures which

finally    become   slums,   the   Chief   Building

Surveyor's   Department   is   continually   taking

enforcement action against the persons responsible.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan):</b>

Sir,  can  the Minister inform the House  why  some

applicants  are  requested  to  submit  architect's

plans and the landowner's signature?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If the area of the building is over

700 square feet, then you need an architect's plan.

If  the applicant can satisfy the third requirement

which  I  have  referred to - ground rent  receipts

and/or property tax receipts - to prove ownership of

the building as against ownership of the land, then

you  do  not  require  the landowner's  permission.

Perhaps  in  the  cases referred  to  by  the  hon.

Member,  the  applicants  could  not  produce   any

documentary evidence of ownership of the  building.

I  say "perhaps", but I would be happy to look into

and  cause investigations to be made in respect  of

any  particular case of which the hon.  Member  may

come to know.

<div align="center"><b>AGENCY FOR CONTROL AND EXPORT OF TROPICAL FISH</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National   Development  whether  he  will  consider

establishing an agency under Government supervision

to  assist  in the control and export  of  tropical

fish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Government does not consider

that there is any need to control or interfere with

the   export  trade  of  tropical  fish   and   the

Government does not intend to establish  an  agency

for such control. However, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



can  assure  the hon. Member for Punggol  that  the

Primary  Production Department is always  in  close

contact  with producers and exporters  of  tropical

fish   and,   in   fact,  the  Department   renders

considerable assistance to these exporters.

<div align="center"><b>MEASURES TO STABILISE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PRICES OF PIGS AND POULTRY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development what measures  are  being

taken  by  the  Primary  Production  Department  to

stabilise the prices of pigs and poultry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Whilst the prices of pigs and pork in

the  market have increased somewhat, the prices  of

poultry  have not and are, in fact, slightly  lower

than normal. The increase of pork price is due to a

temporary shortage of the supply of pigs  from  the

farms consequent on the outbreak of swine fever  in

the   latter  part  of  last  year.  However,  this

shortage  is  only  temporary  and  I  expect   the

situation  should improve when the  young  pigs  at

present  in  the  farms have  grown  to  marketable

weight.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRICITY SUPPLY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Complaints of voltage fluctuations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister

for   Law  and  National  Development  if  he  will

ascertain  from  the  Public Utilities  Board  what

steps  will  be  taken to improve  the  electricity

supply  in  areas where metal and  wood  works  are

carried   out,  as  the  operation  of  the   heavy

machinery  used  in  those  works  often  adversely

affects  the electricity supply to other  consumers

in the vicinity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for

Kampong   Kembangan  could  indicate  the  specific

localities  where there are complaints  of  voltage

fluctuations, the Public Utilities Board will carry

out  detailed investigations and take the necessary

remedial  action. There has been a general increase

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



electricity    demand   in   the   hon.    Member's

constituency.  The  Electricity Department  of  the

Public  Utilities Board is examining the  need  for

reinforcing  the distribution system to  cope  with

the  power demand as well as to obviate the adverse

effects of voltage fluctuations.

<div align="center"><b>SURVEY INTO SINGAPORE'S MINERAL DEPOSITS POTENTIAL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development whether any  survey  has

been   carried   out  into  the  mineral   deposits

potential  of Singapore including its  islands  and

foreshores,  and what are the results;  or  whether

such a survey will be carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (Law Division) (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> In 1950, a survey into the granite

resources on Singapore and the surrounding  islands

was  carried out for the purpose of determining its

availability  for  construction purposes  and  road

works.  A  report on this survey was published  and

presented to the then Legislative Assembly on  19th

December,  1950.  Since then, no  other  geological

surveys  have  been carried out.  If  circumstances

warrant   it,   Government  will  be  prepared   to

undertake or authorise such survey into the mineral

deposits  potential of Singapore,  its  surrounding

islands, foreshore and sea-bed.

<div align="center"><b>REVISION OF WATER RATES FOR NON-COMMERCIAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PURPOSES IN THOMSON</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development if he will ascertain from  the

Public Utilities Board whether the Board will  take

steps  to  revise water charges from the commercial

to  the  domestic rate in respect of some consumers

in   the   Thomson  Constituency  who  are  charged

commercial rates but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



who  do  not  use the water for poultry-rearing  or

other  commercial purposes, where this is genuinely

found to be the case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is "Yes". If the premises

are   not   used  for  poultry-rearing   or   other

commercial purposes but exclusively for residential

purposes,  then  the  Public Utilities  Board  will

charge the domestic water rate and that only.

<div align="center"><b>RECRUITMENT OF MORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FEMALE OFFICERS TO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC SERVICE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance whether the intake into all grades  of  the

public  service recently has been of male  officers

mainly,  and  if he will consider taking  steps  to

promote the recruitment of more female officers  to

the service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not true that the

intake  into  all  grades  of  the  public  service

recently   has  been  mainly  male  officers.   For

instance,  most appointments as nurses and  nursing

assistants are women, More than 60 per cent of  the

teachers recruited in 1967 were women. On the other

hand,  some  posts are unsuitable  for  women,  for

instance,   combat  troops,  night   watchmen   and

lighthouse keepers. Male and female candidates  are

considered  strictly on their suitability  for  the

posts  concerned. For the first half of this  year,

955  female candidates were offered appointment out

of a total recruitment of 2,849.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question, it

would  be  wrong  to give preference  to  women  in

recruitment  to  the  public  service.  The  P.A.P.

Government  has accepted that women  are  equal  to

men; it has not accepted that they are more equal.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

I  would  like to ask two supplementary  questions.

First,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



according  to  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Finance, the Government has  no  bias

against  females  in  recruitment  to  the   public

service.  He  has pointed out that  in  cases  like

nurses or nursing assistants and teachers -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Madam Chan, can you get to your

supplementary question without repeating  what  Mr

Tang has said?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): My first

supplementary   is  this.  Does  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  agree  that  in other  departments  many

female applicants have been rejected?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, does the Parliamentary

Secretary  acknowledge  that  all  members  in  the

Public  Service  Commission are males  and  whether

this  fact  would  not lead to prejudice  and  bias

against females?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards

the  first question, I can only repeat what I  have

said, that there is no prejudice against women  and

that  candidates are considered strictly  on  their

suitability for the posts concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second question, I am afraid I cannot

accept the hon. Member's contention that the P.S.C.

is biased against females. As regards membership of

the  P.S.C., perhaps if a suitable female candidate

could  be  found, I am sure the President would  be

delighted to appoint her.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[10th  July. 1968], "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

clause  47 as it stands in the Bill is a very  good

one.  It gives discretion to the employer to pay  a

bonus  to  his  employees, the amount varying  from

employee to employee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



depending  upon their performance and productivity.

At  present,  the  bonus  provision  in  collective

agreements   applies  equally  to  all   employees.

Whether  a person is a good worker or a bad worker,

he  gets  the  same bonus. In other words,  a  good

worker is penalised in that he gets the same reward

in  the form of bonus as another who is inefficient

and  unproductive. However, there are some  genuine

misgivings on this provision, as not all  employers

are  enlightened employers. Some employers may take

advantage of this provision and give no bonus or ex-gratia  payment whatsoever. This should not be  the

case  if they make a profit. To allay the fears  of

the workers that they might be deprived of a bonus,

the  amendment to be moved by the Member for  Bukit

Ho   Swee  is  a  reasonable  one  and  should   be

supported. It makes the payment of bonus negotiable

up  to one month's wages, and any payment above one

month's wages is at the discretion of the employer.

In  this  manner, bonus can still  be  used  as  an

incentive  for higher productivity or as  a  reward

for good performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the standardisation of working

hours at 44 hours a week as contained in clause  39

is  a  very good provision. It does away  with  the

distinction  between  a white-collar  and  a  blue-collar worker. The limitation of overtime work will

help  to  create more needed jobs for  our  people.

However, in view of the shortage of skilled workers

in special trades, this provision has to be applied

intelligently.  It  may not be  possible  to  limit

overtime  work to 48 hours a month in all cases.  I

am  glad to note that this has been recognised  and

is  provided for in sub-clause (4) of clause 39. As

this  law is new in more respects than one, we must

tread  cautiously. We must be magnanimous. We  must

always  be  willing to listen and always  ready  to

change. With an open mind and flexibility, we  must

entertain  and  process  all  reactions   to   this

legislation, from the workers and trade  unions  to

the  employers and the public. Our future will,  in

fact,  be  more  dependent  on  the  goodwill   and

understanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



of  all citizens in operating this Bill than on the

clauses  contained therein. I feel that if given  a

fair trial, this Bill will undoubtedly succeed.



<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if this Bill had been called our survival  or

salvation   Bill,   it   would   have   been   less

controversial and would have been more receptive. A

great deal of misapprehension, fears and doubts  on

the  provisions of the Employment Bill were created

in  the  minds of our working citizens even  before

this  Bill was introduced in this House.  True,  it

was   openly   admitted   that   there   had   been

consultations   and   discussions    between    the

Government, N.T.U.C, leaders and employers, and  in

discussions  of this nature it is not  possible  to

contain   and   confine   the   contents   of   the

discussions.  But  the  allegations   and   rumours

concerning  the provisions of the Bill,  which  had

been   circulated  to  the  public  prior  to   the

introduction  of the Bill in this  House  and  even

after its introduction in this House, have, I feel,

caused  much  harm, particularly  as  to  the  real

purpose  and intent which this Bill is designed  to

do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, rumours, however unbelievable,

have  their  source of origin. I feel  it  will  be

worth  the  while  for  the Government  to  inquire

whether there had been any unauthorised leakage  of

information   or  intentions  in  regard   to   the

Employment  Bill. It is unwise to  spread  rumours,

more  so in this House. If you would allow me,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, to cite one point which was  alleged

to  be  a provision in this Bill just to illustrate

how harmful these rumours were. The rumour was that

married  women, whose husbands are employed,  would

not  be  permitted to work in order to create  more

jobs  for  the  unemployed. Such a  rumour  in  the

prevailing   situation  would   be   difficult   to

disbelieve.  Nevertheless, as I say it,  it  had  a

very harmful effect on the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to appreciate the intent of this Bill,

which is essential and vital to accelerate economic

growth  and  expansion so that  more  jobs  can  be

created,  it  is  absolutely necessary,  first,  to

remove  those  doubts  and fears  and  restore  the

confidence of the workers in the pro-labour  policy

which   the  Government  has  always  pursued   and

practised, so that the implementation of this  Bill

would have a fair chance of success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it is absurd to suggest that the leaders of

the  Government have all of a sudden  turned  anti-labour  and  taken sides with the  employers.  What

could they benefit at this stage of their political

career and what benefit could the country gain from

a  weak  labour force and a beaten N.T.U.C.?  There

has been in the past a total lack of discipline  in

the  labour  force. Now is the time  for  all  good

trade  union leaders in the Republic to  be  honest

and  courageous enough to enforce strict discipline

among  the  members,  particularly  those  who  are

malingerers,  lazy,  inefficient  and  unproductive

workers.  They should stop giving them  protection.

By  and  large,  our citizen workers  are  a  hard-working  lot  and if only our trade  union  leaders

will  stop giving protection and cover to this very

small  percentage  of malingerers and  unproductive

workers,  we will no doubt achieve a much healthier

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Labour Ordinance, the Clerks

Employment   Ordinance  and  the  Shop   Assistants

Employment Ordinance, which became law more than 10

years   ago,  were  enacted  against  a   different

background and in different circumstances. They are

all  now outdated and no longer serve the needs  of

the people at present and for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the Employment Bill as

well  as the Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill

and the Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill,  a

new  era  in the employer and employee relationship

will  emerge. The intent of the Employment Bill  is

to  secure  on  a firm and sound basis  a  healthy,

disciplined  and competitive labour  force  in  the

Republic  which will ensure our continued survival.

It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



designed  to  standardise and regulate the  working

conditions  of  all workers regardless  of  whether

they  are  white-collar or blue-collar  workers  or

shop  assistants.  It seeks to remove  malpractices

and  restrictive  practices which make  enforcement

and   maintenance  of  discipline  difficult   and,

therefore,  hinder economic growth. If  we  are  to

increase productivity, there must be discipline  in

our  labour force. Without discipline there can  be

no  efficiency, and without efficiency  it  is  not

possible to increase productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has often been said that the

island of Singapore has no natural resources of its

own and that we owe our living to the ingenuity and

skill  of  our  people.  If  we  are  to  meet  the

challenges  of  the l970s, if we  are  to  continue

living  as a people with an identity, if we are  to

make  progress,  then we must be prepared  to  make

sacrifices now to ensure our survival as a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to go into the

controversial provisions of the Bill in detail,  as

many  other  Members have already dealt with  them.

There  will be ample opportunity to do so  when  we

are  in  the Committee stage. But I would  like  to

touch on Part XI, consisting of clauses 109 to  112

which  incorporate  changes to  give  Government  a

measure  of control over the hiring of workers.  In

particular I refer to clause 112 which empowers the

Minister   to  make  regulations  to  control   the

engagement  of employees by employers.  On  this  I

would  sound a note of caution to the Minister  and

his  Ministry.  Present indications  are  that  the

machinery  of  the Employment Exchange  is  totally

inadequate and it is not efficient enough  to  cope

with additional work. This provision should not  be

implemented  until the machinery of the  Employment

Exchange  is  adequately geared to  its  new  task.

There should be consultation with employers and the

N.T.U.C, on  the  proposed regulations  so  as  to

ensure  that their implementation does  not  impede

efficiency and retard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



employers from recruiting the right type of persons

they require in the shortest possible time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill in its present form is

unacceptable without amendments. Several amendments

have already been tabled by the Minister for Labour

and  the  Member for Bukit Ho Swee and I urge  that

these amendments should be seriously considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Employment Bill updates the working

conditions  of  workers in the  private  commercial

sector,  Government  should not  overlook  updating

similar  working conditions in the  public  sector.

Both  are  complementary and  must  be  implemented

concurrently   if   we  are  to  achieve   results.

Government  should also expeditiously consider  and

release  the Report of the Salaries Commission  and

to  take  steps to remedy and correct any anomalies

so  as to ensure also an efficient, productive  and

contented  civil  service  in  the  Republic.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill with amendments.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, allow me to speak on some of the provisions in

this  Bill. I look forward to the amendment of some

of the provisions therein, especially as some of my

colleagues   have  already  tabled  amendments   to

certain clauses in the Bill. When it comes  to  the

Committee stage, I would like to move to amend  the

amendments proposed by my colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I refer to the spirit of this Bill and the

mood and reaction of the people to the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the masses have been gravely

concerned  since the Employment Bill was  read  the

First  time  in this House. Many groups of  people,

either in the streets or in the coffee shops,  have

gathered and discussed the contents of the Bill. At

the  same  time, another class of people living  in

luxury  flats gather together in their offices  and

discuss  the Bill. They rack their brains over  it.

Obviously, this class of people represent the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



employers.  They appear quite satisfied  with  this

Bill   so  far  because  we  have  not  heard   any

opposition to it from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only people who are not happy about this Bill

are  the  working  class. They have  discussed  its

contents  in coffee shops, in the streets and  many

other  places. Many of the provisions in  the  Bill

are  the  same  as those contained in the  original

labour laws. However, there are some new provisions

which will affect their future livelihood and their

family.  As a result, they are grumbling  and  have

complained that the Government is trying to  change

its  attitude towards them and that it has  changed

its  consistent stand on labour. Some of them  have

even  gone  to  the extent of saying  that  because

there  is only one party in Parliament, it  can  do

things  arbitrarily  without  regard  to  anybody's

opinions.  This  is a very good opportunity  to  be

made use of by the Barisan Sosialis and others like

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we examine carefully the arguments of these

people  and  assess  them against  the  spirit  and

content of this Bill, we will find that there is  a

certain  degree  of discontent among  some  of  the

people.  We  will  also realise that  some  of  the

provisions  should not have been  included  in  the

Bill at all, or at least they should be amended  in

the process of debate. Viewed this way, I regret to

say  that  the  contents of this Bill are  entirely

divorced from the realities of present-day society.

Those who drafted this Bill have not gone among the

people  to  assess  the living  conditions  of  the

general masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is said that the Bill gives the correct

definitions   for   reward,   efficiency,   effort,

productivity,  then  we are neglecting  the  common

interests  between labour-cum-consumer on  the  one

hand  and  the employer on the other. This  neglect

arises  because  the  long-term  interests  of  the

employer  depend on a large consumer  market.  This

market in turn depends on the price of goods and on

whether  the  people have the  means  to  buy  such

goods.  At  the  same time, in  order  to  increase

production, there must be a demand for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



them. The fact remains that labour-cum-consumers do

not have the money to buy them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe all loyal citizens will do their best to

meet  the  challenge  of the  1970s.  The  solution

cannot be dependent on merely passing a Bill, or on

any passive way of readjustment to the distribution

of wealth, because that is not enough. We must take

all  measures  to maintain our economic  prosperity

for  the  long-term stability of Singapore  and  to

strengthen our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important also to prevent any grave

repercussions  in  our  society.  When  people  are

desperate,  they cannot contribute  anything  worth

while to the country. Therefore, we must pursue our

scientific studies actively in order to promote our

economic  progress.  We must  study  the  potential

effects that science and technology can play in our

economic development and stability so that  we  may

step  into a new era of industrialisation in  which

there  will  be  innovations  and  more  employment

opportunities. It is necessary to have  innovations

and modern techniques of manufacturing in order  to

meet  the  increased needs of the consumers.  There

should  also  be improvement in the  techniques  of

production. There should be modern equipment and co-operation between employers and employees in  order

to increase productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour's demand for wage increases and fringe

benefits   is  usually  a  stimulant  to   economic

progress.  In  other words, this demand  will  also

stimulate technical progress. In this present  age,

trade unionists realise that wage increases without

increased productivity will result in a rise in the

prices  of  goods and a reduction in the number  of

people  employed. Therefore, they try to get fringe

benefits  for  the workers. The present  Employment

Bill  seeks  to  take some of these away.  This  is

contrary  to  the concept of industrial  psychology

and is also against the mood of the workers. It  is

a retrogressive act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe most people can understand the labour

policy  of  our Government. The original policy  of

bias   towards   labour  will   not   be   changed.

Undoubtedly, as an efficient Government with  long-term political objectives, it will preserve its pro-

labour policy. The enactment of the Employment Bill

into  law is only a change of technique. The  basic

pro-labour  policy  of  our Government  will  never

change.  What  can be changed is the  technique  in

order  to  meet the requirements of the nation  and

the changing situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As democratic socialists, the first step for us is

to  seek  independence and to  raise  productivity.

Unless   we  can  concurrently  increase   national

productivity,  we will not have a  fair,  just  and

equal  society  for  the people.  It  is  therefore

necessary   to  get  a  larger  market.   We   must

industrialise in order to improve the livelihood of

our  people.  Now that Singapore is an  independent

country, we can depend only on our human resources.

We  have  to  carry  out the  great  tasks  of  our

country.  The  people should meet the challenge  of

this age and march forward in unity. The source  of

economic  strength  cannot be  separated  from  our

resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with natural and human resources, we cannot

ensure our country's prosperity and progress. There

should   be  some  catalyst  to  promote   economic

progress. One mode of bringing this about is by way

of  legislation. The introduction of the Employment

Bill   can   be   said  to  have  come   from   the

consideration   of  trying  to  ensure   full-scale

economic prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour explained the true purpose

of  this  Bill in Parliament the other  day.  After

1971,   the   economic  welfare  and  survival   of

Singapore  lies in the hands of our  people.  In  a

small island like Singapore, we cannot plant cotton

or  other  crops  or  foodstuffs  but  we  have  to

maintain the livelihood of many people. One  square

mile  in  Singapore  will  have  to  support  8,000

Singaporeans.  So  a  stagnant  economy  will  mean

starvation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



This Bill is introduced so as to meet our political

and defence requirements and so that the people can

adjust  themselves to face the new  situation  when

the  British  troops are withdrawn. I  support  the

views of the Minister for Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Employment Bill does not

mean  that  the  Government has already  adopted  a

policy  of  suppression  of  the  workers.  Certain

provisions  in  the Bill have, on the  other  hand,

caused  some  anxiety  among the  workers.  On  the

surface, the provisions can easily be construed  to

be  anti-labour  or  contrary to  the  Government's

policy  of  bias  towards  labour,  because,  to  a

certain  degree,  these provisions  will  adversely

affect  the  future livelihood of the  people.  For

this  reason,  I  am  of  the  view  that  if   the

Government  can  be enlightened  enough  to  accept

certain amendments tabled by my colleagues, it will

still  be  possible to avert any  wrong  impression

gained by some people about the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his speech in May mentioned

certain  Bills  which reflected the  general  mood,

thought  and spirit of our people. He also exhorted

the Government and Members of Parliament to give  a

lead in the thinking and feeling in the country. In

view  of  these  considerations, I hope  Government

will  accept the amendment which will be  moved  by

the  Member  for  Bukit Ho Swee (who  is  also  the

Secretary-General  of  the  National  Trades  Union

Congress) to clause 15. If the Government does  not

accept the amendment, it will have to consider  the

consequences  that will follow. If this  clause  is

passed  as it now stands, the Government  will  not

achieve any good results. On the contrary, it  will

achieve  the  opposite  of that  which  the  clause

intends,  because there will be quite a  number  of

people who will be retiring prematurely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide more jobs

for the unemployed, but its enactment into law will

mean  driving  more  people into  unemployment.  If

these people are unemployed when they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



are  forced to retire, what can they do thereafter?

if  they  want to be non-criminal types,  they  may

resort  to becoming hawkers or pirate taxi drivers.

Does  the  Government  wish  to  see  more  hawkers

appearing  and  more pirate taxis  running  on  the

roads? Clause 15 as it appears in the Bill must not

therefore  be passed into law. The Government  must

accept the amendment tabled by the Member for Bukit

Ho Swee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point on which the workers are

unhappy.   This  is  the  question  of  bonus.   My

colleagues  have touched upon this issue.  I  would

like to say that the amendment tabled by the Member

for Bukit Ho Swee fails to meet the objections.  If

the  discretion is given to the employer alone, the

workers  will be at his mercy, because  it  is  not

likely  that  he will be generous or charitable  to

them.  I would like to suggest that the quantum  of

bonus  should  be  a  certain  percentage  of   the

workers'  wages and should depend on the employers'

profits.  If  the  employer is satisfied  with  the

productivity and performance of his workers, he may

also  give  them certain rewards in the form  of  a

bonus.  Thus,  there will be no  animosity  between

labour  and  capital. Instead, there  will  be  co-operation to increase productivity. These measures,

if embodied in the Bill, will encourage the workers

to  raise their productivity, and good relationship

between  labour and capital will last longer.  They

will  be able to co-operate even more and this will

lead to a more stable situation in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maxim whether a country survives or perishes

depends  on  its citizens is valid. To  ensure  its

survival  is the highest virtue that any  patriotic

citizen  can aspire to attain. Everyone  should  be

prepared  to struggle and make sacrifices  for  our

country's  survival. United, we should be  able  to

meet  the coming challenge. This should be the task

of each and every one of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should however give the capitalists

opportunity to show their patriotism and  sense  of

loyalty  by donating a certain percentage of  their

profits towards our Defence Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



So  far, it seems that the Government has been  too

generous to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Employment Bill has given

a very bad impression to the broad masses of people

who wish to support the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like for the reasons outlined in my speech

to   support   the   amendments  proposed   by   my

colleagues.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in full support of the Bill.

It  was  only  after  prolonged and  soul-searching

discussions    with   industrialists,    investors,

employers  and responsible trade unionists  in  the

past  years  that we have arrived at the conclusion

that  we  must  do something for the  good  of  our

national economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the crucial things we have all agreed upon

is  to boost the economy of our country if we  want

to  survive  in this turbulent region.  To  achieve

this,  our workers must be more efficient and  more

understanding  and,  like soldiers  on  the  battle

front,  they must be prepared to accept discipline.

But  with  the  present-day  restrictive  practices

indulged  in  by some of our trade  unions,  it  is

rather  difficult  to  persuade  entrepreneurs   to

expand or even to keep existing factories here, let

alone attract new capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, it is significant that out of our total

working population of about 500,000 persons, only a

minority, roughly one-fifth of them, are unionised.

It  is  not  illogical  to  suggest  that  complete

unionisation  might  have  retarded   rather   than

contributed   to   progress  and   development   in

Singapore  in the past 10 years. Take  the  Housing

and  Development Board flats, for example. We  show

them  to the world as one of the major achievements

of  the  Government. The houses and  buildings  are

printed  in stamps, books and pamphlets. Architects

the  world  over  study them, sociologists  discuss

them, and foreign dignitaries visit them. But it is

common  knowledge that not a single  housing  board

fiat was built by unionised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



workers.  These  are the fruits of  the  labour  of

contract  workers. Only after the  flat  had  taken

shape  and  the feat accomplished did the unionised

workers   come  into  the  picture.   Through   the

agitation  of  a  few misguided leaders  they  then

began to demand work on Sundays and public holidays

in order to qualify for double pay and they went to

sleep on Mondays or Tuesdays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the foundation of the Jurong Industrial

Estate  was  not  laid  by unionised  workers.  The

results  in Jurong are the fruits of the labour  of

non-unionised  workers. Only  after  the  factories

were  built, machinery installed and the  factories

on  their  way to full production did the unionised

workers  become active, bringing in  their  wake  a

whole  series of restrictive practices and  abuses,

copied wholesale from the British trade unions.  We

are  not  condemning unionised labour  nor  are  we

suggesting  that  in  order  to  achieve   economic

progress,  we should abolish all trade  unions.  We

are not against the unions at all. We want them  to

grow  and play a useful role in the development  of

our   country.   We   are   however   against   the

malpractices indulged in by some of the unions.  If

we  want  to  have a healthy and responsible  trade

union  movement in Singapore, we must legislate  in

such a way that no trade unionist can be tempted to

indulge in such malpractices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we must make clear is that when we talk about

uplifting  the living standards of the workers,  we

must  think of the 500,000 working population as  a

whole and not just focus exclusive attention on the

100,000  odd unionised workers. It is true that  in

the  past we have tended to think in terms of  only

the  unionised  workers. The  uplifting  of  living

standards  and  social levelling  has  always  been

confined  to the unionised workers to the exclusion

of  the non-unionised workers. In other words,  the

500,000  hard-working people of Singapore  together

created  the prosperity that we see today, but  the

fruits of their labour were enjoyed by only a fifth

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



the working population. Social organisation on this

basis   is  unhealthy  and  is  likely  to   create

divisions among our people where, on the one  side,

we  find the privileged few getting ever fatter and

better  pay  and more fringe benefits  through  the

intervention  of  their unions and,  on  the  other

side,  we  have the general working population  who

are  over-worked and underpaid, not forgetting  the

many  thousands of unemployed who will  be  willing

and  able to perform the same type of work  as  our

unionised workers perform for a fraction  of  their

pay.  Such a situation will inevitably lead  to  an

explosion  in which all will be lost. We  certainly

do not wish to deny our workers better food, better

clothing and more leisure, but this should  not  be

at  the  expense  of other people. All  these,  the

better  things in life, must be made  available  to

all  workers  and  not just a privileged  few.  The

creation  of  equal opportunities in  enjoying  the

fruits  of labour cannot be attained unless we  can

persuade  some  of our unions to give  up  overtime

malpractices, infringement of managerial rights and

the  wrong attitude of conniving at the laxity  and

indiscipline of some unionised workers. It  is  not

that  we  want  to be harsh with our  workers.  But

adequate  measures  are  necessary  since  we  feel

impelled  to  look after the working population  at

large,  the  unemployed and the many young  persons

who yearly enter the labour market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this background that we are

introducing the Employment Bill and the  Industrial

Relations  (Amendment) Bill. Essentially these  are

the two doses of medicine administered to stimulate

our  economy,  to  boost our  productivity  and  to

enhance   the   image  of  our  labour   force   at

international  level. As the Chinese  saying  goes.

"The mouth is bitter when taking good medicine; the

ear  is hurt by true words." So trade unionists and

workers  must  not whimper to find the  medicine  a

little bit too bitter and unpleasant to swallow. If

we want to seek recovery from our economic ills, if

we want economic robustness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



and health for a long, long time, then we have

no alternative but to administer this medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of these two pieces of legislation can

only  be  seen in the future and we must not  judge

them  too  hastily in the present-day context.  The

concept  and  objects of the Employment  Bill  have

been  very  clearly enunciated by the Minister  for

Labour  in  his speech. Yet the Bill has  met  with

mixed  feelings. From the ranks of  the  democratic

labour   movement   have   come   responsible   and

reasonable  criticisms and, as expected,  from  the

minority  pro-Communist  Barisan  Sosialis   group,

violent and vehement outbursts. The clear sight and

thinking  of  the democratic labour  movement  have

generated light. On the other hand, there have been

heat  and  fire, the twin elements of  destruction,

from the pro-Communists.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly heartening to note that the

majority   of  the  people  of  the  country   have

recognised and appreciated the problems facing  us.

But  recognition  of  the problems  is  one  thing,

understanding   them   is  another,   and   finding

solutions  to  them is yet another. Everyone  knows

that we already have a massive unemployment problem

on  our  hands.  But inadequate  thought  has  been

devoted to the question of how we are going to deal

with the situation. The question is not whether  we

can  contain the existing unemployment problems but

how, with the aggravation of these problems through

increasing numbers entering the labour market every

year  and  the  sudden injection of those  who  are

currently  employed with the British Services  into

the    labour   market,   we   can   generate   job

opportunities  to  absorb a significant  number  of

unemployed people into the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records of the Unemployment Exchange of the

Ministry of Labour reveal that at any given time in

Singapore from 60,000 to 70,000 persons are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



seeking  jobs. More than 25,000 young people  enter

the labour market each year and we will have in the

near  future  another 21,000 or so of our  citizens

joining the ranks of the unemployed in the wake  of

the  British withdrawal, all of them competing  for

jobs which are scarce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we have made significant advances

in industrialisation. But what has been achieved is

insufficient to solve our problems. No parents like

to  see  their  grown-up children let  loose  in  a

society  which  offers them no  hope  of  obtaining

jobs. A society bereft of hope will be a frustrated

one  with  automatic outlets for  anti-social  acts

like  crime and delinquency, riots and arson.  What

is  more  important to realise is that a  situation

like  this  can  well undermine the  foundation  of

society  and threaten the security of those already

in  employment.  A teeming labour market  will  not

only  depress  wages but also generate  demand  for

cheap  labour  by employers, with dire consequences

to  the  ordinary  workers. We  cannot,  therefore,

allow matters to drift along and take their natural

course.  On  the other hand, we must  do  something

about it even though these actions and measures may

be  unpleasant  and unpalatable for  some  time  to

come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logic of the circumstances, therefore,

necessitates that we should plan now  to  meet  the

situation looming ahead. Metaphorically, it is  too

late  to start planting crops after we have reached

starvation  level, because we will  never  live  to

enjoy the harvest. In the face of an impending food

shortage, the logical step to take is to plant food

crops  well  in  advance to prepare  to  avert  the

calamity of starvation. Another way of saying it is

that  if we dig a well in search of water only when

we  feel  thirsty, then that will be too  late.  We

must  start  digging a well even  at  a  time  when

thirst has not yet set in and while there is  still

more  drinking water left. Our future is grim  and,

therefore,  demands  strong, stern  and  determined

action. It is only on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



basis that we can meet the challenges and hope  for

partial, if not complete, solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, at the moment, a mild boom in Singapore.

But we cannot afford to sit back and let everything

drift. Time will creep up inexorably and 1971  will

come  sooner than we think. A Government worth  its

salt,  therefore,  must plan for the  eventualities

ahead.  If it does not, then it does not merit  the

confidence  of  the  people of Singapore  who  have

elected  it.  We must not postpone the  search  for

solutions and allow events to overtake us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic prerequisite in order that our goal can

be  more attainable is the creation of a climate to

inspire  confidence  and  to  attract  investments,

local  and  foreign. Confidence connotes  political

and  industrial  stability, and  an  efficient  and

productive labour force which will lower production

costs.  Hidden  fringe benefits must  be  axed  and

other  anomalies  abolished.  This  is  to  promote

social justice in which a person's reward should be

commensurate with and not out of proportion to  his

contribution and, not least of all, bonuses  should

be  determined  in accordance with this  principle.

The days of unearned bonuses are over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk about bonuses in economic

theory, that bonus is an incentive payment and,  in

the  strict application of the term, it  should  be

left  to  the discretion of the employer to  decide

whether or not his workmen merit bonuses. The  rule

should  be that it the employer generally  makes  a

profit  he  grants a bonus to his  workers.  If  he

makes  more  profit, he gives proportionately  more

bonuses,  and  ii  he makes less profit,  he  gives

less.  The  bonus  is  a device  to  encourage  the

workers  to  work hard so that they  can  help  the

employer  not  only to maintain the same  level  of

profit  but also to try to surpass that of previous

years  in order that together they may enjoy bigger

slices  from a bigger cake. Only foolish  employers

refuse to utilise this device, in which case  there

is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



incentive  for workers to give of their best,  with

the result that the profit of the employer is bound

to  slide down and perhaps eventually the profit is

turned  into a loss. It is obvious that by properly

and   intelligently  applying  this   device,   the

employer  can benefit as much from a bonus  as  the

workers. But it must be given in such a way that it

is  related  proportionately to the profit  of  the

firm  and not otherwise. But once the bonus is made

bargain-able,  its meaning is lost. It  becomes  no

longer the incentive instrument that it should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a runaway system of bonus payments, the

workers,  with  the  backing of  their  union,  can

demand to be paid so many months of extra salary  a

year  as their bonus regardless of whether the firm

makes  a profit or not, and if the employer refuses

or  cannot  afford  to pay, then  the  workers  can

always  back up their demands by industrial action.

What is more, in order to forestall further losses,

the  employer  may  have to  give  in.  It  is  not

uncommon   to  find  firms,  which  have   incurred

financial losses for the year, end up by paying one

week's or one month's pay bonus to the workers.  In

such cases, the word "bonus" becomes a misnomer. It

is  actually an increase of salary or  a  pay  rise

except  that the payment is deferred to the end  of

the year or to some festive occasion. Sometimes the

bonus  may  even  be  written into  the  collective

agreement. In this case, the employer is  committed

to  pay bonus during the three-year period in which

the collective agreement is in force. In the three-year period it may happen that the employer makes a

profit in the first year for which he willingly and

thankfully  grants a high rate  of  bonus.  In  the

event of his sustaining losses in the following two

years,  he still has to pay the same rate of  bonus

as he did the first year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiable bonus opens itself to another

disadvantage. As things are now, the unions tend to

demand  the same rate of bonus for each  and  every

worker, regardless of whether he belongs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



to   the   hard-working,  lukewarm  or  indifferent

category,  or the intermediate shades. If  a  hard-working  worker  obtains the  same  reward  as  his

easygoing  counterpart, then clearly the  so-called

incentive is really no incentive at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this background that we proposed to

make  bonus a non-bargainable item. However,  since

the  introduction  of the Bill,  the  N.T.U.C, has

raised  strong  objections to this  provision.  The

Member for Bukit Ho Swee has put in an amendment to

make bonus bargainable up to one month of salary  a

year.  The  Minister  for Labour  has  promised  to

consider it very carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be repeated that the Employment Bill and

other  complementary pieces of legislation such  as

the  Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill seek  to

create  better  conditions more  conducive  to  the

attainment of our objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill has evoked much discussion.

Unfortunately,  many  views  have  been  based   on

misconception and misunderstanding and twisted from

the context of the Bill. There has been an unending

drone  over the provisions regarding hours of work,

overtime,   annual   leave,  sick   leave,   public

holidays,   bonus,  retrenchment   and   retirement

benefits;  and  the repeated charge has  been  that

workers' rights are being sacrificed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, the Bill does not affect the

benefits  of the majority of the workers.  Even  to

the  white-collar  workers, the  sacrifice  is  not

much.  According to the Singapore Sample  Household

Survey,  1966, about 576,700 persons are classified

as being economically active. Of this number, about

67,300 persons, including nearly 16,400 employed by

Government  and statutory boards, are clerical  and

related  workers. On the assumption that a clerical

worker starts working at the age of 20, the figures

indicate that about 27,500 are in the age group  of

20 to 29. The remainder, that is, about 39,800, are

in the age group of 30 and over.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the question of annual leave first. It

can   be   safely   assumed  from  these   figures,

therefore, that the bulk, or roughly 60 per cent of

the  total  number  in  the  clerical  and  related

trades, would have had more than 10 years' service,

which  means  that in effect they  would  still  be

getting  the 14 days' paid annual leave which  they

are  getting now. On the other hand,  workers  in

manufacturing and servicing industries who form the

majority  of  the  economically  active  population

would get not 7 days' paid annual leave perpetually

but an enhanced period of 14 days after  they  have

completed  10 years' service. There is  no  ground

for   these  grouses.  In  other  words,  with  the

standardisation  of  terms of  service  under  this

Bill,   the same benefits will be extended to  all

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to sick leave, some restrictions are

embodied  in  the Bill. No doubt, this will  entail

some inconvenience for the genuinely sick. At least

those  who  used to feign sickness have now  to  be

really sick whenever they claim to be sick and they

can  no  longer malinger by means of a  $2  medical

certificate of dubious validity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many workers have not clearly understood the

provisions on working hours. The Bill provides  for

a  standard  44-hour working week for all  workers,

regardless of whether they are white-collar or blue-collar workers. The great majority of workers  are,

however, not affected by this provision. Only  some

12  per  cent of the working population  comprising

white-collar workers will be affected. Even in such

cases, they can continue to work the same number of

hours  as  they  are working now if their  existing

collective  agreements provide for a lesser  number

of hours of work per week. Overtime rates, however,

will  become operative only after they complete  44

hours work a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to overtime work, the position is that

the present economic situation is one whereby  it

is preposterous to permit people to enjoy unlimited

overtime work. In the past,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



since  overtime work was paid at double  rate,  the

usual  abuse  was to "manufacture"  overtime.  Work

that could and should be done during normal working

hours was shelved in order to create overtime work.

This has no doubt affected the productivity of  the

workers  in that false values have been inculcated,

so  that  the worker is more interested in stalling

than  in finishing his job in the way a responsible

and   conscientious   worker   should.   We   have,

therefore, restricted overtime work to 48 hours per

month  but  exemptions can be granted for employees

in  any  particular  industry or  undertaking.  The

restriction imposed on overtime work will result in

two  important factors which are beneficial to  our

economy. Firstly, by this restriction, the need  to

fabricate  overtime  work is  removed:  the  worker

seeing no purpose in prolonging his job, will  then

want  to finish the job quickly so that he  can  go

home  early. This means increased productivity  per

unit  of labour. Secondly, it will create more jobs

for  new workers. For example, last month, the Port

of  Singapore Authority's restriction  on  overtime

work  and the introduction of a three-shift  system

resulted in the creation of over 400 new jobs. This

is  an example of what can be mobilised to increase

employment if other establishments reorganise their

work programme along the same lines. There is every

reason  to believe that by so doing, many more  new

jobs could be created.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that all those who have bitterly

complained about the Employment Bill should compare

it  with the labour laws of other countries in this

region.  By  comparison, our Bill  remains  a  much

better piece of legislation than any that exists in

this  part of the world. We have a 44-hour  working

week,  adequate annual leave and 11 public holidays

a  year.  No labour legislation in these  countries

can challenge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



comparison   in   terms  of  good   conditions   of

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate my statement by citing a few

examples.  Malaysia has a standard 48-hour  working

week and 11 public holidays a year as compared with

our  44-hour working week and 11 public holidays  a

year.  Even  in  comparison with more  industrially

advanced  countries, our Employment Bill  is  still

much  more  favourable. This can be seen  from  the

following statistics:



<pre>

Name of    		Standard working   Number of Public

Country    		hours per week     holidays per year



Japan                         48                    12

United States                 40                     8

United Kingdom                40/42                  6

France (now)                  40                    10

France                        46.9                  10

  (prior to the strikes)

Germany                       43.9                  11

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore an utter misconception to believe

that  our workers will be groaning under the weight

of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the patriotic point of view, it has been

suggested  that workers and employers should  alike

bear  the  same  sacrifices for  the  good  of  the

nation. This is only wishful thinking. There is  no

reason  why a foreign investor should make  one-way

traffic  type of sacrifices merely for our benefit.

They  have not come in with their finances to  save

us from starvation. They have come in with a profit

motive.   And   if  we  make  life   difficult   or

unprofitable for them, they could just sell out  or

liquidate   their  firms  and  go  elsewhere.   The

ultimate sufferers will be the people of Singapore.

A  cruel  fact of life in the world today  is  that

money can move, but not men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the employers must not form the

idea  that, because of this Bill and the Industrial

Relations (Amendment) Bill, they can have the whole

world  to  themselves. We have heard of  complaints

that  some small employers have actually threatened

to  reduce the pay of their workers. One shopkeeper

I know of has in fact told his shop assistants that

from  now,  they  must work 7 days a  week  without

rest.  This kind of attitude is not only wrong  but

also dangerous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate how some employers can exploit the

situation for their own selfish ends, I will  quote

an  example of an employer who is running  a  daily

newspaper  in  Singapore.  Immediately  after   the

Employment Bill was tabled in this House in May, he

instructed  his  editors  to  write  editorials  to

condemn  the  Bill,  stating  that  the  provisions

therein were harsh and that they should be deleted.

In  doing  so, his foremost aim was to  play  along

with the taste of the workers in order to boost the

sales  of  his newspaper. However, after some  time

when  his  workers  and  journalists  staked  their

claims  for  better working conditions,  he  turned

around and told them that since the Employment Bill

was going to be passed, he was not prepared to give

them  anything  at all. In fact, he even  suggested

slashing  their  pay and withdrawing  their  yearly

bonuses. What is this employer trying to do? He  is

using both edges of the blade to his own advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in public, he condemns the Bill to the

point  of misleading his readers in order to boost

the  sales of his newspaper. On the other hand,  in

private, he exploits the Bill to the full even to

the  extent of misinterpreting it in order to  deny

his  workers  their rightful share of the  profits.

This  is  the kind of unscrupulous and double-faced

employers  we  have to watch out for  and  we  have

enough  power  to deal adequately  with  them.  The

employers  should  realise  that  without  the  co-operation  of  their workers, they cannot  hope  to

reap    profits    from    their    factories    or

establishments, and that they cannot afford to have

disgruntled and discontented employees.  They  must

also  realise  that  whatever labour  laws  we  are

introducing,  we do so only to ensure the  survival

of  the whole country and not in order to enrich  a

few  employers.  I am quite sure in the  Industrial

Relations  (Amendment)  Bill  there  are   adequate

provisions   with   which  we  can   restrain   the

unscrupulous  employers  from  abusing  our  labour

laws.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the pages of this Bill are

embodied  balances  and brakes which,  on  the  one

hand,   ensure   that  managements  perform   their

functions  properly  and responsibly  and,  on  the

other,  promote  and protect the interests  of  the

workers both in the short run and in the long  run.

This   Bill   is  the  prescription  for  unimpeded

economic  health and uninterrupted  progress.  Only

future generations can judge the decisions we  take

today,  and  if they find themselves  living  in  a

happier  society from which hunger  and  want  have

been  banished, and where they can hold their heads

high,  they  will  be proud of  us;  they  will  be

grateful  to us who have struggled and  fought  for

their benefit in these difficult days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they are not wanting in Singapore,

people  who give no thought for the future and  who

seem to think that the purpose of trade unionism is

generally not to think at all but to rave and rant,

to strike up heroic postures and beat the war drums

of  industrial  strife. This is the kind  of  trade

unionism that has led to all the broken-back States

which today litter the developing world. Judging by

some  of  the  anonymous  correspondents  who   get

regular  publicity  in  the  Eastern  Sun,  it   is

apparent  that the formidable and daunting economic

challenges which await the people of Singapore just

around the corner do not concern these gentlemen at

all.  They  are  more interested  in  painting  the

leaders  of  this Republic as a lot of  anti-labour

ghouls  and  accusing the responsible trade  union

leadership  of  being stooges.  If  we  go  by  the

standards  which these anonymous cowards set,  then

the  one  qualification  which  no  trade  unionist

should  possess on any account is the capacity  for

careful  thought  and  analysis  in  depth.  Rather

should  trade unionists say, in effect,  to  blazes

with the unemployment problem, and to blazes with the  need  to create 100,000 new jobs by the  early

1970s,  or  to  blazes with everything  except  the

satisfaction of the organised creed of  the  labour

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the lasting credit of the labour

movement in Singapore that today we can boast to  a

much  larger  extent than previously of  the  trade

union  leadership which thinks in terms  of  social

priorities   and  of  the  collective  effort   and

discipline necessary if the people of Singapore are

to survive in the gruelling years ahead. Not for us

any  more the empty-headed sloganising of the past,

nor   the   striking  of  idiotic  and  thoughtless

postures. It is to the lasting credit of the people

of  Singapore that they have thrown up a  political

leadership



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



which  refuses to play up to any sectional  gallery

but,  instead, has the courage to take  the  people

into their confidence and tell them, even brutally,

the  harsh  facts of economic life. The  Government

has placed a premium on intelligent trade unionism.

It  must,  therefore, be prepared  to  subject  the

measures  it  proposes in this Bill to  intelligent

and searching criticisms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other trade union colleagues in this House have

touched  on various aspects of this Bill  and  have

pointed  out  some  of  its  serious  defects   and

shortcomings. For my part, I would like to ask  the

Government   to   re-examine  very  carefully   the

provision  in  clause 47 which proposes  to  remove

bonus  payments  altogether  from  the  sphere   of

collective  bargaining. Let me  grant  straightaway

that bonus payments have sometimes been abused  and

that  there have been occasions when profit sharing

bonuses  were claimed even when no profits existed.

Let  me also grant that potential investors may not

be  forthcoming if such abuses are not checked  and

if  unions  are  expected to demand bonus  payments

even   before   any  industries  have   established

themselves on a stable and profitable basis.  Throw

the  bath water out by all means. But must the baby

also  be  thrown out with the bath water? This,  in

effect,  is what this particular provision proposes

to do. The more intelligent thing to do would be to

provide  the  necessary checks to  prevent  obvious

abuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Government to give serious

consideration to the observations which  I  propose

to   offer.   Long  established  banks,   insurance

companies,  petroleum companies and  various  other

commercial  undertakings, which have  long  enjoyed

comfortable   or   more  than  comfortable   profit

margins,  have  been in the habit of paying  annual

bonuses to their employees without any qualms  and.

indeed,  quite cheerfully. Such payments have  very

often  been sanctioned or awarded by the Industrial

Arbitration Court. Every year millions  of  dollars

are  being  distributed to commercial employees  by

way of bonus payments. It is now proposed to remove

these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



annual  payments  altogether  from  the  sphere  of

collective  bargaining. Indeed, assuming  that  all

bonus payments are stopped, can the Government tell

us  what  employers will do with these millions  of

dollars  which  they  have been  in  the  habit  of

distributing annually as bonus payments?  Does  the

Government have any guarantee that all these  large

sums   of  money  will  go  into  reinvestment   in

Singapore? The chances are that they will  go  into

nothing of this kind. Rather they are likely to  go

into  private  pockets. I can give up  the  benefit

gladly if I am convinced that the surrender of this

benefit will lead to greater social benefit. But in

this  case I have no such assurance. All I know  is

that the bonus payments will, in all likelihood, be

taken  away  without leading to  any  corresponding

social  benefit.  Indeed, the only  outcome  of  my

renunciation is that the bulging purses  of  a  few

will bulge even more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not given sufficient thought to

the  fact that bonus payments can be made to  serve

as  an incentive to increased productivity. We  all

know  that  it is desirable to give an increase  in

the profitability of an undertaking. 1 would submit

that  the  best way to cultivate such  a  desirable

interest is for management to declare categorically

that  the workers shall be entitled to a fair share

of  any  distributable profit. In this  event,  the

workers  will see that it is in their direct  self-interest  to increase productivity and  thereby  to

enhance the profitability of the undertaking  which

employs  them.  For they know that the  higher  the

profitability,  the larger the  bonuses  that  will

accrue to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other considerations which I would

urge the Minister for Labour and his colleagues  to

consider  more  carefully when the  leader  of  the

N.T.U.C. moves his amendments to this clause.  Not

to  do  so would be to turn a deaf ear to sane  and

rational  arguments, which is what  the  Government

professes to encourage in the trade union movement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  we first sat here as a new Parliament of  the

people's   choice,  we  were  promised   that   the

Employment Bill would standardise and regulate  the

terms  and conditions of service for all grades  of

employees. It was to be a package deal designed  to

lessen  abuses of fringe benefits and  malpractices

amongst  our work-force and, more important  still,

to aim at increasing productivity and promoting and

hastening industrial growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I consider it a task and responsibility we

owe  to  the people of the Republic to provide  the

leadership in seeing this Bill through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering any piece of legislation, the basic

consideration, as I see it, must be whether or  not

such a piece of legislation and its provisions  are

relevant to the prevailing circumstances. It is not

my  intention  here to reiterate all the  difficult

problems  we  are  going to face in  the  next  few

years.  The Hon. Minister for Labour has,  for  the

benefit  of - the more absent-minded, listed  facts

and  figures and has dwelt on them in great detail.

It is essential to have these problems in mind when

examining  whether the present Bill is relevant  to

our  circumstances. It calls for more than ordinary

courage   to  face  the  situation  and  make   the

necessary  adjustments and sacrifices  to  overcome

these  problems.  Our  workers  must  be  made   to

understand the problems ahead so that they know why

and  for  whom they are making the adjustments  and

sacrifices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all agreed that the years ahead are

difficult  and  cruel.  To  survive  these   years,

Singapore must launch a programme of rapid economic

growth  and  promote  speedy industrial  expansion.

This  will  then  provide employment  opportunities

and,   in   so   doing,  ensure   continuance   and

consolidation  of  stable  political   and   social

conditions.  For all these things a price  must  be

paid,   because  history  has  shown  that  neither

economic growth nor industrialisation has ever been

achieved on the cheap!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that many of the more advanced countries

of  today  have  paid a very high  price  in  toil,

discipline and sacrifice to achieve this.  In  some

totalitarian    countries,   human    lives    were

deliberately  sacrificed so that the country  could

achieve  rapid  industrialisation.  In  our   case,

thanks  to  the democratic principles we uphold  in

Singapore and the practices we carry out, the  cost

demanded  for such development cannot be  made  and

are  not  being  made  so  high  as  to  make  life

intolerable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here in front of us a Bill that merely

sets   out  to  curtail  malpractices  and   lessen

opportunities of abuse of fringe benefits.  A  very

small  section of our work-force is asked  to  work

five  hours more a week only when requested. And  1

say  this particular section of the work-force  has

for  many years in the past been living on the  fat

of  the  land. As the Hon. Minister for Labour  has

put  it,  the medicine we are now administering  is

not  really that bitter. And I say that it is  well

worth  it  if at the end of it all we see  progress

and stability emerge all the more flourishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what will happen if we in this

Parliament  are weak and try to seek  an  easy  way

out.  We  can  sit back and admire the Government's

achievements for the last nine years (of  which  we

in the P.A.P, are extremely proud). We will let the

problems  of  the  l970s take care  of  themselves.

Maybe  some of us will kneel down and pray that  by

some  good  fortune, conditions  in  Britain  would

improve  so  much  that the Pound  would  overnight

become so strong that the British Government  would

be prepared to maintain the bases here longer. Then

the  sum total of all this is that our people  will

make merry, drink and dine. Our Prime Minister will

turn  round and say he is the happiest man  because

his people know how to enjoy life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the truth is that this is not going to

be the case. If we just sit back and relax, we will

be on the sure way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



to  economic  stagnation  and  eventually  we  will

collapse.  The  result of such a  collapse  is  too

horrible  even  to imagine, when we  consider  that

here  in Singapore we have a population density  of

something  like 8,500 or so to a square  mile.  The

Hon. Minister for Labour has predicted here in this

Chamber,   when   expounding  his   philosophy   of

development and consumption, that we can only  live

by  eating one another and the Prime Minister  sums

it  up by saying that we must then all perish! This

must  be  the  case because we just  have  not  the

agricultural base to allow us to plant anything  to

feed ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident, however, that this is not going to

be  the end of a people and a country that has over

the  past one and a half centuries built out  of  a

fishing village a prosperous and flourishing island

State!  We  have that spirit of self-reliance  that

even with all the problems coming on us as a result

of  the  British pull-out, we will emerge  all  the

more stable, secure and flourishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I see the Bill sets out to prove. The

attitude  of  the  workers shall  be  and  will  be

remoulded.   Because  our  people  understand   the

problems,   we   have  decided  to   make   certain

adjustments  and sacrifices at this  stage  of  our

country's  history. Our workers  cannot  depend  on

abuses   of   fringe  benefits  to  deprive   their

unemployed fellow citizens of jobs. Each and  every

worker  will  get a day's pay for  a  day's  honest

work. These adjustments and sacrifices are made not

for  some  tribal chieftains, not for  a  group  of

capitalists,   not  for  a  set   of   self-seeking

politicians,  not for some fortunate  sons  of  the

soil,  but  for  a  more  prosperous,  secure   and

flourishing Singapore wherein every citizen  shares

equal   rights   and  obligations,   enjoys   equal

privileges and opportunities!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fruits and the end result of all these

adjustments and sacrifices shall feed not only  the

generation  that will see through  the  1970s,  but

also  for the many others who will come after them!

So I say - I again quote the Hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



Minister   for  Labour - that  we  should  "postpone

immediate rewards for greater gains in the future".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if our workers are not prepared to work just

five  hours  more  a  week,  forego  a  few  public

holidays, restrict scoring on overtime now, let  me

say to them, in the very near future they will have

to strive very much harder under sterner rule of  a

chaotic and disorderly state which must come  about

when our unemployment could not be checked and  has

reached  such  unmanageable proportions  that  many

workers will want to work even for a dog's reward!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now confine myself to one or two

specific clauses in the proposed Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision on the payment of bonus has aroused

great interest. To me this must necessarily be non-negotiable. But  I  understand  from  my  N.T.U.C.

friends  in  this Chamber that they would  want  to

make  it negotiable up to one month's wages.  I  do

not  see the logic of all this. I foresee what  the

employer will do is to evaluate the annual worth of

his workers and divide it by 13 rather than usually

by  12,  thereby leaving himself a quantum  of  one

month's wages for negotiation. Sir, this is what we

set out to eliminate. Bonus should be an incentive.

It  should  not be part and parcel of the take-home

pay  of the worker at all. What I would rather  see

is  a law to request every employer to declare  his

profits  and  some kind of profit-sharing  schedule

drawn  up. In this way, both the employer  and  his

employees   will  make  it  a  point  to   increase

productivity so that the net profits will go up and

everybody  in  the company gets more. However,  let

the  N.T.U.C.'s  scheme  be  tried  out  first.   I

envisage  that at the end of the trial  period,  my

N.T.U.C. friends  will  want  to  see  the  system

changed.   In  this  respect.  I  really   do   not

understand  why the traditional ang pows  given  at

the  end of the year by the Chinese towkay  to  his

coolies  in Chinese business circles cannot  really

work.  In this system, the question of how much  to

give is entirely up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



the  employer who, I believe, after he has done his

calculations   -  Chinese  businessmen   are   very

calculating  -  will  give the  most  to  his  most

productive  employees. And I do not  see  how  this

cannot be extended to the unionised sections of the

work-force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 42 (2) of the Bill is of particular

interest to me. When I was in the public service, I

noticed   that  every  so  often  a  worker   would

conveniently absent himself either on  the  Tuesday

after or the Thursday before the Easter holidays so

that  he  could  enjoy watching the Grand  Prix  in

grand style without worrying whether at the end  of

it, he would be fit to work or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> He should join the

Army!



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> The introduction of this

provision will put a stop to such nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a more general coverage, the Bill seeks to

bring  the  white-collar  workers'  conditions   of

service  in  line  with those  of  the  blue-collar

workers. This, as I see it, will definitely enhance

the  status of the latter. As I pointed out in  the

debate on the President's Speech, this must be done

if  we  want  to  lure more of our youngsters  into

taking up blue-collar jobs. Maybe at the end of the

trial  period of this Bill, we will be in a  better

position  to provide better conditions  of  service

for blue-collar workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, may I say that basically, this

Bill,  far  from  being  designed  to  deprive  the

workers  of  their  rights, actually  sets  out  to

outline the minimum and basic conditions of service

for  our workers. These basic conditions are in  no

way  inferior  to those existing in  the  countries

surrounding us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that our work-force is mature

enough  to understand the problems of the  day  and

accept  the position that what is asked of them  is

really  relevant  and necessary under  the  present

circumstances.  And I am sure that they  will  work

harder and make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



the neccessary adjustments and sacrifices so that we

may  emerge  in  the  1970s more  stable,  better

organised and more flourishing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of the Bill, I am sure many more

foreign investors and industrialists - I must  echo

what  the former Minister for Labour has said, that

they  do  not  owe us a living - will  bring  their

money  here and stake it with us. Because they  can

then  safely say that here in Singapore, we have  a

brave  and sane government and an intelligent work-force  that understand problems and care, not  only

for  the future of their children, but that of  the

country as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the Bill will prove a success.



<br><br>5.05 pm.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the. Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to make another analysis of the

Bill.  I  have  been preceded in  this  respect  by

competent    hon.   Members.   The    controversial

provisions   of  the  Bill  have  been  extensively

illustrated and, when set against the magnitude  of

our  economic problems, I think they become reduced

to sacrifices which our workers can afford to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, the merits of the Bill are simply that

it  seeks to achieve a situation which is the logic

of the present limitations of our economy. And that

it  is  a  facet  of a vast definite programme  for

national    consolidation,    if    not    national

construction,  made necessary by our assumption  of

sovereignty  on  the  9th  of  August,  1965,   and

rendered   imperative  by  the  impending   British

withdrawal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trading and servicing centre and on the way

towards  being  a  manufacturing nation,  Singapore

depends  on  the  saleability  of  its  goods   and

services for a  living. Productivity, therefore, is

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



basic  concern  of  our  economy.  Labour  must  be

adjusted   accordingly.  Labour's role  of   merely

producing the goods for wages must, in my  opinion,

at  this-phase  of  our  economic  development,  be

refashioned  in order to produce more  goods  at  a

lower  cost  per unit of output and,  at  the  same

time,  maintaining quality. The  structure  of  our

economy  is such that if our country is to continue

to  bustle  and thrive and our living standards  to

remain as high as they are today or 50 years  later

or  100 years later, our chief productive resource,

i.e. labour, must be consistent with  capital  and

their  co-ordination must result in-high industrial

productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has been dictated by sheer

necessity. For years, our labour force has operated

under  conditions of strife. In the public  sector,

it  had  to-contend  with an  arrogant,  unyielding

colonial government, in the private sector, it  was

engaged in a relentless struggle against forces  of

exploitation.  Responses  assumed  a  pattern   and

became  set.  Labour's  response  to  capital   was

largely governed by the principle of work for  fair

wages  and as soon as the employer showed  profits,

labour said, "Share." Labour conducted its role  of

protecting the workers' welfare without a national

context.  In the pre-Malaysia and Malaysia periods,

this  may  have been a valid role because,  if  the

chips  had been down then, at least one could still

have  opted for a new life elsewhere. Today we  are

sovereign  and,  simply  put,  it  means  that   we

together  are on our own for better or  for  worse.

And  if the worst happens, we will have to take it.

Mass option for a new life elsewhere is out of  the

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a situation, labour's agitations, however

legitimate,  must be tempered by the exigencies  of

the   nation.  These  exigencies  result  from  the

impending  British withdrawal by 1971. As  detailed

by  the Minister for Finance, we need to spend  the

sum  of  $900 million in the course of  the  coming

four  years to counter the recession that will  be

caused  by  the progressive reduction.  In  British

military expenditure over this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



period. This expenditure of $900 million will  have

to  be above the normal public expenditure for  the

same  period.  $200  million of this  $900  million

represents the total of private investment we would

have  to  induce in the course of the  coming  four

years. This figure is in addition to the prevailing

scale of $250 million per annum. Sir, we can expect

to  succeed  in inducing at least half this  amount

if,  in addition to the political stability of  our

country  and  the industrial peace  which  we  have

achieved,  we  can offer investors an  enthusiastic

labour  force conditioned to secure high industrial

productivity  and  an  assurance  of  a  reasonable

freedom  to  manage,  and generally  an  industrial

climate which is favourable to industrial expansion

and confidence in the future. Both these offers are

spelt out in the Employment Bill and the Industrial

Relations (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But high industrial productivity is the cumulative

result  of  a number of basic industrial needs  and

processes  like  buildings,  factories,  equipment,

power and transport, skilled labour, managerial and

technical  know-how and efficient  services.  These

are   all   immediate  objectives  in  our  overall

reorganisation for survival and development through

our  urban  renewal,  industrialisation,  technical

orientation   in   education,  markets   discovery,

quality control and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated earlier, we are reorganising

now  to  remain a nation in the future. Though  the

problems  before us are vast, they are  not  beyond

solution.  But  woe betide us if we  fail,  for  we

shall  fall into an economic stagnation from  which

we  can  hope to recover only after many years  and

much grief. What is urgently required is a national

mood for productive work at all levels motivated by

a  realisation of the full consequences of failure.

If  this  Bill  and  the debate on  it  inside  and

outside  this Chamber can stir in our  workers  the

beginnings of this mood, it will already have begun

to achieve results before its operation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there will be criticisms on this Employment

Bill.   But  whatever  may  be  said  against   the

Government for introducing this Bill, I think  even

the  devil would blush at the allegation that  this

leadership is helping the capitalists to  get  rich

at  the expense of the workers. This leadership has

gone  down  in our political history  of  the  last

decade as a government that has sought the survival

of  the  country and the realisation of the  common

good.  I  do  not think any serious minded  quarter

would  question the truth of this.  This  Bill  has

been  introduced at this stage for no other  reason

than that it would help the survival of the country

and the realisation of the common good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to some of the controversial clauses

will  be  moved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs

and Minister for Labour himself. Amendments to five

clauses  will be moved by the Member for  Bukit  Ho

Swee.  The  alleged severity of the Bill  would  be

reduced  as  a  result.  In addition,  the  Central

Provident  Fund  (Amendment) Bill offers  a  worthy

compensatory privilege.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it has been disturbing to hear of the

cases  of two employers already attempting to abuse

the  provisions of the Bill. I am heartened to have

been  told that the Minister would wield his  stick

if  the need arose. Let the Minister not find  that

the  stick has been misplaced when the time  comes,

for  I  am  sure  that  our  workers  will  respond

favourably and management is not all that  angelic.

Enthusiastic  and  earnest labour  alone  will  not

suffice.  There must be progressive innovations  at

the  managerial and technological levels by capital

if  the hopes and intentions of this Bill are to be

realised.  Productivity promotion itself needs,  in

my  view,  an infrastructure for care, control  and

research. The Government is urged to consider  this

aspect  of  our  reorganisation  for  survival  and

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, there is a period in the

history of a nation when the people begin to  be  a

nation. For ourselves, this is it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Inche Sha'ari bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since  this  Bill  was  first  introduced  in

Parliament,  it  has generated,  understandably,  a

great  deal  of  public interest and comment,  some

favourable,  some controversial, some adverse.  All

this   has  helped  us  reflect  further   on   the

requirement in the best interest of our country and

people  in time to come. It is, however, heartening

to  see that there has been a general appreciation,

if  not acceptance, of the motivation and need  for

this   legislation  from  all  sectors,   including

labour, management and the press. Criticisms,  most

of  them  constructive, have  been  on  aspects  of

detail, on provisions for hospitalisation, payments

of  bonus,  overtime and fringe  benefits  and  the

like.  It  is  further reassuring to see  that  the

Minister  for Labour has an open mind for  argument

and   persuasion   and   will  consider   seriously

necessary  amendments arising  out  of  a  rational

review within and outside this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make my observations now on the necessity

for and urgency of this legislation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were interconnected factors behind this Bill

- higher Gross National Product and the creation of

more   jobs.  It  is  not  the  intention  of   the

Government  to  inflict  pain  on  the  workers  by

introducing  this  Bill. With its  introduction,  a

more favourable climate for established enterprises

to  expand  and to attract more foreign investments

into  the  Republic  will be created.  This  is  an

inevitable  measure  to prevent  our  country  from

going  down as the result of the impending  British

withdrawal.  We  can  just imagine  the  plight  of

thousands  of our workers thrown out of  work  when

the British leave Singapore by the end of 1971. Not

only  will  the employees of the bases be affected,

but  also those who provide ancillary services like

domestic  servants, etc. Already, true unemployment

is reckoned to total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



anywhere  between 52,000 and 100,000. To this  will

be  added another estimated 100,000 people who,  it

is  calculated, will lose their jobs as a result of

the  withdrawal. This round figure  of  100,000  is

made  up  of  47,000 workers in the British  bases,

including enlisted personnel and domestic servants,

who  will forfeit their jobs directly, plus another

53,000 people who will be directly affected by  the

withdrawal of service expenditure here. The service

presence directly or indirectly generates one-fifth

of  Singapore's  Gross National Product  of  around

S$3,200 million a year. The Forces' direct spending

alone  accounts more than S$400 million a year.  In

addition,    25,000   school-leavers   enter    the

employment  market every year. The process  may  be

likened to pulling off the main root of a plant for

transplanting which will undoubtedly damage some of

the  roothairs. The Government's task is to  ensure

as little damage as possible when this main root is

removed.  That  is  why these radical  changes  are

necessary, however painful they may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present leadership has never faced a greater

and  more  crucial test in its fight  for  economic

survival  after  the announcements by  the  British

Government  last year that it intended to  withdraw

all  its military commitments east of Suez.  During

this short period discussions between top Singapore

Government  officers led by the Prime Minister  and

British personnel have taken place and these  talks

have not only been fruitful but have also helped to

pave the way for Singapore's accelerated role as an

industrial nation. This kind of situation calls for

prompt  and effective action. There is no time  for

us  to  brood,  but to get down to work  since  our

future is at stake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden flood of responsibilities thrust upon

us  includes that of looking for sources of revenue

in  order  to pay for the high defence expenditure.

By the end of 1971 Singapore will have its squadron

of  subsonic Hunter Mark Nines, flown  by  our  own

pilots,   now  beginning  their  initial  training.

Singapore cannot afford to carry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



passengers  and  we want our people  to  carry  and

share  this  burden equally together through  these

difficult  years.  Singapore, being  important  not

only  as  a  sea  and  air  route  because  of  its

geographic position but also as the nerve centre of

Southeast  Asia,  must  and will  exploit  all  the

resources  that  she  has  in  the  form  of  human

expertise and skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By introducing this Bill, we hope to be able to

produce  two or three times the goods and  services

we  have been producing now, and in return for  the

meaningful  sacrifice  made  by  the  workers,  the

Government expects to provide better facilities for

all. We cannot afford to allow our workers to go on

strike  to  ask  for increased wages especially  at

this  juncture, as has happened in some  countries

overseas.  The United Kingdom Government  has  lost

millions  of  dollars  as a  result  of  industrial

action during the last four months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore trust in

the  leadership of our Government. We must now make

realistic   approaches  to  ensure   the   economic

survival  of  Singapore. The introduction  of  this

Bill  is  one way of fearlessly facing  up  to  the

problems  ahead.  Let  us hope  for  the  best  but

prepare for the worst.



<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

much   has  been  said  in  this  Chamber  on  some

provisions of the Employment Bill. The Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour has  stated

that  only six per cent of the clauses in the  Bill

are  new and some of these new provisions have been

designed  to  cut  out  bonus abuses  practised  by

workers.  The  old  labour laws were  brought  into

force  about  14 years ago to stop malpractices  by

employers  and  to  prevent  the  exploitation   of

workers. But the Employment Bill does give  one  an

impression  that  what the Minister  is  trying  to

convey   is  that  one  of  the  reasons  for   the

introduction of certain restrictive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



clauses is to prevent workers and trade unions from

exploiting the employer.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> - to prevent anybody

this Chamber again to repeal the present measure to

prevent  the  exploitation of workers,  or  are  we

going  to amend the labour laws every few years  to

prevent employers or employees from exploiting each

other?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that this P.A.P. Government has got

the  interests of the workers at heart. It  assists

them  to have a fair share of their labour  and  we

also  know  that  this  Government, too,  has  the

reputation of allowing employers to have their just

due.   One   can  therefore  understand  that   the

introduction  of  these new  clauses  is  aimed  at

giving  a  boost  to  capital  investment  with   a

resultant reduction in our unemployment. Of course,

there is no doubt that this is a good intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Bill will give most citizens employment

and  in the long run the workers will be better off

and the country as a whole will have prosperity. We

all fully agree that this is what the Bill sets out

to  do.  But intentions alone are not good  enough.

They  must be translated into realities.  Does  the

Government  seriously  believe  that  some  of  the

restrictive clauses in this Bill will create a good

industrial climate? Is the Government sincerely  of

the  opinion that this Bill as it stands  now  will

achieve  its objectives? I ask, can frustrated  and

disgruntled  workers give of their  best  and  thus

increase productivity? If the answer is "No" to the

above  three questions, then I suggest to the  Hon.

Minister  for  Labour that he must be  prepared  to

concede to the amendments proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



by  some of us here. But, on the other hand, if the

Minister is of the opinion that the answers  to  my

three  questions are "Yes", then I am  prepared  to

accept this Bill in toto. This Government, I  know,

however,  is too honest to give a dishonest  reply. [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not stand here because some fringe benefits

have been taken away from the workers, but if, as a

result  of  the sacrifices made by them,  there  is

overall benefit to Singapore, then I am all for it.

Unfortunately, some of the sacrifices made  by  the

workers would only go towards enriching some of the

unenlightened  employers  who  would  invest  their

savings not in industries, but in their big  houses

and  property, thereby increasing their own  wealth

without  any direct benefit either to Singapore  or

to   the  workers.  On  the  other  hand,  if   the

Government  can assure us that savings will  accrue

as  a  result  of this Bill by lowering  production

costs  and  that the profits made will be  ploughed

back  into  industry  thereby increasing  the  work

force,  I am fully in support of the workers making

sacrifices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also obvious that one of the objectives of

this  Bill is to increase the wealth of the country

by  attracting foreign investors because  of  lower

production  costs. The Government also  hopes  that

these  foreign  investors will  plough  back  their

profits  into  industry,  thereby  increasing  work

opportunities   for   our  school-leavers.   Highly

developed countries like Russia, America,  England,

West  Germany and Japan have reached their  present

standards  because  of  the utter  exploitation  of

workers  during  the  nineteenth  century.     The

capitalists in those countries, while getting  rich

at  the  expense of the workers, did not forget  to

plough  back their profits into industry.  But  the

same  cannot  be  said here in Singapore.  Are  the

foreign  capitalists also prepared to  plough  back

some of their profits into expanding the industry

and helping us to reduce our unemployment? This  is

very doubtful. I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



mentioned   that  capitalists  in  the   nineteenth

century  exploited  the workers and  ploughed  back

their  profits into industry not because they  had

sympathy  for  labour but because of their  selfish

motive  to  make still more money.  But  this  evil

motive  did,  in fact, bring good to  the  country.

More  workers were employed and industry  expanded.

The  workers  in  these countries today  are-really

reaping the harvest made possible by the sacrifices

made  by  their  fore-fathers. Can the  Singapore

Government assure us that the employers who are now

given  advantages by the introduction of this  Bill

will do what the capitalists did in the countries I

have  mentioned, that is, plough back their profits

into  industry?  I am not asking the  investors  to

sacrifice  their profits, but I am only asking  the

employers to reinvest their money so that they  can

make  more  money and at the same time  reduce  our

unemployment figure which stands at nine  per  cent

today in the active labour market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year there are 20,000 school-leavers and in

five  years there will be 100,000 young adults  who

should  have been absorbed in industry. Our workers

are not beyond understanding of these problems. The

sacrifices  asked of them must be worth  while  and

they  will be prepared to make more sacrifices,  if

necessary, if they are assured that their  children

will   reap  the  harvest  as  a  result  of  their

sacrifices  today. If after having made  sacrifices

there is within the next five years no reduction in

our  unemployment  figure, then  the  workers, are

going  to  ask  us,  "What have  we sacrificed  our

fringe  benefits  for?"  Only  the  investors  have

become rich.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must induce confidence in the

working  class  if it wants them to  give  up  some

fringe  benefits. It can only do this by seeing  to

it  that  the  employers also play their  part  by

expanding   their  industry  and   providing   more

employment.   If   this   is   not    done,    then

disillusionment  must  set in and the  propaganda  of  the

Communists   will   provide  an   alternative   for

industrial unrest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us not forget this point. Workers alone

cannot  be held responsible for the economic  well-being  of the country. Employers, and others,  too,

must  be  called upon to play their  role  and,  if

necessary,  the  Government should  enact  laws  to

compel  investors  to plough  back  some  of  their

profits  into industry annually. If this is  not done,  then  what  will happen is  that  while  the

workers  have sacrificed fringe benefits, investors

make  more  money and unemployment  increases.  The

Communists  will be able to exploit  the  situation

and we will all be in trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on some

of  the clauses here. What I cannot understand  are

the precise reasons for the introduction of some of

the new provisions in the Bill. Let us consider  at

this  stage  the  exact nature of the  new  clauses

introduced, such as clause 15, which seeks  to  fix

the age of retirement for all and sundry at

55.  The Hon. Minister in his policy speech did not

adduce  one  single reason why this should  be  so.

What is it that the Government hopes to achieve for

the  country through the introduction of clause 15?

What medical evidence, if any, has the Minister  to

be  so  categorical that a person should retire  at

the  age of 55 as opposed to any other age? As  for

the  ill effects of the clause on all concerned,  I

think enough has been said by my colleagues. I need

not elaborate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I wish to draw the Minister's attention to

clause  42  - for all this, of course, the  present

Minister for Labour is not responsible; the  former

Minister for Labour is responsible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is collective

responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes. We too were responsible to

some  extent!  Now  I wish to touch  on  clause  43

(annual leave) and clause 44 (sick leave). The Bill

purports  to  standardise annual heave  at  a  flat

seven days and 14 days irrespective of the type  of

job  a  man  does. I am all for standardisation  of

benefits  as  between industrial and non-industrial

workers. But why has the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



Minister  not  taken  into account  the  prevailing

practice in the public and private sectors  whereby

the  employers, of their own volition, grant  leave

up  to a maximum of 21 days - and even 21 days  for

the  industrial workers? In the first  place,  have

the  civil  servants  in  the  Ministry  of  Labour

compiled  statistics on this matter? I  am  certain

that  they  have not done so. On what research  has

the  Minister based seven days' and 14 days'  leave

provision  other than on the demand of a few  local

employers?   Can  he  prove  to  this  House   that

irrespective  of the nature of the work  a  man  is

engaged  in,  14 days' annual leave  is  absolutely

sufficient  for a worker at the age  of  50  or  50

plus?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, on the sick leave provision, where

are  the Minister's facts and figures to show abuse

amongst  employees  in  the  private  sector?   For

instance,   I   myself  work  for  a  big   private

enterprise and my employers have never had occasion

to  complain  to me or against me as a trade  union

president that my colleagues who work with me  take

excessive   medical  leave   or   that   they   are

malingerers.  How many complaints has his  Ministry

received  from  private sector  employers  to  this

effect?  If so, who are the employers? What  is  so

magical  about  the  14 days' intermittent  medical

leave?  Presumably the Minister  has  taken  advice

from  medical experts on averages. If so, would  he

care  to  reveal the details of any such study?  As

for  the arbitrary figure of 28 days' leave  for  hospitalisation, I need only say this.  Even  the

doctors in the hospitals are clearly shocked.  They

say. "What rubbish is this 28 days!" This provision

lacks  not only research on the matter but shows  a

complete absence of common sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my other trade union colleagues

have  said, "We are prepared to make the  necessary

sacrifices,  but not without assessing the  precise

nature  of  the  sacrifices we are called  upon  to

make."  If  I  am  asked to make  sacrifices,  like

returning to work half-way through sickness or from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



treatment  in the hospital, at least I am  entitled

to question the wisdom of such a demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 47 is the controversial bonus clause

removing bonus payments to workers. I need not have

to  elaborate much on this. The other day  I  asked

the Ministry of Labour if it could give me any good

reason  for the Government's interfering with  free

negotiation on bonuses between trade unions and the

management.  There  seemed to  be  no  satisfactory

answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this Chamber have to take full

responsibility for any repercussions that may arise

as  a result of this Employment Bill. Let us not be

hasty about passing it; otherwise it will be a case

of  acting in haste and repenting at leisure. I ask

the  Minister to consider seriously the  amendments

that will be moved by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee.

These  amendments have been tabled not so  much  to

increase benefits for the workers as in the sincere

belief  that  they will remove any discontent  from

the  minds and hearts of the workers and they  will

rise  to  the occasion and give of their utmost  in

the  interest  not  only of  themselves  and  their

children but of the nation as a whole.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, what is really striking in the discussion that

has  taken  place on this Bill up till now  is  the

remarkable  degree of sobriety with which  we  have

discussed it. Perhaps this is due to the increasing

awareness that politics in Singapore now is  not  a

venture  in recklessness but that it is the science

of the possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present historical context, I believe there

are two main factors which have conspired with each

other  to  make  the  introduction  of  this   Bill

inevitable.  The  first is the increasing  need  to

build  up a completely rationalised economic system

that  would  in toto, not merely in its  parts,  be

able to compete with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



the  economies of countries such as. Hong Kong  and

Japan   who   are   our   main   competitors    for

international markets. This first factor is  merely

the function of the second one which is the need to

convert our society into art industrial society  as

swiftly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few specifics when one talks about the

industrial  society which needs to be created.  All

over  the  developing  world,  the  under-developed

world  or  the  backward  world,  the  ambition  of

governments is to create as quickly as possible  an

industrial  society  with  a  manufacturing   base.

Although it is difficult to define clearly what  is

meant  by an industrial society, there are a number

of attributes that can be pinpointed. Primarily, it

is the application of a scientific mentality to the

production   process.  Secondly,  to   change   the

psychology  of  the  human beings,  especially  the

workers, who participate in the industrial process.

In  other  words,  to convert the individual  digit

that  works  in the factory itself, to  change  its

attitude  towards work and play, and to change  its

attitude  towards tools, which means that  we  have

got  to  create the scientific capability. We  will

have  to create a manufacturing capacity which will

build the tools which will set up the factories and

produce the machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which industrialisation in a

country  can  be induced. One is indigenously  from

the inside which is the method that has obtained in

the  Western countries and possibly Japan, and  the

other  one is to induce industrialisation from  the

outside,  from  impulses from  developed  countries

into  the  developing country,  which  is  what  is

happening   all   over   the   world   today.   We,

unfortunately,  because  of  our  serious  physical

limitations and our lack of scientific capabilities

for    the    purpose    of    inducing    internal

industrialisation, belong to the  second  category.

And   a   price  has  got  to  be  paid  for  this.

Unfortunately, the price that we have  got  to  pay

today  is  this  Bill.  It may  not  be  completely

humanistic  in terms of the minimum standards  that

obtain in advanced countries, but at least, as  has

been pointed out by a number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



speakers,  it  is  humanistic in relation  to  what

obtains in surrounding countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factors that really stand in the way of the

conversion into an industrial society are manifold,

especially in developing countries. The first  one,

of  course, is a backward leadership that does  not

understand  modernism. Secondly, the  allowance  in

the  political process of the emergence  of  ghosts

from   the   past.   In  other  words,   linguistic

chauvinism  in  a  multi-racial  society,  communal

clashes and the lack of ability on the part of  the

political  leadership  to  organise  scientifically

their  policies in such a way as to  mute  whatever

conflicts and contradictions there might be between

communities and languages. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



worse   still   is  corruption  in   high   places,

especially among the political leadership and among

the  Ministers  and  others who  go  into  politics

because they feel it is a very attractive business.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Selvadurai, it is now 5.45

p.m. Will it be convenient for you to stop now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In accordance with the resolution

made earlier, the House will now adjourn.
