<div align="center"><b>CITIZENSHIP</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Applications from non-citizen members of family)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs and Minister for  Labour  whether

the Government will give sympathetic consideration

to   an   application  for  citizenship  from   an

applicant  who  is the sole remaining  non-citizen

member of his family.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the general policy on

citizenship was enunciated by the Minister in this

House  on  the  21st  of May, 1968.  However,  the

Government   is   prepared  to  give   sympathetic

consideration  to such applications  provided  the

applicants  satisfy the provisions of  Article  57

(1) of the Singapore Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, at present, the Government is

very strict as regards the approval of citizenship

applications.  Normally,  an  applicant  who   can

fulfil  residential  and other  qualifications  is

granted  citizenship. But now the Government  will

have   to   consider  whether  he  is  likely   to

contribute economically to the state and,  because

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



this, it is very difficult to have applications for

citizenship  approved.  I would  like  to  ask  the

Parliamentary Secretary --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ch'ng, are you going to ask a supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, Sir. Can the Parliamentary Secretary say

whether  Government's policy  on  applications  for

citizenship will be revised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have indicated just now that

sympathetic   consideration  will   be   given   to

applications  for citizenship. But as  far  as  the

policy is concerned, it is constantly under review.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are aware of Government's

difficulty on the issue of citizenship certificates

to applicants at this particular time. But, all the

same,  as  there  are many applicants  waiting  for

citizenship,  can the Parliamentary  Secretary  say

whether  Government will issue a statement  to  the

effect  that  for a period of, say, so many  years,

there   is   no  need  for  people  to  apply   for

citizenship  as we will not be able  to  give  them

citizenship,  so  that they need  not  waste  their

time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I do not think that would be practical. For

example,  people who apply for citizenship  at  the

present   time   do  not  get  their   applications

approved. But if they had applied, say, five  years

ago,  their applications would have been  approved.

Therefore, it is almost impossible to lay down such

a policy as indicated by the Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, can the Government say what sympathetic

grounds   are  required  so  that  applicants   for

citizenship can prepare to meet these requirements?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, there are many different shades of people

and   character  in  this  world.  It   is   almost

impossible to lay down anything definite. Just look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



at  the Gentlemen across the Floor. Each Member has

a  different  background and each has  a  different

face. So how are we going to lay down the rules  as

to whom we will give sympathetic consideration?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, is it to be understood that the Government

does  not  know  what  type  of  hardship  can   be

considered   as  genuine  grounds  for  sympathetic

consideration?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can only say that each case

will have to be considered on its own merits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary

say   whether   Government  will  give  sympathetic

consideration to applicants whose parents, brothers

and  sisters are all Singapore citizens?  There  is

one  case  where,  because the applicant  was  born

during the Japanese occupation, he is unable to get

his citizenship papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point relates to applicants who were told

in  1964  not  to  apply  for  citizenship  by  the

authorities concerned when we were in Malaysia. Now

that  they  want  to  apply for  citizenship,  they

cannot  get  their applications approved.  Can  the

Parliamentary     Secretary    give     sympathetic

consideration to these cases?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first question of the Member

for   Paya  Lebar  was  asked  by  the  Member  for

Mountbatten, and I have already answered it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second question, I do not think

there  is any proof that individuals were  told  in

1964  not to apply. Even if that were so, the  case

will still have to be considered on its own merits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister enunicated the

policy on citizenship on 21st May. 1968. It is  now

nearly  two  years  and things  in  Singapore  have

improved a lot. In view of the rapid growth of  the

economy of Singapore, does the Government not think

that  it  is  now the opportune time to review  the

policy on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



citizenship  so that more people can be  productive

and  help  to  contribute  to  the  prosperity   of

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, as I said just now, the policy on citizenship

is always under constant review.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of citizenship,

I feel that the Government's policy is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee, are you asking a supplementary

question or are you embarking on a debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I meant to say was that the Government

should revise its policy on citizenship and certain

officials should be appointed for this task. I know

of   certain  applicants  who  should  qualify  for

citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee, can you please ask a supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I want to ask a supplementary question and

also give my comments on the Government's policy on

citizenship.  The policy should be  reviewed,  and,

where   possible,  citizenship  should  be  granted

straightaway  without  the  Criminal  Investigation

Department investigating to see how many wives  an

applicant has and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the Member is not

asking  a supplementary question at all. He is,  in

fact, giving a speech.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, will you please ask your supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I was asking is an indirect question. Is

it  true that applicants with more than one wife do

not qualify for citizenship?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I really do not know what the Member wants. If he

says  that we should give citizenship to a man with

many  wives, I do not think that is relevant.  That

could be a disqualification. As I said, we have  to

look into every aspect of the individual.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, does the Parliamentary Secretary mean that a

person  with many wives is not qualified  to  be  a

citizen?  As  we are not debating this question,  I

suggest  that the policy on citizenship  should  be

reviewed.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during my meet-the-people

sessions, I receive many cases of applications  for

citizenship  made years ago. They were informed  by

letter that their applications had been refused and

were   told   to  reapply  again.  But  when   they

reapplied,  the  Registry of  Citizenship  did  not

accept  their  applications. Can the  Parliamentary

Secretary explain why their applications  were  not

accepted when they had been told to reapply again?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, the circumstances of an individual change

all the time. Several years ago, a person might not

qualify for citizenship. If he were to reapply now,

the circumstances might be different. He may now be

a    millionaire   or   a   manufacturer   or    an

industrialist. So the circumstances are  different.

Therefore, when we ask an applicant to reapply,  it

means  that we will reassess his present  situation

to see whether he qualifies for citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, that being the case, then those who apply for

citizenship  will  be  refused  until  they  become

millionaires.  I do not think that  is  the  proper

answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> What I actually meant was that this applies to a

person  who can really make a definite contribution

to  the  country. This is the policy enunciated  by

the Minister in May 1968.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary said

that when a person has made no contribution to  the

state, he will not get his citizenship papers.  But

labour  has contributed much to Singapore.  So  how

can  he  say  that  a labourer  has  not  made  any

contribution?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I did not say that a labourer does not qualify for

citizenship at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> That particular point, I think, has caused a bit of

inconvenience. I am just wondering whether it would

not  be  best,  when  sending out  this  letter  of

refusal,   to   indicate  that  if   the   personal

circumstances of the applicant have changed, he may

reapply.  If  there have been no  changes,  he  may

forget about reapplication. That will save a bit of

inconvenience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, that again is not practical, because, as I

indicated  earlier, the policy  is  under  constant

review.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I would like to ask this question. If the

applicant  reapplies,  will the  Government  ensure

that he will get his citizenship?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> No, Sir, but consideration will be given to such

an application.

<div align="center"><b>(Mailing to Singapore students abroad)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  and Minister for  Labour  whether

official   publications   and   other   informative

materials  such  as "The Mirror", etc, are  being

mailed  regularly to our students abroad  from  the

Republic's  missions overseas, so as to  keep  them

informed of current affairs in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our students abroad are

normally  kept informed of current developments  in

the    Republic   through   official   publications

distributed  by our overseas missions. In  addition

to the Mirror, there is also the publication called

Berita  Pelajar,  published by the  Public  Service

Commission. A number of our overseas missions  also

publish   the   Singapore   Newsletter   which   is

distributed   among   students   as   well.    Such

publications are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



sent  sometimes on request by individual  students,

or  to  student organisations or groups  who  share

them.  Besides  these publications, some  Singapore

daily newspapers are available in the missions  for

students  to  read. It may well  be  that  official

publications do not reach all students,  but  where

requests  are  made  by individuals  or  groups  of

students,  every  effort  is  made  to  meet  their

requirements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister of State for

Foreign  Affairs be able to indicate the number  of

copies of such publications that are mailed to  our

overseas missions?



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, as the Member for Punggol has

asked  for  this information, he will get  it.  The

number  of  copies  of  the Mirror  distributed  to

students  in  Australia is 180. This  distribution

started  in  1969,  and copies of  the  Mirror  are

distributed by the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the alphabetical order of distribution, in

Cambodia,  as no students are registered  with  our

Embassy  there, we do not send any  copies  of  the

Mirror.  In  Canada, 89 copies. In  Hong  Kong,  no

students   are   registered  with   the   Singapore

Commission there, so we do not send them  any.  In

India, 12 copies of the Mirror are distributed, and

these copies are shared among the students, as  the

mailing  list  of  200  has to  include  Government

offices  in  India  and  diplomatic  missions.   In

Indonesia, no copies are distributed, although  11

students  in Soerabaya and Jogjakarta have recently

registered with the Singapore Embassy and they will

be receiving the Mirror in due course. In Japan, 51

copies  of  the  Mirror are sent  directly  by  the

it.

to  a  straightforward question. It could have been

before or after 1969.

attending a school for a few years are required  to

produce   documents  such  as  birth  certificates,

parents'    identity    cards    and    citizenship

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am asked by my Minister to

reply.  This  Ministry has always been  aware  that

parents   are   greatly  inconvenienced   and   are

concerned  whenever their children are required  to

produce  important  documents for  verification  by

schools.  There  is no ruling that  such  documents

have to be produced annually for inspection. On the

contrary,  schools have been repeatedly advised  by

circular  to  refrain  from asking  for  documents,

except  in the case of new admissions or where  the

pupil's eligibility for remission of school fees is

in  doubt.  Even then, only the minimum  number  of

documents  will  be called for and the  reason  for

doing so is explained to the parents concerned.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister consider

changing  this system and, instead, issue forms  to

the  parents  of the students so that the  required

particulars  can  be filled in by them?  This  will

ensure that the documents are not lost.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Even if forms are distributed to parents for

entry,  they  have to be verified  by  the  schools

concerned.  Therefore, the  documents  have  to  be

required by the school principals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether he will consider the conducting

of pre-university classes in any one of the three

secondary schools in the Sembawang and Nee Soon

Constituencies for students residing in those

Constituencies who have completed their secondary

education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Sir, our policy is to centralise Pre-University

education  as far as possible so that  our  limited

resources of specialist teachers, teaching aids and

other   facilities  may  be  used  to  the  maximum

advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Pre-University education is available

in the National Junior College and in 44 Government

and Government-Aided secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three secondary schools in the Sembawang and

Nee Soon Constituencies had a combined enrolment of 834  Secondary Four students in 1969, of whom about

100  are expected to qualify for admission to  Pre-University classes in 1970. In view of the need  to

distribute them according to language media and  in

Arts  and  Science  courses, four Pre-University  I

classes  would  have to be formed  for  this  small

number  of  students, each class having an  average

enrolment of only about 20 students. This is not an

economically-sized  class  to  run,  and  there  is

therefore  no  case for setting up a Pre-University

centre  within the two constituencies. All the  100

students  will  be  found places in  Pre-University

classes as close to their homes as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the reply given by

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Education,  it  is not possible to set  up  a  Pre-University  class  in  the  two  constituencies  in

question because of the small number of students. I

hope  that  in future when the number  of  students

increases, the Parliamentary Secretary

will  reconsider the question of setting,  up  Pre-University classes.

Education   (a)  when  his  Ministry  decided   to

introduce Extra-Curricular Activities Record  Cards

for  students in secondary schools, and  what is

the  cost  involved  in some  of  the  schools  for

printing  those cards; (b) whether any officer  or

work out the details for the implementation of such

a  scheme; and, if not, what arrangements have been

made  to  ensure the uniformity in the  maintenance

of  such records in every secondary school;  (c)

why  his  Ministry considers it not necessary  to

issue a circular when introducing such an important

scheme;  and  (d) what steps have  been  taken  to

rectify  the confusion that has been created  among

the principals and staffs of secondary schools  by

conflicting   telephone   instructions    on    the

introduction   and   subsequent  cancellation   and

reintroduction of such scheme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education):</b> Sir, it is regretted that a certain amount of

confusion   arose   over  the   introduction   and

subsequent suspension of the use of cards  to  mark

the   attendance   of  pupils  at  extra-curricular

activities. The original intention was to introduce

a  system of recording attendance without involving

expenditure  for a trial period,  at  the  end  of

which   a   decision  would  be  taken  whether   a

standardised  printed  card should  be  introduced.

Only then would a circular on the subject be issued

to  schools.  Unfortunately, owing to the  lack  of

precise instructions, there was confusion over  the

conduct of the experiment and.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



a telephone message had to be relayed to schools to

suspend  the trial use of attendance cards  pending

further instructions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Physical Education Advisory Committee of my

Ministry  is  currently studying  the  problem  and

reviewing  the whole scheme of awarding  marks  for

extra-curricular  activities.  The  revised  scheme

will  ensure that, whilst pupils are encouraged  to

participate   in   a  variety  of  extra-curricular

activities, there is no excessive participation  at

the  expense  of  their  academic  achievement  and

progress.  Marks will be awarded fairly to  reflect

the   effort  put  in  and  the  quality   of   the

performance.  Such marks will be  recorded  in  the

report  books  of  the pupils  and  converted  into

grades.   The  final  grades  obtained  in   extra-curricular activities in Secondary Four can be used

in  place  of  the grades obtained in  an  academic

subject  in the School Certificate Examination  for

purposes   of  applying  for  admission   to   Pre-University classes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

is  being  taken against unscrupulous  vendors  who

have unreasonably raised the price of crash helmets

since  the  introduction of legislation  making  it

compulsory for the holder of a provisional  licence

to wear a crash helmet while driving a motorcycle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no intention on the

part of my Ministry to control either the import or

sale  price of crash helmets at present,  as  there

are  more than adequate stocks in Singapore to meet

the  known  demands. We will let the law of  supply

and demand take its natural course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Institute of Standards and

Industrial   Research   (SISIR),   which   is   the

responsible  authority  for testing  and  approving

crash   helmets,  have  sample-tested  consignments

totalling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



30,000  crash  helmets over the last l½  years,  and

26,841  or 90 per cent have been approved for  sale

in  Singapore.  Whilst  the number  of  provisional

licence  holders of motor cycles and motor scooters

who  are  required by law to wear crash helmets  as

from  the  1st  of last month is only  14,000,  the

number  of  new  applications for such  provisional

licences is estimated at around 1,000 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to point out that the necessity

to  get  SISIR's approval before crash helmets  are

permitted to be put on sale in Singapore adds  only

an  average  of 60 cents to the imported  cost  per

helmet. If the consignments are larger, the cost of

sampling-tests would go down even lower.

Singapore citizens, and/or change its name if it is

the   same  as  that  of  an  organisation  outside

Singapore, and/or change its symbol if  it  is  the

hospitals to ensure that the next-of-kin can claim

a  corpse  from a hospital mortuary  in  the  most

satisfactory  manner; and (c) if  he  will  ensure

that the Police will contact and inform the family

of  a  deceased  person  without  fail  where  the

identity of that person has been established.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the first part of

the  question,  I  will say that where  there  are

means  of  identification of the body, the  Police

will  then  immediately inform the next-of-kin  of

the  deceased.  If no means of identification  are

available,  then  the  list  of  persons  reported

missing  is  checked while, at the same  time,  an

appeal is made through the press for assistance in

identification from members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the identity of the dead person cannot be

established after a lapse of four days,  the  body

is  disposed  of  by  the Government.  Particulars

relating  to the dead body, however, are kept  for

purposes of record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is constant liaison

between  the hospital authorities and  the  Police

through the Police post at the Outram Road General

Hospital.  The  Police post receives  as  well  as

disseminates information regarding sudden  deaths,

or  deaths brought about by violence, or deaths in

which  the  cause is unknown. After investigation,

the Police will contact and inform the next-of-kin

of the deceased. In certain instances the body may

be  removed  from the mortuary after the  identity

has been established before the Coroner and/or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



after  an  autopsy  has been performed.  Where  the

identity  of  the dead person has been established,

the  Police  will  always contact  and  inform  the

family of the deceased person. Where a person  dies

in   hospital  as  a  result  of  illness  and  the

relatives   of   the  deceased  are   not   readily

available,  it  has also been the practice  of  the

Police to assist in contacting the relatives of the

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE NEW YEAR FIRES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Casualties)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Social Affairs how many people died as a result of

fires  during the Chinese New Year up to Chap  Goh

Meh; whether there were delays by the Fire Brigade

in  dealing with the fires, and whether  any  such

delays led to the casualties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by the

Minister to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No persons were killed as a result of fires

during the Chinese New Year up to Chap Goh Meh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there were six deaths caused as a

result   of   injuries   suffered   from   cracker

explosions on three separate cracker incidents  on

20th February, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first incident, two persons died as a

result  of  a cracker incident at 11-A,  MacKenzie

Road.  There was no fire in this incident and  the

Fire Brigade was not called.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second incident, three persons died as a

result   of   injuries   suffered   from   cracker

explosions  at 290-P, Joo Chiat Road. The  cracker

explosions, besides fatally injuring three people,

started  a small fire in a bedroom which  was  put

out  by  the occupants before the arrival  of  the

Fire  Brigade. There was no delay on the  part  of

the Fire Brigade in responding to the call.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third incident one person died as a

result  of  a fire cracker incident at  8G,  Block

105, Gagak Selari Barat. There was no fire and the

Fire Brigade was not called.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six deaths were caused by cracker explosions

and  there is no question of any delay by the Fire

Brigade causing the casualties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Brigade and the Police are working out

regulations to prevent any repetition  of  such  a

disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, all firing of crackers is

prohibited,  unless permits from the  Police  have

been  obtained.  Permits will be granted  only  on

very  special  private occasions. For  traditional

festive occasions, like Chinese New Year's Eve and

Chap Goh Meh, each constituency will have a number

of  open  spaces, designated by the Police,  where

firing will be allowed between specified hours but

only   by  adults.  These  open  places  will   be

determined    after    consultation    with    the

constituency's  Citizens'  Consultative  Committee

and   management  committees  of   the   community

centres. Fire and other safety precautions will be

taken  at  these designated places  to  deal  with

accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality control of crackers locally manufactured

and imported is also being looked into.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development if he will ascertain from

the  Public  Utilities Board whether  difficulties

have   been  encountered  in  getting  landowners'

permission for the running of overhead cables  and

water-mains across their lands in order that rural

folks can enjoy electricity and water supply;  how

many land-owners have objected and refused to  co-operate;  whether steps are being taken to  ensure

that  such  schemes  will be successfully  carried

out;   and   whether  he  proposes  to   introduce

legislation   to   amend  the   Public   Utilities

Ordinance  to  enable  the Board  to  successfully

carry  out its tasks without encountering  similar

difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Utilities Board has

encountered   some   difficulties   in   obtaining

permission from land-owners to lay cables  or  run

overhead lines



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



across  their lands in connection with the  schemes

to provide utility supplies in the rural areas. But

such  difficulties  have  not  been  found  to   be

insurmountable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been three cases so far in respect of

electricity supplies where persuasion by the Public

Utilities  Board,  the  Urban  and  Rural  Services

Committee  and the Citizens' Consultative Committee

have   failed   to  induce  landowners   to   grant

permission, and the Public Utilities Board has  had

to invoke its powers under the relevant sections of

the  Public Utilities Ordinance. 1963. In  all  the

three cases, work has been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cases have arisen so far in connection with

water  supplies. It is, therefore,  unnecessary  to

amend  the Ordinance to enhance the powers  of  the

Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Will the Minister enlighten the House further by

elaborating  on  the three cases he  has  mentioned

just now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the first case was in 1967 in Changi, where

a  scheme to get electricity supply to a kampong at

Siak Kuan Road, off the 9th milestone, Changi Road,

was   approved   under  stage  6   of   the   rural

electrification programme. However, as a result  of

the  landowner's objection, section 15 (2)  (a)  of

the  Public Utilities Ordinance, 1963,  had  to  be

invoked before the scheme was implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case was when a landowner at Jalan

Payoh  Lai objected to overhead mains being  strung

within  his  property.  A  notice  under  the  same

section  of  the Ordinance was subsequently  issued

and work was completed in December last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third case, a land-owner of a coconut

plantation,  off  Holy Innocents Lane  in  Punggol,

refused to give permission for the installation  of

overhead lines but agreed to the laying of under-ground



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



cables. The matter was reported to the Urban

and  Rural  Services Committee  and  the  Citizens'

Consultative Committee, Punggol, to use their  good

offices  to  secure  the  necessary  way-leave  but

without any success. A notice was therefore  issued

under  the relevant section and work has  now  been

completed.

From  information gathered, the two islands  appear

to  be suitable for agricultural purposes. However,

because of the need to provide infrastructure, such

as  roads,  electricity and water,  which  requires

considerable  expenditure of public  funds,  it  is

necessary to give more careful consideration to the

proposal   to   develop  these  two   islands   for

agricultural purposes. Furthermore, large parts  of

these  two islands are in private ownership.  These

aspects  are  being  carefully  studied  before   a

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



That  Parliament approves the financial  policy  of

the  Government for the financial year  1st  April,

1970 to 31st March, 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the first Budget Statement of the new

decade, it seems appropriate on this occasion to do

a  review  of our economic performance  during  the

past  decade. This was the decade which the  United

Nations christened "The Decade of Development". For

us  in  Singapore, it was a turbulent decade during

which   momentous  changes  took  place.  Singapore

entered  the 1960s as a British colony  with  self-governing  powers  in domestic  affairs.  We  later

achieved   independence  as  part  of   independent

Malaysia,  only to be expelled from the  Federation

after   two   years.  On  August  9th,  1965,   the

independent Republic of Singapore was created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to confine my review of the decade to

Singapore's economic performance. I was engaged for

most  of the decade in a Ministry which was charged

with  the  responsibility for economic  development

and  planning  in Singapore. It is  not  altogether

possible for me to escape bias, either in treatment

or  emphasis,  in  this account of  the  Republic's

economic  growth.  No  doubt some  future  economic

historian  will  cover  the same  ground  and  will

probably see events in a somewhat different  light.

He  will  also  treat the subject more exhaustively

than is possible in a Budget address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to conduct this review of Singapore's

economic development in the 1960s in two ways.  The

first  is  to compare the positions as in 1959  and

1969, taking two snapshot pictures, so to speak, of

the main economic terrain. Secondly, I will try  to

trace developments through the different phases  of

the   decade,   in   a  kind  of   motion   picture

presentation, if I may be permitted to  extend  the

analogy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the snapshot pictures. Singapore's Gross

Domestic  Product in 1959 was $1,968  million.  The

Gross  Domestic Product is the value of  goods  and

services produced within the geographical  area  of

the  Republic. They include the value of foodstuffs

produced  by  our  farmers,  the  earnings  of  our

traders  and shipowners on the entrepot trade,  the

value   added  in  Singapore  in  the   course   of

manufacturing  operations, the earnings  of  retail

trade, the hotel business, and other services,  the

value   of   services  provided  by  the  Singapore

Government, British military expenditure,  and  the

value   of  construction  of  new  roads,   houses,

factories,  power-stations and  so  on.  The  Gross

Domestic Product is a close relative of the G.N.P.,

or Gross National Product, and differs from it only

in  that  the G.N.P, includes earnings of Singapore

citizens   from  overseas  sources   and   excludes

earnings  in  Singapore  accruing  to  persons  and

corporations abroad. In this account, I  shall  use

the  Gross  Domestic Product rather than the  Gross

National Product since calculation of the latter is

subject to greater uncertainty and error.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1969, the G.D.P. had increased from $1,968.

million  by  nearly 2½ times to $4,833  million.

This represents a compound growth rate through  the

decade  of  9.4 per cent a year. We have  therefore

surpassed the United Nations target for the  Decade

of  Development of 5 per cent annual growth. At the

same  time, our performance was well below that  of

some  other economies such as those of Japan, South

Korea in recent years, and Hong Kong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubling of the G.D.P. during the l960s was

not  due  to  discoveries of natural  resources  as

these  are  virtually absent. It was the result  of

the  growth  of  trade, on the one  hand,  and  the

growth  of  industry,  on the other,  with  tourist

development   providing   a   small   but   welcome

increment.  In  other words,  it  was  largely  the

result  of  greater human effort.  Associated  with

growth of the G.D.P. has been a much faster rate of

capital  investment in the Republic. The accounting

aggregate representing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



capital   investment  -  Gross   Domestic   Capital

Formation   in   the  terminology  recommended   by

statisticians of the United Nations increased  from

$150 million in 1959 to $919 million in 1969. Total

investment increased at more than twice the rate of

increase of the domestic product, a compound annual

rate  of 19.8 per cent during the decade. In  1959,

total  investment amounted to 7.6 per cent  of  the

G.D.P. and  this increased to 19.0  per  cent  ten

years  later. Ploughing back an increasing part  of

our  domestic  output is essential to  sustain  our

growth  momentum and we should continue to increase

this  percentage. We are still a  long  way  behind

Japan  which invests more than 30 per cent  of  its

income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since much of investment was in industrial

machinery   and   equipment,   industrial    output

naturally  expanded. Industrial output is sometimes

defined   as   the  output  of  the  manufacturing,

construction and utilities sectors. Their  combined

output  increased, as one would expect, at a faster

rate  than  the G.D.P. The compound rate of  growth

for  1959-1969 was 16.2 per cent as against 9.4 per

cent,    the   overall   economic   growth    rate.

Manufacturing industries grew at 17.1  per  cent  a

year,  construction  at 17.9 per  cent  and  public

utilities  at  10.2 per cent. In value  terms,  the

industrial sector's contribution to the G.D.P. rose

from  $256  million  in 1959 to $1,154  million  in

1969.  Employment  in the manufacturing  sector  as

determined  in  the annual census  of  manufactures

covering  establishments employing ten  workers  or

more,  increased  from 25,199 to 87,128.  Of  these

latter,  no  less  than  35,000  were  employed  in

pioneer  industries in 1969. There were, of course,

no pioneer industries in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepot trade also seems to have flourished

during  the  decade though, as we shall see  later,

there  were  many  ups  and  downs.  There  was  an

increase  in  total cargo handled at  the  Port  of

Singapore from 14.2 million freight tons in 1959 to

37.7 million freight tons in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



1969.  The number of ships increased from 9,584  to

16,531. Passenger arrivals at the beginning of  the

decade  totalled  a mere 163,000 and  increased  to

546,000. Economic growth of these proportions  must

naturally  be reflected in the financial  structure

of  the Republic. There was a substantial expansion

during  the decade in the commercial bank deposits,

from  $816 million to no less than $2,745  million.

The Central Provident Fund balances standing to the

credit  of  members increased from $120 million  to

$632  million.  Government revenue  benefited  from

expansion,  increasing in a decade  from  a  paltry

$275 million to $934 million. Despite expansion  of

output,  volume  of trade and total investment,  as

well as money supply, there was a marked absence of

inflationary pressure. The consumer price index  as

at  mid-1969 stood at 110.9 with mid-1960 providing

the  base-mark of 100.0. In a world where inflation

plagues  many  countries, both rich  and  poor,  an

average annual increase of one per cent in consumer

prices over a decade is not a common experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth has had beneficial effects on

social  conditions. One of the results of  improved

standards of living has been a substantial  decline

in   the   rate  of  population  growth.  Infantile

mortality rates also declined. School enrolment and

expenditure  on  education increased substantially.

Newspaper circulation nearly trebled. Housing Board

flats and shops increased from - 23,019 to 106,418.

Happily,   increase  in  crime  and   violence,   a

contemporary phenomenon in many cities in both  the

developed  and  under-developed  world,   did   not

afflict  us. Armed robbery and housebreaking  cases

numbered  3,125  in 1959 compared  with  a  reduced

figure of 2,010 in 1969.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of things, statistical information,

which  deals  with  social and  economic  phenomena

susceptible  to  enumeration, does not  and  cannot

describe    the   qualitative   and   non-numerical

improvements that have taken place in our  society.

There  is  greater  social  cohesion,  more  social

discipline  and self-reliance, pride in performance

and achievement in the face of adversity. These are

the  intangible yet supremely important factors for

progress  of any society. By our common  endeavours

and  achievements,  we  are  slowly  acquiring   an

identity of purpose and in this way building  up  a

sense  of  belonging and nationhood. The  rootless,

migrant  and parvenu values, where each is out  for

himself, attitudes so prevalent at the beginning of

the  last  decade, are giving way to more  positive

group  values of a self-reliant people,  determined

to  build an enduring future for themselves in this

part of the world. In the final analysis, it is  on

the  firm framework of these values rather than  on

steel   and   concrete  structures  that   economic

progress is to be achieved and sustained. Max Weber

was  the  first, but he will not be  the  last,  to

detect   in   particular   societies   the    close

interaction   between  ethical  systems   and   the

modernising   processes  which   enables   economic

transformation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now trace in outline the development of

the economy during the decade. Singapore's economic

development  can be conveniently grouped  in  three

periods - pre-Malaysia, during Malaysia, and  post-Malaysia.   Since   the  most   relevant   economic

statistics  are  given in terms of calendar  years,

the    three   phases   of   Singapore's   economic

development may be considered in the calendar  year

periods as follows:

<pre>

                     (i) 1959-63

                    (ii) 1964-65

                   (iii) 1966-69

</pre>



<br>It  should  be  remembered, however, that  economic

trends  sometimes  transcend two or  more  periods.

This    results   from   anticipation   of   future

development, as for instance, in the years 1962  to

1963,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



when  several industrial projects were  started  in

Singapore  in  anticipation of a Common  Market  in

Malaysia. Further, the lead time needed  to  see  a

project  off the ground - the interval between  the

moment  a  decision is taken and the completion  of

the  project - often occupies a period  of  several

years for large scale projects.



<br><br><i>Economic Development, 1959-63</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-Malaysia period was dominated by

political  events. Several of the  more  discerning

observers  knew  in 1959 when the general  election

was  won  by the People's Action Party that  behind

the    anti-colonial   solidarity,   was   a   deep

ideological division between a Democratic Socialist

faction  and  a  pro-Communist faction.  It  was  a

matter of time before the two groups were forced to

bring  their  differences into  the  open  as  they

contended  for political supremacy. The  policy  of

the   Government,  which  consisted  of  democratic

socialists, was determined at that time more by the

immediate  political necessities than by  long-term

needs  of  economic development. The pro-Communists

broke  off  from the P.A.P. and their United  Front

forces  fought the P.A.P. in the Anson  by-election

in   July  of  1961.  They  joined  issue  on   the

Government's  policy  to negotiate  a  merger  with

Malaya  to  form  Malaysia. All  this  is  familiar

history.  But  events  of  such  traumatic   impact

inevitably  leave their mark on the economy,  as  I

shall shortly demonstrate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, despite the political preoccupation of

the  Government, the Economic Development Board was

established in August 1961. It was charged with the

duty  of  promoting  the growth  of  industries  in

Singapore.  At the same time, the former  Singapore

Improvement Trust was absorbed in a more  effective

agency  named  the  Housing and Development  Board.

While the creation of new industries, by its nature

requiring a substantial lead time, could  not  show

quick  results, Government action in improving  the

social   services  produced  swift   and   tangible

benefits in the pre-Malaysia period.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate action was taken to extend and improve

the  education  system. School  enrolment  both  at

primary  and  secondary stages  increased  rapidly.

Primary school enrolment increased from 266,625  to

336,163  between  1959 and 1963;  secondary  school

enrolment increased from 48,723 to 84,425.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board suffered some

initial   troubles  under  the  former   mayor   of

Singapore.  After his replacement, the  Board  soon

got  into stride and showed dramatic progress.  The

number  of flats and shops built each year  was  as

follows:

<pre>

                    1959 --  1,611

                    1960 --  1,682

                    1961 --  7,320

                    1962 -- 12,230

                    1963 -- 10,085

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because industries took a long time in getting

started  and because there was little expansion  in

entrepot  trade earnings during this period  -  the

growth rate was a mere 4.5 per cent per year -  the

substantial  housing  programme  launched  by   the

Housing   Board  undoubtedly  helped   to   sustain

economic expansion during this period. The  finance

to pay for this had to be obtained by civil service

pay  cuts and tax increases, measures which did not

increase the Government's popularity rating. During

this  period, the Gross Domestic Product  increased

from   $1,968  million  to  $2,684  million.   This

represented a compound growth rate of 8.1 per  cent

a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Housing Board building

programme,  the construction industry prospered  in

the  second  half  of  the period,  generating  the

following net output:



<pre>

              1959 -- $40.0 million

              1960 -- $41.9 million

              1961 -- $56.0 million

              1962 -- $70.0 million

              1963 -- $94.7 million

</pre>

<br>The   construction  industry  during  this   period

increased at 24.0 per cent a year. The impetus came

mainly  from Government expenditure in the  housing

field. Increase of public sector investment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



during  this period was at a compound rate of  27.5

per  cent.  The present rate, between 1965-69,  has

been  10.5  per  cent  growth rate  in  the  public

sector, a more moderate pace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political in-fighting between the Communist

United Front (C.U.F.) and the P.A.P. resulted in  a

large  number  of strikes called by the  C.U.F. as

part  of its attempt to coerce the Government.  The

number of man-days lost in strikes was as follows:

<pre>

                    1960 -- 152,005

                    1961 -- 410,891

                    1962 -- 164,936

                    1963 -- 388,219

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defeat of the Communist United Front in the

Referendum  of August 1962, followed by  subsequent

security action against them, restored a measure of

industrial  peace. In 1964, strikes  accounted  for

loss  of only 35,908 man-days. In 1969, the  figure

was 8,512.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a period when unemployment was heavy,

trade  union  irresponsibility on  such  a  massive

scale    was   hardly   conducive   to   industrial

investment. The following figures of employment  in

the  manufacturing industries as  recorded  in  the

annual   census  of  manufactures  show  that   the

manufacturing sector was virtually stagnant between

1959  and 1962 and registered only a small increase

in 1963. The employment figures are as follows:



<pre>

                     1960 - 26,697

                     1961 - 26,837

                     1962 - 27,924

                     1963 - 35,256

</pre>



<br>Employment  in  pioneer industries,  the  first  of

which went into production in

1961,  increased from 241 workers to 2,654  at  the

end of 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not easy to get started. The domestic

market was small, as it still is today. Wages  were

then high compared to other Asian countries such as

Hong  Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. On top  of  all

this, a near-endemic situation of management-labour

conflict  arose  out of the show-down  between  the

democratic and pro-Communist forces. Despite  these

handicaps, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



Government  proceeded  with its  development  plans

with  a  confidence  few  believed  justified.   In

September  1961  earth-moving operations  commenced

when the first bulldozer moved into Jurong. By  the

end  of 1962, 1,100 acres of prepared land had been

levelled by cutting

down  hills and filling swamps. By the end of 1963,

1,800  acres had been prepared. Twenty-four million

cubic  yards had been moved in the process. Jurong,

as  of  December  1963, had only two  factories  in

production  to  show for this mountain  of  labour.

They  were  the National Iron and Steel  Mills  and

Pelican  Textiles. Between then, they  employed  90

workers.



<br><br><i>Economic Development, 1963-65</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's entry into the Federation of Malaysia

in  September, 1963 was preceded by many months  of

negotiations.  While the political arrangements  in

the   new   Federation  were  agreed   to   without

difficulty,  negotiations on financial  arrangement

and  over the structure of the Common Market proved

unexpectedly  long and difficult, in  the  end,  a

compromise  solution was found,  literally  at  the

eleventh  hour  in  London. Our membership  of  the

Malaysian  Federation proved to be shortlived.  The

reasons for the sudden separation of Singapore from

Malaysia  are now past history, as are  the  events

which  led  to  it. So far as Singapore's  economic

development  is  concerned, hopes for  a  Malaysian

Common   Market   had  led  to  some   anticipatory

investment  in  1963. However, the proclamation  of

the  new  Federation  was greeted  by  unexpectedly

strong   reaction  from  the  Soekarno  regime   of

Indonesia. Confrontation was declared, and with it

the   curtailment  of  our  entrepot   trade   with

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national economic aggregates show the results

of   the   factors   I   mentioned   -   Indonesian

confrontation,  the  abortive  Common  Market  with

Malaysia,  the  financial arrangement  between  the

States and Federal Government. Of the three periods

of the last decade, the years we spent in Malaysia

showed the lowest growth rates of Gross



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



Domestic  Product,  a  mere  6.5  per  cent  annual

growth. This was due to the substantial decline  of

our  entrepot trade by some 16.8 per cent as  trade

relations with Indonesia were severed. As a result,

earnings  on the entrepot trade declined from  $441

million  in 1963 to $306 million in 1965.  Further,

agriculture  and  fishing, never  noted  for  rapid

growth, showed a decline of 2.5 per cent. This  was

the  result  of night curfews imposed in  Singapore

waters   for  security  reasons,  which   adversely

affected the livelihood of fishermen. On the  other

hand,  there was a very large increase in the value

of  British  military  expenditure,  as  one  would

expect.  British military expenditure increased  by

27.7 per cent in 1964 and again by 25.9 per cent in

1965.  In  absolute terms, this meant  an  increase

from  $323 million in 1963 to $519 million in 1965.

This  was, sufficient to make good entrepot  trade

losses, taking the two years together. But the year

1964  was  a particularly bad year; the decline  in

entrepot   earnings  was  much  greater  than   the

increase in British military expenditure. Accordingly, the Gross Domestic Product for that year showed

the  least increase of the decade, a mere  0.5  per

cent.    But   for   increased   British   military

expenditure,  there would have been  a  substantial

decline.  The Gross Domestic Product  for  the  two

years we were in Malaysia were:

<pre>

              1964  ...  $2,700 million

              1965  ...  $3,043 million

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Indonesian confrontation, total

investments continued to expand and at a brisk rate

too. Gross capital formation increased at an annual

rate of 20.6 per cent, running at $421 million  and

$476  million  in  1964 and 1965 respectively.  The

manufacturing  industry forged ahead  in  spite  of

poor trading conditions and deteriorating relations

between  the  Singapore and Malaysian  Governments.

Manufacturing, construction and utilities showed  a

combined  average  of 16.2 per cent  annual  growth

rate  during Malaysia as compared with 14.7 per cent

in  pre-Malaysia.  Employment in the  manufacturing

industry increased moderately, some 14.2 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



cent  a year. The increase of employment was  about

10,000  over  the  two years, the  1965  census  of

manufactures giving a total of 46,020 employees for

1965  as  against  35,256 two  years  earlier.  The

Labour Department work force figures also showed an

increase  of  about the same amount,  188,701  for

1965  as  against 178,787 for 1963. It is  apparent

that  the manufacturing industry was providing  the

main new job opportunities. But these never reached

the  proportions  which would  reduce  unemployment

significantly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onerous terms of the financial agreement

under  which  we  entered Malaysia  resulted  in  a

decline in our overseas assets for the only time in

the  decade.  Our overseas assets  which  stood  at

$748.4  million at the end of 1963 were reduced  to

$631.0 million at the end of 1965.



<br><br><i>Economic Development, 1966-69</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the last period under review, the

years  as  an independent sovereign state.  On  the

morning of August 9th, 1965, I was in my office  in

Fullerton  Building  brooding  over  the   enormous

problems facing the country and the Government. The

problems  of  the  future  loomed  in  awesome  and

intimidating proportions. Here we were,  an  island

trading  outpost, with its economic  hinterland  in

other   countries,  a  vulnerable  arrangement   as

confrontation  had shown. Our token defence  forces

were  manned mostly by citizens of another country.

Even  the water we drank had to be mostly imported.

We  had  no natural resources other than a diligent

and  enterprising people. At 10.00 a.m, news of the

separation  was announced over the  Radio.  It  was

greeted  by the firing of crackers in Chinatown.  I

thought  this a light-hearted response to  a  grave

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years later, in my Budget Statement of

December 1967, I was able to say, "After two  years

of independent existence, the Republic of Singapore

continues not only to survive but also to flourish,

to the surprise of many observers."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This account of the final period of the decade

will describe how our economy grew in the last four

years  and  will attempt to give some  reasons  for

such growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the post-Malaysia period, Singapore's Gross

Domestic  Product  increased at a  compound  annual

rate of 12.3 per cent as compared with 6.5 per cent

during  Malaysia  and  8.1 per  cent  pre-Malaysia.

Trade,  industry  and  tourism  provided  the  main

thrust  to our economic growth during this  period.

The  result  of  robust economic expansion  on  the

Government's   finances  was   gratifying.   Annual

revenue increased from $508 million to $934 million

last  year  with but minor adjustments in  taxation

rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for expansion during this period

stemmed  from external as well as domestic sources.

As  regards the first, what undoubtedly helped most

was  the  strong position of the economies  of  the

United  States,  Europe and Japan.  Notwithstanding

recurring  monetary crises during  the  last  three

years  of  the  decade,  the  1960s  saw  what  was

virtually  a  long sustained boom  among  the  rich

nations. One after another, they reached conditions

of  full  employment and had to depend for  further

expansion either on imported labour, as happened in

the  case  of  Germany  and, to  a  lesser  extent,

Britain,  or  they  had  to  move  some  of   their

manufacturing   operations  abroad,   as   happened

particularly  with  the United  States  and,  to  a

lesser extent, Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also assisted by conditions in Hong Kong

where,  as a result of growth at an extremely  fast

rate,  tight employment conditions became  apparent

in  the  last two or three years. Hong Kong,  whose

wage levels used to be substantially below those of

Singapore,  ceased to be a provider  of  labour  to

foreign investors at cheaper rates than Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, the end of confrontation brought

about  a resumption of Indonesian trade. This  gave

the  first  year  on our own the  main  impetus  to

economic growth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside conditions were favourable. But this by

itself  did  not ensure our prosperity if  we  were

unprepared  to  make the effort  required  to  take

advantage  of  our opportunities. Fortunately,  the

institutions  which were established  as  early  as

1961  had developed in experience and expertise.  I

am,   of   course,   referring  to   the   Economic

Development  Board which was the Government's  main

agency  for promoting industrial growth. Industrial

estates at Jurong and elsewhere had provided a wide

range of industrial sites to meet every conceivable

demand of industry. The Development Bank was  amply

supplied  with  funds  and  the  E.D.B.'s  overseas

promotion  officers improved in skill and  efficacy

in  their efforts to attract large corporations  to

the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but by no means least, the Employment Act

passed  in  August 1968, with the  support  of  the

National  Trades Union Congress, gave an impressive

demonstration of the will of the people to overcome

all  obstacles  to  make temporary  sacrifices  the

better to secure the future for themselves. Perhaps

more   than  anything  else,  the  Employment   Act

projected   an  image  of  Singapore  among   large

potential  foreign investors, of a disciplined  and

rational people upon whom they could depend for the

success of their enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these favourable external and internal

influences,  except for the year 1967, the  economy

moved  ahead  briskly. The Gross  Domestic  Product

increased substantially, details of which  are  set

out in Table 2.



<pre>

                      TABLE 2

    1969        4,833               13.5%

</pre>



<br>The 1969 figure is  based on preliminary estimates

and it is likely that the final estimates would

show a larger figure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansion in 1966 derived its impetus principally

from  a resumption of trade with Indonesia as  well

as  a  general increase in world trade. In absolute

terms, the earnings of the entrepot trade increased

from $305.6 million to $377.0 million in 1966.  The

manufacturing  industry provided a useful  gain  of

some  $72  million  in  value  added,  from  $414.3

million to $486.8 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good start the Republic made in 1966 was not

sustained  the following year, which registered  an

increase of only 7.5 per cent. The principal reason

for   this   was  a  temporary  decline  in   world

prosperity. World trade which before that year  had

been  growing annually at between 8.4 per cent  and

11.9 per cent in the previous four years, showed  a

growth  of only 5.4 per cent in 1967. Our  entrepot

earnings in 1967 showed a very small increase, just

over one per cent on the previous year. At the same

time there was a marked decline in British military

expenditure from $549.5 million to $489.9  million.

The experience of 1967 is pertinent because the two

elements making for the slowing down of our  growth

- reduced military expenditure at the British  bases

and  levelling off of world trade - are  prospects which face us in the next three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two years of the decade were

exceptionally  good  for Singapore.  The  principal

thrust   was  an  unparalleled  expansion  of   our

entrepot   trade,  earnings  of  which  more   than

doubled.  Buoyant  world  trade  conditions  during

1968-69  helped  sustain our own growth  of  trade.

World trade in these two years increased by 11  per

cent and 14 per cent. At the same time, earnings in

the   manufacturing  industry  showed   substantial

increases - 19.2 per cent in 1968 and 22.9 per cent

in  1969.  The  contribution of  the  manufacturing

industries  to  the Gross Domestic Product  reached

$827  million  in  1969 compared  to  a  mere  $170

million  a decade ago. The effect of this expansion

on employment will be discussed later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansion of trade and industry was more than

enough to offset the modest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



reduction in British military expenditure. In  1967

this  amounted to $489.9 million and it was reduced

to  $415.4 million by 1969. We should remember that

as  from  now  British military  spending  will  be

reduced  at  a much faster rate. Between  1967  and

1969,  quite  apart from expansion of manufacturing

and   trade,  even  the  tourist  trade   increased

sufficiently  fast  to offset the  reduced  British

military  spending, so that increased  earnings  on

trade  and  industry virtually formed net additions

to the domestic product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I have referred to total investment which

increased  throughout  the  decade  not   only   in

absolute  terms  but also as a  proportion  of  the

Gross  Domestic  Product.  The  increase  in  total

investment was especially marked in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



post-Malaysia era. The figures are given in Table 3.



<pre>

    1968        735.9               17.3%

    1969        918.5               19.0%

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain interesting features about the

growth of investment during this period quite apart

from  its  size.  The  first is  that  the  fastest

increase  occurred  in  the  private  sector.   The

figures  between public sector and  private  sector

investment are given in Table 4.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>

    1968      300.9      435.0       735.9

    1969      322.4      596.1       918.5

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase during the period in private sector

investment  from $234 million to $596  million,  an

increase  of  156  per  cent,  compares  with  $239

million to $323 million in the public sector, or  a

mere  35 per cent growth in the public sector  over

three  years. This is as it should be. It  reflects

the  response  of private enterprise to  the  growing

social  maturity,  to  the  National  Trades  Union

Congress'  success  in  promoting  labour  responsibility and to the Government's policy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>

on  wage  stability and industrial incentives.

All these   created  a  favourable  general  investment climate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an interesting development in 1968 and

1969  which calls for attention. The statistics  on

capital  formation give separate figures in respect

of   expenditure   on  machinery   and   equipment.

transport  equipment, that is, ships, aircraft  and

vehicles  mainly, and on buildings and  works.  The

figures  for the period under review are  given  in

Table 5.

1969    400.7      116.6        401.2        918.5

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A striking feature about the table is the sharp

increase   in  1968  in  expenditure  on  transport

equipment.  The explanation lies in the substantial

purchases of ships and aircraft in these two years.

Purchases  of  ships  in  1968  amounted  to  $30.2

million   and  in  1969  to  $56.5  million.   This

development fits into the general picture of  sharp

increases in entrepot trade during these two  years

against  the background of burgeoning world  trade.

In 1969, purchases of ships included the four ships

bought by the Republic's newly-established national

shipping line, the Neptune Orient Lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ships accounted for in these figures did not

include,  as  far  as  could be ascertained,  ships

registered  under  the  flag-of-convenience   terms

provided  for  in  the  revised  Merchant  Shipping

Ordinance passed in Parliament towards the  end  of

last  year.  Future calculations of  Gross  Capital

Formation would have to draw a distinction  between

Singapore-registered ships whose beneficial  owners

are  residents in the Republic and those registered

for  flag-of-convenience purposes. This distinction

is by no means easy to make in all cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards aircraft purchases, the Malaysia-Singapore Airline's aircraft renewal and expansion

programmes  commenced in 1968, when  deliveries  of

the  new Boeings took place. New aircraft delivered

in  1968 and placed in the Singapore Registry  were

valued  at  $59.4 million. In 1969,  $37.7  million

worth  of new aircraft were delivered. Half of  the

new  M.S.A. fleet carry Malaysian registration  and

these are not included in the above figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other noteworthy feature of the investment

process  in  these  four years was  the  large  but

regular  increases in expenditure on buildings  and

works.  As  against this, expenditure on  machinery

and  equipment remained level during 1966 and  1967

and  took  two large steps in 1968 and  1969.  This

reflects  the  recent  increase  in  the  pace   of

industrialisation  with  which  most  of   us   are

familiar.  This  increase  is  also  reflected   in

employment figures, to which I now turn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Address of 5th December, 1967,

after quoting figures of employment as reported  in

the  annual  census  of manufactures,  I  made  the

following observations [Vol. 26, No. 8, col. 453]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is a sobering thought that with the

prodigious  efforts we put in and the vast  amounts

of  money  and  resources which the Government  had

been  channelling towards increasing the growth  of

the  manufacturing industries, all  that  had  been

achieved is a net increase of some 5,000 jobs  each

year  in  these industries. Clearly  this  rate  of

increase is inadequate to meet our future needs.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happily, performance since then has improved and

I  give  the  following employment figures  in  the

manufacturing industries from 1966 to 1969:

<pre>

                     1966 - 51,272

                     1967 - 56,762

                     1968 - 72,603

                     1969 - 87,128

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years employment in the

manufacturing industries has been increasing at  an

annual rate of around 15,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more in keeping with what we need. In

fact,  taking  into  account  that  the  stepped-up

employment in industry coincided with the intake of

national  servicemen  into the  Armed  Forces,  the

result  had  been  a  tight  labour  market,   more

especially in the professional and skilled  grades,

where shortages in certain lines were acute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to deal with the very rapid

increases  in  our official overseas  assets  which

grew from $631 million in 1965 to $2,445 million at

the  end  of  1969. An increase of this proportion,

about  four  times in four years, is not  a  common

occurrence in the monetary history of nations. This

growth  in  our  overseas assets  was  not  due  to

financial  wizardry. It was firstly the  result  of

institutional  changes in note  issue  arrangements

after independence;

secondly, the consequence of the financial policies

we   followed  as  an  independent  Republic;   and

thirdly,  the  reflection  of  the  rapid  economic

growth I have just described.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three components to the increase of our

overseas assets. The first is the establishment  of

our  own  currency and the transfer of assets  from

the  old Malayan Currency Board to our own Currency

Board  when the old notes were exchanged  for  new.

The assets of the Currency Board at the end of 1969

amounted  to  $645.37 million. The  second  element

arose  out  of a large increase in commercial  bank

deposits.   As  a  result  of  economic  expansion,

favourable trade balance and, possibly, some inflow

of  'hot  money', bank deposits more  than  doubled

since  1965,  increasing from $1,222.0  million  to

$2,745.3  million  in  1969.  The  Government  sold

Treasury bills to commercial banks and the  holding

of  such  bills  at  the end of  1969  was  $500.13

million compared with $23.07 million at the end  of

1965.  As  the  proceeds  of  Treasury  bills  were

invested   abroad,   this   had   the   effect   of

neutralising  a good part of the increase  in  bank

deposits  and in this way, helped to avert possible

inflationary  pressure. The  remainder,  some  $696

million,  represented  the accumulation  of  annual

Government surpluses since 1965 as well as those of

the  statutory authorities to the extent that  they

were invested in Government securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ordinary circumstances, it is not necessary to

hold  such  large assets overseas, which is  really

tantamount to investing our money abroad instead of

investing  it in the Republic itself. However,  for

reasons  which I shall go into later, these  assets

may come in useful when possible economic trends in

the  next  three years may require us to  run  down

these assets from their present rather high levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be the right note on which to end

this narrative of the decade. We started it with  a

grave and persisting problem of unemployment fueled

each  year by successive floods of post-war  babies

coming of age. Our difficulties were compounded  by

irresponsible  actions of trade unions  manipulated

for political ends. We sought a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



solution in a Common Market in Malaysia that proved

a  dead  end.  Throughout the decade  there  was  a

persistent   search  for  practical  solutions,   a

patient   building  of  institutions   and   infra-structure,  a  generous  allocation  of  funds,  an

accumulated  collection of talented staff.  In  the

end,  it paid off. It is imperative that we  should

never, either through extravagance or carelessness,

fritter  away all that we had so laboriously  built

up.   We  must  build  on  the  foundation  of  the

accumulated  experience of the  decade  and  ensure

that  progress  and  prosperity  will  continue  to

higher levels of consolidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I turn to suggest some policies that could

help  to achieve this, I wish to turn to the  more

mundane and immediate task of the budget.



<br><br><i>Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure, 1970-71</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first turn to the Estimates of Revenue and

Expenditure   for  the  financial   year   1970-71.

Following the practice introduced last year, I have

presented  to Parliament two Treasury papers*,  one on  the  Ordinary Estimates and the  other  on  the

Development  Estimates. These explain  the  reasons

for  increased  expenditure, and  forecast  revenue

yields  in  the  forthcoming  financial  year.  The

Treasury   papers  also  deal  with   revenue   and

expenditure  performances  in  1969.  It   is   not

necessary  for  me to enter into  great  detail  of

itemised  allocations of money to  heads,  subheads

and items of expenditure, nor need I go through the

yield  forecast of different classes and  items  of

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* Papers Parl. Misc. 1 and 2 of 1970.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only necessary for me to set out in broad

outline  the  policy adopted by the  Government  in

framing  the  budget for the forthcoming  financial

year  and  to  draw attention to some of  the  more

significant expenditure items both in the  Ordinary

and the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy this year follows the same lines as

those  laid down at the last Budget. The  needs  of

defence are taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



as given datum. What remains of anticipated revenue

yields  is distributed to the other sectors of  the

Government  services. As was the  case  last  year,

care had to be taken in limiting expenditure on the

social  services  to the most essential  functions.

Consequently,  the increase of expenditure  on  the

social  services is the smallest of the  four  main

functional  divisions. There  is  a  9.3  per  cent

increase  from  $292.0 million in  1969  to  $319.2

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic services that are essential to the

maintenance of the momentum of growth were provided

with  adequate funds. Taken as a group,  the  money

voted  for this division increased by no less  than

25.1 per cent from $87.1 million for 1969 to $109.0

million in the next financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the real increase is far less than

this,  as  certain expenditures  that  used  to  be

financed out of the Development Estimates  are,  in

the  coming financial year, charged to the Ordinary

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence and internal security take the largest

portion  of the budgetary cake, no less  than  31.7

per  cent. The money to be supplied to Defence  has

long  been  pre-determined by the  revised  Defence

Plan  which  I described in detail in  last  year's

Budget.  The  defence plans had to be revised  when

the  British  Government advanced the date  of  the

closure of their bases to 31st December, 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a substantial increase of $52.1 million

in  respect of statutory expenditure. This  is  due

principally  to additional provisions for  interest

payments   and   sinking  fund  contributions.   An

increase  of  $1.5  million  results  from  pension

increases   due   to  the  salaries   consolidation

exercise carried out last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Business Motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will now comment on major expenditure changes

in respect of each Ministry. The Prime Minister's

Ministry is provided with additional sums to pay

for new posts in the Corrupt Practices

Investigation Bureau, an expense which none of us

will grudge. However, there is a reduction of

$158,120 for the Bases Economic Conversion

Department as a result of more accurate assessment

of the needs of that department. The Prime

Minister's Ministry accordingly will show a small

reduction in total expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Science and Technology requires

new posts under its plan of reorganisation, to

provide for effective economic and statistical

evaluation as well as to determine the needs of

industry with greater precision..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance is provided with a

substantially enlarged vote, $173.7 million as

against $137.9 million in 1969. Of the increase of

$35.8 million, $10 million results from increasing

the transfer to the Development Fund from $30

million to $40 million. An additional $2.0 million

goes to a new electronic computer for the Ministry,

and $1.8 million is set aside for the Population

Census next June. A sum of $12.3 million represents

grants to the Economic Development Board and its

subsidiary agencies. This expenditure was formerly

paid out of the Development Estimates, a practice

which I consider erroneous. There is also a new

item under Contributions and Charitable Allowances,

a sum of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



$3.1  million being our contribution to the  ASEAN

Fund. The Housing Board subsidy is to be increased

by $3.6 million next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be staff increases in the Ministry - 21 new posts in the new Industry Department, 12 new

posts  for the new Overseas Investment Section.  14

new  posts in the Banking and Control Units of  the

Commissioner of Banking and seven new posts to look

after  Government's rented properties. Customs  and

Excise are to be provided with 74 new posts to keep

pace  with increased work at the Singapore Airport,

at  the  Port  Authority and Free  Trade  Zone  and

elsewhere.  Inland  Revenue  is  to  be   given   a

substantial increase consequent on the creation  of

105  new posts. 52 new posts go to the Anti-Evasion

Unit  recently  established with the assistance  of

the American Inland Revenue authorities. A total of

47  new  posts  are  created for the  Property  Tax

Division. Both Inland Revenue and the Property  Tax

Department   have  long  suffered   from   staffing

deficiencies  and an effort must  now  be  made  at

improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is given an

additional  $2.3 million, its vote increasing  from

$8.9 million in 1969 to $11.2 million in 1970-71, a

25.6  per  cent increase. Salary consolidation  and

normal  salary increments account for  $½ million.

The  requirements of 44 new posts to  man  overseas

establishments  as well as headquarters  cost  $¼

million.  New and increased allowances  add  up  to

another  $528,000. Additional travelling  expenses,

diplomatic  bag  service,  etc.,  take  a   further

$380,000. An additional sum of $129,450 has  to  be

provided  to  the  Mission in  Manila  while  other

existing Missions will cost $444,000 more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has been given a 9.3

per  cent increase, or $14.9 million. The education

vote   increases  from  $159.1  million  to  $174.0

million the next financial year. A total of 380 new

posts  are  provided  of  which  367  are  in   the

Technical Education Department. In addition to  367

new staff, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Education Department will have a further 843 posts transferred to it from the General

Education Department. Such is the magnitude of the

shift  in  priorities from academic  to  technical

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual increments and consolidation of salaries

to  teachers  in the Government service  amount  to

$5.7  million. Grants to aided schools increase  by

$5.0  million as a result of salaries consolidation

and annual increments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four institutions of higher learning, Ngee

Ann  College,  Nanyang  University,  the  Singapore

Polytechnic, and the University of Singapore,  will

receive an increase in grants by an amount of  $3.9

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications, which looks after

policy on essential services to the economy by  way

of air and sea communications as well as postal and

telecommunication  services,  receives   a   modest

increase  of  $825,000  or  1.9  per  cent.   Civil

Aviation gets a large part of this, by way  of  new

staff  and facilities. A sum of $150,000 is to  pay

for  public utility charges which will be  incurred

as  a  result  of  the  new cargo  complex  at  the

Airport,  the  instrument landing systems  and  the

taxi-way  and approach lights. New baggage handling

equipment,  including  four  tractors  and   eleven

trolleys,  will cost $65,500. There are also  staff

increases  in  the  Meteorological  Services,   the

Postal  Services, the Telecommunications Department

and  the  Marine Department. Demand for  all  these

services increases with economic growth and  it  is

the   policy  of  the  Ministry  to  maintain  high

standards of efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already referred to the increased

allocation  to  the Ministry of  the  Interior  and

Defence  and  no further elaboration  is  required.

Apart from the expansion of the armed forces, it is

also   necessary  to  strengthen  the   Immigration

service.  At the same time, the Ministry had  found

it  possible to delete a total of 508 posts  mainly

of  Police  grades, thereby saving some  $1.1  mill

ion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures by the Ministries of Culture and

Social  Affairs have been kept within bounds.  They

show  a  reduction in expenditure of  $425,000  and

$1.17  million respectively. The saving  in  Social

Welfare  is principally due to a decrease of  $1.45

million needed by way of public assistance and  the

tuberculosis treatment allowance. No doubt this  is

the result of better housing, more employment and a

better health environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little change in the Ministry of Labour.

The  closure  of the Second Industrial  Arbitration

Court,  made possible by improved labour-management

relations, provides adequate savings to meet annual

increases and some small staff increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Law and National Development gets

a  modest increase of $3.0 million, or 6.7 per cent

on   the   1969  vote  of  $44.6  million.  Primary

Production  continues  to  expand  its  staff   and

services.  The abattoir in Jurong needs more  staff

and  so  does the Car Parks Division. The Fisheries

Section  of  Primary  Production  has  been   given

$909,000 as back payment of rent to the Jurong Town

Corporation  for  the  Jurong  Fisheries  Port  and

Central  Auction  Market. But  the  main  increases

required  by  the Ministry of National  Development

are  in  respect  of  public works.  An  additional

$400,000  has  been  provided  to  keep  government

offices,  buildings and grounds in good  condition,

as  well as to maintain properties taken over  from

the  British Armed Forces. There is a small saving

from  the  present  policy  of  dismantling  public

standpipes  and  providing  domestic  water  supply

direct to homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health gets a substantial

increase of $6.4 million. More than a third of this

represents annual increment of salaries  and  other

additional  payments to staff. However, there  will

be  an increase in the volume of services provided.

A  total of 121 new posts will be provided  to  the

Public  Health Division of the Ministry, 68  to  be

deployed in environmental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



health,  33 in school health services and the  rest

elsewhere. More money is also to be spent on public

cleansing,  maintenance of drains in the  catchment

areas,   supervision  of  hawkers  and  such   like

services.  A total of 110 new refuse vehicles  have

been  or will soon be supplied to the Ministry  and

they  will  require  an  increase  of  $240,000  on

maintenance expenditure. A substantial increase  in

anti-mosquito  activities will cost  $¾  million.

The  years  ahead  will  see further  expansion  in

environmental health control. There is likely to be

very substantial capital and re-current expenditure

on   garbage  disposal.  New  policies  are   being

developed  in the Ministry not only to  improve  on

existing  services  but also  introduce  new  ones,

particularly  to combat the growing menace  of  air

and   water  pollution.  The  experience  of  other

countries  and other cities indicates that  we  are

well  advised  to take measures in advance  of  the

deterioration  to  such proportions  that  remedies

become  very  costly. A committee is  investigating

and    identifying   those   areas    of    medical

specialisation in which Singapore could achieve pre-eminence  by providing available medical  expertise

with the latest in equipment and facilities.



<br><br><i>Development Estimates, 1970-71</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates provide for a sum of

$438.5  million.  This is roughly  divided  in  two

equal   portions  -  one  of  $215.6  million   for

expenditure  on  government  development  projects,

while  a  sum  of $222.9 million is set  aside  for

loans to statutory authorities and government-owned

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major part of direct government expenditure

is  spent  by  the  Ministry of  Law  and  National

Development. The budget provision for this Ministry

is  $95.65  million. The major schemes administered

by  this  Ministry  include the  Bedok  reclamation

scheme,   the  Kallang  Basin  reclamation  scheme,

construction  of  roads and bridges,  drainage  and

flood  alleviation  schemes, as  well  as  sewerage

works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bedok reclamation scheme has been proceeding

well,  some 1,000 acres having been recovered  from

the sea



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



at  a  cost of $43 million so far, and another  $11

million  will  be required in 1970-71.  The  second

phase  of  this large land reclamation scheme  will

cover  125  acres  of  land between  the  Singapore

Swimming Club to the end of Tanjong Rhu. A  further

165  acres  along  Nicoll  Highway  will  also   be

reclaimed  at  a  total cost of $24.9  million,  of

which  $8.3  million is expected  to  be  spent  in

1970-71.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kallang Basin reclamation scheme is 80 per

cent  complete,  399  acres  of  land  having  been

reclaimed  at  a cost of $22.9 million.  A  further

$2.6  million is required next year to reclaim  the

remaining 93 acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urban renewal is expected to cost $15.6 million

in   1970-71.   The  first  phase,  rebuilding   in

Crawford,  Sepoy Lines and Havelock  constituencies

on  270  acres of land has been completed with  the

construction of 2,500 flats and 800 shops.  Another

950  flats and 97 shops are nearing completion. The

Urban Renewal Department will need $1.9 million  by

way  of  salaries  and  wages  while  another  $¼

million will go as Government's contribution to the

United Nations State and City Planning project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Production is forging ahead with

ambitious development schemes costing $2.5 million.

Animal  husbandry  projects alone  will  cost  $1.0

million.  This  includes a revote of  $300,000  for

completion of the Jurong abattoir, and $500,000 for

the   pig   and   poultry  training  and   research

institute.  Among agricultural projects,  work  has

started  on  developing hydroponics farming,  while

the  farm  licensing and collection of agricultural

statistics accounts for $150,000. Fisheries will be

provided with more than $½ million; most of it is

for  training of fishermen. It is to be hoped  that

this   massive   injection  of   funds   into   the

agricultural  sector will result in an  improvement

on  the  anaemic performance of 2.9 per cent growth

rate in the last decade, the lowest growth rate  of

any sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on roads and bridges is expected to

amount to $13.3 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



Drainage  and  flood alleviation will cost  another

$4.2  million. This includes the cost of completing

the   first   phase  of  the  Bukit   Timah   flood

alleviation project for a sum of $2.3 million.  The

total  cost  of this phase, which will drain  flood

waters from the Bukit Timah Canal to the Ulu Pandan

River through a canal which runs into a tunnel  cut

under a hill, amounts to $6.84 million, spent  over

four years. Canals and subsidiary drains in various

parts  of  the  Island will be lined with  concrete

and,  with  minor drainage schemes, will cost  some

$1.9 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sewerage development continues apace, and a sum

of  $12.1  million is provided under  Head  97  for

this.    Major   sewerage   projects   are    under

construction  at  the  Kallang  Basin,   Serangoon,

Jurong,  Thomson Road, Urban Renewal  North,  Urban

Renewal  South,  Bartley  Road  and  Upper   Changi

Estate.  In  addition to these nine  major  schemes

which  cost $7.2 million, there will be three major

sewage  treatment and disposal works for  extension

or  construction at a cost of $3.2  million.  There

will  also  be miscellaneous projects costing  $1.7

million.  Most of these schemes will see completion

in the financial year 1971-72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health will be spending $2.6

million  on  Public Health services.  $1.6  million

will  be  spent  in buying 55 new refuse-collecting

vehicles. New cleansing and night-soil depots  will

be  established at a cost of $678,000.  There  will

also  be  development of hospital services  costing

nearly a million dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications has important

development  projects  under  way.  The   passenger

terminal  at  Paya Lebar will be redeveloped  at  a

cost  of  $5 million, of which $3 million  will  be

spent in 1970-71. It is expected to be completed by

the end of next year. The existing jet and terminal

parking   aprons  will  be  extended   to   relieve

congestion, at a cost of $1.3 million. Improvements

to taxi-ways, apron areas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



and  airfield  drainage  will  require  another  $1

million.  The  Government proposes  to  extend  the

runway now 11,000 feet long to 13,200 feet long. It

will also construct a new cargo terminal and a  new

hangar large enough to accommodate the Boeing  747.

Only  token provisions, however, have been  entered

in the coming financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star item in the Ministry's development

programme   is  undoubtedly  the  earth   satellite

station   for  which  some  $10  million  will   be

required.  It  is also necessary to buy  additional

teleprinter machines and telex machines, demand for

which  has  exceeded supply by a wide  margin.  The

national  auto telex exchange will be improved  and

new  micro-wave  radio bearers for the  main  trunk

system  will be introduced. The total bill for  all

these is expected to be $15.2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteorological services will be provided with

up-to-date equipment, including wind-finding  radar

and a replacement for the storm-warning radar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Interior and Defence will

need  $51.4 million, mostly for works and buildings

and  land  acquisition, to house  the  new  defence

units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will be provided with

$22.1  million  for development projects  of  which

there  is  a long list. Most of these projects  are

for  the  advancement of technical  education.  The

Technical Education Department of the Ministry  has

introduced  workshops in academic schools  so  that

all   secondary  school  students  will  have  some

experience of workshop practices. In addition,  the

conversion  of  academic schools into academic-cum-technical  schools  and  conversion  of   the   old

vocational  schools  into  industrial  centres  are

proceeding as scheduled. Four vocational institutes

are  under construction or extension and a new  one

at MacPherson will soon commence construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on academic education consists mostly

of  continuing  projects. However, a  new  building

will be provided for Raffles Institution at Grange



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



Road.  Earth-works have begun on a 14.2  acre  site

and the building is expected to be completed by the

middle  of  next  year.  The  total  cost  is  $2.4

million. There will be 28 class-rooms, two lecture-halls, seven workshops, eight science laboratories,

a  library,  an  assembly hall,  a  gymnasium,  and

ancillary rooms for extra-curricular activities. In

addition, there will be a large sports field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Labour's development

projects, a Hotel and Catering Training School will

cost  $2.2 million. It is hoped to provide training

for some 1,000 trainees a year when completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Science and Technology proposes

to  build a Popular Science Centre. This will  give

citizens  a  better understanding  of  what  modern

science  is  about;  it  will  also  be  useful  to

secondary  school science students and  others.  In

addition, the National Museum will be improved  and

extended  at  a  cost  of $300,000.  It  is  public

knowledge that the Government proposes to move  the

University of Singapore from its present campus  to

Kent  Ridge. A sum of $500,000 is set aside to meet

the cost of planning the new university campus. The

World  Bank has expressed an interest in  providing

finance for the cost of university development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in many years, the Judicature

appears  in the Development Estimates. This  is  to

provide    Subordinate    Courts    with     decent

accommodation.  They are now scattered  at  various

places   along  South  Bridge  Road,  Sepoy  Lines,

Empress Place, New Bridge Road and Outram Road. The

Chief  Justice tells me that some of the  buildings

are  not  only old and dilapidated but a danger  to

their occupants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Court building will be erected at Havelock

Road to house 55 odd-rooms, chambers for judges and

magistrates,  waiting-rooms, witnesses'  rooms  and

other paraphernalia required for the administration

of justice. The cost of the building is expected to

amount to $6.4 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the loan portion of the development

programme.  The Housing and Development Board  will

be  provided with a loan of $100 million to finance

its  accelerated building programme. Hitherto,  the

annual  loan provision stood at $50 million. Jurong

Town Corporation has some $50 million set aside and

this  money will pay for reclamation of swamp  land

at the old West Coast Road, the extension of Jurong

Wharf,  construction of workers' flats  and  social

amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Stadium, the foundation-stone of

which I was privileged to lay a fortnight ago, will

be  offered a loan of $7.8 million. It is  intended

to  form  a  Corporation to run  the  Stadium.  The

income to repay this loan, as well as future loans,

will  come from two sources. First, the profits  of

Singapore  Pools  (Pte.) Limited and,  second,  the

takings at the gate of the Stadium, which one hopes

will exceed the cost of maintenance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has embarked on a number of

enterprises  in  the  business field,  including  a

shipping  line, a shipbuilding yard, a  ship-repair

yard,  a  small arms plant and a development  bank.

These  require  loan finance and  a  sum  of  $65.1

million has been set aside for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Town Corporation has been charged with

the  duty  of developing Blakang Mati, soon  to  be

renamed,  and  has commenced work. Further  tourist

attractions will be developed on islands in  Jurong

Lake.  Money  for  these projects required  in  the

coming financial year is estimated at $8.9 million.



<br><br><i>Taxation Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concludes my observations on the Ordinary

and  Development  Estimates.  Before  I  go  on  to

discuss  possible future courses  our  economy  may

take,  I should say a few words on taxation policy.

The Government's policy in recent years has been to

depend on fast economic expansion and improved  tax

administration to provide increased revenue  rather

than raise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



rates of taxation to higher levels or introduce new

taxes. Last year, some minor tax increases as  well

as  new  taxes  were announced to meet  the  rising

needs   of  our  defence  build-up.  1969   revenue

increased by $131.5 million over 1968. The yield of

new   revenue  measures  was  $30.4  million  while

economic expansion contributed most of the  balance

of $101.0 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury estimates of tax yields, as set out in

the  Estimates and explained in the Treasury paper,

indicate  that  increasing yields,  resulting  from

economic   growth,   will  be  adequate   to   meet

expenditure  increases. I therefore do not  propose

to  raise new taxes, apart from the recent increase

in  tobacco  duties  to bring  them  in  line  with

Malaysia. Singapore, contrary to the belief of many

Backbenchers,  is  a  lightly  taxed  country.  Tax

revenues  amount to about 13 per cent of G.N.P.  In

other countries they are much higher, as much as 30

per  cent  or more of G.N.P. in some instances.  So

long  as  we  maintain a robust  rate  of  economic

expansion  and  maintain government expenditure  to

essentials,  we  need not emulate  the  example  of

these highly taxed countries.



<br><br><i>The Near Future</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this glad news to the taxpayer out of the

way,  I  turn  to  look at our  immediate  economic

prospects.  It is important that we should  not  be

lulled  into a sense of false security by the  mild

boom  now  going on. There are dark clouds  on  the

horizon, and it is as well that we prepare for more

difficult times. The first adverse factor affecting

our  economy  over the next two years will  be  the

completion  of  the British military withdrawal  by

31st  December, 1971. In the next three years,  the

economy  of  Singapore will feel the  impact  of  a

decline of British military expenditure, from  $415

million in 1969 to zero in 1972. There is likely to

be a reduction of some $100 million to $150 million

for  this  year  and  a final phasing  out  of  the

remaining  $250  million to $300 million  in  1971.

While no longer the catastrophe we once feared they

would be, declines of expenditure of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



this magnitude cannot but have an unpleasant impact

on   our  economy.  In  1969,  the  reduction   was

estimated at some $40 million and was hardly felt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards world trade which, as we have

repeatedly    seen,    influences    our    economy

significantly,  it  is  unlikely  to  provide   the

substantial impetus to growth which it did  in  the

years  1968  and  1969. In these two  years,  world

trade expanded at unprecedented rates, 11 per  cent

and 14 per cent respectively. There is likely to be

a  slowing down of world trade in 1970. The  extent

of this is yet uncertain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of this uncertainty derives from the outlook

of  the  U.S. economy for this year. The  American

economy  is so large and powerful that fluctuations

in   its   level  of  activity  exercise  a  strong

influence on the economies of the rest of the world

outside  the  Communist bloc.  For  just  over  two

years,  the  American administration, in  the  last

year  of  President Johnson and the first  year  of

President  Nixon,  has  been  battling   with   the

problems   of  domestic  inflation  and   unsettled

balance of payments position. The l960s have seen a

sustained and powerful growth of the U.S. economy,

the  G.N.P. increasing from U.S. $503  billion  in

1960 to U.S. $932 billion in 1969. In the last four

years  of  the  decade,  as  the  American  economy

approached   and   reached  the   level   of   full

employment, inflationary pressures began  to  build

up.  These  pressures became grave,  when  military

expenditure in Vietnam was substantially  increased

as from 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With domestic price inflation there has also

occurred the inevitable concomitant - a squeeze  on

the  balance  of payments. Whereas, throughout  the

1950s and the first half of the 1960s, the American

balance  of  payments on trading account invariably

showed  an annual surplus of anything between  U.S.

$3  billion and $5 billion a year, the last year or

two  has  seen this reduced to very small  amounts,

quite  inadequate  to support  the  large  overseas

payments on account of American capital invest-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



ments abroad, expenditure by American tourists  and

government  expenditure  overseas,  including   aid

finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since December 1968, the Federal Reserve Board

has  begun  a  policy of severe  credit  restraint.

Because  of the strength and power of the  American

economy,  it  was only in the last few months  that

the tight money policy of the Federal Reserve Board

has  produced  visible  results.  There  have  been

significant reductions in the volume of  industrial

production,  in the volume of new construction,  in

expenditure  on  consumer  durables  and  a   small

increase   in  unemployment.  Yet  price  inflation

remains  alarmingly strong, at annual rates  of  54

per cent to 64 per cent in recent months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the slowing down and even decline in

several   of  the  important  economic  indicators,

investment plans of the large American corporations

and  in  the  public sector have not  so  far  been

reduced to the extent needed to dampen inflationary

pressure.  The demand for investable funds  in  the

face  of  the  tight money policy  of  the  Federal

Reserve  Board has resulted in the rise of interest

rates to historical heights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic trends in the next twelve months in the

United   States  are  difficult  to  predict.   The

administration economists visualise a levelling-off

of  growth measured in real terms, and increase  in

the  rate of unemployment from a low level of  some

3.3 per cent in some months last year to an average

level  of  4.3 per cent this year, perhaps reaching

5.0  per cent at the highest level. They do not see

any  recession  of  significant  proportions.  They

expect  price inflation to moderate from the annual

rate  of 54 per cent last year to around 4 per cent

or  44  per cent this year. They expect the economy

to  pick  up  momentum in the second half  of  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scenario, as set out by the administration,

is  probably the best development one can hope for.

If  events  follow the course as predicted  by  the

American  official  economists,  then  neither  the

world of advanced nations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



in  Europe  nor  the  less affluent  underdeveloped

countries  need  fear  a marked  decline  in  their

trading  positions. GATT (the General Agreement  on

Tariffs  and Trade) predicts that world  trade  may

increase this year by between 4 per cent and 8  per

cent. The O.E.C.D., optimistic as ever, forecasts a

10  per  cent growth. My own preference is for  the

GATT  forecast; if the outcome is near  the  higher

point  of  the GATT forecast range, there  probably

would be no unduly harsh impact on our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if events take a course different from

the U.S. official forecasts, it is likely to be for

the  worse  rather  than for the better.  Then  the

negative   factors  created  by   reduced   British

military expenditure will be compounded. These  are

matters  beyond our control. All we can  do  is  to

take  note  of  possible  dangers  looming  on  the

horizon and make due preparation for them. I cannot

but  underline  my warning against the  dangers  of

complacency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, the next three years may not be as

good   as  the  last  two.  Fortunately,  we   have

accumulated sufficient fat in the good years.



<br><br><i>The Longer-term Perspective</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the longer-term perspective,

looking  to  the  mid '70s and beyond.  Unless  the

stability  of  the area is seriously upset,  it  is

likely that we can sustain and even increase the momentum  of  industrial  growth  which  we  recently

achieved. The Promotion Centres established by  the

Economic  Development Board in Europe  and  America

and  Japan have gained good experience in the  last

few   years.  Unless  we  see  a  world  depression

developing  on  some scale - and the consensus  among

the   experts   is  that  this  is  an   improbable

eventuality - we shall see in the next  few  years,

the  fruition of many industrial projects, some  of

them  of  a  size exceeding anything that  we  have

hitherto  attained. The activities  connected  with

offshore  oil  exploration in  the  waters  of  the

Archipelago are likely to give rise to a number  of

interesting  manufacturing and  service  industries

based in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



The  problem we are likely to encounter between now

and  1975,  barring a recession of  course,  is  to

provide  the  large numbers and wide  varieties  of

skills which the new industries will need. In  this

connection, we have had the advantage of  a  recent

study  by  Dr Albert Winsemius who led  the  first

United  Nations  mission in 1960  to  Singapore  to

advise  on policies on industrial development.  Dr

Winsemius is an old friend of Singapore; in 1967 he

was  awarded the Distinguished Service  Medal.  Dr

Winsemius  pays regular visits to the Republic,  at

our request, to check on our economic health and to

discern problems ahead and suggest remedies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completed his last visit about a month ago.

His  prognosis  is  that the shortages  of  skills,

which  we  knew  existed, will become  increasingly

serious  and  more acute than we had believed.  For

instance,  his calculations indicate  that  despite

the  intention  of the University of  Singapore  to

increase the annual output of engineers from 80  at

present  to  210 by 1974, the Republic will  remain

short  of  engineers over the next  five  years  by

between 450 and 500 each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards management personnel, the output of

accountants and business management graduates  will

fall seriously short of requirements, the shortage,

in  Dr Winsemius' estimate, coming to some  200  a

year  over  the  next three years. As  regards  the

demand  for  technicians, who have to  support  the

efforts  of engineers, the position is even  worse.

Taking  into  account  the  large  requirements  of

technicians in the defence forces, we are likely to

be short of technicians by 1,500 to 2,000 each year

over the next two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These estimates are based on the assumption that

industrial  growth, now running at between  15  per

cent and 20 per cent a year, will be sustained over

the  next  five years. There is no reason why  this

cannot be done. By 1974, the industrial work  force

should  have  increased  to  around  247,000   men.

Further, as much of the increases will accrue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



from  the  establishment of large industrial  units

rather  than  a  proliferation of small  ones,  the

demand  for engineers, and management and technical

personnel will be of a different order of magnitude

from  what we have been accustomed to. This,  then,

will  be the principal difficulty which we have  to

overcome  - not so much to attract investment  into

the   manufacturing  industries   but   to   supply

investors  with  skilled personnel of  all  grades,

without which modern industry cannot operate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it takes four years for an engineering

student  to graduate and several more years  before

he  acquires sufficient experience to  be  able  to

work  effectively  in an organisation,  clearly  we

cannot depend on local supply to meet the demand in

these  fields. The problem is similar in regard  to

management  personnel and technical  staff,  though

here  local supply, if stepped up immediately,  may

be  able  to fill the gap earlier than is  possible

with engineers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary, as a matter of high

priority, that we should relax our immigration  and

work permit restrictions on the inflow of personnel

belonging  to  the categories I have described.  At

present,  they  are given entry  and  work  permits

provided they are sponsored by an employer. That is

to say, they have to find work here before they are

allowed the necessary permits. It would be a  clear

advantage to liberalise the conditions under  which

such   people  can  come  into  Singapore,  acquire

permanent  residence and eventual  citizenship.  It

would  be  useful, for instance, if they  could  be

allowed  here for any length of time they  wish  so

that  they can do the job-hunting and, in this way,

fit into the best slots available to them. This  is

a matter of great urgency, as it is well known that

a  great  amount of crimping already  takes  place.

Indeed, the Technical Education Department  of  the

Ministry  of  Education, which has to  train  large

numbers  of artisans and craftsmen, are finding  it

difficult to retain their engineers and technicians

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



have   to  do  the  training  at  the  Department's

Industrial  Training Centres, Vocational Institutes

and secondary technical schools. -



<br><br><i>University Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discussion of the ways in which we should

try  to  fill the gap between demand and supply  of

engineers  leads  me to two related  subjects.  The

first relates to the levels of scientific knowledge

and   technological  know-how  which   our   future

industries   are  likely  to  demand.  The   second

concerns  University development  in  Singapore  in

general  as  well  as  the  output  of  scientists,

engineers and technicians in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, there has been increasing

reference  in public as well as private discussions

to the need for Singapore to develop "science-based

and  technology-oriented industries". A  well-known

British  financial commentator recently  said  that

whenever  he hears the phrase "advanced  industrial

technology" he reaches for his gun. Too often  this

catch  phrase  is used as an attempt to  mulct  the

public   purse  of  sizable  subsidies  to  finance

industrial research which has no hope of  resulting

in  commercially feasible -products. I have a great

deal  of  sympathy  for  this  position,  but   for

different  reasons.  The use of  the  term  to  our

industries, existing as well as potential, is often

misleading.   As   an  -example,  the   electronics

industry  in  America  works at  the  frontiers  of

science  and technology. The electronic  components

we  make  in Singapore probably require less  skill

than  that required by barbers or cooks, consisting

mostly of repetitive manual operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not presume that at the comparatively low

level of scientific and technological know-how that

we  find  ourselves today, it is our role to  train

scientists  and  engineers  who  will   engage   in

research at the frontiers of -knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours should be the more mundane, if practical,

approach. In the foreseeable future, we are  likely

to set up those industrial activities which require

assiduous application of engineering skills



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



and  workmanship in well-developed  and  well-known

industrial  processes in which we  have  a  natural

advantage  by  being  able  to  produce  or  import

engineers,   technicians,  craftsmen  and   skilled

workers  capable  of performing the  most  exacting

standards of work but at a much lower cost than the

advanced  countries could. Even so, the  limitation

here  is  that restrictions may be imposed  on  the

import  of  quite  a  number of these  products  by

industrialised nations which want to  preserve  the

home market for their own industries. Further,  not

all  countries  would favour a policy  whereby  the

techniques which they have evolved as a  result  of

sustained and costly research and development  work

are   passed   on  to  others.  But   within   such

limitations, there could be a wide field to  choose

from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical application, even at these modest

levels   of   technology,  requires  a  substantial

upgrading  of skills at all levels - from  research

scientists,    engineers,   technicians,    skilled

craftsmen  -to  standards beyond anything  we  have

achieved  now. It is in this sense that  we  should

try  to  improve  our reservoir of  scientific  and

technological knowledge and experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me naturally to the subject of the

development   of   our   Universities   which   are

institutions  to  provide the requisite  people  to

perform  these tasks. It is one of the  misfortunes

of  Singapore  that  the  development  of  our  two

Universities  has encountered difficulties  in  the

past  which have stunted their growth. In the  case

of   Nanyang   University,  the  deterioration   of

administration  prior  to  1964  had  allowed   the

control  of the University virtually to  pass  into

the hands of student activists who were manipulated

by  the  Communist United Front. Nanyang University

virtually  became a training ground for the  higher

echelon  cadres  of  the  Communist  United  Front.

Government intervention as a security measure  then

became  inevitable.  Since the restoration  of  the

University's   administration   to   more    normal

standards,   improvements  have   been   made   and

standards have been raised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the University of Singapore was

different. Here, until recently and perhaps not even

then,  there  appeared to be  a  total  absence  of

meaningful dialogue between the University and  the

Government. The University, particularly in certain

departments  in  the  Faculty  of  Arts,  in  which

expatriate   staff  were  dominant,   viewed   the

Government not as a possible source of support  and

encouragement,  but  as a potential  danger  and  a

threat  to  its autonomy. Trivial incidents,  which

sometimes  arose as a result of poor communications

between  the two sides, were inflated  out  of  all

proportion  to their real importance. Part  of  the

trouble  seems to stem from the attitudes  of  some

expatriate staff who have brought with them  not merely    a   competence   in   their   field    of

specialisation  but also contemporary  styles  and

postures which may be meaningful in the context  of

strident  anti-establishment and liberal  postures.

In    part,    these    reflect   trends    towards

permissiveness  and promiscuity  in  the  societies

from which these expatriates came and to which they

belong.  But  these are totally irrelevant  to  the

situation Singaporeans are facing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of student population as well as the

increase  in  expenditures of the two  Universities

financed  from  Government revenues has  failed  to

keep  pace  with  the  expansion  of  the  economy.

Enrolment   at   the  two  Universities   and   the

Polytechnic  and  Ngee  Ann College  combined  grew

during  the decade from 9,355 to 16,214, a  73  per

cent  increase  as compared with  a  146  per  cent

increase in the Gross Domestic Product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matters had reached such a pass at the University

of  Singapore  that it was found  necessary  for  a

Cabinet   Minister  to  be  appointed   its   Vice-Chancellor. And yet, it may be that the appointment

of  my  colleague,  the Minister  for  Science  and

Technology,  could  be just the  step  required  to

restore  a  relationship of confidence between  the

University   and  the  Government   so   that   the

University can develop into an institution more  in

tune  with the needs of the society which  nurtures

it. There is welcome evidence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



that  the  student body and a growing part  of  the

academic staff are becoming aware of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly without his appointment to the post of

Vice-Chancellor, it is unlikely that my  colleagues

and  I  would  entertain the proposal to  move  the

University  at  enormous expense from  its  present

constricted  campus at Bukit Timah to  one  of  the

most  scenic sites in Singapore in the range  of

hills known as Kent Ridge. Since his appointment as

Vice-Chancellor, it has been increasingly  apparent

to  the  Government that the University would  need

more  funds  not only to expand existing  faculties

and  establish new ones, but also to  increase  the

pay  of  academic staff to levels which will ensure

that they will attract and retain the keenest minds

produced in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvements in similar measure are also

necessary   at   the   other  University,   Nanyang

University.  Here  the problem will  be,  for  some

considerable  time  to come,  to  recruit  Chinese-speaking   academic  staff  of  calibre  into   the

University.  While  Nanyang  graduates   who   have

returned  from  post-graduate studies  abroad  will

grow  in  strength and numbers, there  is  need  to

recruit  senior  staff in various disciplines.  The

field  of recruitment is much narrower than is  the

case  with  the  University of Singapore.  Further,

many  of  the best Chinese-speaking scientists  and

scholars  available today -outside of the  People's

Republic   of  China  are  engaged  in   industrial

research or academic teaching in the United  States

of  America. To attract them to Nanyang  University

would be both a complex and expensive exercise, but

some  method must be found of doing this if Nanyang

University were to develop in stature and repute as

a centre of scholarship and research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dwelt at some length on University

education.  The  subject arose out of  current  and

projected  shortages  of engineers  and  management

personnel   which   proper   university    training

programmes could in course of time help to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



solve. But universities have a more crucial role in

the  development process, if one takes a  long-term

view  of  it.  Let me set the subject in  its  true

perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made long and strenuous efforts to

attract foreign investment into Singapore, but  not

because  we need the money. The high level  of  our

overseas assets shows that we have more money  than

we  can  usefully  spend in Singapore.  We  welcome

foreign  investors  for the two things  they  bring

with  them  - technology and markets.  If  Singapore

were a large country, say, with a population of 100

million  and  endowed  with a  variety  of  natural

resources,  the  open  door  investment  policy  we

pursue  may  not be the best long-term  development

strategy. In such a situation we should develop  an

indigenous technology centred initially around  the

exploitation of natural resources. But  this  would

take  time, and would constrain the economy to slow

growth  rates  for possibly several  decades  while

universities  and  research  institutions  need  to

build up staff and expertise. But the pay-off would

come  in  the  end and most of it would  accrue  to

citizens of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our situation is the opposite to what I have

described.  An  open door policy is  one  which  at

least  ensures rapid growth right from  the  start.

When  foreign  corporations bring their  expertise,

what  we experience, as a developing nation,  is  a

brain-drain in reverse. Naturally we pay for  this.

We  pay  in  the form of profits and know-how  fees

remitted  abroad  and  high  salaries  to   foreign

management and technical personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the position we find ourselves in today

and  it is likely to persist into the mid-seventies

and, in lesser extent, even after that. It would be

wrong  for  us  to resent the inflow of  management

personnel,  engineers and technicians from  abroad.

On  the  contrary, we could regard them as  blazing

the  trail for the new industries which we  do  not

have  the  knowledge  and  technology  to  set   up

ourselves. We should also regard them as presenting

us not only with opportunities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



for   future  graduates  of  our  Universities  and

technical schools but also as performing invaluable

services in giving firm indications as to the lines

of  science  and  industrial technology  which  our

Universities   and  training  institutions   should

develop.  Without such clear indications, Singapore

might  make the mistake of other developing nations

in  producing large numbers of university graduates

who  cannot  find  useful employment.  Having  said

this,  I  need also say that in the long  term  the

scientific  know-how  and  technological  processes

which  we now borrow from abroad must in course  of

time   develop  on  an  indigenous  base   at   our

institutions of higher learning. This is  the  task

which  I see as deserving of high priority  in  the

coming decade. We must make good the neglect of our

universities  of  the  past decade  when,  for  the

reasons  I have explained, they did not participate

in  the exciting transformation of Singapore,  from

colony,  to  a State in a Federation,  and  then  a

Republic.
