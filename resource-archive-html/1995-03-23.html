  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, Members will recall that I have replied to a similar Question on Monday, 20th March 1995. Police is currently reviewing the NPP system taking into account shifts in population due to the setting up of new towns. The request by Encik Ibrahim Othman will be considered in the review.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, how long will the review take and can the Parliamentary Secretary inform the House when is it likely that they will consider my request seriously?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The entire review will be completed towards the end of 1996. But Police is looking into the situation to see whether, in the meantime, any new NPPs should be set up or any existing NPPs taken off. Over the next few months, the Police is likely to firm up some details.

  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman</b> asked the Minister for Education whether a primary school will be built in Bishan North Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are four primary schools serving Bishan New Town.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that of the four primary schools in Bishan, as stated by the Minister, none are in Bishan North? Would the Minister consider seriously giving us a primary school at the earliest date convenient?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the four schools I mentioned include Guangyang Primary School which still had vacancies at the end of the Primary 1 registration last year, despite it being a year for Dragon babies.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for National Development (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Sir, allow me to continue. The Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) started life in 1965. Then, it was known as the Urban and Rural Services Committee (URSC). At that time, and since then, the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs), on the ground, will determine what amenities are needed in the constituency and they will consult the PWD, Ministry of the Environment and other departments to request for improvements. If those works are within the budget and within the work plan of the departments, then those works
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will be carried out. If the requests are reasonable but the budget provided is not sufficient, then the CCC would apply to the CIPC for funding.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CCC does not decide what they can have. They put in an application and the CIPC will evaluate and consult the relevant departments whether these are feasible, whether they can serve the residents effectively and efficiently and based on the budget available, the CIPC will decide whether the constituency can have the money. This money is given to the CCC to be disbursed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Members asked: why not give this money to the town councils? The answer is very simple. The town councils, by law, can only work within the boundaries of the HDB estates, in particular, within the common areas of the HDB estate and if we give the money to the town councils, then the private estates and privately-run commercial and industrial areas will never get this money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not give it to the MP? The answer is no again because CIPC funds are public funds and in disbursing public funds we have to give them to a public body to be disbursed. No money is given to any MP, Opposition or PAP, for such purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek clarification? First of all, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has gone back to the old story and standard answer of the CIPC. Mr Chiam and I did not say that the money should be given to the MP or the town council. What we are asking is simply the procedure of application to CIPC. Yes, money should be given to a public body because it is public money. Is the town council not a public body?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, may I clarify? The situation from 1965 has changed tremendously. There are at the moment four constituencies held by the Opposition and probably there will be more in time to come. If you keep to this procedure, on the face of it, it would appear that all these Opposition constituencies will never get CIPC funds for community projects because members of the CCCs are all selected by the People's Association (PA). Unfortunately, PA is not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> under the Ministry of National Development. It is under the Ministry of Community Development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at PA, which is a statutory board, the Chairman of PA is the Prime Minister and Ministers are on the board. It is a very high-powered board. This board will select the members of the CCC. The CCCs will, in a way - I would not say beholden - have to look to the people who have appointed them. These are all political figures. Their action will definitely be politically-biased. They will certainly not approve something which will help the Opposition MPs. I think that is the crux of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we wrote to the CCC for support to apply for CIPC funds, they not only refused us but they have not even got the courtesy to give a reason. The usual standard Government answer: We have looked at your application. We are unable to accede to it. We asked three times for reasons because Potong Pasir has so far not benefited anything at all from CIPC funds and there is a need for community projects, because community projects, especially linked walkways, are built in other constituencies. If other constituencies have a need for covered walkways, why not Potong Pasir? It is within the guidelines. That is the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, when I brought up this problem the last time, the Minister conveniently said that CCC was not under his charge. So I should not ask him how they approve and not approve. The Ministry of National Development is the ministry that disburses the funds and yet it is another ministry that gives the approval. Again, there is some irregularity here. Perhaps the CCC should not be made an approving body in the first instance. Maybe, as we have suggested yesterday, it should be the MP himself. Normally, the MPs are the advisors in other constituencies and the CCC in a way will take the advice of the MP. So why not cut away the CCC and let the MP, who is the elected Member, make the application or approve it? If the MP does not know the wishes of the grassroots, then he should not be the MP at all. If he cannot read the ground, I am afraid
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> he will probably be voted out in the next election. There is no other person who has got more interest in these projects than the MP himself if he wants to remain an MP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the procedure be corrected and put the MP to be the person either to approve or to make the application. The town councils can make the application and approval given by the MP, just like MPs have approved many other applications. I would suggest this to the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, I have listened to the comments by both Opposition Members very carefully but they have not listened to my comments carefully. I have said why the money should not be given to the town council. By law, the town council is confined to working within the boundaries of an HDB estate. It cannot do work outside of the estate and it cannot spend money outside of the estate. So giving CIPC money to the town council does not help those who live outside of HDB estates. So that is out of the question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's quarrel with PA and how the CCC is structured, I suggest he raise this under his cut on the CCC. But to suggest that because he is in Parliament, therefore, we must change a long lasting and long established practice which has worked very well is not necessary. The point is, from MND's position, we have got these funds to subsidize improvement projects. We look for a body within the constituency that can coordinate various requests and help disburse the funds. Where is this body? There is one, which is the CCC, and it was established a long time ago. The URSC had worked very well with the CCCs all this while.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam says conditions have changed. It is not the same as 1965. I am glad conditions have changed. There were more Opposition Members in 1965 than there are now. So his suggestion about changing the rules is not based on sound arguments. All he wants is the control of the money. The CIPC and URSC have never given money direct to MPs. We do not give them to PAP MPs. We do not give them to Opposition MPs. I do not think we need to change the rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, on this point that in 1965 we had more Opposition MPs, I think if you read the history of the PAP there was a split at that time and the Barisan Sosialis MPs were no longer interested in being MPs. In that period, they were trying to work their way out and, in fact, they did. In 1965, they all walked out of Parliament. So they were not interested in any community projects. But we are. The present Opposition Members are keen to improve all their constituencies.
  <br>12.45 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My quarrel is that under the present system it would appear that no Opposition MPs will get any taxpayers' fund through the CIPC. That is my contention. As long as you have this checkpoint at the CCC, none of the Opposition Members can get through this checkpoint. They will be blocked right from the start, and no funds will be disbursed to any of the Opposition MPs. That is really unfair, because those funds are not PAP funds. They are taxpayers' funds. I think there should be a new system. Probably you allocate the fund pro rata. For so many voters in your constituency they will give you this amount. I think that is the fairest system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary says it is not fair if funds are not allocated for improvements in private estates. Is it not true that CIPC also provides funding for community projects which are done in HDB estates? The funds are used for HDB estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regard private estates, is it not also the elected MP's responsibility to look after the private estates? They could also suggest improvements in the private estate should the need arise. So why is it that application for funds should be given to the CCC for approval because we are also looking after the private estates?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, Mr Low does not understand my answer. I shall repeat it. We cannot give the money to the town council because the town council can only spend money and work within the HDB estate. So if we give the money to the town council, none of this money can be used in private estates.

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Senior Parliamentary Secretary does not understand my clarification. So far, the CIPC has never given any money to town councils, even for the PAP wards. You provide funds for upgrading community projects to the HDB estates. The fund is used for improvement works in HDB estates. What we are asking is that you allow the town council or the MP concerned to submit the application directly to CIPC for funds and the CIPC decides whether it is going to provide the funds for a particular project. That is what we are asking. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary has called for fine-tuning of the system yesterday and a proposal has been put forward by us. I would like to know his position on that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, the town council cannot put up a proposal and ask for money for improvement works outside of an HDB estate. That is the simple position, as provided by the law. Mr Chiam understands that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Thank you. On Mr Chiam's question, all I want to say is this. Mr Chiam does not want this money to be used in a politically motivated manner. So the best solution for all of us is, let us give this money to the CCC, as we have done since 1965 and let the CCC recommend and decide on its priorities. The money does not go to the PAP MP and it does not go to the Opposition MP. It is fair for all. So my position on Mr Chiam's and Mr Low's suggestion is that there is no need to change the present system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> First of all, yes, the town council's funds cannot be used outside the HDB estate. The town council could, through the MP, look at the private estate and put up a proposal to the CIPC for improvements. Why can it not be done? Or the MP himself can put up the proposal. What is wrong with that? The fund is not going to the town council. It is a CIPC fund. I am not saying that you give
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the money to the town council. What I am saying is that you allow the town council to apply. There is no need for the CCC to apply. Allow the town council or the MP to apply for funds for certain projects and you consider whether it is viable. If you do not think so, explain why. Rather than going through the CCC and the CCC says, "We do not support your application." When we wrote in and asked for the reasons, they replied, "No need to give you the reason." I think this is not fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister talks about the CCC. I have an amendment on the CCC and I will talk more about it. But he says that the CCC is not politically motivated. I think most CCCs, if not all, are highly politically motivated. This is proven by the fact that I have been an MP at Potong Pasir for nearly 10 years and the CCC has not lifted a finger to apply for CIPC funds. The best person to get things moving in a constituency must be the MP. It cannot be anybody else. If he wants his seat, he must do something. If he does not do anything, he will be kicked out. Whereas for the CCC, it makes no difference to them. So the CCC is not the best body.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to repeat myself. As the system exists now, all the Opposition wards will not get any CIPC fund, and that is the reality. I have already mentioned that even in Hougang, before the Opposition MP came in, they were eagerly applying for funds. As soon as the Opposition Member came in, they say, "No, withdraw all the funds." That proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the CCC has got no interest to improve the constituencies under Opposition MPs. So if you have this system, Opposition wards will not get one cent of the CIPC fund. That is the problem. So if the Minister can solve this problem, I shall be very happy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> May I suggest to Mr Low that he discontinues with his line of questioning because it makes no sense and he knows it, but he does not want to give up.

  <br> the Town Councils Act and see whether the town councillors are charged with the responsibility of looking after the entire constituency or looking after the common areas of the HDB estate. After that, he may wish to file another motion or Question and we can have another debate on it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Chiam, his quarrel is really with his CCC in Potong Pasir. I do not hear this quarrel from the other Opposition Members with their own CCC. He has got an amendment under the CCC subhead and I suggest that he brings this up under that amendment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> An easy way out.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> It is not an easy way out. I have said this before, and I say this again. Public funds are involved. Here is the CIPC fund. What do we do with this fund? We want to let the constituencies enjoy the use of this fund. We go to a public body that can disburse this fund and coordinate the projects in a proper manner. The CCC exists for this purpose and we will continue to keep contact with the CCC, look at the recommendations and decide whether they should get the money or not.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's proposal does not get the support of the CCC of Potong Pasir. It is not the concern of the CIPC. The CIPC's job is to look at applications and make sure that the applications are reasonable, feasible and effective, and give the fund in support of these projects.

  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I do understand the town council's main responsibility. It is for the HDB estate. It is under the Act. But the private estate is part of the town. Is it not part of the town? You call it a town council. It is part of the town. You cannot, of course, apply for funds for improvement works in a private estate.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes, it is only for HDB estates. I understand that. I have no quarrel with that. What I am saying is that private estates, being part of the town, the town council can show concern and put up a proposal if the CIPC allows. We are not talking about using town council's
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I think the answer from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is rather unsatisfactory. His Ministry controls the fund and of the two Ministries, MCD and MND, I would say that MND should be the Ministry that should initiate a change on the procedure of application for CIPC funds because it is controlling the purse strings. It is not MCD. So I would urge the Minister not to pass the buck over to MCD and say, "It is none of my Ministry's concern. Let them solve it." I would say the buck ends with MND.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to take the initiative to change this system of application for CIPC funds. I repeat myself again. If this system is not changed, none of the Opposition MPs would get any assistance from CIPC for funds for community projects. Can I urge the Minister to initiate the change?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, I just want to clarify from the Member. Before we debate further on whether the responsibility of approving funds for improvement works in the Opposition constituencies should fall with MND or MCD, I think we should get back to the basic question. The general care of the constituency must be the responsibility of the MP. I do not think the Member should pass the buck from our shoulders to MND or MCD. Sir, the complaint made by the Opposition Members, Mr Chiam and Mr Low, is basically that the Opposition wards could not get funds from CIPC for improvement works in their constituencies. In other words, because of this situation, the Members now complain that they
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cannot do anything to improve the surroundings of the housing estates in their wards. I thought that was the question that was raised because of the current position of funding by CIPC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, improvements in many constituencies have been made even before CIPC was formed some years ago, and Members of Parliament in this House, whether PAP or Opposition, have done whatever they could to improve their constituencies. The Members of the Opposition have just said that without the CIPC fund, they are ineffective as MPs. They are now trying to pass the buck to MND and MCD. It is not fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, we did not say that no improvement works have been done. I think Mr Chiam will agree that the crux of the issue is the system of application which allows only the CCC within the constituency to submit the application. The CCC, given its affiliation to the PAP, will never support Opposition wards and therefore the application of public fund is biased towards the PAP constituencies. As a result, it is unfair. That is the crux of the issue. That is why I was very happy yesterday when the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said, "Well, put up a proposal to fine-tune the system." Yes, we have put up a proposal to improve the system. Now I would like to know whether the Senior Parliamentary Secretary agrees with our proposal. If he does not agree, why does he not agree that we change the system to allow town councils or MPs to apply directly to CIPC? Of course, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, being the Chairman of CIPC, we may not get the fund applied for because he can reject it. But never mind. At least he is in Parliament. We can come to Parliament and ask him for justification as to why he refuses to approve certain projects. It is better than going to MCD and MCD says something else. I would like to have an answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> I have actually applied for CIPC funds. I am an advisor to the grassroots organisation as well as the MP. As far as most of us are concerned here, I think we are very happy with the system and if we are so happy with the system, why change it.

  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Let me finish. I think the grassroots organisations know exactly what is happening in the constituency. They have RC and CCC members, most of whom are local residents. They know exactly which spot to be improved. It is not the MPs because we do not stay in our own constituency. So I think it is better to leave it to RCs and CCCs to come up with proposals which we all are very happy. If Mr Chiam has any proposal in regard to the application of CIPC fund, he should approach Mr Gan and Mr Gan will decide in consultation with the RC and CCC members. If it is reasonable, I am sure the Chairman of CIPC will be more than pleased to approve.

  <b>The Chairman:</b> Do you have any fresh points to make?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Yes, Sir. This fresh point, in fact, was indirectly raised by Mr Low. Now he is saying that it is the responsibility of the PAP Government to help the Opposition Members so that they can win the next election. This was what he said. But that does not come under the MND budget, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I have a fresh point to make with regard to Encik Maidin's comments. Of course, by virtue of the system of CIPC, it is the PAP Government's responsibility to make sure that the PAP win the next election and thereby deprive the Opposition wards of funds to improve the estate. Therefore,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> during the election you can compare and say, "You see, the Opposition has not done much to improve your constituency."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fresh point is with regard to Mr Choo Wee Khiang's comments. I regret to say that it seems to me that Mr Choo's grassroots know more about his constituents' needs than Mr Choo himself. I advise him not to rely too much on the grassroots leaders. Of course, I respect some of them who are really working for the people. But I think that may be his downfall.

  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, I agree with my PAP colleagues in their unanimous response to Mr Low. Please read the Act and then come back.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's point, if I can summarise it, is this. The Ministry of National Development should change the system because under the present system, the Opposition constituencies will never get any funding from CIPC. That is the point. The day the CIPC approves funding for any project in any Opposition constituency will prove his point wrong. When the day comes, I hope he withdraws all that he says. With that, Sir, at this point, it is not necessary to change the system. It has worked well and it will continue to work well.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, would you like to wind up the debate?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, Mr Maidin, I think, makes the issue stand on its head. He asked why the Opposition wards need CIPC funding when they can carry on with whatever funds they have and do something. I think he should reverse it and say that all the CIPC funds be given to the Opposition wards and let all the PAP wards do the funding on their own. Why does he not reverse the argument?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is Mr Choo Wee Khiang of Jalan Besar GRC said that he is very happy with the system. Of course, he is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> happy with the system because he is having all the funds and we are not having it. I am astounded that he makes such a statement. As a senior Member of this House, I would advise Mr Choo that if he does not know his constituency better than his grassroots, I think he had better watch out at the next election.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I thank you for your indulgence, Sir, and withdraw the amendment.

  <br>
  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua):</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, the further prosperity and progress of Singapore must be established on happy families, a more cohesive society and a more united people. In building up the spiritual civilisation and a cohesive society, the Ministry of Community Development plays a very important role. At a time when we are stressing on regionalisation and internalisation, we must not forget our roots. While enjoying a good material life, we must not forget to help those who are less educated and less fortunate among us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, the Ministry of Community Development must also reflect the views of the people to explain the Government's policies and strengthen the bond between the Government and the people. The Ministry has also to promote family values, look after the young and the old, sports facilities, the handicapped and the community needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every year there has been an increased budget for this Ministry, I think
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> with so much to do, $300 million is not much because this only constitutes 1.9% of the annual budget of $18.5 billion. So I would like to know whether the Government can consider giving more money to this Ministry for all its activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that my colleagues will not say that I am too soft-hearted. Of course, I agree that we should not have too much handouts and make people lazy, but our activities must be done through incentives, education and assistance. Under all these premises, we help our people to help themselves to become self-reliant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these premises, I would like to raise a few points. In the inculcation of family values and social values, what kind of measures will the Government take to promote the social and core values of the family? I would suggest that the Ministry take the initiative to link up with the youth groups, the trade unions and the community leaders to educate the public, the young, the old, and the couples on how to live together happily in harmony. Because in this highly commercialised society, members of the family are constantly facing very heavy pressure. Our Family Service Centres should take the initiative to strengthen education of the family so that they would not break up the family ties. To wait for the family to break up before stepping in to mediate may be just too late.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undeniably, our Women's Charter has gone a long way in enhancing the social status of women in society. In terms of education, employment and social status, I think our women have enjoyed a better position. But, unfortunately, there are still some women who come from broken families and they are hard put in terms of livelihood. They are quite helpless. I would like to request the Minister to amend the relevant provisions of the Women's Charter to help this group of women.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to ask how the Ministry of Community Development could promote a family-friendly policy. Over the last few years, the Ministry has already done a lot to promote social and friendly values. But I think we should
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> strengthen our care for the children, the aged, the handicapped, etc. For the children, I think child care centres and creches are very important because a lot of couples are working to maintain a certain standard of living. So creches and child care centres play a very important role here. But many of these families have an income of less than $2,000 and they cannot afford to pay for such services. Therefore, they would not be able to make use of the facilities of these child care centres and creches. I would therefore suggest that the subsidies should be raised for these children so that their mothers can go back to work. They can be encouraged to bear more children and, at the same time, do not have to be over-reliant on foreign maids.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ageing population - I have another cut later on - I would just deal, in passing, on the subsidy for the old people. The Ministry of Community Development provides a lot of services for the old. The grants of the Government come to about 55%. For those families with an income of less than $2,000, it is quite difficult to send their old parents to this kind of centre. I hope that we would try our best to increase the subsidy to help the lower-income families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the handicapped and unfortunate children, they need special care from their families. But according to my understanding, the facilities for them are very limited. For example, I have a resident who has to send her handicapped child to Newton to attend special school from Jurong East and she has to work half-day. Child care centres do not normally accept these handicapped children because they need special care, and the centres do not have the means to do it. To the lower income group with handicapped or retarded children, I think it is very, very difficult. They face great hardship. So I hope that the Ministry will do an overall review on the distribution of these facilities and equipment for the retarded and handicapped children. I hope that the Government will give subsidy or grant to trade unions and other civic organisations to help in this area.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to deal with drug addiction. The Government has already
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> set up a committee to prevent drug addiction, to help boost the confidence of the drug addicts and enable them to return to a normal life. Some women face great financial and social hardship because their husbands or children are drug addicts. I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any new plan in the pipeline to help these women. What is the progress in the Ministry's review of the drug problem in Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On welfare facilities and public assistance, I believe that the Government has a whole string of schemes in store. For example, we have the bursary, CDAC, 25th Anniversary grant, all kinds of subsidies and rebates, but when it comes to application for such assistance, the applicants find themselves facing a lot of problems. For example, if the family's income is more than $2,000, it will be very difficult for them to apply for a bursary. The CDAC only helps families whose combined income is less than $1,000. A family staying in a 3-room flat qualifies for public assistance, but I think most of the time their applications are rejected. Although these people have a family income of between $1,000 and $2,000 and they live in a 3-room flat, if the husband or the wife or any member of the family is suffering from some prolonged chronic illness like kidney disease, they just cannot make ends meet. They are helpless. So I hope that in handling the application for public assistance, the department concerned can be more flexible so that these poor people can find our Government to be more humane.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to talk about human resources and financial resources. The Ministry of Community Development has a lot of plans to carry out but I do not know whether we have enough professionals and volunteers to implement such policies and plans. I hope the Government can give some incentives to encourage more people to take part in voluntary work. At the same time, the Ministry should link up with the Ministry of Education to get more students to spend at least two to three days each year on voluntary work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On financial resources, we know that the various charitable organisations have
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> been actively raising funds every year. In order for these fund-raising campaigns to succeed, they need very good publicity, and such publicity is normally done through the mass media, like the newspapers, radio, TV, etc.

  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, the welfare programme of the Ministry of Community Development aims to develop a compassionate and caring society through the participation of volunteers and the community at large.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, towards this end, I am very happy to note that for the financial year 1995/96, there is an increase of 44.7% in the Ministry's budget over the previous year. As a percentage of GDP, the Ministry's share will now increase from 0.24% to 0.31% over last year. This is a good sign.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's record in most areas of activity, be it in the administration of the port, airport, telecommunications, is excellent. In fact, we are No. 1 in many fields. I would like to see the day when we are rated No. 1 for looking after the disadvantaged among us. We are not a poor country and also we need not go to the other extreme of giving handouts in the form of State welfare. We have to strike a judicious balance. In any society, there will be a percentage in the population that needs special attention. We are not alone in this. It is, therefore, very important for the Government to play a major role in looking after the needs of the disadvantaged in our midst.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal for many helping hands, as spelt out by the former Minister for Community Development, is a good one and should be encouraged and supported by all. But I believe that the biggest hand must be that of the Government. Some believe that the Government's hand is getting smaller and, in some cases, even becoming invisible.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, I would like to pay tribute to all the volunteers and voluntary organisations for their sacrifice and dedication to help the disadvantaged. Whilst they are happy doing this, many feel that a good part of their energy and time is spent on fund raising. Their time and specialist knowledge could certainly be put to better use. More generous funding from Government will help to alleviate this area. Secondly, corporations and the more generous in our society are constantly asked to fork out donations for one charity or another, be it the Community Chest, children's home, welfare home, Kidney Foundation, you can keep on going.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are, by nature, very generous and I believe many are beginning to feel the overload. There is a case for greater Government involvement in this area. I believe more hands will be forthcoming if the big hand of Government sticks up in front. I would appeal to the Minister to persuade his colleague, the Finance Minister, to make more funds available for voluntary organisations. If generous funding is available from Government, I believe more can be done to help the poor and disadvantaged by the volunteers and voluntary organisations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said this, I would like to ask the Minister for Community Development whether his Ministry has any new plans and programmes to take care of the disadvantaged amongst us? Secondly, I would like to know what has happened to the 25th Anniversary Endowment Fund. How much has been disbursed and to whom? Are there any plans to have a 30th Anniversary Charity Fund with Government matching dollar for dollar?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, Singaporeans are looking at better homes, bigger cars and a better quality of life. They discuss about their vacations, their clubs and the restaurants they frequent. Unfortunately, there is a small segment of Singaporeans who can never make ends meet, let alone think about these matters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Assistance (PA) scheme is meant to help some of these financially distressed to regain their independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Under the current PA scheme, the quantum given is really meagre. I think that if MCD is sincere in helping them gain their independence, there is much more that can be done to help these families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the PA rates should be revised to a more realistic figure. Before MCD tries to convince us that the PA figures are realistic, why does it not ask some of its officers to try subsisting on PA rates in present day Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the benefits given to Singaporeans, in terms of rebates and SOTUS, often do not benefit the low income group. MCD should ensure that these families are not disadvantaged when benefits are given out. MCD must be proactive and devise measures to pass some of these benefits to those on public assistance. Otherwise, the poor will get poorer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, MCD should also provide assistance in obtaining skills training for those who are able to work and to give them a salary during this period of skills training. This will make it easier for them to find a job and be independent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, MCD should liaise with the bus companies and SMRT, or MRTC, to allow free transportation for these low income families while they are on Public Assistance. For example, under the current scheme, a two-person household of two adults is given a grant of $240 per month. If they have to travel a long distance to work, the transportation costs alone can easily take up one third to half of the grant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, with such a big budget surplus, it is difficult to convince such families that enough has been done. If not given sufficient assistance, the gap between these families and the rest of Singapore will widen. Subsidy and welfarism are not dirty words to be shunned. If applied selectively and correctly, we can help these low income families enjoy the fruits of Singapore's success without creating a welfare mentality.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Imram bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Imram bin Mohamed (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, presently over 2,700 disadvantaged families are receiving public
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> welfare assistance. The allowance they receive varies from $155 per month for a single-person household to a maximum of $445 per month for a family of four or above. As Dr Lim has just mentioned, the amount is not quite enough to meet the daily needs. Thus, many of them receive additional assistance mainly in kind from voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs). The recipients of PA are not allowed to take up any form of employment, otherwise their allowance will cease. I feel the scheme works against the principle of promoting self-reliance. There are no incentives for recipients to seek jobs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is understandable for the old and the infirm. However, those who are able should be encouraged to be self-dependent, even partially. They should be given the opportunity to supplement their income. May I suggest that the PA recipients be allowed to work part-time in voluntary welfare organisations without losing their financial assistance. They could work as cooks, cleaners, receptionists, child-minders, and so on. In this way, they will be earning their supplementary income instead of simply receiving them as handouts from the VWOs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, in the last decade, the number of child care centres run by the voluntary welfare organisations, the trade unions and the private sector has grown significantly,. However, the demand for child care centres in the new towns has become more acute. Many of the young parents in the new towns have to wait for a long time for places to admit their children in these child care centres. The Ministry is not as proactive as it should be. I would want to find out what are the plans that the Ministry is making in meeting the anticipated demand for child care places in the new towns.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect which requires attention is that the subsidy for child care has not been reviewed in the last two years and the cost for child care has increased quite significantly. The average cost is about $350 a month. The subsidy from Government is about a third of this amount and therefore a large number of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> working class parents have found increasing burden in trying to find access to the use of child care centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that the child care facilities provide an overall net gain to families, particularly to the working class. Otherwise many of these children would remain as latchkey children and, in the longer term, it will have consequential effects on the well-being of our community as well as the nation. I feel that easy access to these child care facilities is indeed important because children can socialise and get a better headstart when they go to school. I am of the opinion that the Ministry should request the Ministry of Finance to increase the subsidy for child care services so that a larger proportion of the working class can gain access to such a service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out what plans the Ministry of Community Development has to revise the child care subsidies as well as to make long-term plans for the development of child care services, particularly in the new towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, increasingly, in many families, both parents are working adults. This raises social concerns that need to be addressed. When the children are young, there are child care facilities to enable the children to be looked after. MCD has, to its credit, provided subsidies to enable child care facilities to be made affordable to most.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a need for a school-going child to be looked after so that -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the child will not be led astray by bad company before and after school hours;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the child will be able to spend his spare time in a constructive manner; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the parents can continue working without having to worry about the safety of their children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As school-going children are at an impressionable age, the Government should invest in programmes, such as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> before-and-after-school-care (BASC) programmes to ensure that the school-going child's spare time is used wisely and he will learn good values. It is definitely a better alternative than having school children who join bad company and spend their spare time loafing in shopping centres, billiard saloons and video arcades.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister should consider the following measures to promote BASC:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Capital grants to voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) to set up centres to provide for before-and-after-school-care services in housing estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Operating subsidies to VWOs to hire staff to operate this service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To provide subsidies for lower income families who wish to use this service. It is the lower income families where it may be important for both parents to be wage earners. Instead of an across-the-board subsidy of a fixed quantum for each child, the VWO operating the BASC service may be given a subsidy and they are allowed to exercise discretion to subsidise the child according to his family's income status.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easy way out for the Ministry is to say that the current incentives are sufficient. However, if the Ministry considers it important to provide subsidies for child care centres, it should also consider this service as an extension of child care. As this is the age where children are most impressionable, it is all the more important that the Ministry should provide sufficient incentives for voluntary welfare groups to develop BASC.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to make child care facilities more accessible and affordable for children from poor and disadvantaged homes. According to the 1990 Census statistics, about one in 10 households in Singapore was either in poverty or vulnerable to poverty. These households have a monthly income of less than $200 per person in the household. I am sure the Minister is well aware of these statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children of low-income families, economically and socially deprived, often do not have an equal start as their better-off counterparts. The latter are often exposed to intellectually stimulating play early in their lives compared to children of low-income families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten classes only provide two hours of school and this is not enough to provide adequate early childhood education for the poor and disadvantaged children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report on "The Importance of Early Education" identifies reasons why it is crucial to be provided an early start:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Good and early education leads to later educational success. Among the three ethnic groups, Malay children followed by Indian children have the lowest rate of enrolment in child care centres. This could be one factor that has led to Malay and Indian children being under-achievers in school.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Early child care provides socialisation experiences, as Dr Vasoo has just said, which according to the study, reduces the risk of later juvenile delinquency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, by providing child care facilities, mothers are provided an opportunity to go back into the workforce, thereby allowing an increase in household income. Statistics from DOS show that for 43% of low-income dual career couples, the wife provides 50% of the family income. The present child care subsidy of $130 per child is not enough for these poor families, especially if they have two children needing child care facilities. Even with the subsidy, poor families cannot afford child care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that besides the child care subsidy of $130 for working mothers, in 1993, a new scheme was introduced called the centre-based financial assistance scheme. And this is targeted at low-income families. With this scheme, there is a two-tier subsidy scale of $50 or $100, depending on the net income of the family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are not enough places for low cost child care in Singapore, and this is what the Ministry has to look into.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> We could try to emulate a model child care system that has emerged from Japan. Parents pay according to a sliding scale, depending on their income, with the poorest family getting free whole day child care and the wealthiest paying $570 per month. The system is subsidised, but this is justified as an investment in the future of the children themselves. At first, the purpose was to help the working mothers, but Japan has realised that the main function of the child care centres is to help the children themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we, in Singapore, can also come to the same realisation, then we will have to make changes in our policies regarding subsidy towards child care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing an adequate number of places in child care centres will not make child care accessible to economically deprived families. Adequate financial subsidies that will contribute to making child care affordable for all families is really the key. What I am asking for is not for more child care places in general but, specifically, for more low cost child care places. Instead of having selective child care centres catering to the low-income families, I am suggesting that 5-10% of all child care centres reserve places for subsidised low cost child care. MCD could have this instituted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Minister to peg child care subsidies to the parents' income so that children of poorer families will get much larger subsidies. It is more important for children from low-income and disadvantaged families to attend whole day child care than it is for their peers from better-off families. I am sure that the Minister is aware of this crying need for this levelling up of society and should therefore earnestly consider this appeal for the less fortunate children in our society.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, much has been said about the issues, problems and challenges of our aging population. We have come out with plans to try and tackle the problems which we will be facing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is whether there are comprehensive plans to deal with the problems of the aged and to enable families to cope
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> better with the problems of their aged parents. I think this matter will become very acute in the decade ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also have a growing number of aged who will be retiring in the next decade, and there will be surplus manpower available. There are very little comprehensive programmes to tap this valuable manpower resource and to provide opportunities for many of them to be involved in gainful as well as other useful community activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we have various viewpoints and plans to deal with the problems of the aged. There is a need to look at this whole issue more comprehensively so that we will be able to deal with the different types of aged. We have the go-go aged, the go-slow aged, the slow-slow aged and the no-go aged. In this context, one has got to look at how we can provide plans to deal with this whole aging problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has up to date been segmental in dealing with some of the needs of the aging population. The challenge before us is to come out with more comprehensive plans to deal with the problems. As I see it, no amount of institutional provision is going to solve the problems of care of the aged. There is a need to enable families to continue to look after their aged parents. In this connection, the Ministry should see how families can be supported to enable them to continue to look after their aged parents within their home and in the community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own assessment is that the service in the direction of community care is rather thin and it needs to be strengthened. The Ministry perhaps may have to be more visible in this direction. And more comprehensive community care programmes and community support programmes should be planned to meet with the challenges ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the response from the Minister in terms of the Ministry's overall plan towards developing community based programmes to deal with the aging population.

  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, may I take my two cuts together?

  <b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, the number of aged in Singapore will increase significantly and this can, of course, pose a social problem in the future, as presently most families are small families. Therefore, there must be measures to encourage our senior citizens to keep healthy, live a more active lifestyle and the Ministry must assist Singaporeans in looking after their aged sick.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are always elderly Singaporeans who do not have dependants and are too elderly to work. These older generation Singaporeans have no CPF and may not have savings. If they were to depend on the meagre public assistance, there is not much to look forward to every day. Surely, having given the best years of their life to the nation, it is not too much for the nation to give them something to look forward to in their twilight years. For those without a home to call their own, the Ministry should work closely with HDB to provide rental flats at special rates. The Ministry should also work with HDB to provide shelter for the elderly widow or widower who may otherwise be deprived of a rental flat when their loved ones depart. The Ministry should also work with voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) to adopt these families on a long-term basis to add meaning to the lonely years of these elderly Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In encouraging our elderly to be more active, there are several concessions for senior citizens and there is also a Senior Citizens' Week to recognise the importance of senior citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is much more that can be done to encourage the elderly to be active. The bus services and SMRT give concessions to senior citizens during off peak periods only. If senior citizens are encouraged to work, they will have to use these services during the peak periods. They are also likely to earn a lower income. If they have to pay full rates, it may not be financially sound for them to continue with their lowly paid jobs. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> bus companies and SMRT should consider extending the concessions throughout the whole day and not limiting it to off peak hours. Many senior citizens feel that this should be so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been given to understand from senior SBS officials that SBS is not against this idea. I think TIBS and SMRT should also not oppose this proposal. In an earlier debate, the Minister for Communications said that he would refer the matter to the PTC. I suggest that we take the bull by the horns; if SBS is not against this idea, let them extend the concession hours. If TIBS and MRTC are not willing to extend the concession hours, let them differ in their opinion and explain their position to the public. We do not need to get a consensus from all three organisations to get things moving. I hope that the Minister will look into this issue and take this up with the Ministry of Communications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Citizens' Week should be an activity that senior citizens should look forward to every year. It should not be a week that activities are organised, and senior citizens are sent in organised bus loads to the site of activities to make the event happen. It should be a week in which senior citizens from all over Singapore should spontaneously come out to the streets to celebrate the event. This can only happen if the Government, statutory boards and the private sector are committed to making this event a success. Places of interest such as the Jurong Bird Park, the Singapore Zoological Gardens, museums, Sentosa and other places of interest should provide free entry to all senior citizens and even have organised activities at these places to suit the needs of senior citizens. All public entertainment areas such as cinemas should provide free tickets to senior citizens during this period. All these places of interest and places of entertainment will benefit as it is likely that the senior citizens will be brought there by their children and even their grandchildren. The bus companies and SMRT should also allow free transport services to all senior citizen pass holders during this period. Hotels and restaurants should give special discount to senior citizens during this period with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the aim of making it a memorable week for them and not with the aim of commercial gain. If the Government, the statutory boards and the private sector are sincere in making the Senior Citizens' Week a success, they must be forthcoming and supportive of measures to make this event a memorable and successful one. As they say, charity begins at home and therefore Government, statutory boards and Government-linked companies should take the lead.
  <br>1.45 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In encouraging the senior citizens to be more active, MCD should also consider expanding the facilities and staffing to Senior Citizens Centres under the CCC or CC. These centres should provide a wide range of educational and recreational activities where senior citizens can participate and spend their time constructively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not pay lip service to our senior citizens. Let our actions express our care for the aged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move to the next topic on Family Services. The importance of promoting family cohesiveness is recognised by the Government in its promotion of family values. In addition to national programmes, Family Service Centres (FSCs) have been set up in population centres to address the needs of families. MCD has also recognised that FSCs have several roles to play and hence the growth in the number of FSCs. The Ministry should enhance the effectiveness of Family Service Centres by providing adequate guidelines and support. There are several ingredients to a successful FSC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, suitable premises in population centres should be made available. Currently, the application for the setting up of a FSC in the housing estates involves several agencies such as the HDB, the NCSS and MCD. As they say, too many cooks spoil the broth. Hence, MCD should provide a single window service to facilitate the processing of the application. After all, if voluntary organisations are willing to offer time, effort and funds to promote family cohesiveness, MCD should do its best to facilitate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it should cater to all Singaporeans. One major tenet for the success of a FSC is its ability to cater to the needs of all Singaporeans of all races. FSCs may have to make adjustments to ensure that the minority groups do not feel alienated. For example, Indian Singaporeans may feel uncomfortable approaching a FSC which only has English and Mandarin letterings and brochures. MCD should provide guidelines to ensure that there is a conscious effort by all FSCs to make all Singaporeans comfortable in using the services of FSCs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it must have the infrastructure to provide family services. The FSCs must have trained social workers and counsellors to provide family education programmes and counselling. Currently, they are only given a one time grant for the training of social workers. As there may be staff turnover, the Ministry should consider giving a grant to train newly employed social workers. After all, it defeats the purpose of having a FSC if the staff are not adequately trained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it can be a first line defence to potential family breakup. FSCs may be able to play an important role in marital conflict and prevention of divorce. Just as those considering abortion have to watch an educational video and be counselled, the Ministry should consider making it compulsory for all couples intending to proceed with divorce proceedings to attend educational video programmes on resolving marital conflicts and the effects of marital breakup on the children. Such couples should also attend a series of marital counselling sessions conducted by a marital counsellor who is able to communicate effectively with them. The FSC may be an ideal place for such programmes as it will be in the heart of major population centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, and finally, the FSCs should also provide social services that will meet the needs of the present day family - a small family with both parents working. Programmes such as the before-and-after-school-care services and homework centre
  <br>

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, I would like to commend the Minister for his Ministry's work in raising the status of social workers but I think we still have some way to go yet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social workers are as important to society as engineers and doctors, but this is seldom acknowledged. Social workers deal with problems in society that, if left unattended to, would lead to a tear in our social fabric. I am referring to problems caused by marital conflict, juvenile delinquency, drug addiction and poverty. However, all this work often goes unrecognised and social workers are overburdened, underpaid and suffer from burnout. It is the creators of material wealth that get the kudos in our country while those who help social cohesion are often forgotten.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder, therefore, Sir, that according to a study done in 1992 by the Singapore Association of Social Workers, the following findings were revealed: Since 1974, the National University of Singapore has trained 830 social workers. Over the years, only half of the social work graduate took up social work related jobs. Subsequently, of this half that took up social work related jobs, only one-third of the cohort remained in social work related jobs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ask ourselves why two-thirds of those trained as social workers quit their field or never ventured into it and yet we have the perennial complaint of the shortage of social workers. Why is it that the law of demand and supply is not working here? Why is there market failure and how do we explain that in spite of the acute shortage of social workers, their salaries have not gone up significantly?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the civil service, social work graduates are paid the same salary as other graduates on similar grades. The National Council of Social Service has adopted a salary which is comparable to what the civil service now pays its social workers but considering the type and load of work
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> undertaken by social workers, this is not enough. Furthermore, many of the affiliates of NCSS cannot even afford to pay what the civil service and NCSS pay to social workers. Non-funded affiliates have a hard time trying to raise money for their operations and thus poor social workers have to continue to serve for the love of the cause while their peers, who are not necessarily more deserving, make much more money in other fields of endeavour. Where is the justice and sense of reward for social workers for a job well done? To address this, Sir, I have six suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) MCD should have a campaign to elevate the status of social workers and highlight the importance of their work and also try to attract more men into the profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The pay of social workers should be raised. Civil defence officers get 10% higher pay than market rates. Why can we not apply this to social workers?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There should be more collaboration by MCD, NCSS and NUS so that satisfactory placement is done of social work graduates so that there is a lower rate of attrition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Professional social workers need continual upgrading and training as social work graduates upon leaving the university do not have enough life experiences to be able to deal with the many challenging and changing conditions of society. In this respect, the MCD has taken the right step in starting the marriage and family counselling course run by the Family Resource and Training Centre, but more needs to be done in this area of continual upgrading.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) MCD and NCSS should help to top-up the salaries of social workers who are employed by affiliates so that the pay of social workers is more reflective of the importance of their work to society. There should be more opportunities for promotion, especially in Family Service Centres and other social agencies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) There should be a formal registration of trained social workers so that there is more professionalism. At this time, many well-meaning people who
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> help in charitable causes are said to be doing social work. Thus, there is a confusion between the roles of these worthy individuals and the professionally-trained social workers. We cannot fudge the two categories of people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I appeal to the Minister to look into this important matter, otherwise the progress of tackling social issues may be held back due to a lack of social workers. Maybe one of the reasons why not enough emphasis has been laid on the importance of social workers is that they are considered to be dealing with welfare issues and this is associated with handouts. Social workers are not just patchers up of social conditions requiring welfare. They do not just act as a band aid. What they do has long term consequences on the integrity and stability of families. In this light, would the Minister please give this matter his considered attention?

  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Now that Singapore has been confirmed to be out of the Malaysia Cup tournament, it is time for us to move on and concentrate on our soccer league.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the FAS has proceeded with such speed to come out with a comprehensive plan to promote the S-League. The report of the task force committee on the S-League has covered all the technical and economic aspects of implementing our domestic football programme. I must congratulate the task force for a job well done, and I am confident that the FAS has the technical competence and the experience to make our new S-League a success. However, I would like to bring to attention that the promotion of soccer is unlike promoting any other sports such as swimming and athletics. Essentially, soccer is more than a sport. It is also a spectator entertainment. Therefore, it is very important to recognise that, apart from the technical and logistics aspects of managing the game, much attention has to be paid to the promotion and marketing aspects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the popularity of soccer is tremendous. In many countries, it is almost viewed as a religion. The soccer game can evoke emotions and passions of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> millions of people. It can even uplift the spirit of the nation. In this respect, I would like the Singapore Sports Council not to under-estimate the task of marketing and promotion. Take, for example, in the United States, the American football game is not merely a sport. When the game is played, there are a lot of other entertainments being staged with the game. Therefore, when any of the game is played, it is an outing for the whole family with all the fanfare and trimmings. It is the same as the NBA basketball game or any baseball game. While I am not suggesting that we move to that extreme, nevertheless, in order to ensure that the S-League is successful, I would suggest a team of consultants who has the experience in promotion and marketing be engaged to work hand-in-hand with the technical personnel of the FAS to cover the total package of staging the S-League.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that about $10 million is allocated for the implementation of this project and that a target of three years is set. Thereafter, each team would have to look after their own financial commitment. I would like the Singapore Sports Council to review this 3-year target, as I feel that the period given may be too short to expect all the teams to completely be financially independent. I would suggest that some flexibility be built in, although we would not like to see the League to be subsidised forever. However, judging from the experience of soccer promotion in the United States and Japan, we may require a little longer for a successful implementation. Now that we have made the decision of promoting the S-League, true to the Singapore tradition, we must make sure that it would be a success.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Acting Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> First, I would like to thank the various Members who have given their comprehensive comments on community development issues, sometimes passionately. Before I respond to these concerns and suggestions, I have a piece of good news for the Member for Tanjong Pagar GRC on the issue of child care subsidy. The Government has decided to increase the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> monthly child care subsidy for each child from $130 to $150. This is actually a 15% increase. That is for the full-day child care. For the half-day, we have decided to increase from $65 to $75. The new rates will take effect from April this year. The increase would mean that the Government would have to spend close to $40 million in child care subsidies in the next financial year.
  <br>2.00 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin has shown concern that even with the subsidies, it may not be enough for low income families. She had mentioned the centre-based subsidies of $100 and $50. Child care centres, in fact, have on their own, come in to help through reduced fees, waiver of registration fees and deposits, free uniforms, and also subsidised activities. But I agree with her. I think we can certainly do more and we will look into the suggestions that she has proposed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cheng San GRC suggested that similar care be given to school-going children. While school-going children also need proper guidance and supervision, they require, in fact, fewer hours of care a day. Where parents can arrange for family members, neighbours or friends to look after their children, I encourage them to do so. This, indeed, would be a better alternative as the children would receive more personalised care and attention from relatives, from people they know, from people they love.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1990 Census survey showed that for children aged between seven and 12 years old, most of their parents are able to take care of them. In fact, 76% of children are cared for by their parents and 11.9% by grandparents. So only about 3% of children are left on their own.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though no Government grants will be given to BASC, I assure the Member we will continue to assist the VWOs and other non-profit organisations by helping them to secure Government premises at subsidised rates. Currently, in fact, most VWOs running BASC have a sliding scale for fees which is based on family income.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Those VWOs who are charging low fees or nominal rates are, in fact, also helping lower income families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Yuhua touched on the heart of our policies when she says that community development starts with the family and that we should help families that need help. Indeed, it is the very strength and weaknesses of the family that determine the social fabric of our society. The family today is not the same as the family of the past. Change is inevitable, but change, when it happens too fast, can be a source of stress on the family, and stress can also come when members of the family have difficulties fulfilling their roles and responsibilities. So, unless the family can handle the stress well, it may end up as a dysfunctional family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Service Centres (FSCs) have been set up to help families under stress with their problems. There are 14 such centres now funded by the Ministry and we plan to have 24 by the year 2000. I would like to inform the Member for Cheng San GRC that FSCs must adopt a non-sectarian approach and must be open to all persons regardless of race, language or religion, if they want to receive funds from the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FSCs do try to engage staff who are multi-lingual. Where it is not possible to do so, FSCs have turned to the clients' family members, volunteers, neighbours, or even HDB officers for interpretation or translation facilities. And I am pleased to inform the Member for Cheng San GRC that all the 14 FSCs so far, with the exception of one that is run by SINDA, have clients from the four main ethnic groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is right in saying that FSCs must have trained social workers and counsellors and each FSC to be managed by staff with the relevant background and experience. While in service, the staff attend courses, seminars, workshops on various topics. A one-time grant is also given to the Family Resource and Training Centre (FRTC) to develop a curriculum for a two-year Diploma Course for social workers in FSCs and to run the first course
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for 20 staff. These staff in turn would be able to train other colleagues when they complete their course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, FSCs discharge a variety of functions, one of which is marital counselling. I agree that couples intending to divorce should view video tapes on how to resolve their marital conflicts and attend counselling sessions as proposed by the Member for Cheng San GRC. However, it would be difficult to force unwilling couples to do so. We will, however, in our public education programmes, encourage couples with marital problems to seek help from FSCs early. FSCs and agencies dealing with marital problems will be encouraged to persuade their clients view these videos during the counselling sessions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training and career prospects of social workers have been raised by the Member for Yuhua and also Dr Soin. Dr Soin also expressed interest in the career advancement of social workers. A few years back I would have agreed entirely with Dr Soin that social work was a very poor cousin indeed among professionals. I think the situation is improving and it is no longer the situation today, especially after the Government's salary revision for the Welfare Scheme of Service in 1994. She also mentioned about the NCSS reviewing the salary scales of the voluntary sector and has recommended a scale comparable to that of the civil service. The new scale should be able to attract and retain good social workers. But, again, I agree with her that we will continually seek to improve the working conditions or the career prospects of social workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is constant dialogue between NUS, NCSS and the Ministry on the social work curriculum to ensure that what they do and their career prospects are always improving. For example, following the Ministry's feedback, NUS has amended its syllabus to place more emphasis on family work. And training does not stop at the graduate level. The Diploma course, run jointly by the NUS and FRTC, which I mentioned earlier, is one example. We will certainly continue to work with the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> University and also other agencies to prepare social workers for the challenges they will face in their work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to getting volunteers, as mentioned by the Member for Yuhua, both NCSS and MCD have award and incentive schemes to recognise the contributions of the volunteers and these schemes are reviewed periodically. However, I think it is important for us to note that many individuals volunteer their services out of personal conviction to do something for the less fortunate in the society. And it is this sense of personal achievement that motivates the volunteers more than any award or incentive schemes that NCSS or MCD can devise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Yuhua called for a review of the Women's Charter. MCD is reviewing the Women's Charter to see how we can give recognition to women who stay at home and ensure that their non-material contributions to the family will be recognised. This is especially so in the division of matrimonial assets in the unhappy event of the marriage breaking up. We will keep the Member and also Parliament informed on the outcome of this study.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problems of the aged, I share the concern of the Member for Tanjong Pagar GRC and also the Member for Cheng San GRC about the ageing population. Indeed, by the year 2030, one out of four Singaporeans will be 60 years old and above and they form a very large pool of experienced and resourceful persons. I agree that they can only contribute if they remain active mentally and physically. I cannot agree more with the Member for Tanjong Pagar GRC about the desirability of the aged to stay in the community and also in the arms of the family. In fact, MCD is looking into this aspect and the Ministry is in the process of restructuring itself to put more emphasis on the family, and not only on dysfunctional families but also on well families to see the family as a whole, including the aged and children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cheng San GRC mentioned the Senior Citizens' Week as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> one of the programmes organised by the Ministry. One of the objectives of the Week is to prepare individuals for their retirement years, and it is an occasion for us to recognise the contributions made by our senior citizens. Private companies, as mentioned by the Member, have been offering concessions to senior citizens, especially during the Week. Nevertheless, MCD will continue to encourage more companies to join in the effort.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior citizens who need help for medical care are looked after by the voluntary welfare organisations and the Ministry of Health. The support programmes include meal delivery services, home medical care, hospital geriatric services and care, nursing homes, and respite facilities. For those who have no dependants or who cannot live with their families for one reason or another, there are 20 sheltered homes. Two more are in the pipeline. For those who are frail and require medical attention, there are 45 nursing homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, the Ministry, together with HDB, has implemented a congregate housing programme to support low-income senior citizens living in 1- and 2-room rental flats. Under this programme, three blocks of rental flats in three housing estates with a high concentration of low income senior citizens are being upgraded to be more user-friendly to the elderly. Each block will be adopted by a voluntary organisation which will give help to the elderly and they have been given grants by the Ministry to cover the development and recurrent costs as well as space to operate in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cheng San GRC has asked that I raise the issue of concession for senior citizens to travel during peak hours on buses and trains. I think the rationale for not giving them concession during peak hours has been given by the Minister for Communications before and I shall not raise it again. Nevertheless, I will raise the issue on behalf of the Member for those senior citizens who need to travel to work. I will raise this with the Ministry of Communications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are constantly monitoring the needs of the elderly and adjusting our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> programmes to meet their needs. The Ministry of Health and my Ministry are in fact spearheading a national survey of senior citizens. Besides assessing the needs of senior citizens, we hope the survey will, for the first time, establish the needs of the aged and also the care givers. The survey findings will, hopefully, be available by the end of this year. These findings should help us to come out with policies and programmes to ease the stress on the family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the issue of helping the less fortunate brought up by the Members for Cheng San GRC, Mr Chandra Das and Dr Michael Lim. NMP Encik Imram also asked about financial assistance plans for the disadvantaged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this group of people will need help, especially help to escape from their poverty. We have, for example, the Small Family Improvement Scheme (SFIS) which finances the education of children of these families, besides helping the families to own their homes. Besides the SFIS, there is a whole array of programmes and services for the less fortunate in our society actually. I think it would take time for me to mention the whole list but if Members are interested, I can send the list to them because it will take some time for me to list them individually in this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Das from Cheng San GRC has asked about the 25th Anniversary Endowment Fund set up in 1991 with an initial capital of $31.3 million to help the destitute and low income families.
  <br>2.15 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Das may like to know that, since its inception, the fund has given out a total of $4.96 million to voluntary welfare organisations to finance their respective programmes. The 25th Anniversary Fund was set up to mark a special event, a quarter century of the nation's independence. It is the culmination of a year-long effort. It is just like a wedding anniversary where you have the silver, golden and diamond jubilees. The Government has no intention of setting up a similar fund for the nation's 30th anniversary. We
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will, however, continue to raise funds for charity during the National Day celebrations, as we did last year and every year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to Public Assistance. Sir, Public Assistance (PA) rates have always been an issue of contention. Critics always claim they are never enough and that the eligibility criteria are too strict. I understand these feelings and I empathise with the compassion most of us must feel for the disadvantaged among us. But the Government is not unfeeling either. Ours is not a case of dismissing the problem. Neither, Sir, is it a matter of how much surplus we have or the lack of it. Rather, ours is a matter of philosophy, a matter of approach to helping this group of people in our society. I know some may snigger at this statement, but the experience of many other countries serves to convince us that what we are doing is indeed not wrong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind Members that the PA scheme is meant to provide a basic subsistence living for the truly destitute. It is for those who have no means of support or income and who are unable to work for one reason or another. If we give PA to those who can work, we may unwittingly perpetuate their dependence on aid and take away their desire to be independent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cheng San GRC can be assured that every effort has been and will be made by my Ministry to assist PA recipients who can work, to undergo skills training and find employment. The Member also spoke on the need for free transportation for PA recipients travelling to work. While no free transportation is given, 87% of the PA recipients are senior citizens actually and they already enjoy concessions by the bus companies and SMRT. For those who need to visit Government or restructured hospitals or outpatient clinics for medical treatment, they are reimbursed for the transport expenses, including taxi fares for the frail and aged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that PA recipients may not benefit from rebates and SOTUS given to Singaporeans. But rebates and SOTUS are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> not meant to be a financial assistance scheme for the destitute anyway. While PA recipients do not benefit from rebates or SOTUS, they do enjoy other benefits. One such benefit is the waiver of rents and conservancy charges announced by the Minister for Finance recently. But what is not widely known, or often dismissed, is that, apart from their monthly allowance, PA recipients also receive many other forms of assistance from the community, for example, free medical treatment in Government or restructured hospitals and outpatient clinics, free textbooks for their children, remission of supplementary school fees and pocket allowances from school for their children as well as assistance in cash or kind from voluntary welfare organisations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PA rates are pegged to the actual consumption values of the households on the scheme. They are reviewed once every two years. The last revision was in 1993 and the rates were revised again last year to offset the impact of GST. A research company has just completed a survey to find out the consumption values of PA recipients. We are now studying the survey findings and, if necessary, the PA rates will be reviewed this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has been and will always be flexible in administering its financial assistance schemes. I would like to reiterate once again that community development is not, cannot and must not be the sole responsibility of the Government. It is through the joint efforts of the Government, the citizenry and organisations in the community that we can build a cohesive, caring, compassionate society and assist in creating a civic society in Singapore. Our many helping hands policy is, therefore, a correct one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talking of the many helping hands policy I like to refer to the comment made by the Member for Cheng San GRC. In implementing the many helping hands policy, the Government has always adopted a very low profile. We want to give recognition to the work and contributions of individuals and organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> This, however, must not be interpreted as the Government's hand disappearing, as has been suggested by Mr Das. I can assure the Member that the hand is, has been and will continue to be a very active and supportive one. The hand may be invisible but it is there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between FY90 and FY94, the Government in fact paid almost $80 million to voluntary welfare organisations to cover their development and operating expenditures. In the coming financial year, the Government will be spending another $20 million to help the organisations to run their programmes and facilities. All these figures, mind you, do not include other subsidies, such as rental of premises, medical services and free education. I would like to say sincerely and honestly that our safety net is wide enough to catch all and whoever needs help will be helped to be independent and to move forward together with others. That is what community development is all about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Yuhua specifically asked whether funding will be given to unions, statutory boards and corporations to set up social service centres. Sir, they will receive the same funding and incentives as other organisations in setting up similar facilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the last item on football mentioned by the Member for Hong Kah GRC. Sir, in promoting sports, the Singapore Sports Council adopts a pyramid concept. At the base of the pyramid is the Sports for All where we encourage all Singaporeans to exercise and to take part in sports activities. The top of the pyramid is the Sports Excellence programme where effort is focused on the development of international champions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports for All and Sports Excellence policies have served us well and they are meant to provide Singaporeans with a very wide choice of sports to pursue, either for recreation or for competition. The Member is interested in giving football a much higher profile for Singapore. Indeed, football is the third most popular sport among Singaporeans, after swimming and badminton. Partly because of its popularity, football has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> been identified as one of the seven core sports actively promoted under SPEX 2000 programme. The SSC will continue to promote football when the local league gets underway.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A task force, appointed by FAS, has just completed its review. The FAS, together with the SSC, will study the recommendations to make sure that football remains not only a popular sport but also one that we will excel in. I do not want to pre-empt the recommendations nor the outcome of the review but I can assure the Member that MCD will give its support to any proposal to make football a sport which Singaporeans can be proud of and which can bring the country together.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. Since the Minister recognises the need for many of our young children to be in child care centres because many families have working parents, I fail to see how this need will disappear the moment the children start attending school. When these children grow up, the families that put the children in the child care centre, because they have to work, and there is no one to look after them, will continue to have this problem even when their children go to school. So I think there is a need for this before-and-after-school-care service. Perhaps the Ministry should look into this need. The need will increase as more of these children reach school-going age.
  <br>

  <b>Encik Imram bin Mohamed:</b> Could I have the Minister's comment on whether he would consider allowing PA recipients to work for the VWOs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, there is no stopping PA recipients who want to work with VWOs, either on a part-time or full-time basis, and our assessment will come after that. Each PA recipient will be assessed on his own merits. Although there is a blanket policy that PA recipients who work will not receive PA, there have been a few who are allowed to work because of circumstances and which we feel merit the client to continue receiving PA.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JD 1500.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): The Minister has just explained some of the problems relating to the aging population of Singapore. Here, I would like to stress certain developments in this area. Although the Ministry of Community Development has done quite a lot in providing facilities to help the aged people, I think the steps taken are still somewhat slow because we have now about 200,000 old people in Singapore. By the year 2030, we will have some 850,000. I believe most of us in this House may well belong to that age group by then. Actually, I do not really know whether the discussion on the problems of the aging population should come under the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of National Development or the Ministry of Community Development. It seems that every Ministry or Government agency has done something for the aged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to appeal to the Government to look into the possibility of setting up a national coordinating committee to deal with the problems of the aging population. In terms of health, the Minister for Health has already referred to this matter and the Minister for Community Development has also mentioned that we have now some 45 homes for the aged sick which have places for just 350 old people. If we take the present proportion of the aged in our population, we have only 1.5 places for every 100 old people. By the year 2030, we will need to have at least 90 of such homes. If each home can accommodate 150 old people, that means out of every 100 old people, there will be only two places available.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have also the Home Nursing Scheme. Last year, the Government spent
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> only about $40,000 on the home nursing scheme. I think that is too little because the home nursing service has enabled those old people who cannot go out of their home to be served at home. They need people to cook and send food to them, and help them to do some domestic chores. Basically, I support the view that old people must be allowed to stay at home. Our young people should allow their old folks to stay with them. But these young people need the Ministry of Community Development to provide some training facilities on how to understand the physical and psychological development of old people, how the young and old people can live together, and try to narrow the generation gap between the young and the old. Young people should be trained on how to take care of the aged, how to bathe them, how to feed them, and so on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch on is the question of accommodation. I believe the HDB has already worked very hard on this but, personally, I am dissatisfied with the Minister's answer that it would be difficult to give the first-timers priority in their application for HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is on the question of fund raising. Many charitable organisations have found it very hard to raise funds for the less fortunate children and the aged. But when it comes to fund raising, a lot of money has to be spent on publicity. Singapore Press Holdings and the Television Corporation of Singapore are profit-oriented organisations. They charge commercial rates for the publicity of these charitable organisations. I would appeal to the mass media not to charge them so much for their publicity, particularly when the Television Corporation of Singapore and the Radio Corporation of Singapore are receiving subsidies, in terms of licence fees, to provide public service programmes. I think I am not asking too much in this appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, the Member for Yuhua has asked about programmes and services for the aged, Government's
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> future plans and things that are wrong with these plans. I think most of these points have been dealt with in my earlier answer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to respond to her specifically on the question of coordination of service delivery for the aged. I wish to inform the House that although there are clear demarcations between the Ministry of Health and my Ministry in terms of service provision, there is very close liaison between the two Ministries in planning, implementation and coordination of the programmes for the elderly and their families. This is to ensure that there is a continuum of care as well as a network of services to meet the varying needs of the elderly and their families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has an information and referral service and the Ministry of Health has the Care Liaison Service. Besides providing coordination, information and referral services, these units also provide advice and assistance to the elderly and families who need help in the care of the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The units help in the placement of the elderly and also link the elderly and their families to services provided by voluntary as well as Government bodies. Recently, a coordinating committee was set up by the Ministry of Health to better coordinate the medical, social and support services for the elderly and their families. This will, I think, enhance the delivery services for the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made mention of the mass media charging voluntary organisations. I cannot agree more with the Member's sentiments. This is something which we have also been debating for some time. All I can say is that I hope the mass media mentioned by the Member will take heed of her comments.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Development Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JD 08994034.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when one thinks of the need for facilities for low-income families, the things that immediately come to mind are a home environment that is not conducive to learning, the lack of motivational factors and guidance for the young. One may also observe that the residents of 1- and 2-room flats spend much of their free time in the common areas around their HDB flats, as they do not normally have the means to indulge in other recreational activities. May I ask the Minister whether the budget provision of over $800,000 under this code for the development of facilities for low-income families would address the areas I mentioned. I notice that this budget provision is made for the first time this year, and the amount appears too little if it is meant for what I think it is for. Perhaps the Minister could clarify.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I believe the NMP is referring to the sum allocated under sub-code JD 08994034, as has been mentioned by him earlier. This sum is actually the development expenditure for three new Family Service Centres (FSCs) and the upgrading of four existing social service centres for FY95. The development expenditure of the FSC programme in the previous years was reflected under another cost centre when the programme was in its pilot stage, ie, development of facilities for the disabled and low-income families. Now that the Government will be funding the capital expenditure of seven new FSCs and the upgrading of 17 existing FSCs over the next few years, the development expenditure for FSCs is shown under its own cost centre.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JE 1500.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CCCs and RCs are grassroots organisations. They are set up by the Government with taxpayers' money. The purposes for which they are set up are to promote social, cultural, educational and recreational needs of the residents of HDB estates. These organisations are also highly endowed with facilities. In order that they can carry out their work more effectively, they are provided with premises at the void decks. They are provided with ample notice boards strategically located at every block of flats, and they also have facilities available to them at the community centres. From time to time, they also get facilities from the HDB.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say that in Opposition wards, the incumbent MPs there do not get such facilities. In fact, what the RCs and CCCs get far outweigh the facilities that are made available to the Member of Parliament there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am bringing up this issue again. In other constituencies, all the elected Members of Parliament are automatically made advisers to the grassroots organisations, except in Opposition held wards. I would call on the Minister to rethink on this issue and appoint the MPs in Opposition wards as advisers to the grassroots organisations in place of PAP prospective candidates. I think there are good reasons. Because the purposes of these CCCs and RCs are to serve and promote the welfare of the constituents. And I think no person can do that better than the incumbent MP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons are quite obvious. The aim of the PAP prospective candidates, of course, is to get elected and if they can help it, they would not assist the incumbent MP in promoting and giving more facilities to the constituencies. In fact, they would encourage these grassroots organisations to support them in their politically motivated activities. In fact, I have observed that this has been done. Instead of these grassroots organisations concentrating their efforts in non-political activities, they are to some extent promoting the interest of the PAP prospective candidates. For example, I have already mentioned that these PAP prospective candidates, of course, would not advise their CCCs to support applications for CIPC funds by the Opposition
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> held town councils. These grassroots organisations often do not recommend. I have known of cases where they do not recommend children of Opposition activists to get into the PCF kindergartens or to get promotion. These grassroots members often are also seen accompanying the prospective PAP candidates in their walkabouts. What does this show? It shows that these grassroots organisations are partisan. They are not neutral. And if they are partisan, I am sad to say that they will soon lose their credibility. Why? Because they will not be recognised as grassroots organisations, but people will say that they are PAP organisations. This is sad, because these grassroots organisations are supported by public funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, I would urge the Minister really to rethink again and get incumbent MPs, even in Opposition wards, to be advisers. And I am certain that these Opposition MPs, because they are MPs, will have better or more interest in the constituents than the PAP prospective candidates who are not MPs. And the public funds that are allocated for these grassroots organisations, I am sure, will be better used.

  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen (Nee Soon Central)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): I am also going to deal with the question of Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) and Residents' Committees (RCs). I would like to raise three points with the Minister:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It should be clearly stipulated that MPs should automatically become the advisers of RCs and CCCs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It should be clearly stipulated that the CCC and RC members must not belong to any political party. They should have no political affiliation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) It should clearly be stipulated that members of a CCC must be residents in the constituency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, I feel that if MPs are automatically made advisers to CCCs and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> RCs, then it will be in keeping with the wishes of the voters and the principles of democracy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, if the members of CCCs and RCs do not belong to any political party, it would cut down the political colour of these two organisations and to make sure that there is a balance in these organisations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third point, I feel that if members of the CCCs are local residents, they will have a better understanding of the local conditions. I discover that in Bukit Gombak, Potong Pasir and Nee Soon Central, the members of the CCCs have refused to endorse the funding of covered linkways for these three constituencies. I wonder if they really understand the needs of the local residents. I am beginning to doubt. I do not think any local resident will refuse to have more covered linkways in their constituency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister can adopt my three points, then he will be able to pacify the heat over the controversy for the CIPC funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I am answering the questions by the two MPs because they both raised questions about the RCs, the CCCs and the CCMCs, the role of the adviser, who should appoint the adviser and who should be the adviser, and how these community organisations should serve the residents. Since I have been tasked to look after the People's Association by the Prime Minister, I will deal with these questions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, these questions are not new. These questions have been raised ad nauseam. These questions have been raised a few years ago and I have given answers to all the questions. Since the questions are the same, the answers would be the same. I do not see how the MPs can change my answers because they have been raised in the last few years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to recapitulate, to remind Mr Chiam and Mr Cheo, why we have these grassroots organisations. I think Mr Chiam also
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> recognises the purpose of these grassroots organisations. They are to help Government promote social cohesion, racial harmony and act as a bridge between the people and the Government. That being the case, if we have an Opposition MP there as the adviser, would he be the bridge in helping to facilitate communication, transmission and explanation of policies between the Government and the people? I do not think so. I think that Opposition MP Adviser would be an obstacle rather than a facilitator. For that reason, I say that Opposition MPs cannot be appointed as the adviser of the CCCs, RCs or the MCs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam says that he had noticed that these organisations have been helping to promote prospective PAP candidates. If they indeed do so, I see nothing wrong in that because if they find that that adviser is worthy of support and they want to help him, so be it. But we have not compelled anyone in these grassroots organisations to say that they must help a PAP man. We have not given such a policy directive. If the grassroots organisations and the members and volunteers feel that they want to help the adviser, by all means. There is nothing wrong in that. I do not know what Mr Chiam meant by his observation that this has been done. Maybe he has some examples of how the grassroots organisations have helped to promote the interest of the prospective PAP candidate. Has he got any example?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Much obliged, Sir. The most recent rampant example of promoting a PAP prospective candidate is the highlighting of his news and pictures in all the notice boards at Potong Pasir. That is a fairly strong example. Of course, the other example is his frequent walkabouts and everybody knows that. These are examples of promoting the interest of the PAP prospective candidate. Notice boards should be confined to social, cultural, educational, recreational or sporting activities, and not to highlight the sayings and interviews of the prospective candidate. What is the purpose of this? It is quite obvious.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I thank Mr Chiam for enlightening me as to what was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> bugging him. If he says that Mr Andy Gan should not be walking about, then Mr Andy Gan must actually move out of Potong Pasir. Mr Andy Gan himself stays in Potong Pasir. So he has to walk around Potong Pasir. There is nothing wrong with that. Unless he wants him to live outside of Potong Pasir, but even then there is nothing to prevent a citizen from walking anywhere in Singapore. If he is the adviser of the constituency, all the more he should walk around to understand the needs of the constituents and what he can do for them. When he is able to do something for them, he will understand and appreciate the concerns and problems that the constituents face. It is perfectly legitimate as an adviser. If he did not do that, I would say that was a dereliction of duty. I am glad to hear Mr Chiam saying that Mr Andy Gan has been very active.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam says that the RC notice boards have been used to promote the news concerning the adviser. What did Mr Andy Gan put up? I anticipate that Mr Chiam may raise this question. So I asked what the RCs in Potong Pasir have actually done. They said that there is one article dated 24th December 1994 which they put up. Mr Andy Gan was interviewed by the Straits Times. This was an interview about what Mr Gan would do and his views about the constituency, his concerns, and the problems and difficulties he faces in an Opposition town council. I think that was a very good interview that he gave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But RC notice boards are not just used to communicate or inform members about the activities of the adviser. They are also used to inform residents of important events, policies and things that are of concern to them. It must definitely be so because the job of RCs is to inform the residents about Government policies and the goings-on in the country. So when there is news about the upgrading of the Kim Keat flats, which is a neighbouring constituency to Potong Pasir, I am sure the residents in Potong Pasir will be very interested to know what is going on in the neighbouring constituency. So when this news was publicised and the Prime Minister went to open this new upgrading project, he made an observation which was very valid: that if Mr Andy Gan was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> indeed in Potong Pasir and able to do this for the residents, the Prime Minister would be very happy to go and open the new project if it happens in Potong Pasir. But it is not the PAP candidate's news or the adviser's news that is being communicated to the residents. I am also told that even news concerning the SDP was also publicised in the RC notice boards. One was an article concerning the SDP entitled "SDP - their appearance and their reality", written by Ng Wei Joo, who found out what was brewing within the SDP and its leadership. They put it up so that people would know the kind of problem that their MP, who is an SDP MP, is facing in his own party. I think they have every reason to be informed. There is nothing wrong with that either.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told that residents were also informed about what Dr Richard Hu, our Finance Minister, has said about the Budget. What is in it for them in the Budget. If the residents have missed the chance to read this in the papers because they are too busy, they can read it in the notice board. Again, there is nothing wrong with that. But if Mr Chiam objects to RC notice boards being used to purvey or communicate news, activities or articles concerning the residents, their MP, or their adviser, then does he object to the town council doing the same thing? Can he tell me?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have also anticipated that question. We in the Potong Pasir Town Council have not bothered to slap a fee on the RCs or try to take their notice boards down. But we will just treat it as a tit-for-tat. If they can do it now, we can do it too. I am glad the Minister has answered in the manner that he has answered. So at least we play on an even level field.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> In other words, Mr Chiam does admit that even for a town council, where he is the Chairman, and all of us are either Chairman or members of town councils, we do from time to time make use of the town council to publicise activities of the candidate or the MP.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> They started it, we follow. So that is fair. All right, let us play the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I am not saying that Mr Chiam should not or cannot do it. I think it is fair. He is quite right. In fact, publicising the news of the adviser is not new. Many constituencies have done it, including mine. So I think it is quite a fair game for the RCs, CCCs and the MCs to keep the residents informed of things that are happening in the constituency, including news concerning their MPs or advisers. That is fair enough, does he not think so?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I also do not quite understand why he said that the PCF rejects children of members of Opposition parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> They do? Then Mr Chiam must understand that the PCF is run by the PAP. It is the PAP Community Foundation kindergarten. So obviously the PAP Community Foundation kindergarten has to take care of all the children in the constituency. When we have too many children going for an inadequate number of places, then there must be a certain priority to be given to the children. And depending on the vacancies, if certain children cannot find a place, it cannot be helped. But I am not saying that they would not be able to find a place. They can find a place. They can go to the People's Association kindergartens. There is nothing to stop any Opposition Member from sending their children to the People's Association kindergartens, which I believe Mr Low has done. So we are quite open. The PA is very neutral, as far as admitting children of citizens into their kindergartens is concerned.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification from the Minister? I would like
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to know from the Minister this. Is the character or nature of the PCF a charitable or political organisation?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> No doubt the PCF is a charitable organisation. Therefore, when it admits children, it tries to admit all the children, if possible. If it cannot, then there must be certain priority set. That is it. Nothing more, nothing less.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> rose -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Wong, are you giving way?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes.
  <br>3.00 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The priority set is based on political reasons. I know Mr Chiam has said the position is that Opposition party members' children are not admitted. Being a charitable organisation, is the priority based on political reasons?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> No, I did not say that it is based on political reasons. I said that there are certain priorities. First priority will be that if you are the sibling of another child who is already studying there. That must be the first priority, like our school admission system. Secondly, if the parents have been very active in the constituency, then I think you also deserve some priority. Because "very active" means they volunteer their service and I think we should give some recognition to people who volunteer. And then the rest of it will be open to all the children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Mr Cheo's question about MPs automatically becoming advisers. I said no, it is not automatic, unless they are able to help explain the Government's policy. I do not think his party would allow him to do that. Would it?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of grassroots organisations should not be members of a political party? Is it right for us to say that volunteers cannot be members of a political party? If we do that, are we not denying them the democratic right to join any party, to be associated with anybody? Are we not breaching the rights in the Constitution? I do not think I can do that. I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> think I will continue to allow members of grassroots organisations to belong to members of any political party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCC members should be residents. Yes, as far as possible, we try to get the residents. If we cannot find enough of them, if the advisers can find others to help them, I do not think we should deny capable Singaporeans of helping in the CCCs just because they do not live in the constituency. If we do that, then I think the constituency will be the poorer for it because the constituency will not be able to benefit from the advice, the help and assistance from whatever ability that this member can bring to the constituency. I think our CCCs are enriched by the experience from a wide cross-section of people who can contribute to the CCCs. Some of them may not live in the constituency, well, we cannot help it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now, the Minister for Community Development said that the Opposition Members cannot help to explain the Government's policy to the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> I did not say that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): I meant the Minister for Home Affairs. I feel that the Minister's view was one-sided. Although the Singapore Democratic Party is an Opposition party, our objective is to serve the people of Singapore. We want to improve the standard of living of Singaporeans. We do not object to all Government policies. If a policy is good, we will support and promote the policy. But if the policy is no good, then we have a duty to point it out. So, this problem does not arise. Why is it that the Opposition won in some constituencies at the last General Elections? This was because the residents in some constituencies were not happy with certain policies of the Government. They did not agree with the Government policies and they have their own views. That is the reason.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the members of CCCs and RCs not having any political affiliation, I think this has nothing to do with the spirit of democracy. Even for our armed forces, we stipulate that members of the armed
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> forces and civil servants cannot join any political party. If the Minister says my suggestion is wrong, then the civil servants have been deprived of their rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to clarify what Mr Cheo said just now. Under the Instruction Manual of the civil servants, there is nothing to say that civil servants cannot join a political party. If they wish to participate in political activities, they just have to inform their superior officers and they will be allowed to participate in the political activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether Opposition Members can help to promote Government policies, I have my doubts. In this Parliament, we can see very clearly that many policies are being opposed by the Opposition parties because of their opposing stand. They said, "We are the Opposition. Our policy is better than the ruling party's policies. So your policy is no good, I have to oppose." If you do not agree with what I have said, you can correct me. In my years of experience in Parliament, I have noticed that more than 90% of the Government policies are being opposed by the Opposition parties. I think Mr Chiam See Tong would agree with me.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Opposition MPs are able to get the support from their constituents because they do not agree with the Government policy or they are doubtful about the Government policy and they feel that the policy is not good enough. This is in keeping with the spirit of democracy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we support the Government all the way, then we should not be in the Opposition parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): This last sentence is indeed "hitting the nail on the head". Since he is in the Opposition party, then why should he want to be the adviser of a Government organisation? I really do not understand his point.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): We have never said that we wanted to be the advisers to the Government. He is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> talking about these grassroots organisations. Is the Minister saying that the grassroots organisations are Government organisations?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, in the case of Potong Pasir, it is not a question of insufficient space that Opposition activists' children were not admitted to the PCF kindergarten. In fact, two of the kindergartens in Potong Pasir had been closed down. It shows that there are not enough students or whatever reasons. So it is not a question of not enough space. They can easily open them up and put more students in there. But they did not do that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about Opposition MPs being the advisers of grassroots organisations in their constituencies. I think there is a case for it because these organisations are supported by public funds and, therefore, you cannot say that they belong to the Government. In fact, they belong to the citizens of Singapore. They are set up with taxpayers' money; they are not money from the PAP party that supports them. So I think there is a case for Opposition MPs to be advisers in these organisations. If you really call them "grassroots organisations", then the person who should be guiding them should be the MP who is in charge. If he does not guide them properly and does not do a good job, of course, he will lose his seat as an MP. So he has got an interest. And if you set the rules that there should be no politics, I think it can be done. Just as I have been trying very hard at our town council to make it above politics. But, unfortunately, Mr Andy Gan has not allowed me to do so. He started the ball rolling, putting his photo on the notice board, I can also put my photo on the notice board. So it is a question of tit-for-tat, who starts first.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we set the ground rules, it can be done. If that is done, I would imagine the beneficiaries would in the end be the residents themselves, instead of having the prospective PAP candidate leading the so-called grassroots and there is an incumbent MP. Of course, the incumbent MP is there to make sure he gets elected and the oncoming onslaught from the prospective candidate is to make sure that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> he is removed. So there is already a clash there. How do you resolve this problem? The best solution is to let the incumbent MP do his job, and if he does not do his job, then he gets out-voted.

  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> He made it difficult for them to carry on. That is my understanding. Firstly, whether I am right or wrong, I think the records speak for themselves. Secondly, Mr Chiam wants to change all that because he thinks that the Opposition and the grassroots organisations can work together. Whereas we are saying that we are elected to govern and like any other democratically elected government, we are empowered to set up any agency to help promote and propagate its policies and explain them to the people. When Mr Chiam wants to change all that, he can, when he becomes the Government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, there are two points. Firstly, the PCF kindergarten at Potong Pasir was closed down because the Town Council at Potong Pasir raised the service and conservancy charges. This is half-truth and not the full truth. We raised it to show the market value of the S&amp;C charges in relation to premises used for kindergartens. The PCF centre is not the only kindergarten in Potong Pasir. There is another kindergarten there run by a church organisation. It is called Kindercare. We did the same thing for them. In all our letters informing them that the S&amp;C charges had to be raised, we enclosed a form. It says they can apply to us, and we will immediately give them up to 90% discount. The other kindergarten said, "All right. We will apply." And immediately they got the discount. So the amount of increase, if I can remember from memory, is only about $35. The PCF centre would also get the same rate. If I remember correctly, it is $15 and $45.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Andy Gan, the adviser to the kindergarten over there, refused to apply. He is too proud to apply to an Opposition MP for a reduction. And that is the reason why he has to proudly bear the full rate. Whose fault is that? We asked them to apply and enclosed a form. They just had to put a signature, and they would get a discount. But he refused. So who is to blame? It is not us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has been asking everybody to apply to the CCC for all kinds of approval. I, as an elected MP, have to apply, but I get the thumbs down in regard to CIPC funds. So why can they not? Mr Andy Gan, I think, should learn some humility if he is going to be the next MP. That is the first lesson. That is in regard to the S&amp;C charges that he was talking about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot recall the other point.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> That if he wants to do all the things that he wants us to do now as the Government, then when he is in Government, he can do it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. I do not deny that the Government's duty is to govern the country. I do not deny that at all. The Government has set up grassroots organisations. I do not deny that they can also set up grassroots organisations. But the point is that - I have to repeat myself - these grassroots organisations are supported by public funds and they are for public good. So the issue now is whether or not an Opposition MP, as an adviser, in contrast with a prospective PAP candidate, would be a better adviser and could serve the purposes of the constituents better. You have got two choices. You can appoint the elected MP and in my case I have nearly 70% support. So straightaway you have already got 70% support for your grassroots organisations if the MP is appointed as the adviser, whereas Mr Andy Gan has got only 30%. So I would like to ask the Minister, on record, who has got better support.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think that is non sequitur, ie, this argument about him getting 70% support and, therefore, with 70% support of the residents, he should
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> run all the activities in the constituency. What the Government wants the PA grassroots organisations to do is to help to explain its policies and carry out the activities for the people. Who do you think will do the job better? Is it the Opposition MP who will stand in the way? Or is it an adviser appointed by the Government? My belief and experience have always been that the latter is better.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his reply to me concerning the S&amp;C charges and so on, I think he should look through the records on what was actually said to the PCF in Potong Pasir. Before the PCF in Potong Pasir received the letter, it knew about it from the newspapers and only when it protested that he subsequently said, "Okay, if you want a discount, I shall give you a discount." It was not conveyed that way right from the start, as far as I could remember. That is the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, we increased the rates effectively on 1st April 1994 together with the introduction of GST. We sent the letter on 4th April 1994. How can the Minister say that he knew about it from the newspapers? It was quite soon after. I think it is quite reasonable even if there was already a publication about that news.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point about explaining Government policies, the Government policies can be explained through the newspapers, radio, or TV, and they do not have to get a prospective PAP candidate to explain Government policies to the residents. But in any event, during my time at Potong Pasir, I did not see any of the PAP prospective candidates explaining Government policies to the grassroots. The only time I read in the newspaper that they were there was when they were telling the hawkers there not to increase their prices when GST was introduced. That was the only news I heard of them promoting Government policy. Other than that, what have they done?

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other constituencies, all advisers are the incumbent Members of Parliament.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JG 1500.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the White Paper on Shared Values was introduced in 1991, there were extensive discussions by both the Government and the people, and a nation-wide promotion has been conducted to propagate these shared values. It was a great achievement to be able to identify these values given the diversity of Singapore society. Although last year saw the most active promotion of family as the basic unit of society, the rest of the four shared values were not given much attention. In fact, a Singapore Family Values Promotion Committee was even set up with a million dollar fund to promote these values. Various projects such as a Family Values Exhibition and a Family Day Carnival were organised to implement and promote the values.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that these activities have been very successful in generating public awareness in spending more time with the families. However, the activities to foster shared values have failed in comparison to the programme promoting family values. With regionalisation, we need to be constantly vigilant against increasing pressure from outside influence on our society, so that family traditions as well as national values can be kept intact. Therefore, I wonder if there are any further plans by MCD to reinforce the shared values and promote them on a scale similar to the publicity campaign for family values. Perhaps the Ministry should consider setting up a Shared Values Promotion Committee similar in nature to the Family Values Promotion Committee, so that more innovative ways to promote shared values can be explored.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can also give an update on the work of the Family Values Promotion Committee. Has the $1 million fund been utilised for any projects? And are there any further plans in the pipeline to promote family values?

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I will take up the Member's sugggestion on the promotion of shared values. Last year, we concentrated on the family values. We will certainly look into how we can further promote the five shared values.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the updating of the work of the Family Values Promotion Committee, as Members know, it was set up last year as part of the campaign to promote the Family Values. The $1 million Singapore Family Values Promotion Fund was launched.
  <br>3.45 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main highlights in the activities since the launch include exhibitions at family events, distribution of 100,000 free book marks depicting the five values, distribution of the Singapore Family Values booklets to schools, CCs, libraries, grassroots organisations and voluntary welfare organisations. We have also incorporated the family values messages in the Families Today newsletter, which has a circulation of around 15,000, and the publication of a book "We are Family", which reflect the celebration of family life as seen in the eyes of Singaporean children. There was also publicity through press advertisements, radio commercials and sponsored segments on variety shows and family entertainment programmes, like Variety Tonight, Portret Keluarga and Nammai Chuttri, a Tamil programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only will MCD continue to promote these family values but it will also make greater efforts at sustaining the campaign. The Committee which I mentioned earlier included members from both the public and private sectors and they have several plans for the year. These include the National Family Day, student projects, creative competitions, filmlets and videos, exhibitions and displays on relevant occasions. The media, especially television, will be further tapped to promote the values. In reaching out to specified target groups, MCD will work together with other Government agencies, self-help groups and voluntary welfare organisations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such target group is children in schools and different aspects of the values
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are already being taught in our schools from Primary One to Secondary Five as part of the Civics and Moral Education curriculum. MCD will work with the Ministry of Education to further strengthen the inculcation of the values in our young. MCD will continue to play a proactive role in promoting the Singapore Family Values. But ultimately, Sir, the practice and transmission of these values rest with each and every citizen. The challenge is for us to sustain awareness of, inculcate and put these values into practice.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JH 3100.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) According to a survey, of the 5,000 people aged between 50 and 60 years, 85% want to spend more time after retirement to stay with their families, 65% would prefer to keep company with their old friends, and about 20% would want to take part in activities organised by RCs and CCs. According to this survey, I think it is a very meaningful indicator to show what sort of facilities the Government should provide for the senior citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my visits to my constituency, I have noticed that a lot of senior citizens like to spend their time enjoying a chit-chat, reading newspapers or watching television in the void decks. These senior citizens can spend a whole day from morning to evening or a lot of time in the evening playing chess or enjoying a talk with other senior citizens because more and more friends are gathered there. The facilities in the void decks are inadequate and so some people bring down their old furniture and leave them in the void decks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> These void decks then become a very good forum for the gathering of these senior citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCs also set up their senior citizens' corners in the void decks to satisfy the needs of these people. But the void decks in the housing blocks do not have proper furniture. We have also received complaints from HDB about these old furniture being discarded at the void decks. This is an eyesore. So how do we help the senior citizens? I believe that the RCs can do their best to look after the needs of the senior citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the RC centre, senior citizens' clubs are formed to conduct indoor and outdoor activities for them. The community clubs and the community centres have also set up their senior citizens' clubs. According to the survey that I have mentioned, they can only attract about 20% of the retirees to take part in the activities. Most of the senior citizens still prefer to stay in the void decks. I would suggest that the Ministry of Community Development provide more funds for the RCs to do something more and provide better facilities in the void decks for the senior citizens. These senior citizens' corners need not be very luxurious or elaborate. They only need basic facilities, like proper furniture, and a proper place for them to drink tea or enjoy a cup of coffee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCs need a lot of funds to manage and run the senior citizens' corner. I think the best idea is to have a senior citizens corner for two to three blocks of flats. We cannot expect the senior citizens to go too far away from their flats. At the moment, I think the RCs need more funds and they have to carry out their own fund-raising activities. They need extra expenditure for such activities. I would like to stress that since the main task of the RCs is to provide activities and facilities for the residents to promote better relations among the residents, they need not spend too much time. In fact, they should not spend too much time raising funds. If we really want to help and satisfy the needs of the senior citizens, I think MCD should consider providing all the funds required for the RC centres.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to thank the Member for showing so much concern for our senior citizens. Of course, every RC has got its own responsibility to set up the senior citizens' club or the senior citizens' centre for our senior citizens to provide a forum and a place for them to enjoy themselves. But we have only limited resources. Even in terms of management, we also need a group of dedicated and talented people to run the centre, otherwise the senior citizens' clubs or senior citizens' centres will become ghettos. The place will become a very unsightly place and that would not be conducive to our good environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy now is to provide one senior citizens' centre for every 10 to 15 blocks of flats. To build one such senior citizens' centre would require about $30,000. We not only have to provide the basic furniture but toilet facilities as well. We also need to provide water so that they can clean up the place after their meals or they need water to prepare tea. So if we have to build one such centre for every two to three blocks of flats, it will be difficult to find enough people to run the centre. Secondly, if the management is poor, then the environment of the whole block will be adversely affected. So although I support the setting up of senior citizens' centres, we cannot do very much because of our limited resources. But if an RC has more than 18 blocks under its charge, maybe we can consider setting up two such centres for them so as to provide the senior citizens with more facilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestion of providing furniture in every block, we can look into the matter. If there is such a need, the town council has some funds to provide for such a facility. I hope that my answer will satisfy the Member.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, what I proposed was not a senior citizens' centre. I was proposing a senior citizens' corner for every two to three blocks of flats. As such, the expenditure involved will not be very much. I think this is a very important need to satisfy.

  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): If we want to set up a senior citizens' corner, we also need a lot of money because we not only have to provide two or three tables or chairs but we also have to provide a toilet before it can really become a satisfactory corner. Like in Bishan, for example, we have a few senior citizens' corners, not centres. But it requires about $30,000 to $40,000 to build such a corner.

  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JH 01984005.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of my colleagues have already covered the subject of child care. I just want to add two more brief points on child care centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times' article in the Life! section dated 30th December 1994 reported the CEO of a kindergarten as saying that there was a need for at least 50,000 spaces in child care centres but there were presently only 26 available. His comment was made based on a survey which he has commissioned. The CEO saw the need by parents for children's services and child care operators are rushing to meet this need. It was reported last year that there were 305 bids submitted for eight sites put up by MCD as child care centres. This implied that for every centre there were 38 interested operators. Therefore, I think we have enough people who are prepared to meet this demand. The question is whether MCD can provide enough licensed child care operators and sites for child care centres to meet this need.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is, since child care centres are important in nurturing our young, there must be some form of control to ensure that only qualified child care operators with high quality programmes are allowed to operate. Does MCD take this into consideration in granting licences to potential
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> operators? What follow-up monitoring system is in place to ensure that the standard is being kept to a very high level?
  <br>4.00 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, we do not know on what basis the projection, as quoted by the Member, was made. MCD regularly monitors the demand for child care centres island-wide. Where a high level of demand is indicated, MCD would target that area for the development of more centres. MCD also has an arrangement with HDB to set up child care centres in tandem with HDB's development of housing estates. A lead time of about one and a half to two years is required before a centre can actually be ready for operation. This means that the supply of places usually lags demand by about one and a half to two years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some instances, it may not be possible to build child care centres even though there is demand. This is particularly so in the older housing estates where suitable sites are not available. In such cases, MCD would usually look for adjacent housing estates for sites.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enrolment figures for child care centres showed that as at February 1995, there were over 4,600 vacancies in existing child care centres. These should be able to meet demand for child care places but they may not be in the parents' first choice of centres; hence the perception that the demand for child care places exceeds supply.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the Member for Hong Kah GRC that more child care centres are continually being set up. In fact, the number of centres as at the end of February 1995 was 364 with 27,603 places. By the end of FY 1995, we hope to have 401 centres with a total capacity of about 30,500 places.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to control of the child care centres, ie, on the quality and qualification of the operators, MCD monitors them and makes sure that only qualified operators with the requisite qualifications are allowed to set up the centres in the estates.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next year, the Football Association of Singapore intends to launch the Singapore League (or S-League). This will involve the division of Singapore into eight regions, of which in each region there shall be a regional club centralised at a Stadium. A task force which studied into the revamped league has identified eight stadiums to be used by the regional clubs. They are Toa Payoh, Yishun, Serangoon, Tampines, Bedok, Queenstown, Jurong and Bukit Batok stadiums. Apart from Jurong Stadium which has a capacity of 5,500, all the other stadiums have a capacity of 2,000 or less.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister whether the Ministry could assist by upgrading the seating capacities of all the stadiums, so that at least it could cater for a crowd of 5,000 fans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal for the upgrading of all the other facilities in these stadiums such as floodlights, changing rooms, toilets, offices and multi-purpose rooms. These facilities are essential to ensure the success of the regional clubs participating in the S-League.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to thank my colleague, Mr Kenneth Chen, for speaking on the S-League and the assurance given by the Minister just now in supporting the S-League next year. And I wish to declare my interest as the President of the Football Association of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, at present the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) operates 16 public sports stadiums and most have a seating capacity of between 1,000 and 1,500. They were built within

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> public housing estates as neighbourhood stadiums to promote the Sports-for-All policy of SSC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not these stadiums will be expanded depends on the attendance at the football league games that are coming. The SSC and FAS will monitor the situation closely to make sure that these stadiums will meet the needs of the local football league. SSC will be continually looking into the upgrading of facilities of the stadiums. The Member can be assured of that.

  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code JJ 3100.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs for a report on the development of the wakaf lands. I understand some wakaf lands have been developed for housing projects. Could the Minister provide information on how successful these projects were? Are there any other types of development on wakaf lands? And also, where have the revenues, which have been derived from these developments, been channelled to?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also ask the Minister what is the programme for development
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of wakaf lands in financial year 1995 and whether MUIS has adequate resources to ensure that the wakaf lands will be developed to its maximum potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> Sir, the Muslim Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) recently launched its strategic plan. It has a grand mission to fulfil its role as an Islamic authority in Singapore and to guide in building an exemplary Muslim community. One of the strategic intents to be pursued by MUIS is to instill Islamic conviction founded on Islamic teachings and principles. I believe it can be achieved through the various initiatives taken by MUIS, particularly its dakwah and madrasah programmes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, enrolment of full-time madrasah students has increased from 2,011 in 1991 to 3,054 in 1993. However, the vast majority of Muslim children are attending state-based secular schools. Many of them attend part-time madrasah at a mosque, especially during the weekends.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister what plans does MUIS have to improve the quality of Islamic education and the standard of religious education in our madrasah.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I will reply to Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe first.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Administration of Muslim Law Act, MUIS is responsible for wakaf or Muslim charitable endowments. Most of the wakaf properties are pre-war properties, rent controlled and temporary structures. They generate very low income. Most of these wakafs are located in prime areas and have great economic potential. But unless they are restored or developed, they will not be able to enjoy their maximum economic worth. Hence it is MUIS' responsibility to restore or develop them so as to achieve their economic potential.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, MUIS has developed the following residential properties:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) four units of three-storey terrace houses at Duku Road;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) nine units of apartments at Lorong L, Telok Kurau.
  <br>
  <br>The two residential developments are successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other projects comprising shophouses at 24 Kandahar Street and 63 Temple Street have been completed and would be rented out. Other on-going projects are 40 units of maisonettes at Lorong G, Telok Kurau and six units of conservation shophouses at South Bridge Road. These units are being restored.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the funds for development of wakaf properties are sufficient. They come from MUIS and the wakaf itself. Once these properties have been restored or developed, they will generate higher income. The increases in income from these wakaf properties will be channelled to the purposes for which these wakafs were established. These will be of benefit to the Muslim community as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY95, MUIS will embark on the following conservation projects:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) three units of shophouses at 117, 119, 121 Telok Ayer Street;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a shophouse at 50 Kandahar Street; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a shophouse at 723 North Bridge Road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to Encik Ibrahim Othman, there are presently six full-time madrasahs with a student population of slightly over 3,000. There are also 29 mosques which conduct part-time religious classes for pupils who attend Government schools either in the morning or afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the establishment of the Religious Education Department (RED) in MUIS, efforts have been made to streamline the madrasahs. Teacher training, school administration, including library and AVA courses, and common syllabi for madrasahs have been introduced and implemented. Common Secondary Four and Primary Six examinations are also being conducted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas pupils in full-time madrasahs attend schools five to six days a week, those in mosque madrasahs attend religious classes only for two to three
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hours, about two days a week. These can either be in the morning or afternoon, depending on the session the students are in Government schools. There are others who attend week-end classes instead in these mosque madrasahs. They follow a common syllabus provided by the RED of MUIS and there is no ECA for mosque madrasah pupils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on feedback, the performance of pupils in Government schools has not been affected as a result of their attending classes in the mosque madrasah.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that mosque madrasah receives the same attention as full-time madrasah, 17 mosques have agreed to make an annual financial contribution to pay for an executive officer and a clerical officer whose duties will be to oversee, coordinate and streamline the professional and administrative aspects of mosque madrasahs.

   <b>PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government announced in December 1994 the following changes to superannuation benefits for pensionable officers:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To allow retiring pensionable officers to commute all their expected pensions into a gratuity, instead of only 40% of their expected pensions over a period of 12 1/2 years, as was the case; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Consequentially to amend the death gratuity formula to bring it in line with full pension commutation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option for full commutation has been effected by amendments to the Pensions Regulations. The provisions for death gratuities are, however, set out in the Pensions Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995 will therefore amend the Pensions Act as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To stipulate the commutation factor to be used in the full commutation of pensions; and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To amend the formula for the computation of death gratuity to bring it in line with the full commutation of pensions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government is taking the opportunity of this Bill to effect two other changes to the Act -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To correct an anomaly in paying death gratuity to officers who retire before the minimum age for drawing pensions; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To insert references to the Legal Service Commission and other Service Commissions, which had been omitted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now elaborate on each of these amendments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Full Commutation of Pensions</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensions will be fully commuted in the following manner. First, it shall be assumed that pensions will be paid for a period of 26 years, which is the average of life expectancies at the age 50 (28.2 years) and age 55 (23.9 years). The pensions stream will then be fully commuted by taking its net present value, using a discount rate of 5% per annum. Using this formula, $1 of monthly pensions paid for 26 years will be equivalent to $175.14 of gratuity. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for this full commutation factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Death Gratuity Formula</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new formula for computing death gratuity will be such that if the officer dies after attaining the minimum age to draw pension, then his death gratuity will be equal to the full amount of the fully commuted pension. In other words, you will lose nothing if you die after the age when you could have started drawing pension. If he dies before the pension-drawing age, his gratuity will be the fully commuted pension, but discounted by the number of years to go from the age of death to the minimum age for drawing pensions, subject to a minimum death gratuity of one year's pensionable emoluments. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for this revised formula for computing death gratuities, which will be more advantageous to the estates of the officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Anomaly in Death Gratuity Provisions</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, when an officer is retired early, his pension benefits will be suspended until he reached the minimum pensions drawing age. If he dies within one year of retiring without drawing his pension, a death gratuity of one year's pensionable emoluments would be paid to his estate. For instance, if an officer retires at 45 with his pensions suspended, and he dies before reaching 46, then his estate will receive a death gratuity. But if he dies after 46, but before 50, when he could start drawing pensions, his estate will not get a death gratuity. This is an anomaly. Clause 4 of the Bill will rectify this, by providing for a death gratuity which is equal to the fully commuted pension, but discounted by the number of years between the minimum pension-drawing age and the age of death, subject to a minimum death gratuity of one year's pensionable emoluments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>References to the Legal and other Service Commissions</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Government is taking the opportunity to correct an omission in the Act. Section 7 of the Act deals with the retirement of officers in the public interest after disciplinary action. It refers to the Public Service Commission, but it does not refer to the Legal Service Commission, the Education Service Commission and Police and Civil Defence Services Commission. Clause 3 of the Bill will correct this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will take effect from the 1st January 1995. This has not caused any problem because the new death gratuity formula will be more favourable to pensionable officers. Also, the various Service Commissions already have disciplinary powers, and there are no pending cases which will be adversely affected by the amendments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are proud to have a civil service of the highest integrity matched by
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> unsurpassed efficiency. It is timely, therefore, that civil servants' gratuities be revised, especially so when they had contributed in no small measure to a strong and vibrant economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst the present serving officers of the civil service can be likened to the hardworking gardeners who continue the good work of pruning and maintaining a beautiful garden, should we not spare a thought for the planters who cut through the forest to create this garden? Yes, without the pioneers who took over the colonial civil service by clearly charting out its mission, improved on it and set high standards, we might not have a bureaucracy that is so clean, so honest and so incorruptible. These pioneers had retired at a time when their salaries were relatively paltry compared to what the civil servants earn today and so is their pension which is a percentage of their last drawn salaries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, our responsibility and moral duty to them to ensure that they would today still enjoy a standard of living that is not too lavish but yet comfortable enough to get by. We owe it to them for nurturing a civil service that is now the envy of many a government and the people. It will be nice if this Government could show once again that it cares and that it never forgets about the persons who had contributed to the well-being of Singapore and to Singaporeans. Just as the serving civil servants will be pleased to learn that their commitment and contribution to duty is amply rewarded, the retired guardians of yesterday should also share the fruits of a buoyant economy for which they had laid the foundation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, appeal to the Deputy Prime Minister to also consider revising the pensions and gratuities of retired civil servants. This gesture cannot be more timely, especially when the country celebrates its 30th Birthday this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point raised by Mr Chew had been addressed by the Prime Minister when he spoke, I believe, a few months' ago, during the debate on the White Paper on
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government. The Prime Minister had said that it would be appropriate for us to make a gesture to recognise the contributions of the civil servants who had retired before substantial adjustments were made to public sector salaries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be difficult for us to revise the pensions and gratuities of those who have already retired, because pensions and gratuities are settled as part of the terms of service. To change them retrospectively will open a very dangerous precedent, because it will commit us to future revisions which we may or may not be in a position to make. However, a one-off gesture will be entirely justified and reasonable and feasible. A committee of civil servants has been studying this question for the last few months. They have made certain recommendations to the Cabinet. I believe we will be ready to make an announcement within the next few months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

   <b>PARLIAMENTARY PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>4.30 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In announcing the changes to the superannuation scheme for pensionable civil servants, Government stated that similar changes would also apply to MPs and Office-holders. The Parliamentary Pensions (Amendment) Bill 1995, therefore, seeks to make consequential changes to allow Parliamentary pensions to be fully commuted. The same principles used for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the civil service apply, while some of the features peculiar to pensions for MPs and Office-holders are retained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes to emplace all new MPs, including ex-MPs who are re-elected or reappointed after the Bill is passed, on the full CPF scheme. Serving elected MPs may choose to remain on pensionable terms or go on to full CPF.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now explain the changes which the Bill will make to the Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Putting MPs on Full CPF Scheme.</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to put all new MPs on the full CPF scheme. There are several reasons for making the change. Firstly, MPs qualify for pensions only if they have served a total of nine years, which is nearly two full terms of office. MPs who step down or fail to be re-elected before completing nine years receive no pension benefits whatsoever. Such a minimum qualifying threshold for pensions is carried over from the civil service, and does not fit the circumstances of service as an MP, for whom the concept of a "golden handcuff" is irrelevant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, increasingly MPs will be persons with careers and professions of their own. Such persons will not depend on their MPs' pensions to provide a flow of income after their retirement. It is better for them to be paid their allowance, including full CPF, while they are serving as MPs, rather than to structure part of this allowance as a pension scheme payable after they step down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the full CPF scheme is the national superannuation scheme. All public officers, except those in the Designated Services, are appointed on the CPF scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be appropriate to place new MPs on full CPF. Similarly, former MPs who may be re-elected or re-appointed to office after 1st January 1995, like new MPs, will be placed on the full CPF scheme. Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill will exclude the new MPs from pension benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominated MPs and Non-Constituency MPs will also be placed on full CPF. In practice, serving Nominated MPs have been paid full CPF since September 1994. NMPs are unlikely to serve long enough to qualify for pensions. It is not in their interest to be on the pension scheme which pays only partial CPF contributions. Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill will exclude these MPs from pension benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Allowing serving elected MPs to opt for full CPF</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving elected MPs will also have the option to switch to full CPF from 1st January 1995, or to remain on the Parliamentary Pension Scheme. Like in the civil service, if they opt for CPF, any pension benefits they have already qualified for will be frozen. Those with insufficient service to qualify for pensions will not be compensated for converting to CPF. Clause 9 of the Bill will allow the President to make Regulations for the exercise of the options.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Retaining the Pension Scheme for Office-Holders</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is not changing the pension scheme for Office-holders. Office-holders, whether serving or appointed after 1st January 1995, will continue to be pensionable. This was the basis on which the Government worked out the salary benchmarks for comparing public and private sector salaries. This will also maintain consistency and relativities between political appointments and the salary grades in the Administrative Service and the other four Designated Services, which remain pensionable. The other four Designated Services are the Administrative Service (Foreign Service Branch), the SAF (Senior) Service, the Police (Senior) Service and the Intelligence Service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Office-holders, like new pensionable civil servants, will only have two options: they can either receive a full pension or commute that pension in full. Clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill provide for the new option, of the full commutation of Parliamentary pensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Disallowing aggregation of pensionable periods of service</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, MPs who serve several separate terms as Members of Parliament can aggregate their service periods for the purpose of computing their pension. Since new MPs will henceforth be on the full CPF scheme, only serving MPs who are re-elected without a break in service and Office-holders can continue to aggregate service periods for computing their pension. Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill provide for this change.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Allowing Office-holders already drawing pensions</i> to commute their pensions in full
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separate pensions are currently payable in respect of MP and Office-holding service. Office-holders currently may elect one pension option in respect of his MP service and another for his Office-holding pensions. When an ex-Office-holder who is already drawing pensions is re-appointed for a further term after 1st January 1995, he may opt for straight pensions or fully commuted pensions, but only for the further period of service. Clause 5 of the Bill provides for this arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Keeping status quo on pension drawing age</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants who retire before their pension drawing age will be able to draw their commuted pensions immediately, but the pension will be discounted by the number of years to go until the pension drawing age. Government has decided against doing the same for MPs and Office-holders. The pension or commuted pension drawing age will remain at 50 for MPs and 55 for Office-holders. This is because the Parliamentary Pensions Scheme is different from the civil service pensions scheme, and in other respects, it is more favourable than civil service pensions. For example, the pension factor for Parliamentary pensions is higher than for civil service pensions. The minimum service period qualifying for a Parliamentary pension is shorter than that for civil servants. MPs and Office-holders can
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> aggregate their service during different periods, but civil servants cannot. Taken as a whole, the Parliamentary pensions package is comparable to the civil service pensions package, even though civil servants who retire early can draw their pensions immediately, whereas MPs and Office-holders who step down early must wait till 50 or 55 respectively to start drawing their pensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Changing the death gratuity formula for MPs</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the death gratuity payable to the estate of an MP is based on one year's salary as a Member of Parliament, or the partial (one-third) commuted pension gratuity, whichever is the greater, less any pension or gratuity already received. In future, the death gratuity will be changed to the fully commuted pension, if the pensionable MP was more than 50 years old at death. It will be discounted from age 50 if he was not yet 50, subject to a minimum of one year's MP's salary. Clause 8 of the Bill provides for the changes in the death gratuity formula.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Allowing full commutation of pensions on medical grounds</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, MPs or Office-holders who cease to hold office on medical reasons, and ex-MPs or Office-holders who are subsequently incapacitated, may draw pensions immediately regardless of age, if they have the qualifying service. Clause 8 of the Bill will allow them to opt for full commutation of their pensions, without further discount because of age.

   <b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee on this Bill received 35 written representations and heard oral evidence from five representors. Except for one private organisation, all the representors were individual persons. They made several useful suggestions which have been adopted in the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Select Committee was presented to this House on 7th March 1995. The Bill, as set out in Appendix I of the Report, incorporates the amendments made by the Select Committee. The reasons for these amendments are contained in Appendix VI of the Report. I do not propose to go into all the provisions of the amended Bill because Members would have read the Report of the Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representors generally welcomed the Bill. Most of the representations dealt with the scope of the provisions relating to voluntary arrangements, the bankruptcy proceedings and discharge from bankruptcy. The Select Committee adopted a balanced approach, taking into account the interests of both undischarged bankrupts and their creditors. It was also conscious of the wider public interest in maintaining an efficient bankruptcy administration without compromising commercial morality.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought I should mention that a number of representations were received, mostly from undischarged bankrupts, in favour of automatic discharges and raising the amount of $100,000 in clause 125 for the exercise of the Official Assignee's discretion in the discharge of a bankrupt. Many different criteria for automatic discharges were suggested by a number of representors. The Select Committee, however, felt that it would not be advisable to introduce the concept of automatic discharges in Singapore. Firstly,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> it would be difficult to arrive at a set of criteria for the introduction of an automatic discharge from bankruptcy that would satisfy all parties as demonstrated by the diverse suggestions received from representors. Secondly, automatic discharges would not encourage debtors to take their financial obligations seriously if they know that they would be automatically discharged from bankruptcy after a specific period of time. Thirdly, automatic discharges would not provide any incentive for bankrupts to cooperate with the Official Assignee in the administration of their bankruptcy affairs and to work towards a speedy discharge from bankruptcy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister has stated in this House during the Second Reading of this Bill, those who have become bankrupt because of misfortune rather than malpractice and have provided every assistance to the Official Assignee in the administration of their affairs in bankruptcy will now be able to obtain their discharges more easily. In this regard, the Select Committee has further proposed an amendment to clause 124 of the Bill to permit speedier court discharges for such bankrupts. The Official Assignee will assist in all deserving cases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the amount of $100,000 prescribed in clause 125 for the discharge by certificate of the Official Assignee, several representations were received from undischarged bankrupts for that amount to be increased. Creditors, however, suggested that it should be reduced to $50,000. Let me explain that the figure of $100,000 has been carefully arrived at. The number of undischarged bankrupts whose debts are below $100,000 and who would benefit from this scheme is already quite large - 71%. Further, under clause 125, the sum of $100,000 can be subsequently increased by order of the Minister, should the need arise. The Select Committee felt that the sum of $100,000 should be retained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not propose to deal with the other amendments as they are technical in nature and are adequately explained in the Report.

   <b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Acting Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of the Bill is to amend the Housing and Development Act to provide the polling framework for HDB shops involved in the Main Upgrading Programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Act was last amended in 1992 to enable HDB to implement the upgrading programme for flats. A new legislative polling framework for shops is now required as the subsequent batches of the Main Upgrading Programme will involve sold shops.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike in the case of flats, the Government will not be providing any subsidy for shops involved in the Main Upgrading Programme. Shop lessees have enjoyed discounts when they bought their shops from HDB. They have also benefitted from the substantial increase in the value of their shops in the booming property market. There is therefore no necessity for the Government to subsidise them again in the Main Upgrading Programme. For rental shops, HDB will bear the cost as the landlord.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shop lessees will be given the opportunity to vote for the upgrading works. In doing so, they will have to weigh the benefits of upgrading works against the cost which they have to pay. Shop lessees who own more than one shop will be given the number of votes according to the number of shops owned. This applies to both precinct works and specific upgrading works like space adding items.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now cover the type of upgrading works which affect the shops and the method of voting for each type of upgrading.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of flats, there are three main types of upgrading works in the Main Upgrading Programme, namely, at the precinct-level, secondly, within the block but outside the flat, and thirdly, within the flat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the precinct-level works and block-level works, shops will benefit as the improved environment is likely to attract more customers. The shop lessees will therefore share the upgrading cost together with the flat lessees. Both the shop and the flat lessees will vote in the same polling exercise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No basic upgrading work will be carried out within the shop premises beyond incidental works resulting from flat-level upgrading. If flat lessees in HDB blocks which comprise shops at the lower levels and flats above vote for space adding items, HDB will also offer the shops beneath them the choice of having space adding items. This is to allow the facade of the building to look more pleasant as the space adding item stack could then be extended all the way to the ground level.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we need to take into account that shopowners will have to pay much more for the space adding items as compared with flat lessees, as the shopowners will not be given any subsidy. If a common poll for space adding items is conducted for both flats and shops, we might have situations where shop lessees may be unfairly forced to take up their more expensive space adding items because they are outnumbered by the flat lessees. This situation may happen even though the majority of shopowners do not want the space adding items.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid this situation, a separate poll for shops will be conducted for their space adding items. This poll will be conducted only after and only if the flat lessees in the same block have voted for the space adding items. If at least 75% of the shopowners in a block vote in favour in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> this separate poll, then HDB will proceed to provide space adding items for the shops in the block.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will represent vacant and rental shops in the voting for the space adding items. For the rental shops, HDB will vote according to the results of the census which HDB will conduct among the shop tenants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also seeks to include two other amendments. One amendment is to allow HDB to undertake functions and duties delegated to it by other written laws. This will enable authorities like the Fire Services Bureau to delegate their powers to HDB on compliance of relevant regulations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment is to increase the maximum penalty fine and composition sum in respect of offences under the Act. The penalty fine has not been changed since it was first introduced in 1986. The same applies to composition sum, which was introduced in 1989. They now need to be revised to ensure that the penalties are sufficiently punitive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, what is the expected range of prices shopowners have to pay when their shops are upgraded?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, there are two levels of charges which shopowners are expected to pay. The first level would be their contributions to the precinct-level and the block-level upgrading. This is the vote that is taken when we take the entire precinct of both flat owners and shopowners and ask them whether they want the Standard Upgrading Package. In this case, the shopowners are expected to pay around $6,000 if they vote for the Standard Upgrading Package. They will pay their contribution for the precinct-level works and they will also pay for the block-level works up to the level of the shop. All block-level works above the shops for the rest of the flats would be shared among the flat lessees and will not be charged to the shopowners. So for the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> first level of works for the block and the precinct, we expect the shopkeepers to pay about $6,000 per shop value.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second level of works is the space adding item. In the space adding item, we will only ask the shopkeepers to vote for the space adding item in those blocks where the flat owners have voted for it. That means in a block where we get more than 75% who have voted yes to a space adding item, then we will ask the shopkeepers in that block whether they also want the space adding item. If the shopkeepers also say yes, then we will charge them the market value of the space adding item less 30% discount. So they pay for the space which they are getting at market value and in line with the sale of shops under the tenanted scheme, we will give them a 30% discount. With that formula, of course, the price they pay would depend on the market value of the shop, which varies from precinct to precinct.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

   <b>SALE OF GOODS (UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum to the President's Address in January 1994, the Ministry of Law announced that together with the Attorney-General's Chambers we would conduct a major review of our laws, so as to strengthen our legal infrastructure in support of Singapore's regional drive. This review was to include the adoption of international conventions and model laws which harmonise and facilitate international trade and dispute settlement. I am happy to report that progress has been made. For example, the International Arbitration Bill was passed by this House
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in October last year putting in place an international regime for settling disputes by arbitration. Sir, this Bill is another such law reform.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of our review was the situation of Singapore businessmen entering into contracts with foreign parties to buy and sell goods. Few difficulties are encountered if the other party is from a Commonwealth country such as Malaysia, India or Australia which share a common legal heritage and system based on English Contract Law. However, many of our major trading partners are not members of the Commonwealth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, our ASEAN neighbours, China, Vietnam, Cambodia and further afield, the European Union (except for the UK), and the Latin American countries have little in common with our legal system. Our businessmen, in their forays abroad, will therefore face unfamiliar laws in foreign languages. They may not have the leverage to insist that the governing law of the contract should be Singapore Law, and therefore end up accepting a foreign law available only in an unfamiliar foreign language.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what can be done to help our businessmen compete on a more even legal footing? One way is to plug ourselves into an international legal regime governing the international sale of goods. This regime is available in the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods which came into force on 1st January 1988 - the product of more than 10 years of work by the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in which eminent jurists from many legal systems of the world participated. The Convention contains rules governing the formation and performance of international commercial sales contracts including important matters such as the requirements of offer and acceptance, obligations of the buyer and seller, the passing of risk and remedies for breach of contract.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is wide agreement to ratifying this Convention. The Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law, chaired by a Justice of Appeal, first
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reviewed the Convention. The Committee has judges, senior practitioners, legal officers and academics as members. A sub-committee then consulted the business community. Their responses were all in favour of ratification.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the recommendations of the Law Reform Committee and the business community's favourable response, Singapore ratified the Convention on 16th February 1995. This Bill will make the Convention part of the laws of Singapore. Singapore will be bound by the terms of the Convention under its domestic laws 12 months from the date of ratification, ie, on 1st March 1996. This will give ample notice to lawyers and businessmen to familiarise themselves with this new regime in international sales law. I understand that the Academy of Law will be publishing its Report for sale to the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important reason for ratifying the Convention is that many major trading nations have done so. As at 22nd February 1995, there were 44 parties to the Convention, including the US, China, Russia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and six of the current 12 European Union countries. All the member countries of the North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA), ie, Canada, the US and Mexico and several APEC countries are also parties. So also five out of the seven members of the G7 Economic Summit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics show that countries which are parties to the Convention participate in approximately 34% of Singapore's external trade. The total trade of the Convention countries accounted for approximately 61% of the world's trade in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other benefits of ratifying the Convention. These include:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, where the parties do not make any provision on the applicable law, the Convention fills the gap. Hence, there will be certainty as difficult rules of private international law need not be applied to ascertain the law governing the contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our current Sales Law set out in the English Sale of Goods Act 1979 is more than a century old. The Convention, on the other hand, is tailored to the needs of modern international trade and takes into account the realities of modern trade practices. For example, it encourages parties to preserve the contract by offering them less drastic solutions than outright rejection of goods and claim for damages. The Convention also contains useful solutions to practical problems such as requiring parties to preserve goods in their possession which may belong to the other party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Convention allows parties the flexibility to opt out entirely or vary the effects of any of its provisions. It recognises that the parties to international sales contracts may wish to exercise broad contractual autonomy. Article 6 enables them to exclude the application of the Convention and to derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Convention is drafted in simple and plain language for businessmen to understand. It has limited the use of technical legal terminology and concepts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Convention incorporates features from different legal systems. As such, it is not a perfect instrument. It is not free from difficulties of interpretation. Neither is it a complete and exhaustive code. However, the benefits outweigh the imperfections. Additionally, they can be overcome or ameliorated by variations or provisions in the sales contract itself. After all, the Convention is not meant to replace the need for a contract in the first place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Law Reform Committee proposed that a reservation be entered under Article 95 of the Convention to exclude the applicability of Article 1 (1)(b). Under Article 1 (1)(a), the Convention will apply to a sales contract if the parties have their places of business in different countries which are Contracting States. If Article 1 (1)(b) is adopted, the Convention will also apply to an international sales contract where the rules of private international law lead to the application of the law of a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Convention country. This is despite the fact that the other party is not from a Convention country. As this may not give effect to the actual intention of the parties, it is proposed that we should not adopt this provision (Article 1 (1)(b)). Clause 3 (2) gives effect to the reservation in respect of Article 1 (1)(b). If the reservation is subsequently withdrawn, clause 3 (3) gives the Minister the flexibility to amend the provision on reservation by gazetting an order.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the passage of this Bill will underscore Government's commitment to creating a more predictable legal environment for our businessmen. In addition, the Bill will also help create a more level playing field for our businessmen in their ventures overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I ask a question, Sir? I notice that this Convention was enacted in 1980. Why is there this long delay of nearly 15 years before Singapore accepts this Convention?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Convention became operational only on 1st January 1988. I think it was wise for Singapore to wait to see how the Convention works, whether it works effectively, and having waited for about seven years now, we are convinced that Singapore would benefit by acceding to the Convention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pursuant to Article 41 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, the Speaker shall be paid:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a monthly salary and allowances equal to 40 per cent of the salary and allowances of Staff Grave IV + 1% as specified in the Senior Administrative Officers' Scheme of Service; and

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a non-pensionable annual fixed bonus of four months of his salary and allowances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our present Speaker's salary has been pegged at 40% of the Speaker's full salary and the Deputy Speaker was given an allowance of 16% of Mr Tan's salary since 1st April 1989. This is because Mr Tan prefers to perform his duty as Speaker on a part-time basis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As salaries for office-holders and senior public officers will be reviewed and possibly revised every year, depending on the salary changes in the benchmark earnings of private sector professionals listed in the White Paper on "Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government: Benchmark for Ministers and Senior Public Officers", it is more convenient to have this motion which states the formula which I have just moved. This will obviate the need to move a motion every time the salaries of office-holders and senior public officers are changed.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must emphasise that this motion today does not mean that the Speaker's salary will be changed immediately. The status quo remains. The Speaker's salary will only be revised on 1st July 1995 when salaries of office-holders and senior public officers are revised as announced by the PMO on 8th March 1995. At that time, 1st July 1995, the Speaker's salary and the Deputy Speaker's allowance will be adjusted accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also want to add that the revision to be effected on 1st July 1995 will also apply to the allowance for MPs. As to the extent of the revision, it is being worked out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, pursuant to Article 41 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, the Speaker shall be paid:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a monthly salary and allowances equal to 40 per cent of the salary and allowances of Staff Grave IV + 1% as specified in the Senior Administrative Officers' Scheme of Service; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a non-pensionable annual fixed bonus of four months of his salary and allowances.

   <b>RETIREMENT OF MR ABILIO LOPEZ, CLERK OF PARLIAMENT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wish to inform hon. Members that the Clerk of Parliament, Mr Abilio Lopez, will be retiring from the Parliamentary Service on 31st March 1995.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lopez joined Government Service on 1st February 1941 as a Clerk in the General Clerical Service. Following various postings after the war, he was awarded a Departmental Scholarship to study at the University of Malaya in Singapore where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1953. In 1954, he was posted to the then Legislative Council as Second Clerk-Assistant. On 1st April 1956, he was appointed Second Clerk- Assistant of the Legislative Assembly. A year later he was promoted to Clerk Assistant, a post he held until his appointment as Clerk of Parliament on 1st January 1967. Mr Lopez retired as Clerk of Parliament on 29th August 1977 on attaining the retirement age of 55 years. Since 30th August 1977, he has been re-employed as Clerk of Parliament on a temporary basis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first met Mr Lopez when I entered the House after the 1976 General Elections. Like many new Parliamentarians, I was unfamiliar with the procedures of the House and it was Mr Lopez I turned to for guidance. Over the years I have found him
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to be an approachable person, most willing to assist a Member in discharging his or her duties within the ambit of Standing Orders. His meticulous knowledge of the Standing Orders is almost legendary and many of us have come to regard him as a walking encyclopaedia on parliamentary procedures. After I became Speaker in 1989, I had the opportunity of working closely with him in the day-to-day administration of Parliament and here again I found him to be equally adept in the discharge of his duties. His quiet, yet assuring demeanour has stood him well not just with hon. Members, but with his colleagues as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lopez has indicated to me on a number of occasions in recent years of his desire to retire because of his age. Each time I have convinced him to stay on. Hon. Members will agree that we have all benefited from Mr Lopez's vast wealth of experience in Parliamentary matters, and I was reluctant to release him. However, Mr Lopez is now 72 years old and a few months ago he expressed to me again his desire to retire.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have accepted this somewhat reluctantly but have managed at the same time to convince him to stay on in the service of Parliament as a Consultant for a period of six months after his retirement at the end of this month. This is to facilitate the smooth take-over of the office of Clerk of Parliament by his successor. Also, Mr Lopez is currently the Secretary-General of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization (AIPO) until the conclusion of the 16th AIPO Working Committee and General Assembly meetings in Singapore towards the end of September 1995, and he has agreed to complete his task as the AIPO Secretary-General.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to announce the appointment of Mr Periowsamy Otharam as the Clerk of Parliament with effect from 1st April 1995. Mr Otharam is a Legal Officer presently performing the functions of Deputy Senior State Counsel in the Attorney-General's Chambers and will be seconded to Parliament for a period of three years. During his stint in Parliament, Mr Ram will, amongst other tasks, assist
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> me in grooming the younger members of the Parliamentary Service for wider responsibilities in the future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of hon. Members, I extend a warm welcome to Mr Otharam.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that hon. Members will now join me in expressing our gratitude to Mr Abilio Lopez in the traditional way for his years of Government Service since 1941, and in particular for his 40 years of devoted and sterling service to Parliament, and in wishing him many years of happy retirement. [Applause.]
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, we have just heard the Speaker announcing that Mr Abilio Lopez, Clerk of Parliament, will be retiring on 31st March 1995 after more than 54 years of distinguished service, much longer than I have been in this world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lopez first joined the General Clerical Service as a Clerk on 1st February 1941, just a year before Singapore fell to the Japanese. After the Japanese surrendered, Mr Lopez worked with the British Military Administration and then the Colonial Secretary's Office before his posting to the Legislative Council and then the Legislative Assembly. After completing his Degree in July 1954 at the University of Malaya in Singapore on a Departmental Scholarship, he performed the duties of Second Assistant Clerk. He was confirmed in that appointment in April 1956 and within a year of that, promoted to Assistant Clerk.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lopez, as we have heard from Mr Speaker, has been the Clerk of Parliament since 1st January 1967. Although he reached his compulsory retirement age on 29th August 1977, he remained as the Clerk of Parliament for another 18 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many people know what a Clerk of Parliament does, including me, when I was a young Administrative Officer in the civil service, until my Permanent Secretary enlightened me. Our understanding of the term "Clerk" normally refers to someone who does the filing of papers, typewriting, recording entries, and so on. But a Clerk of Parliament does not do any of that. He is the head of all the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> permanent staff of Parliament. He is the expert in procedures and practices of Parliamentary proceedings. He gives advice to MPs on order and procedures in Parliament. His role is vital in ensuring the smooth administration of Parliamentary business and the running of the Parliament administration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Mr Lopez retires, again, he has served first in the Legislative Council (Legco), the Legislative Assembly and, later on, our Parliament for almost 40 years, or 39 years to be exact. He has been part of Singapore's Parliamentary history with an institutional memory of the struggles of Singapore, first, against the colonialists and then against the communists and the communalists, as enacted in the many debates that took place in this Parliament between the different political parties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his quiet, unassuming and ever-obliging ways, Mr Lopez has helped me to smoothly discharge my duties as the Leader of the House. I have, on many occasions, had to consult him and sought his advice on Parliamentary procedures and practices. Although he will now formally retire on 31st March 1995, he will remain for a few more months to help his successor and to help us organise the AIPO Conference in September this year, as he is the Secretary-General of the AIPO Secretariat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lopez has deservedly earned his retirement but I know he will keep himself very busy. He will certainly have more time for his other pursuits or interests, for example, playing golf.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of this House and all the Members present here, both the PAP MPs and the Opposition, I wish him all the best in his retirement and many, many years of good health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new Clerk of Parliament will be Mr Periowsamy Otharam, who is here in the Strangers' Gallery, but he is no stranger to me. I know Mr Periowsamy Otharam as P O Ram when I first met him when I was in the Ministry of Defence. Mr Ram is a senior Legal Officer with the AG's Chambers and has been in the Legal Service for more than 25 years. Mr Ram's
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> long career in the Legal Service has seen him serve in the AG's Chambers, the Legal Aid Bureau and the Legal Department of the Ministry of Defence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from his work, Mr Ram has also found time to contribute as a volunteer in many organisations, such as Hin Seng Chinese Mutual Benefit Association, the Kong Ngan Athletic Association in Serangoon South School, the Sri Sivam Temple. He is also a Superintendent in the Volunteer Special Constabulary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of this House, I welcome him as our Clerk of Parliament and we look forward to working with him in helping to ensure the smooth running of Parliamentary business. Once again, all our best wishes to Mr Lopez for his well-earned retirement. [Applause.]

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have come to the end of two weeks of Parliamentary business that included the debate on the Budget Statement and the Committee of Supply. I know that we have from time to time taxed your patience and, with your indulgence, we have concluded this sitting very successfully.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, I wish to thank the Leader for his kind words and I must say that although we have completed our Budget debate this year slightly ahead of time, we have all discharged our obligations as Members of this House in discussing so very thoroughly all the many issues and concerns that confront our country and our constituents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both my Deputy and I have listened very attentively and intensely to all the speeches from both sides of the House and, if at times, that intensity does not appear to be there, let me just say that appearances can be deceiving and both of us have thoroughly enjoyed listening to all of you as much as you have enjoyed making your speeches, every moment of it.
