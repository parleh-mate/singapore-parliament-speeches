<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 47 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I think all yesterday the Opposition was

giving  every  possible reason why they boycotted  the

National Day and National Loyalty Week rallies, except

the right one. They know what the real reason was, and

I  think  they know that I know what the  real  reason

was.  But  unless it is their desire  to  prolong  the

debate  on the subject, I will just confine myself  to

clarifying one or two points raised yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One accusation was that the National Day rally was a

P.A.P. show. Sir, if by that is meant that the P.A.P.

as a Party was very prominent in the celebrations, let

me  just give an indication of some of the items  that

were  scheduled  to  take place during  National  Day.

First,  I  think we started off with the National  Day

rally which did not take place, and the Member for the

Southern  Islands flattered the Government by  blaming

it  for not arranging the weather. We shall try to  do

better  next  time. But that was the only occasion  on

which P.A.P. members, as members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



of a political Party, would have participated. And out

of  the  20,000 people who would have participated  in

the rally, something like 3,500 would have been P.A.P.

members.  Therefore, by no stretch of the  imagination

could  that rally be described as a P.A.P. show.  That

was  followed  immediately  by  the  Prime  Minister's

reception   to  political,  civic,  trade  union   and

cultural representatives. Surely, Sir, that could  not

be  described  as a P.A.P. show. Then  there  was  the

National  Economic Development Fair sponsored  by  the

Government,  the  Trades  Union  Congress,   and   the

Chambers  of  Commerce. Was that a P.A.P. show?  Then

there  were three open-air concerts. At none of  these

was  the P.A.P. represented, nor did the P.A.P. as  a

political Party take an active part. Then there was an

Art  exhibition; again organised not by the P.A.P. but

by  local  artists. Then there was a fun-fair  at  the

Raffles  Institution, organised by the T.U.C. and  not

by  the  P.A.P. There were a number of sports  events,

again  organised by sports organisations. There was  a

mass   tatoo  organised  by  schools.  So,  Sir,  this

allegation that the National Day celebrations  were  a

P.A.P. show has no shred of truth to it.  As  I  have

said,  the  only  occasion was  when  during  National

Loyalty  Week P.A.P. members participated in the  mass

rally,  there  were something like 30 to 40  different

groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other contention by the Member for the Southern

Islands  was  that the Opposition was  not  consulted.

What  he really meant was not that the Opposition  was

not    consulted   but   that   something   like    40

representatives who were there did not take the advice

of  representatives of the S.P.A. and  U.M.N.O.  Their

advice  was  that  no political Party  should  display

flags  or  banners.  That was the point  of  view  put

forward,  and everyone else except the representatives

of  these two political Parties saw no objection.  The

S.P.A.,  U.M.N.O. representatives, walked out  of  the

meeting. In fact, we did not know that they walked out

of  the  meeting. All we saw were three people quietly

walking out, and then on the following day there was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



a  news report claiming that the members concerned had

staged  a walkout. We were not interested in making  a

political issue out of National Day celebrations.  So,

just  as on the first occasion during National Loyalty

Week  when they themselves announced in the newspapers

that   they  had  staged  a  boycott,  all  that   the

Government  did was to express regret that  they  were

not  able  to  participate, and we would not  make  an

issue out of it. On the second occasion - that was  last

year - they issued a statement to the Press saying  that

this was a P.A.P. show; the Minister was unreasonable;

they  were not consulted; they were presented  with  a

set schedule, and they were asked to accept or not  to

accept  it.  That  is  not  quite  true,  because  the

discussion  at the first meeting - there were  about  40

other organisations there - started from April and  went

on  till  the  end of May. Many suggestions  were  put

forward by the other organisations. Some were accepted

by  the  Government, and some were scrapped.  But  the

S.P.A. representatives    and     the     U.M.N.O.

representatives decided to pull out  and  to  make  an

issue  out of the whole thing. Again we refused to  be

drawn into making an issue out of it. All that we  did

was  to  have  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  issue  a

statement,  again  expressing  regret  that  the  two

political  Parties  could  not  participate  in  these

celebrations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main contention is not that political

Parties   should  not  participate  in  National   Day

celebrations - that they concede - but what  they  say  is

that  if  political Parties participate,  they  should

conceal  their identity. They say you must not display

a  flag or a banner. In fact, yesterday the Member for

Farrer  Park said that if a political Party  displayed

its flag or banner, the Head of State would be put  in

the  invidious  position of having to salute  a  Party

flag. Sir, I am quite sure the Member for Farrer  Park

put  that forward purely as an argument. The Yang

di-Pertuan Negara did not salute the P.A.P. flag any more

than  he  saluted the flags that were carried  by  the

Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



Singapore   Dance   Hostesses  Association   and   the

Singapore  Trishaw Riders Association. He  did  salute

them,  but  he  was not saluting their flags!  He  was

acknowledging the respect that was being  accorded  to

him  as  the  Head  of State on that  day  by  various

sections of the population. So the Opposition concede,

in  fact,  that every other organisation  can  display

their  flag,  can show their identity.  But  for  some

obscure  reason,  they say that if  political  Parties

display their identities, they are going to create  an

impression  among  the people that  they  are  putting

forward,  on the day of national unity, symbols  which

emphasise differences. If that is so, Sir, the  others

also  emphasised differences - the Chambers of  Commerce

showed  there were three Chambers of Commerce in  this

country.  The  schools went one by  one,  showing  the

different  schools - Malay schools,  Chinese  schools,

English  schools. Could we not apply the same argument

and say that on that day the schools which used to  be

under  the care of the Member for Tanglin should  have

got  mixed  up  with Chung Cheng High School  or  some

other school?



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, I think, they really object to is not that the

political Parties should not display symbols.  We  are

not  ashamed,  Sir,  of our Party symbol,  or  of  the

hundreds  of thousands of people who have  helped  the

Party  to  realise its ideals and who are  responsible

for  our being here. We are not, ashamed of all  these

people. Therefore, we were not going to insult them on

that day by saying, "You can participate in this rally

only  on condition that you disguise yourself as sheep

or  goats."  We said, "No. You are P.A.P. members  and

you  should  be proud of the fact." I think  what  the

Opposition really wanted was to have an anonymous body

of  political  organisations so  that  P.A.P. members

might  be  mistaken for S.P.A., and U.M.N.O. members,

which  is not fair to the P.A.P. members. And U.M.N.O.

and  S.P.A. members  might  be  mistaken  for  P.A.P.

members, which again, I say, is not fair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



to  their  supporters  who obviously  believe  in  the

S.P.A. and  U.M.N.O.  Therefore,  Sir,   all   these

arguments do not count for anything. The real  reason,

as  I  have  said,  is that all they  wanted  was  one

anonymous  group  of political parties  so  that  they

could  probably  claim that there  were  fewer  P.A.P.

members  than  there  really were;  and,  secondly,  I

think,  all  the protests may be part of  the  general

strategy of the Opposition parties to show that things

are  getting from bad to worse and that the Government

has  achieved  nothing. A National Day celebration  as

everybody  acknowledges has had some  impact,  and  to

that  extent, they have been trying to pour cold water

on  an occasion which at least we have hoped would  be

free  of  political  controversy and  political  party

squabbles. But, unfortunately, they have seen  fit  to

bring  that occasion into disrepute by alleging, quite

falsely,  that  it  is  a  P.A.P. show,  that  it  is

organised  by  P.A.P. members,  and  that  it  is  an

occasion  to put forward P.A.P propaganda. As  I  have

said,  out of all the celebrations, the only  occasion

when  the  P.A.P. got  some prominence  was  when  it

marched  as one of the 20,000 people who marched  past

the Head of State.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Minister for

Culture has just explained at great length the details

concerning the National Day celebrations in Singapore.

We   do  not  question  the  detailed  aspect  of  the

celebrations.  What  we are questioning  here  is  the

principle  or  the manner in which the Government  had

organised such a National Day celebration. We  are  of

the  opinion that the organisation did not aim at  the

ideals  which were intended originally. If we were  to

comment  item  by  item  on the programme  during  the

National  Day celebrations, it would take  us  a  long

time  to  do it. But I would like to quote an instance

where  the  people in the celebrations were forced  to

participate.  They did not participate  of  their  own

free will but because of forced circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



They had no alternative but to participate, because of

their    position,   their   livelihood,   and   their

circumstances.  Pressure was  put  upon  them  by  the

Government, and they were thus obliged to take part in

the celebrations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, for instance, the Chambers of Commerce. National Day could be considered to be a day of pride

for  the  State of Singapore. As regards the  response

given by the businessmen, we observed that only a  few

of the commercial buildings put up bunting in the real

sense  of the word. We saw the bunting put up  by  the

Government.  It costs $42,000, and was spoilt  by  the

rain on that day. If on that day we were able to get a

response from every section of the community and  each

and every citizen did his bit to make the celebrations

a   success,  it  was  because  they  were  forced  to

participate;  there was no expression of sincerity  in

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another point. This concerns the

residents  of the Southern Islands who were  requested

to  participate in the sea sports during the  National

Day  celebrations. They were forced to participate  in

the kolek race, and they were housed at the Telok Ayer

basin.  They were given accommodation and food and  so

on.   These  islanders  were  dissatisfied  with   the

facilities accorded to them, because, apart  from  the

fact  that  they had to leave their homes for  two  or

three  days - at least they had to leave their  kampongs

for  two  days -  they  had  to  row  their  koleks  to

Singapore and return empty-handed. Normally,  if  they

were required to participate in an important event  on

an  auspicious  occasion such as this, they  would  be

given  allowances, and transport facilities  would  be

provided  for  them to arrive at Singapore,  and  they

would  not  be asked to row their own boats  from  the

islands to Singapore. This was a mistake which I could

quote  on  how  the organisers organised according  to

their whims, without caring to hear the views of  the

other sections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meetings organised to run the National Day

celebrations   were  ready-made,  and  the   committee

members were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



given  all the resolutions to adopt, and there was  no

chance  for them to put up their views. What we submit

is   that   all  sections  should  organise   such   a

celebration so that we could really participate in it,

as  was organised by the previous Government. That is,

it  should  be  by  way  of  forming  a  sub-committee

comprising representatives from all political  Parties

in  Singapore, and not like the organisation conducted

or run by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like to draw the

attention  of the Member for the Southern  Islands  to

the residents of the Southern Islands who participated

in  the  National Day celebrations. As far as I  know,

the  islanders were provided with more than what  they

normally received. It is a fact that the people of the

Southern  Islands had participated in the kolek  race,

for  instance, like the ones held at Ayer Gumuroh  and

Siglap. They voluntarily came without their having  to

be  provided  with food and so on.  It  has  become  a

custom to them. Not only in Singapore but also, to the

best  of my knowledge, quite recently when celebrating

the birthday of the Sultan of Johore, the residents of

the Southern Islands left their homes for a week or so

and  went to take part in the kolek race. However,  in

last year's National Day celebrations, we invited them

to  take  part  in the kolek race and  they  willingly

agreed   to   participate.  We  gave  them   lodgings,

accommodation,  apart from the prizes awarded  to  the

winners.  I am quite sure that the islanders were  not

forced  to  take part. On the contrary, they  gave  of

their  best  during the National Day  celebrations,  a

thing  which  has  become part  and  parcel  of  their

everyday  lives. For instance, during the  New  Year's

kolek  race, we see the islanders taking part.  I  can

say that I am very close with the islanders there, and

so  far  I have not received any complaints from  them

about their participation in last year's National  Day

celebrations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am obliged to seek

clarification  on this subject from the  Minister  for

Culture.   Because   U.M.N.O. has   been   repeatedly

mentioned, I would like to stress U.M.N.O.'s attitude.

We  agreed,  in principle, to celebrate National  Day,

but what we could not accept were the things that were

done  and  which had been explained by the Member  for

the Southern Islands and to which objection was taken.

Mr  Speaker,  I  am  one of the representatives  from

U.M.N.O.  We received an invitation from the  Ministry

of  Culture.  It is imperative that I receive  further

clarification,  because  I  know  that  when  we  were

invited  by  the Ministry of Culture, we  replied  and

accepted the invitation.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we were present at the meeting. But, again

I   shall  require  a  further  explanation  from  the

Minister for Culture, because it appears that at  that

particular meeting which was fixed by the Ministry  of

Culture, no mention whatsoever was made in the  agenda

regarding  the  matters  to  be  raised  for   further

discussion and reconsideration by our side. But  since

the  Minister for Culture has accused us of  this  and

that, I would like to ask him if that is the manner in

which  a  meeting,  especially of  political  parties,

should be conducted. I feel that that is nothing short

of  steamrollering the issue. If everything is  to  be

forced  on  us,  U.M.N.O., so that  we  will  have  no

opportunity  to  submit our views,  then  I  think  no

useful purpose can be served by throwing allegations

at us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Mr Speaker, which I would

like  to explain to this House. I wish to congratulate

and  pay  my  tribute to the Prime  Minister  of  this

State.  I  knew how difficult it was when we tried  to

draw  up  a  national flag. Meeting after meeting  was

held, but he was prepared to reconsider and accept our

views  and  findings. Why is it that the Minister  for

Culture could not adopt the same attitude? I therefore

require an explanation from the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we, the Opposition

Parties on this side of the House, still believe  that

political  parties as such should not  participate  in

National  Day  celebrations. My  suggestion  yesterday

evening   was  merely  a  concession  to  the   P.A.P.

Government,  that  if  they felt  it  was  vital  that

political  parties should participate, then  we  would

concede  the  point  to them; but  we  asked  them  to

concede  a  point to us, that the flags  be  dispensed

with.  So  far as we are concerned, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

this occasion is as important as the national flag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has said what, in

fact,  did  take place when the State was  considering

the question of a national flag. On that occasion, Mr

Speaker, the political parties concerned were invited.

There was a vast difference between the nature of  the

first flag which was presented at that meeting and the

flag  that we have today as the flag of the  State  of

Singapore.  A  big  difference,  which  on  the  first

occasion  seemed to us to be unbridgeable.  But  after

three  or  four  days  of  coming  and  going,  likely

breakdowns,  almost certain breakdowns, we  eventually

got a solution. The reason, Mr Speaker, was that both

sides wanted a solution; and thank God, a solution was

found.  Because if the Government had  gone  ahead  as

they had originally intended, we would not have had  a

national  flag  and  the  flag  would  have  become  a

political  issue. If the Government had not been  able

to seek the agreement of the political parties on this

side, Mr Speaker, Sir, our intention was to make this

a  political issue in the forthcoming elections. But I

am  sure the Government is glad, and we also are glad,

that  that is not a political issue today. All  of  us

are  100 per cent behind the flag. It is our flag.  It

is  not  the Government's flag, the P.A.P.'s flag  the

U.M.N.O.'s flag, or the S.P.A.'s flag, but the  people

of  Singapore's flag. If that is the correct  attitude

to adopt on a national matter such as this, why is the

Minister  for  Culture  being  so  adamant  about  the

National  Day  celebration? We think the National  Day

celebration is just as important as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



national  flag.  They go hand in  hand,  and  yet  the

Minister  for Culture does not want to move  an  inch.

Why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 21 is "Contribution to the Maintenance of

Caldecott  Hill Estate". Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  notice

that the figure does not appear in the 1960 Estimates.

It  appears to be a new item of expenditure  which  is

being  incurred by the Government. Could  we  have  an

explanation why this was found to be necessary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. Caldecott Hill Estate is a

private residential estate belonging to the Estate  of

the  late Mr Mistri. Radio Singapore is sited on land

in  this  estate  purchased from  the  Estate  of  Mr

Mistri. By virtue of an indenture of conveyance  dated

25th   June,  1960,  the  Government  is   liable   to

contribute  to  the maintenance of the  estate  roads,

site cables and septic tank. There was no provision in

the  1960  Estimates,  because  there  was  then  some

discussion  as to whether the indenture of  conveyance

might not be abrogated. However, agreement was reached

with  the  Trustees of the Estate that the  Government

pays one-third contribution towards the maintenance of

the estate. $808,000 is the estimated amount based  on

what  it  has  cost in the past The total  expenditure

from  1st January, 1953, to 30th September, 1959,  was

about  $53,000. So the average for one year  is  about

$8,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of that explanation, Sir, may I

be given leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 25*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment stood in the name of Mr A. P. Rajah.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vote asked for is just a token vote of $10.

We would, therefore, like the Minister to give us more

details of what this service means and what the  total

cost would be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, first, I must apologise for a

printing  mistake.  It should read  "medium"  and  not

"short  wave" service. Suara Singapura is a new medium

wave  service. It is intended that it should  be  more

national   in  character,  in  the  sense   that   all

announcements will be in the national language, though

the  programme content will be from the four  cultural

streams.   In  fact,  practically  all  the  non-Malay

announcers and programme staff of Radio Singapore have

already   undergone   a   course   in   simple   Malay

announcements. It is hoped that the service would come

into   operation  sometime  in  the  middle  of  1961.

Although  the planning has already gone ahead,  it  is

not  yet  known for certain what would  be  the  exact

amount,  and  therefore a token vote of $10  has  been

entered for 1961.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, would the Minister give us

just an indication of what the amount would be? Is  it

$100,000,  $10,000 or $200,000? We just want  a  rough

indication.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I am not quite sure, because

all  we know is that we will be getting back the three

short-wave transmitters from the Federation at the end

of  this  year.  But I am afraid I have no  indication

from  my  staff as to exactly how much it would  cost.

But what it will amount to is that we will have to buy

a  new  medium-wave transmitter and, if  I  understand

correctly, it costs something like $70,000 or $80,000.

But I am not sure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, leaving aside the merits of

instituting such a service, I am sure if the  Minister

thinks it is good for Singapore, we will accept  that.

But  I  think, from the financial point of  view,  the

House  must be told what he expects to be the  capital

expenditure on this and what he thinks are going to be

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



annually recurrent charges. Merely putting down a  sum

there  as capital cost is not sufficient. I think  the

Minister for Finance will support me in this: that  we

must also know what the annually recurrent charges are

going  to be. Sometimes in approving a vote, the  more

important   things  to  consider  are   the   annually

recurrent charges rather than the capital expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, among the many virtues of my colleague,

the Minister for Culture, a grasp of financial matters

is  not  outstanding. I, however, feel that the Member

for  Farrer Park is trying to take advantage  of  this

particular  weakness of my colleague and that  he  was

really talking with his tongue in his cheek. The thing

is  this:  if indeed we had all the plans worked  out,

they  would  then have been entered there in  complete

detail.  But, of course, it is because it  takes  some

time   to  work  out  the  details  of  the  staffing,

programme  activities and so forth, that we have  just

entered a token vote. No doubt in course of time, this

Assembly will be fully informed of what it is proposed

to do with this section.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I have the assurance of the Hon.

the Minister for Finance that before expenditure is in

fact incurred, the Assembly will be consulted?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Even if we are not consulted, he

will spend it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I said the Assembly would be

informed, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the point remains that before the

Assembly  passes this $10 token vote, it is imperative

that  it  knows what the total capital expenditure  is

going  to  be and what the annually recurrent  charges

are likely to be. But if the Minister feels that he is

not  in  a  position to give these  estimates  at  the

moment,  I  think,  in fairness to  the  Assembly,  he

should   concede   the   point   that   before   these

expenditures  are  incurred,  the  Assembly  will   be

consulted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know unless the details are given as to

whether the project is a laudable one or not.  We  are

not  in  a  position even to dispute it in  principle,

unless  we really know what it intends to do, whom  it

intends  to reach, and what the programmes are  likely

to be; whether it is going to be cultural, national or

political from a party point of view, because there is

a  growing fear in Singapore that the radio  is  being

used not for the State but for the Party in power.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

hon.  Member is fully aware that when additional  sums

are required to be spent under this Head and it is not

possible  to  find a saving within that  Head - and,  in

this  instance, the expenditure is likely to be fairly

substantial - Supplementary Estimates will be  submitted

to  this Assembly. The Member for Farrer Park is fully

aware of that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of the difficulty of

the  Minister to reply in detail, may I beg  leave  to

withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 37.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 37 reads "Salaries of Radio Orchestra", and

the current vote is $166,800. The Minister intends  to

run this orchestra in the next year for $75,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are orchestras and

orchestras. You could have an orchestra of three, five

or  eight, or you could have an orchestra of more. You

could  also have a symphony orchestra. Each  of  these

orchestras costs different amounts, depending  on  the

number  of  persons  in  the orchestra.  But  when  an

institution such as Radio Singapore has an  orchestra,

I  take  it  that it must be an orchestra which  comes

very  near - but not quite - to the symphony class  which

could  render pieces in various ranges of  music.  The

vote  is  being reduced by more than half the  present

vote.  Judging  from that, it would  appear  that  the

number in the orchestra



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



is  going  to  be reduced by more than  half.  So  the

question   arises:  is  that  orchestra   on   reduced

personnel worth maintaining?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I am glad to know that the

Member  for Farrer Park is as bad as myself in reading

the  Estimates! But if he will look at them,  he  will

see  an  entry  of  $75,000  for  1961  as  against  a

provision of $166,800 for 1960. That can give a  wrong

picture of what is happening in Radio Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current sum of $166,800 covers not only the

salaries  of members of the radio orchestra  but  also

the fees paid to augmentees who are employed from time

to  time  to  complete  the instruments  required  for

certain  types  of  music to be played  by  the  Radio

Orchestra,  it  also  covers  fees  paid   for   music

arrangements and orchestrations. The splitting of  the

sum  of $166,800 into $75,000 for the salaries of  the

Radio  Orchestra  and $72,000 as fees for  augmentees,

arrangements and orchestrations which appear under

sub-head 30 of the Estimates, is really a move to make the

administration  of this vote simpler and  more

clear-cut.  There  is no move to weaken the Radio  Orchestra

which  has  been built over the years, and I  am  very

glad,  Sir, to note that the Member for Farrer Park - at

least in this instance - is so interested in culture as

to  listen to the Radio Orchestra, to express  concern

that  his Sunday and Friday music might be of a  lower

tone  as  a  result  of reducing  the  number  in  the

Orchestra. In fact, the Orchestra remains the same  in

number,  but we just split the amount to help disburse

the funds more efficiently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to the

Minister  for  Culture.  If  he  will  bear  with   me

patiently as the evening progresses, he will know  for

certain  how  interested I am in culture, particularly

his  Ministry. May I have leave to withdraw? I  merely

raised this question, Sir, because there was a

fear-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is asking

for leave to withdraw, he must stop at that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I put it this way then? I merely

raised this question because there was a fear that the

claims   of  the  Orchestra  in  Singapore  might   be

overlooked  as  a  result  of various  other  pressing

claims; but as the Minister has now assured us that it

is his intention to keep it up to the standard that he

thinks it should be kept up, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Of course, I have remarked before

that  if  an hon. Member wishes to withdraw,  he  just

begs  leave  to  withdraw and does  not  preface  that

request  by a speech. That might, of course,  put  the

Minister to some embarrassment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 59.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Minister for Culture what is

intended to acquire as specimens for the Museum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Rock `n roll music!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I can assure the Member for Farrer

Park that any museum specimens that we intend to bring

to  our new museum would not come from the other  side

of the House!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in the past a sum of only $750 was

allocated  to  enable  the  museum  staff  to  collect

zoological,     anthropological    and    ethnological

specimens.  Most of these specimens are  collected  by

the staff and very rarely purchased. But some types of

specimens,  like silverware, pottery, iron  materials,

cloth,  fabric, have to be purchased, and I understand

that  with the growing interest in culture and so  on,

the  prices of these things have gone up. People  seem

to  value  these  very  old things  and  therefore  we

require more money to purchase them unless, of course,

we  can  induce  benefactors to  contribute  items  of

museum  interest as an act of civic gesture gratis  to

the  museum.  But pending that, we feel that  we  need

additional money to buy more new specimens.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister in

his  opening  remarks assured this side of  the  House

that we will not become museum specimens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I only heard the Minister

saying that he does not think the specimens would come

from  the other side. It may be from the hon. Member's

collection of museum specimens.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister assured us that the

specimens would not come from this side, and  I  think

the  basis for his assurance is that the specimens may

come from the other side!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is quite possible!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think the Members on the

other  side do not come under the category of  "museum

specimens". Perhaps "historical relics" might be  more

appropriate!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I bring this down to a more

serious  level? The present Government - as  indeed  any

government - should be interested in art,  culture,  and

so  on,  and  if the Government really means  what  it

says, that it is interested in fostering local art and

local  artists,  I think there should  be  more  money

allocated for this purpose by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Raffles Museum, there is a pottery section and

there   are  various  other  art  sections.  I   think

Singapore  is  well  placed to collect  these  things,

because  this  is the focal point for distribution  to

various  parts  of South-East Asia  and  there  are  a

number  of  useful  works of art which  I  think  the

museum  might  purchase.  The Government  could  focus

attention on these various aspects of art, and I think

the sum of $1,750 is not enough even to purchase three

or four pieces of any value at all. So I would ask the

Government  that  in  future  they  might  give   this

particular aspect of Raffles Museum more consideration

in the way of financial allotments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When I visit the museums of other

countries,  I  find  that I  always  have  to  pay  an

entrance  fee,  but in the case of the Raffles  Museum

everyone  can  go there gratis. So if the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  thinks that we should spend  more  money

purchasing collections of art work, perhaps when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



the time comes and we have to levy an entrance fee  he

would support such a measure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not think that would be a matter for

budgetary  approval.  It is  a  matter  for  a  purely

internal  Government arrangement. I do not think  that

matter  will  come up before the Assembly.  But  I  do

seriously  submit,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  if  the

Government has a national art gallery, I am sure  many

people  would be quite willing to pay an entrance  fee

just to view works of art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to be accused of prefacing my

remarks by asking for leave to withdraw, but-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether the Minister

wishes to say anything further. If he does not,  then,

of course, the hon. Member can ask for leave.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I would just like to assure the

hon.  Member that if he is not confusing art galleries

with  museum  specimens, then we hope at  some  future

date  to  consider the possibility  of  setting  up  a

national art gallery. But I understand that this money

is  for  the  purpose  of merely purchasing  very  old

things like pottery, iron materials, cloth, and so on.

As  I  said earlier, we are hoping that we may  induce

benefactors to assist us in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of what has been said, may I have

leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 89.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-head 89 reads "Land Rovers, four. $32,700.

Subject  to Treasury sanction". This merely  takes  it

out of Assembly control and vests it in the control of

the  Treasury. May we know, Mr Speaker, Sir, what  is

the  necessity  for the purchase of  these  four  Land

Rovers, because I believe their purchase is related to

a  number of sub-heads which precede and succeed  this

sub-head?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Again, I can assure the hon. Member

that  these  Land Rovers are not for  the  purpose  of

ensuring a quick get-away for anybody from this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



island.  I understand that these four Land Rovers  are

needed  to  expand the present Field  Section  of  the

Publicity  Division so that it would  be  possible  to

cover  more places both in the city and in  the  rural

areas  at  any time. At the moment, we have six,  such

units  and increases for staff have already been  made

in  sub-head 1, items (62), (63) and (64),  and  these

four new Land Rovers are to ensure that the additional

work  by  the Field Section of the Publicity  Division

can be more effectively discharged.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, do I understand the Minister to say

that  the  addition of these four Land Rovers,  making

ten  separate units, should be capable of working  the

whole Island?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir, that is correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I beg leave to withdraw, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be reduced

by $10 in respect of sub-head 96.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there appears a vote for next year. In the

meantime,   commercial  services  have  already   been

introduced  by  Radio Singapore.  Could  the  Minister

inform  the  House  whether  commercial  services   at

present  being run by Radio Singapore are  a  success,

from  a financial point of view, and whether he thinks

they  are equally successful from a cultural point  of

view?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As to the first question, whether

financially  it is a success, yes, Sir, definitely  it

is.  The  commercial services had, up to 31st October,

1960,  contracts up to a figure of $1.3  million,  and

this,  I  think,  is not a bad showing for  commercial

services.  As  regards  whether  it  is  culturally  a

success  or  not,  that is an  issue  on  which  I  am

prepared  to  join forces with the Member  for  Farrer

Park.  But I cannot do so until he indicates  in  what

direction our arguments should proceed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in regard to this commercial

broadcasting,  I  remember, when the  Government  came

into  power,  they described rock `n  roll  as  yellow

culture.  But now, because there is money to be  made,

rock  `n roll is no longer yellow culture. It is being

played over Radio Singapore. So it boils down to this:

if  there is money, everything is all right. If  there

is  money, go ahead with gambling. And if there is  no

money, it is yellow culture!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Sir,

I  do  tune in to Radio Singapore now and then, but  I

cannot at any time say that I have listened to rock `n

roll.  There  is a large difference between  rock  `n

roll  and jazz. Perhaps the Member for Cairnhill could

give us a demonstration of what rock `n roll is like!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would appear

that  there is a lot of rocking and rolling in so  far

as  money  can be made by the Government. If the  Hon.

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister would  only  listen  more

attentively  to Government's commercial  broadcasting,

he  would be able to hear this rock `n roll music that

is  going on. I think, Sir, the dignity of this  House

does not permit me to do any rock `n roll, but if  the

Hon. the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  will  go  with  me

outside, I will show it to him!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have not got television here!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not think I can allow

the Member for Cairnhill to get away with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With rock 'n roll?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He is a man who is very rapidly

acquiring  the  unfortunate habits of the  Member  for

Hong Lim. He knows pretty well, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

Members of the Government Benches do not spend  a  lot

of  time  listening in to Radio Singapore  during  its

less serious moments. And, therefore, he hopes to  get

away  with this reckless allegation that rock `n  roll

is  being transmitted through Radio Singapore.  I  too

listen in at breakfast time when less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



serious  music is being played, and I cannot  remember

any  occasion whatsoever of any performance by a  rock

`n roll orchestra.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the answer is very simple. It

is  in the hand of the Government. Ask Radio Singapore

whether rock `n roll music has been played or not!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think the Member for

Cairnhill  should  listen in more to  Radio  Singapore

because  then he would be able to distinguish

cha-cha-cha from rock `n roll, tango, or rhumba. In fact, I am

afraid,  Sir, that he is just repeating what  he  read

from  a  letter in the Straits Times. When that letter

appeared,  I  did  ring  up Radio  Singapore  and  ask

whether  by  some  unfortunate  accident - they  had   a

programme,  I  understand,  where  the  "jockey"

(so-called)   would  just  snatch  any  record  from   the

rack-rock  `n roll music did get in. They  assured  me

that  no  rock `n roll music is on the racks. I  think

there is a difference between rock `n roll, as defined

by  musicians,  and rock `n roll, as  defined  by  the

Member for Cairnhill for the purposes of this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, might I come back to my point:

whether the Minister finds commercial services equally

profitable from a cultural point of view? The Minister

rather  tries to deflect it by saying he wants  me  to

say  what I think of the whole situation. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it  is  not  for me to say. The  Government  are

embarked  on a cultural programme. They want  to  give

culture in Singapore a particular direction. They want

to  give it a particular content. What is in the  mind

of  the Minister and what direction he wishes to give,

only he himself can say. But we are very interested in

the  content and the direction. Perhaps he could  tell

us. Take us into his confidence!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I am always prepared to take

the  Member for Farrer Park wholly under my wing,  but

as  far  as commercial radio is concerned, it is  true

that the programme is of a more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



popular variety because it is commercial. And that  is

one   of  the  reasons  why  we  are  starting   Suara

Singapura,  which we discussed earlier, to preserve  a

balance  between  serious and  popular  entertainment,

which  is  not  necessarily the kind of  entertainment

that  the  Member  for Cairnhill is thinking  of,  but

good, clean, healthy popular entertainment. To balance

that,  we have decided to launch Suara Singapura which

will  give more substantial programmes for those  like

the  Member for Cairnhill who would like to listen  to

symphony orchestras.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do wish the Minister would take

this a little bit more seriously, because I can assure

him  that parents outside are seriously interested  in

this  topic.  This is not a game of shuttle  where  we

pass the shuttle from this side to that side, and from

that  side back to this side. And if the Minister went

into  the  matter,  he would find  that  most  of  the

programmes  that  are  being  played  are   in   these

commercial  services,  and  the  children  insist   on

listening  to them. The question I am now  asking  the

Minister  is  this:  is  he satisfied,  from  his  own

cultural  point  of view, or from the  point  of  view

which he thinks the children should be exposed to,  if

he  wishes to expose them to certain types of culture,

Is  this  the  type  of culture  that  he  wishes  the

Ministry  of  Education schoolchildren to  be  exposed

to - using his own phrase?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir, I was not trying to treat

this matter in the lighthearted manner that the Member

for  Farrer  Park  thinks I am  doing.  It  is  a  bit

difficult  to  just launch off on a long  dissertation

about  the  kind of programmes that are put  over  the

commercial   services   unless   he   specifies   what

programme. Does he mean children's programmes, or does

he  mean programmes in general? By and large,  we  are

quite  satisfied that the programmes are such as would

be  enjoyed by children, not necessarily by me  or  by

Members  of  the  Opposite  Benches,  but  these   are

children's programmes which are popular in many  other

parts  of  the world. The few that I have listened  to

are   not  necessarily  offensive  or  degrading,  but

naturally I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



would   like  children's  programmes  or   any   other

programme  to  progressively increase  their  cultural

standard. It is a bit difficult to specify, apart from

saying generally, "Ah, yes, I think the programmes are

very   good."  Unless  you  specify  some   particular

programmes as models to be followed or to be shunned.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am sure my colleague the Member for Farrer Park

does  not  mean children's programmes alone. The  Hon.

the Minister for Culture must realise that children do

not  listen to children's programmes alone. The  radio

is  at  their disposal, and they tune in at  any  time

they like. The Minister for Education is not here.  If

he  is  here,  I am sure he will agree  with  me  that

education for children today does not mean learning to

read  and  write in school alone. It means  everything

they  hear. The environment is so important - everything

they  hear, everything they see. The radio is a  means

of  entertainment that penetrates the home willy-nilly

the parents' wishes. So it is up to the Government  to

see  that  what penetrates the home is good, not  only

for the adults but also that it is not detrimental  to

the  children. That is what I am sure the  Member  for

Farrer Park means: whether the Minister for Culture is

satisfied   that   the  programmes  carried   by   the

Commercial services are such a type that will  not  be

detrimental to children should they tune in,  although

they are not meant for children.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Opposition are not satisfied with the standards of the

programmes over Radio Singapore, surely they can point

out  which  programmes  are inadequate  and  for  what

reason.   All  these  vague  insinuations   that   the

programme   is  not  satisfactory,  or  that   it   is

exercising  a harmful influence on children - all  these

generalities will get us nowhere at all.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with

regard  to  the  comments  of  the  Minister,  in  all

seriousness,  I  wish to bring the  attention  of  the

Government  to  some of the programmes I  happened  to

listen to. For instance, one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



day,  when  I was trying to tune in to some  classical

music,  I  heard this sort of recital.  "I  married  a

widow.  The widow has a daughter. The daughter married

my father. My father and my wife's daughter gave birth

to a daughter. So my wife's daughter"-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You have got it all wrong!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - "Gave birth to a daughter who

becomes my mother." This is the sort of programme  one

sometimes  gets  from the radio.  The  other  type  of

programme,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is what  one  gets,  for

instance, on a Sunday night when you like to  tune  in

to  some good music or some good talks. You tune in to

the radio, and try to find where you can get something

you  like.  Then you hear the trotting of the  horses,

"Trot,  trot, trot, trot, trot". Then we have all  the

Yankee  talking which is not very good for the  school

children.   In   the  daytime  there  are   programmes

specially for children which appear in the papers with

headings like "Tarzan", "Flash Gordon" and others. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I am only commenting  on  the  English

programmes.  In  general, the Chinese  programmes  are

reasonably good. I think action must be taken  by  the

Government, since the Ministers are so busy, to keep a

closer  surveillance  on  the programmes  produced  by

Radio Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I fear the Member for Hong Lim

listened to that rather complicated song with one  ear

glued  to  the radio and probably with the  other  can

glued  to  somewhere else. I think that is the

well-known and very popular song called, "I am my own

grand-pa"  or "grand-ma". I see nothing offensive about  it.

In  fact, it is a very enjoyable song, and I would not

mind joining the Member for Hong Lim in a short chorus

after the proceedings are over in this Assembly!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other observation about the trotting of

horses,  sounding like Yankee trotting, I thought  the

trotting  of  horses anywhere sounds like trotting  of

horses.  I  cannot distinguish between a Yankee  horse

and  a  Malayan horse or an Indian horse.  As  regards

"Tarzan", I think there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



is  nothing  offensive about "Tarzan". In  fact,  even

Ministers and intellectuals like it. In fact,  not  so

long  ago,  I  read  an article in the  New  Statesman

analysing  the  social and political  significance  of

"Tarzan". The New Statesman, the Member for  Hong  Lim

will admit, is not a colonial paper; nor is it run  by

Thomson or Blades. The paper was quite satisfied  that

"Tarzan"   is   a   very   healthy   form   of   comic

entertainment,  unlike  the  more  obnoxious  type  of

comics  which  I am quite sure the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  has effectively dealt with. But  if  some  of

them  have escaped his notice, that cannot be  helped.

But  I  cannot  see  what  is offensive  about  either

"Tarzan"  or  "Flash Gordon". In  fact,  there  is  no

"Flash Gordon" over Radio Singapore as far as I  know.

There  is  certainly  a "Tarzan"  programme,  but  not

"Flash  Gordon". So I assume that the Member for  Hong

Lim has been tuning on to the short-wave and listening

to  programmes from that terrible country, the  Yankee

country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point I would like

to  make  is this. You will recollect that soon  after

the   Minister   took  over  Radio  Singapore,   there

definitely came over the programmes a certain definite

change. I personally welcomed that change. Many people

might disagree with me, but I personally welcomed that

change.  The  programmes were good. A lot of  nonsense

was  cut  out from Radio Singapore and the  programmes

were  good.  Then  the Government began  to  think  of

commercial radio or commercial programmes.  And  then,

lo and behold, Mr Speaker, Sir, suddenly there was  a

drop, a drop even below the level Radio Singapore  had

reached  before the Minister took over.  What  I   find

difficult  to  reconcile is this.  If  the  programmes

originally put up by Radio Singapore at the time  when

the  Minister  took over were not of a type  which  he

would  allow  through  his  radio,  how  does  he  now

reconcile  programmes reaching the whole of  Singapore

at a level much lower than what it was when he took



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



over?  But if he says that the introduction of dollars

and   cents  into  this  business  has  made  all  the

difference to his Government, I accept the situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I disagree with the Member for

Farrer  Park  that the programmes have declined  since

the  introduction of the commercial service.  I  think

Radio Singapore has even prevailed upon the Member for

Farrer  Park  to take part in some of the  programmes,

and  I  am quite sure that thereby - at least I for  one

would  like to think so - the standard of the programme

has not necessarily deteriorated. All that he said was

that, as a result of introducing a commercial service,

we have more popular programmes. I have said that too.

The total amount devoted to serious programme is about

an  hour  and  a half every day out of a  broadcasting

time  of  about  seven or eight hours.  The  rest  are

devoted  to the very popular, the medium popular,  and

the highbrow popular type of music. To offset that and

to ensure that we get a more serious type of music and

a  more  serious type of programme, we are introducing

"Suara Singapura" where you will probably get the kind

of  programme that an intellectual of the  calibre  of

the  Member  for  Farrer Park would be  interested  in

listening to. So there has been no general decline  in

the standard of programmes unless you say that popular

entertainment is a lower standard, with which I do not

agree.  But  if you mean that we are not  having  more

symphony  music, that is true, because  once  we  have

ensured  that  we  are  going  on  to  the  commercial

service,  unfortunately not many commercial firms  are

prepared  to sponsor a symphony orchestra or  symphony

music.  But for the coming year a number of commercial

firms  have agreed to sponsor Malay music and  Chinese

music  of a more serious kind as an experiment.  I  am

quite  sure  that  even in the commercial  service  an

experiment  of  this  kind would  help  to  raise  the

cultural   standards  and  the  cultural   tastes   of

listeners to Radio Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced by $100*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment stood in the name of Tun Lim Yew Hock.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are one or two topics which I wish to

touch on, particularly the first topic, which is Radio

Singapore -  Radio Singapore, and what  service  it  is

providing  Singapore  with  today.  Besides  providing

Singapore  with a commercial service, which brings  in

great  profit  to  itself, it also provides  Singapore

with  a  news  service,  which  is  one  of  its  more

important  functions. It reports Assembly debates  and

other  matters.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I  am  particularly

interested today in the reports which Radio  Singapore

put up about Assembly debates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal conditions, when the Assembly meets,

the  time  is  Government time, and the Opposition  is

there merely to see if it can get in a word if it can.

But  on the Budget, Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the time

is  Opposition time. If the Opposition does not choose

to  query an item, that item lapses merely because the

Government accepts it all. Over the last three or four

days,  the  manner in which Radio Singapore  has  been

reporting Assembly debates, Mr Speaker, Sir,  to  put

it mildly, is absolutely deplorable. All it does is to

put out the Ministers' replies. The questions put, the

manner  in  which  a  question  is  put,  the  further

questions  put on the Ministers' statements,  are  not

reported at all. The impression Radio Singapore  gives

is   that   Government  has  answered  every  question

satisfactorily.  But  from the Opposition's  point  of

view,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that is not  so.  There  are

numbers  of  questions  which  go  unanswered  by  the

Ministers. And yet this aspect of the situation is not

brought out in the Radio Singapore reports. I  do  not

know  why that should be so. When the P.A.P. came into

power,  the  position was not bad  at  all.  Both  the

Opposition  and  the Government got a fair  amount  of

time  on Radio Singapore. But as time marches on,  the

Opposition gets less and less time on Radio Singapore.

Even  the Opposition Members' names are not mentioned.

Why  is  it? Are we on the Opposition lepers? Are  not

our  names  worth mentioning if we raise a  matter  in

which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



public is interested, particularly in a Budget debate?

Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not asking for publicity. But

we  are  asking that Radio Singapore gives  a  correct

picture  to the public outside of what takes place  in

this  Chamber. That is its duty, and that is  why  the

public is voting it these sums of money in order  that

it  might  bring  to the public a fair  and  impartial

picture  of what goes on inside here. But  if  you  go

home  and  listen to the 9.30 p.m. news, what  do  you

get? "The Minister said this. The Minister said that",

and  nobody else said anything. Everything  is

hunky-dory  with  the Government. God is in His heaven,  and

everything   is  all  right  with  the  world.   Radio

Singapore  is  sitting  tight and  pretty  and  nobody

bothers it. Its little world is preserved. Its  little

world  is protected. If that is the protection and  if

that  is  the  preservation that Radio Singapore  has,

might  I tell it that it is not performing its  public

function,   and   the  sooner  it  is  detached   from

Government and made into a corporation the  better  it

will be, and the better it will serve the purpose  for

which it has been created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Press. The

Press  is just as bad as Radio Singapore. If you  take

up the Straits Times of today and read it, it does not

give  you  a  picture  of what  goes  on  inside  this

Chamber.  We  have all read it. Nobody knows  what  is

going on inside here if one relies on the Press or the

radio.  Could  these  be  accidents?  Have  the  great

institution of the Straits Times and the equally great

institution  of  Radio  Singapore  fallen  into   line

simultaneously-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order. I am quite

sure Members of this House will realise that the

Straits Times does not appear as an item under this

head of the Ministry of Culture, and I do not see what

bearing or what reference the Straits Times has in

this debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the point is well taken. I was

just  wondering  whether there is any allegation  that

there  is Ministerial responsibility for what  appears

in  the Press reports on Assembly debates, if that  is

so,  then,  of  course, there is some bearing  on  the

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understood it, the

Minister  for Culture did indicate to this House  that

he  had called up representatives of the Press to  his

office,  and  had  discussions with them  on  Assembly

debates and reports. I am just wondering, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  whether  in these instances he  has  called  the

representatives of the Press into his office and in  a

very,  very friendly manner, as a P.A.P. Minister  can

do  over  a  nice cup of steaming coffee or tea,  told

them,  "Well, what are you going to say about  today's

debate?"   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  I   have   seen   the

Parliamentary  Secretary in this Assembly  nodding  to

members  of Radio Singapore, and the members of  Radio

Singapore responding to that nod and going out of  the

public  gallery. I have seen that with  my  own  eyes.

Why?



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish first to

speak  on  the  question  of  running  the  radio  and

television.  In  my opinion, there are  two  types  of

radio  in  the world - one is run by the State  and  the

other is run by partisan groups like the Pathet Lao in

Laos  or  the  army  in Thailand, which  has  its  own

separate  radio.  The  navy,  the  police,  and  other

partisan  groups too have their own radios. The  other

type  of  radio is run by the State. In  a  democratic

State  like ours the radio and all the other media  of

information must give some consideration to  political

views  different from those of the persons in  control

of  the  State  organs. The reports  on  the  Assembly

debates  are  much to be deplored. For instance,  last

night, after the 7 o'clock news, there was a report on

the  Assembly debates which was written by a  reporter

of  Radio Singapore, who announced himself as Mr Vas.

There is much left to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



be   desired   in  that  particular  report   of   the

proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in certain countries, say, like

Australia, the proceedings of Parliament are broadcast

over the radio, and that is what the Government is now

scared  of. If we have proceedings broadcast over  the

radio,  there is no necessity for a report from  Radio

Singapore  or from the Ministry of Culture to  make  a

summary  in  his own words about what  he  called  the

"proceedings". Mr Speaker, Sir, the best alternative,

of  course,  is to broadcast the proceedings  of  this

Assembly. The second alternative, which should go hand

in hand with the first, is to remind the Government of

what the P.A.P. has declared, i.e. to make the radio a

statutory corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I remind this House of a speech

made  by the Prime Minister in Hansard, Vol. 2,  col.62 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> 5th September, 1956. In a speech

on  the  Government's policy, the Prime  Minister  in

1956 said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Can there be any doubt at all that Radio Malaya

should  be divorced from the Government and run  as  a

public corporation? Is there any real doubt that if we

wanted  to introduced television, and if the committee

sitting  on it should want to recommend it, it  should

be done by a public corporation?'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier in February 1956, in

Volume  1  of the Hansard, at the end of column  1548,

the Prime Minister in those days moved a motion-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. May I ask, Mr Speaker, Sir,

who  was  the  gentleman that was  Prime  Minister  of

Singapore in 1956?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. Mr Ong

Eng Guan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister in those days moved an amendment to a  motion

to introduce commercial television. The amended motion

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"That this House approves in principle the

introduction of television in Singapore and recommends

that   a  Commission  be  appointed  to  explore   the

possibilities  of setting up a public  corporation  to

operate it."'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The difficulty of the Chair is,

of course, to draw a line somewhere. At the moment, we

are debating Radio Singapore and there is, I think, an

amendment   which  will  be  moved  later   on   under

Development  Estimates, Head D47 at page  524  on  the

question  of television. So perhaps we had better  try

and confine ourselves at the moment to Radio Singapore

and leave out television.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only

touching  on  television  in  passing.  What  we   are

discussing  today is the policy of the  Government  on

the media of information. First of all, these media of

information  should  be  run by  public  corporations.

Secondly,  the  debates  on the  proceedings  of  this

Assembly should be reported in a more impartial manner

by the reporters, who we know have to take orders from

the   Government.  I  sympathise  with  them  in  this

respect,  disseminating the news and  views  of  other

Members of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other point I wish to raise is

this:  that  during the early days of June this  year,

Radio  Singapore  broadcast not only Government  news,

but  statements  issued in the  name  of  the  Central

Committee of the People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other matter which I want to

raise   under   this   Head   is   the   question   of

discrimination in the treatment of the Press. We  know

that discrimination-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The point has already been

raised  as to whether or not a criticism of the  Press

as  a  criticism can properly be made in  Committee  of

Supply proceedings, and I have ruled that if there  is

to  be  a direct criticism of the Press as such, then,

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



course,  the  matter is completely irrelevant  to  the

matters  we  are debating in the Committee of  Supply.

But  if  there is an allegation that the Minister  for

Culture  controls  the Press, then,  of  course,  the

debate can proceed on those lines, and on those  lines

only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am only

dealing with the relationship between the Ministry  of

Culture and the Press. As I have said just now,  there

is  discrimination in the treatment of the  Press.  As

there has been discrimination in the treatment between

European   business   and  local   business,   between

expatriate  civil servants, whose pay is  not  cut  at

all,  and the local civil servants, so there  is  also

discrimination  in the treatment of  the  Press.  From

what  I  know, during the past 18 months  the  Straits

Times  has  never  been hauled up  by  the  Government

except  in the case of a local reporter of the  Sunday

Mail,  a subsidiary of the Straits Times. But most  of

the  other local newspapers, particularly the  Chinese

vernacular Press, are living in jitters. Editors  have

been  hauled up, sub-editors questioned and  reporters

threatened.  All  the promises which  this  Government

made  before or during the election about the

British-owned  Press  have  now vanished into  thin  air.  For

instance,  Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Straits  Times  of

16th  April, 1959, the Secretary General of the P.A.P.

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it was an open secret the Straits Times editorial

staff was "scooting" to Kuala Lumpur on May 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who followed the paper's view should

"scoot along with them,".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no use, he continued, for Cynicus to say

regularly  "We Malayans" when he knew very  well  that

"those blooming scoundrels in the Straits Times"  were

the people who would run away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people who write that are the people who would

run away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an open secret that the Straits Times

editorial  staff are scooting off to Kuala  Lumpur  on

May 18."'.



<br><br>These   charges  were  repeated  by  other   Ministers

present.  Here  are  the  speeches  made  by  Mr   S.

Rajaratnam,  a  former member  of  the  staff  of  the

Straits Times and the Singapore Standard. He said-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the paper?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sorry. It is the Straits Times of

23rd April, 1959. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Addressing a lunchtime rally attended by several

thousand  people at the Fullerton building  car  park,

Mr S. Rajaratnam, a former member of the staff of the

Straits Times and of the Singapore Standard, said that

since  the  last P.A.P. rally two Singapore newspapers

had  become  very  interested in the  freedom  of  the

Press.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Another speaker, Mr K. M. Byrne, said that he was

sure the British Press would change their line against

the P.A.P. after the elections on May 30.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, did it change its attitude towards

the present P.A.P.? It is not because the attitude  of

the  Straits Times has changed, but because the policy

of  the P.A.P. has vitally departed from what they had

promised the people. This is what the present Minister

for   Culture  said  in  a  report  in  the  Singapore

Standard,  dated 30th April, 1959, about  the  Straits

Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`After a reference to a Straits Times editorial on

the  freedom of the Press, Mr Rajaratnam said:  "This

sounded  very  nice  but one thing the  Straits  Times

failed to answer is, freedom for whom?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freedom of the Press is the freedom of the people

of  Singapore. Very nice. But what exactly  does  this

mean?  Does freedom for the Straits Times mean freedom

for  the people, for the million and a half people  of

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put very bluntly, it means freedom of expression

only  for  the people who control and run the  Straits

Times."'.



<br><br>And he knows who run the Straits Times! He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"This is because the paper is completely in the

hands  of those who own what are called the management

shares."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are the people who own the management shares? I

hope  the Straits Times will correct me tomorrow if  I

am  wrong.  The  four  directors  are  Messrs.  R.  C.

Kendall,  M.  M.  Pierce,  K.  A.  Seth  and   A.   C.

Simmons."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a handbook here of European

companies  in  Malaya  which  shows  that  these  four

persons who more or less control $65,000 only  of  the

$8  million capital control the Straits Times, because

they  are the only persons who have the right to  vote

and  decide policies. What does support of the Straits

Times  mean?  The Minister for Culture in  those  days

said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Against this background it is easy to understand

why,  in the last general election, the Straits  Times

boosted   the  Progressive  Party,  the  party   which

unashamedly  pleaded  the  cause  of  colonialism  and

denounced socialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally, the Progressive Party lost the election.

Before  merdeka in the Federation, the  Straits  Times

boosted   Dato  Onn  and  sneered  at  the   Alliance.

Naturally, Dato Onn came a cropper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the Labour Front victory in Singapore, the

Straits  Times dropped the Progressives and  built  up

David Marshall into a heroic personality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marshall, too, went the way of Dato Onn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After Marshall, the Straits Times turned to build

up Tun Lim Yew Hock into a sort of poor man's Messiah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An attempt was made to build up the SPA into

something  bigger than what it really was.  Naturally,

the SPA too collapsed."'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have reminded the hon. Member

for Hong Lim that if he is to read extracts, they must

be  short ones. If the extracts are long, I think that

all  he  can do is to paraphrase them. I do not  think

the  time of the Assembly should be wasted on  lengthy

quotations. They should be short extracts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Straits

Times   is  now  supporting  the  policies   of   this

Government, and from the logic of what has  been  said

just now, this Government is also coming a cropper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It might support you, you know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I will ban the paper if I am on

that  side.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the present leaders  of

the  Government only dare to ban small mosquito  Press

like the Saturday Post.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other papers which have no big political backing and

European capital like the China Press in Kuala  Lumpur

are not allowed to come in because this Government can

only  survive  if European capital controls,  supports

and  backs  it. Everybody knows that it is the  banks,

like  the  Hongkong and Shanghai Banking  Corporation,

and foreign capital like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



the  Cold  Storage  which control  the  Straits  Times

through  their  agents. Since this  Government  cannot

carry  on without the support of European capital,  it

must,  like its predecessors, fall back on a  colonial

paper like the Straits Times. I believe that there are

attempts  by some local people to obtain a licence  to

start   an  English  paper.  I  understand  that   the

Government  insisted on having a  whole  list  of  the

staff  from the Chief Editor down to the peon  to  see

whether  there  are  any subversive  elements  amongst

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unless we allow a local

businessman  to  start a paper  in  English  which  is

capable of fighting the Straits Times (with Government

support), then there is no way to eradicate the vermin

in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask the Government to remember all its

election promises. It can carry out its promises by  a

very constructive proposal, that is, encourage a local

paper  organisation to print a paper  in  the  English

language and, when once it is given a start,  ban  the

Straits   Times  since  it  has  scooted  across   the

Causeway,  as  other newspapers in English  have  been

banned by this Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, next year the Ministry of

Culture  will  spend money to the tune of  57,036,290,

not taking into account its development programme. Let

us  give the Minister for Culture - if I am permitted to

say  at this juncture - time to follow the footsteps  of

the  Prime  Minister to enable him to answer questions

asked of him in the national language (Malay). I  feel

that this is appropriate and right to the point. If it

is  the Government policy for the Minister for Culture

to encourage the development of the national language,

I  earnestly  hope to hear him speak in  the  national

language   at  all  times,  and  not  only  on   Radio

Singapore.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the  Government  has  a

Minister  for  Culture  to  look  after  the  cultural

affairs  of  Singapore. We know that the  Ministry  is

concerned  with evolving a Malayan nation on  a  basis

that has been agreed upon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



We  can  accept  the  P.A.P.'s concept  of  a  Malayan

culture,  but my colleagues on this side of the  House

and  I  have full hopes that culture as based on Malay

culture  can be accepted. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  need  a

positive,  clear and sincere reply from  the  Minister

for  Culture  in this Assembly, and not  outside  this

Assembly, as to whether the Government is prepared  to

accept this. If the Government is not prepared  to  do

so,  I suppose it cannot be helped. It is left to  the

P.A.P. to pass judgment on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the Ministry of

Culture  has  set aside a sum of money for expenditure

on Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan and that its

head is to come from our neighbour, Indonesia. What  I

would  like  to  know further from  the  Minister  for

Culture  is  this. What are the plans that  have  been

formulated  by  the  head of  the  Dewan,  and  is  it

possible  that  he  will be able  to  discharge  his

obligations with only one stenographer? Perhaps in its

long-term  planning, the Government has a  prospective

successor to take over. Could the Minister tell us who

will be the prospective head of the Institute, as this

is an important post?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in connection with Radio Singapore

(Malay  section),  I  would like clarification  as  to

whether  it  is the policy of the Government  to  give

part-time  employment  to  people  who  already   have

permanent  jobs.  If  that  is  the  policy   of   the

Government, what is the reason for it? In addition  to

that, I am also told that the part-time employees  are

relatives  of  the staff currently employed  in  Radio

Singapore  (Malay section). Is this really  happening?

Why  are  employment  opportunities  closed  to  other

better able persons who are unemployed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Mr Speaker, Sir. Quite

often  I  hear  the  news items from  Radio  Singapore

(Malay  Section),  and I am afraid that  its  standard

will  deteriorate because it could be  said  that  the

Malay  announcers  read the news  items  like

school-children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now on an all-embracing

amendment,  "That  the total sum to be  allocated  for

Head 47 be reduced by $100."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an amendment of that nature is moved, the

debate   must   centre  around  general  policies   in

connection with the Ministry as a whole. I  think  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan was in order up  to  the

time when he touched on part-time employment, but when

he  touched on part-time employment and when  he  gave

details  as  to  who were, in fact, employed,  then  I

think he was inclined to swing a bit far away from the

motion. The topic he is touching on now appears to  me

to be a matter of detail. If it is a matter of detail,

then,  of course, he is too late. If he had wished  to

raise  detailed points, he ought to have given  notice

of   amendments  pinpointing  specific  items  in  the

Estimates. At the moment, I think we ought to  confine

ourselves to general principles.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek

clarification  from the Minister for  Culture  himself

particularly  on the question of the  basis  of  Malay

culture, whether it is to be accepted as the basis  of

our national culture. I hope this question will not be

answered  by  the Back-Benchers who I consider  to  be

ikan belis (small fry).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It seems to me that perhaps it is time

for  the  Chair  to try and channel the  debate  to  a

specific  subject because, as far as I can  make  out,

there  are four subjects which have been touched upon.

One is Radio Singapore, one is Press relations, one is

the basis of culture being Malay, and the fourth is a

point on Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if we now concentrate on the first topic,

that is, Radio Singapore, and deal with that aspect of

the  debate, it might be convenient for Members. Shall

we then dispose of Radio Singapore?



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, Radio Singapore or any other

radio  is  always  an  object of displeasure  for  the

Opposition,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



and  always  an object of approval for the Government.

It  happens  in every country. I am quite  sure,  Sir,

that  if  by  some  misfortune we  should  be  in  the

Opposition,  we  would be saying  precisely  the  same

things that Members of the Opposition have said.  But,

firstly,  I  suggest that reports of proceedings  which

last  from  2.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. cannot  be  summarised

into  a ten-minute bulletin without a great deal being

left  out; and, secondly, that the assessment of  news

varies    with    individual    reporters    in    any

organisation - three  reporters  often  cover  the  same

item - giving  different emphasis to different  speakers

and  different  speeches.  In  fact,  this  point   is

strengthened by the allegation made by the Member  for

Farrer   Park  that  not  only  has  Radio   Singapore

overlooked some of the weighty pronouncements  he  has

made but the Press too has done the same thing.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture and his officials

could  not,  when the debate is finished,  go  to  the

respective  newspaper offices and say to the  editors,

"Go   and  take  a  blue  pencil  and  cross  out  the

pronouncements  that have been made by the  Opposition

Members."   For  example,  yesterday   most   of   the

officials,  the  Ministers and  so  on,  were  at  the

Airport  to see somebody off. So to suggest  that  any

reporting done by these newspapers yesterday is due to

any instruction from the Minister or from the Ministry

of  Culture is both unfounded and false. Except, as  I

have  said before, where there is a big issue, we have

not  summoned editors, as the Member for  Farrer  Park

has  said.  We  have invited editors and reporters  to

come  and discuss certain issues, certain topics which

we  would like to be emphasised. But apart from  that,

if  a newspaper decides tomorrow to black-out a speech

by  a  Minister or by the Opposition, there is nothing

we can do about it. So the Opposition has been trying,

right  from the start, to create this rift, to conjure

up  this  picture  which they had painted  before  the

elections: that here are people who would line up  the

Press and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



give  them instructions and tell them, "Today this  is

what  you are going to report; this is what you should

do,  and this is what you should not do." But if  what

they  are  complaining about, as far as the  Press  is

concerned, is that at some certain time they feel that

their  words are not being given the weight that  they

should  be given, that is a matter for them,  and  not

for the Government, to take up with the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for reporting over Radio Singapore, I am

prepared  to put every Member of the Opposition  to  a

test.  I can invite them today, after this debate,  to

come to the office where the reporters will be writing

up the speeches that are being made here and ask them,

"Would  you  mind giving me a 10-minute summary" - which

is  about four pages of what might amount to 30 or  40

pages  of a full news report - "to go over the  air  by

half-past nine?", i.e., it must be ready by 9  o'clock

p.m.  I  am quite prepared to put every Member of  the

Opposition to a test, and I am quite sure,  Sir,  that

each one will give a different version which will  not

have  the  approval of other Members on the Opposition

side. So this type of argument that they are not given

fair   play,  that  their  speeches  are   not   given

sufficient weight, is one which will be repeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a newspaper man for 15 years, and I know

every  time newspapers come out with a report,  people

always ring up and say. "You know, the criticism which

I  have  spent three weeks composing has been  blacked

out."  Or, "I have made a very pertinent case  against

my  opponent which should have squashed him,  but  you

have  left it out. I made a long and involved argument

but  you just missed out one crucial link which  makes

the  whole  argument  sound  foolish."  That  sort  of

observation  is  always made  and  I  am  afraid  that

Members of the Opposition should resign themselves  to

that  fact. The Opposition should not indulge in  this

campaign  that they have been conducting for the  last

18  months  to  present the Ministry of  Culture,  its

officials,   its   Minister,  and  its   Parliamentary

Secretary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



as  having  a  torture room to which  they  bring  the

editors  and  reporters, and there twist  their  arms,

slap  them and say, "Now, you have been bad  boys.  Go

back and write as we say." If they want to put forward

that kind of suggestion, the first people to laugh  at

it would be the reporters and the editors themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member for Hong Lim, also a champion of

the freedom of the Press, ended up by saying that what

we  should do is to ban the Straits Times. He is still

a champion of the freedom of the Press. He is trying a

different  line, with different arms.  The  Opposition

has been trying very hard to present a picture showing

us  torturing  and  twisting of the arms  of  editors;

whereas  the Member for Hong Lim decides that he  will

play the game that he has been trying to play for  the

last  few  days.  He appears as the  champion  of  the

Chinese  Press.  He  says that we  are  discriminating

against the Chinese Press, so at the same time



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the

nationalist Press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Hong  Lim defines a "nationalist paper" simply as  any

paper which would refrain from publishing things which

might embarrass him, or publish things which might  be

of  value to him. All I can say is that, as far as  we

are  concerned,  if the Press is working  against  the

interests of this country, then, regardless of whether

it  is Chinese, Indian, Malay or English-speaking,  we

will  proceed against it. It is no use talking in  one

breath  about the freedom of Speech, and then  in  the

next breadth asking lo ban a paper because you do  not

like  it.  He  therefore  takes  this  line:  he   has

decided - this is not a strategy unknown to  us - that  he

had better cultivate one particular section and he now

appears as the champion of the Chinese Press. Then  he

goes  on  to  say  that  we are  bad  because  English

papers - he  did  not say so but he implied  it - go  scot

free.  That  is  not true. We will ban  any  newspaper

which   is   thought  to  be  yellow - the   Weekender,

published  by  the  Straits Times, a  lot  of  Chinese

mosquito  papers,  Malay  mosquito  papers,  journals.

Then, to reinforce his point - as usual, he has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



no  regard  for facts - he said that we had  banned  the

Saturday Post. We had never banned the Saturday  Post.

He  said  that we had banned the China Press.  We  had

never  banned  this  paper. We had never  stopped  the

China Press from coming here. But he has to appear  as

the  champion of the Chinese Press. Then, after a long

defence  of  the Press, he ends up by suggesting  that

the  Government should ban the Straits Times. Why? Can

he  give any reason? Unless he says that we should ban

a  paper  which  openly  and  straightforwardly  works

against the national interest



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member for Hong Lim is not

interested  in  clarification.  He  is  going  to  say

something  in this privileged Chamber which  he  hopes

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I just want to make some quotes,

that is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Order. I think the

Member  for Hong Lim must remember that he  can  start

speaking only when I have called him to speak, but  he

cannot just get up and make a speech. He must remember

that. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, this is a free debate and he

can  chip  in any time later on. I do not see  why  he

should get up now to clarify things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> He will have

plenty of clarifications coming in!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think all this is getting a bit

tiresome. One Member is trying to pose as the champion

of the Chinese Press. The others are trying to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



build  a  myth as champions of the Press  in  general,

that we have such a vast organisation which every  day

instructs  the papers that the Member for Farrer  Park

gets only three lines, the Member for Cairnhill, being

the  leader of the Party, gets four lines, the  Member

for  Hong Lim gets only two lines. Such an implication

is  not  true. All they have got to do is to find  out

from the Pressmen and editors themselves. We are quite

open  and  clear  about what we do. I have  called  up

editors and discussed things with them. In fact, to be

quite  frank  with  you,  I  have  indicated  to   one

newspaper that when the subject of education comes up,

to  beware  of  the Member for Hong Lim because  I  am

quite convinced that he is going to exploit that  from

a  more  or  less communal angle, but if the newspaper

thinks that that sort of thing is worth publishing, it

is up to it. It is up to the papers. If they decide to

give  the Member for Hong Lim full play, they  can  do

so. To that extent, I think we are quite justified  in

doing   it,  because  in  the  past  I  know   various

politicians who were Members of the Government and who

had  approached me and said, "Well, you know, you have

been attacking us. This is our point of view. What  do

you  think about it?" And if I decided it was  a  good

point  of view, I acceded to their request. If not,  I

would just carry on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as far as the newspapers

are  concerned, I do not think any valid fact has been

brought  forward  to substantiate the  myth  that  the

Government controls the Press.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as regards the suggestion by the Member

for  Hong  Lim  that the only way to  ensure  a  freer

expression  of speech over the radio is  to  broadcast

the  proceedings  of  this Assembly.  I  do  not  know

whether any of you have read the newspapers today. The

last  thing that the Government would want to  do  is,

first,   to   make  this  Assembly  an  occasion   for

broadcasting  things which might land Radio  Singapore

in extensive libel suits, unless, of course, at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



the  same time, we take care to pass laws to indemnify

Radio  Singapore against possible action. Secondly,  I

do  not think it would serve the purpose. Though it is

done in Australia, many other countries have turned it

down  on  the  ground that, far from this  becoming  a

debating Chamber, it becomes a tub-thumping arena  for

an  electioneering campaign and for  saying  downright

lies, it is very interesting that the Member for  Hong

Lim has got interested in this-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> On a point of order.

Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy speaker, the word

"lie", I believe, is unparliamentary, and I think



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Order. When the

Minister  said "down-right lies", I think he  did  not

say  it  in  connection with any particular Member  of

this House, and, therefore, I consider he is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A sensitive bloke he is in this

Assembly!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The third point which was brought up

was  about  the  Dewan Bahasa, and  the  question  was

asked,  what are our plans regarding the Dewan?  As  a

matter  of fact, Professor Muljana has been  here  for

just over a month. He has completed his plans, because

we  did not want to devise our own plans. We suggested

that  he  put  forward  his plans  and,  in  fact,  he

completed his report only a few days ago. But  I  have

had   no   time   to  read  it.  He   has   just   one

stenographer - this is purely for the purpose of getting

the   Dewan  started.  But  there  will  be  a  larger

complement of staff. Therefore, the third question  as

to who would be his successor, that, of course, is not

for  me  to say, because I am sure that if I  did  so,

that would start another debate from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



other side of the House. We hope that we will be  able

to  train somebody who will succeed him when his  term

is up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point brought up by the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan  is whether the Government  accepts

Malay culture as the basis for Malayan culture. It  is

not  a  new argument. This argument has been going  on

for  some  time,  and I would not like  to  repeat  in

detail the series of arguments that have been going on

for  the  last  two or three months. The  Government's

position  is this. We do not know what is  meant  when

you  say Malay culture should be the basis for Malayan

culture. I have asked representatives who came to  see

me,  "Does  it mean that the Government should  accept

Malay  culture as the basis for Malayan  culture?"  An

essential of culture is religion. And it will be taken

to  mean as such by other communities. If tomorrow the

Government boldly comes out and says, "Yes, we  accept

Malay culture as the basis for Malayan culture", there

will  be a lot of misunderstanding. The first question

that  people  will ask is: Does that mean that  Islam,

which is the basis of Malay culture, must become  part

of  Malayan culture, and that those who do not profess

Islam must remain outside the pale of Malayan culture?

That  is  a  question to which we must get a  definite

reply, that is, either you say, "No, that is not  what

we  mean when we say that Malay culture should be  the

basis for Malayan culture." Or again, culture includes

customs;  the  costumes that you wear,  your  marriage

ceremonies. So will Malay costumes, the Malay marriage

ceremony,  Malay beliefs, Malay habits, the  kind  of

food they eat - does it mean, when you say Malay culture

should  be  the  basis for Malayan culture,  that  the

Government should not recognise anything except  these

things?  Or  do  you  exclude  all  these  from   your

definition  of "Malayan culture"? I read an  editorial

in  the Utusan Melayu which dealt with this point.  In

fact,  I met a Malay delegation which came to see  me.

The  only  sound  basis  which  would  not  create   a

misunderstanding,  because  the  Government   is   not

prepared, in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



multi-racial  society, to announce a slogan  which  is

going  to  create misunderstanding and  confusion,  is

this.  We said that the only sensible thing we can  do

is to accept one thing as a basis for Malayan culture,

and that is the Malay language, which has already been

so accepted. Language is an essential part of culture.

In  fact,  the  Utusan Melayu, in a  very  interesting

editorial, eventually came to the same conclusion - that

all that you can press for is to ask the Government to

declare  that  the  Malay language be  the  basis  for

Malayan  culture. If that is the case,  we  are  quite

prepared  to  accept that. But to go beyond  that,  to

make  a  vague statement that Malay culture should  be

the  basis for Malayan culture and leave it  at  that,

would  be dangerous, because it would cause a reaction

on the part of the other communities who will say that

this  Government is going to force Islam on them,  and

force  customs and habits which belong to a different

community on them. But if what is really meant is that

the Government should recognise the Malay language  as

the  basis for a Malayan culture, there is some  sense

to   it,  and  this  can  be  accepted  by  the  other

communities without any fear or confusion. But  beyond

that,  I do not think the Government is quite prepared

to  go  because we feel that this might  result  in  a

grave  and  serious misunderstanding which might  have

other consequences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Kandasamy, may I just remind the House of the Standard of the 30th April, 1959,

with the heading:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`PAP guns turn on the Straits Times Paper accused:

You  have misled english-educated Rajaratnam leads the

attack again'



<br><br>That is the heading. And in the contents, the Minister

for  Culture  gave  the reason why the  Straits  Times

should be banned in those days:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"The Straits Times is heavily committed to

defending forces and interests which are part  of  the

colonial  structure  which is  visibly  disintegrating

before our eyes."'.



<br><br>Earlier he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Freedom of the Press is the freedom of the people

of  Singapore. Very nice. But what exactly  does  this

mean? Does freedom for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



the Straits Times mean freedom for the people, for the

million and a half people of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put very bluntly, it means freedom of expression

only  for  the people who control and run the  Straits

Times."'.



<br><br>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these same people now control

and  run  the Government. To my knowledge, the Straits

Times  has  never  been called up in the  past  twenty

months.  But  everytime the Chinese  Press  and  other

vernacular  Press have been hauled up.  I  understood,

that  is  to  say, in one of the Chinese papers  dated

21st October this year - the Nanyang Siang Pau with the

heading:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prime Minister condemns Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br>The story behind this, I believe, is very interesting.

After  the debate the Press were told that the heading

should be, `Prime Minister scolds Ong Eng Guan'.  When

he  went to the papers, the editor did not think  that

this  was good for the prestige of the Prime Minister.

He  changed the word "scolds" to "condemns". Then what

happened?  They  were  given a reprimand.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, to this Government, there are two  types

of  Press.  To  us there are two types  of  Press.  We

support  the  Press  which  supports  the  nationalist

movement.  They support the Press which  supports  the

colonial  movement.  So the Press which  supports  the

nationalist  movement, we say freedom  of  speech.  To

them there is no freedom of speech. To the Press which

supports  the colonial movement, we say no freedom  of

speech.  To them there is complete freedom of  speech.

That is the difference, Mr Deputy Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I

wish  to  raise one or two further points in order  to

clarify my doubts with regard to the replies given  by

the  Minister for Culture. Apart from his explanation,

could  he say whether the memorandum submitted by  the

Permanent Malay Literary Congress to the Minister  for

Culture  sets  out  in  detail  the  meaning  or   the

conception  of Malay culture as the basis  of  Malayan

culture,  and how the conceptions could be implemented

by   the  Government?  Apart  from  that,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



question  from me which the Minister for  culture  has

not replied to is this. On principle, is it the policy

of  the  Minister for Culture - on the  whole,  all  his

departments - to  recruit part-time  employees  and  the

employees who are recruited have in one way or another

relations  in Radio Singapore? Is this the  policy  of

the Government?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I was

impressed  by  the  Member for Kampong  Kembangan  who

referred   to   the  Back-benchers  as  "small   fry".

Admittedly  we  are small fry. But all  the  same,  we

represent the poor masses whose number is large. It is

better to be like that than be like a big fish,  which

eats up anything that comes across its way. Mr Deputy

Speaker, the characteristic of a big fish is like that

of an opportunist. It will swallow anything that comes

across its mouth as long as it benefits its own ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to touch on matters relating to culture which have been repeatedly

mentioned  by  the  Member for Kampong  Kembangan,  as

though  he  is the sole champion of Malay  culture  in

Singapore.  I have had occasion to meet  a  number  of

responsible  people  in the Permanent  Malay  Literary

Congress,  including its leader. They  have  expressed

their  regrets that these cultural matters  have  been

brought in the Assembly by political opportunists.

the  question  of  Malayan culture.  Let  us  complete

Malayan  culture and then go back to the other  topics

if  it is convenient to hon. Members. We can then come

back  to Radio Singapore and Press relations and Dewan

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is it a question of great difficulty?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, it is not. The suggestion I am

making  is, of course, in order to try to channel  the

debate on specific subjects and clear those hurdles as

we  get to them. We will come back to the other points

later. So shall we then complete the debate on Malayan

culture?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, to

continue  with my speech, I would like  to  stress  in

this Assembly that it is possible that after making my

speech, I would be accused of being insincere  to  the

Malay  people or to the Muslim religion. I  wish  this

matter to be treated calmly. It is possible too that I

might be accused of being a political adventurer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of Malay culture

as the basis of Malayan culture, this is a matter that

has  long  been  debated  and  discussed  by  experts,

whether  they  be in the Federation of  Malaya  or  in

Singapore. Misunderstanding arose. As a result of  the

misunderstanding, I have had occasion to meet a number

of  experts, including the head of the Permanent Malay

Literary  Congress, who told me that he regretted  the

attitude  of certain circles who sought to  drag  this

question   of  culture  through  political   channels,

thereby  giving rise to the unhappy consequences  that

we  see  today.  He and other people in the  Permanent

Malay  Literary Congress are of the opinion that  they

are the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



who  are well qualified to deal with this matter,  and

they have done so through a memorandum which they have

submitted  to  the Minister for Culture in  Singapore.

The  memorandum,  I believe, is now receiving  careful

attention.  The  Malay cultural experts  in  Singapore

have  stressed to me that these matters should rightly

be  taken  up by cultural experts who are  really  and

thoroughly  expert in this particular matter,  because

it  is  only the cultured people who really  know  the

value  of  culture and who really do know anything  at

all about culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the remarks that Members on the Back

benches  are but small fry, I would like to  say,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that these so-called  small  fry  have

never  given  official  replies  to  the  question  of

culture. What has taken place is that I had spoken  on

the  matter  when the Permanent Language and  Literary

Congress  in  Singapore was welcoming the  arrival  of

Prof. Slamet Muljana, who is the present head of Dewan

Bahasa of Singapore. I said then that, to the best  of

my   knowledge,  Government  had  never  refused   nor

accepted the concept of Malay culture being the  basis

of  a  Malayan  culture. But the very  next  day,  the

newspapers  reported to the effect that the  Singapore

Government  had  never accepted the concept  of  Malay

culture  being  the basis of Malayan culture,  and  my

name was quoted in respect of that report. I took  the

step  to write to the papers concerned to clarify  the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to stress with

all  sincerity, that those of us, who  are  taking  up

this  matter  for the purpose of evolving  a  peaceful

society in the interest of our people should not utter

anything  in  our  speeches that would  give  rise  to

disharmony   in   matters   concerning   the   various

ideologies of the people in Singapore. I am no  expert

on  cultural matters myself. Therefore, I feel  it  is

only  proper  that the concept of Malay culture  being

the basis of a Malayan culture should be left to those

who  know  it  to deal with it. A memorandum  on  this

concept has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



submitted  to the Minister for Culture by a body  that

represents  all  the organisations  which  are  really

interested  in this matter of culture. They  and  they

alone  are the people who should be dealing with  this

matter. This has not been taken into consideration  by

the  people  whose actions have been merely  to  cause

feelings  of  disunity. I say it is only  the  experts

alone who really know the true worth of the matter and

who   can  distinguish  between  precious  stones  and

imitation stones. This is all I have to say  in  order

to bring about better unity and better racial feeling.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

debating the amendment to the Head on the Ministry  of

Culture,  I  would like to express my views concerning

the part played by the Ministry-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am not quite certain whether

the  Member  for the Southern Islands is  touching  on

Malayan culture.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is Malayan culture, and Malayan

culture alone.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Actually, Mr Speaker,

it  is  my purpose to speak on the subject of bringing

about a Malayan culture. The task of evolving it is  a

difficult  one. The Ministry of Culture was formed  at

the  time  when  this Government  took  the  reins  of

office.  It  was expected then that the  Minister  for

Culture had a definite concept or had ideas which were

acceptable  for  them  to  be  carried  out.  Now  the

Government has been in power for well over a year, but

what we find today is that the efforts of the Ministry

of  Culture are still vague. A big amount of money  is

to  be allocated to the Ministry for plans which  are,

of  course, very useful to the country, but  money  is

badly needed for the welfare of the people. If such  a

big  amount  of money is spent without bringing  about

beneficial results to the country, then I say that  is

wrong. Culture is something that should encompass  all

races in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



country.  It is a matter that cannot be formulated  by

any  particular individual or by any particular  group

of  people.  It  cannot be forced upon the  people  by

anybody  or by any organisation. It is something  that

is  alive, and it grows by itself only. What we can do

is  to  prevent what is bad from evolving so  that  it

does  not become part and parcel of the people  living

in  this  country.  If this is the  only  plan  to  be

carried  out by the Ministry, then I feel that  it  is

not  right that we spend a sum to the tune of over  $7

million  in  order to stamp out what is called  yellow

culture,  about which the Government keeps on crowing.

If  so  much  money is to be spent for the purpose  of

wiping  out  yellow culture, then I feel  that  it  is

money not wisely spent. If we compare the work done by

the Ministry of Culture with that of other Ministries,

we  see that very little work of a cultural nature has

been done. There are many things that we are short of.

We still need more staff in the Ministry of Education.

In  view  of the shortage of staff in the Ministry  of

Education, I feel that that sum of over $7 million  to

be  spent  by  the Ministry of Culture, which  has  no

specific plans to achieve its purpose, is money  which

could  be  put  to  better  use  by  the  Ministry  of

Education. Culture should have its basis in education.

Education  will  enable the people  to  improve  their

standard  of  living and economic  conditions.  It  is

difficult  really to bring about the  evolution  of  a

Malayan culture by the wish of the Government. If I am

not  wrong, I have read in the papers that it  is  not

possible to bring about Malayan culture to people  who

are  now beyond help, but that the process of evolving

it  will begin with our children. Therefore, it is  my

opinion that the money to be allocated to the Ministry

of  Culture  could more properly be allocated  to  the

Ministry  of  Education. If  I  am  not  wrong  in  my

analysis,  there are about 600 Division I officers  in

the  Headquarters Division of the Ministry of Culture.

Money  is  very  much more needed in the  Ministry  of

Education. There are teachers attached to the Ministry

of  Education, and these are the people who are really

suited  for the purpose of giving proper education  to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



children.  The matter that I raise is in the  interest

of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we should not aim at something that

we  hope  to  bring  about by force.  That  is  highly

unsatisfactory. I do not wish to go into details about

the  mistakes that have been made. The Members of  the

Government   have   no   proper  culture   themselves.

Formerly, we saw the Members on the Government side-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for the Southern

Islands is now embarking on personalities, and I  have

been  trying  to stop that from the very beginning  of

this  debate in the Committee of Supply. There  should

be  no personalities. Further, as the opportunity  has

presented  itself, it appears to me that  perhaps  the

hon. Member is going away from the issue that has been

raised,  that  is, whether Malayan culture  should  be

based on Malay culture. I have mentioned that, as  the

time is getting short - there are three topics that will

have to be discussed, and this Head 47 will have to be

disposed  of  by  6.35  p.m. I just  mention  that  in

passing.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is  not my intention to touch on personalities. I only

want  to express my views in a sincere manner. If what

I said was wrong, then I readily withdraw. But we must

first ourselves practise what we wish to carry out  so

that the people will not be hoodwinked. That is all  I

wish to say on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On Malayan culture.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I think we have spent quite some time on

this topic, but I feel that some of the points brought

forward  by  the Government do not really  answer  the

points raised by the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that I was the first Member in this

Assembly  who  brought  up  the  question  of  Malayan

culture  based on Malay culture. The question I  posed

then   was   whether  the  proposed  Malayan   culture

envisaged by the Government could be based upon  Malay

culture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



Eighteen months have passed, Sir, and yet we have  not

had a definite reply from the Minister himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not an expert on Malay culture. I know a

few  Malay  songs, and probably know how to dance  the

rong-geng and say my prayers five times a day; but  I

cannot  accept  the  statement  by  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for National  Development

when  he said that we in this Assembly should not take

part  in  the debate on this issue because we are  not

experts on Malay culture. Sir, I think the stand taken

by the Parliamentary Secretary is completely wrong. We

are  being asked to vote a sum of over $7 million  for

the  running of the Ministry of Culture, and it is our

duty   and  our  responsibility  as  Members  of  this

Assembly to debate the issue and to get proper answers

from the Minister concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, culture is a very wide thing. In fact, I do not

think  that  there  is any expert  amongst  the  Malay

community today in Singapore or even in Malaya who can

claim  that he is an expert on Malay culture. I  would

rather suggest, Sir, to the Government that instead of

forcing the people of Singapore to accept what I would

call a "synthetic" Malayan culture, it would be better

that they let the people themselves decide and let the

people themselves in their actions and in their way of

life evolve a culture which would be acceptable to all

parties concerned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister might wish to say a few

words  in  reply and then we can pass  on  to  another

topic. If there is sufficient time, we will come back

to Malay culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, much time has been spent on this

subject.  A great deal has been said by both sides  of

the  House as to what is the correct attitude to Malay

culture.  Certain  Members of the  Opposition  want  a

straightforward declaration by the Government that  it

is prepared to adopt Malay culture as the basis for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



a Malayan culture. The Government stand is that we are

not  saying yes or no, because we do not know what the

term  means.  We are not sure about the definition  of

Malay culture, because if once the Government makes  a

policy,  it must carry it out in some way and it  must

do  something to follow it up. The only thing  we  can

say  is  that we accept Malay as the national language

and  that  we  are implementing it. People  have  been

taking  contradictory attitudes. On the one hand,  the

Government is told not to force culture. On the  other

hand,  the demand is made, "Let the Government declare

that  Malay culture is the basis for Malayan culture."

There  is  a  contradiction. We say  that  culture  is

something about which Government cannot declare, "This

is  a  Malay  culture  and that is  Malayan  culture."

Culture  is  something which the  people  decide  for

themselves. All that the Government can do to  promote

Malayan  culture is to create a Malayan  consciousness

and  a  Malayan  loyalty. Anything that  hinders  that

objective, like the development of racialism, communal

outlook,  exploitation of communal  feelings,  can  be

minimised  or  stopped  by  the  Government.  To  that

extent,  the  Government is carrying out a  policy  to

prevent the kind of thing that is happening in Ceylon.

I  would  request all Members of this  House - not  only

from  this  side but also from the other side  of  the

House - to read a book titled "Emergency, 1958 - The Story

of the Ceylon Race Riots".



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that is one of the most terrible books

I  have  read.  It is written by a journalist  and  he

says,  in  developing his argument,  that  before  the

riots  came  people said things were  very  nice.  The

Tamils  and Singhalese were getting on well  together;

everything  was harmonious, the people said  it  could

not  happen in Ceylon. "That is what we all thought" - I

am  just  quoting,  Sir. "After  all,  we  have  lived

together, Singhalese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



and  Tamils,  for  so long, sharing  our  profits  and

losses."  Then he goes on to explain how  they  fought

together  to  achieve self-government. Yet  ten  years

after that, something went wrong and they had the most

terrible episode in Ceylonese history, when Singhalese

and Tamils, who were far more akin to one another than

the   races   here,  indulged  in  the   most   brutal

bestialities that can ever be conceived. In  fact,  he

ends  up  by saying that he wished that not only  the

Government but also the people had foreseen  all  this

and had done something to prevent its coming about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that the Government is doing is that though it

cannot  determine what the future will be, it will  at

least  do  what  is humanly possible to avert  certain

foreseen  dangers. Some people say  that  we  may  not

succeed  in creating a Malayan culture. For us Malayan

culture is anything which would prevent antagonism and

conflict  between the races. If we can  prevent  that,

then we will have justified our existence. If we fail,

then  when  people turn round and say,  "Why  did  not

somebody do anything about it?", at least we can  say,

"We  did our best, and we tried to avert it." So that,

in  essence, is our attitude towards Malayan  culture.

So  as  regards the demand to declare what is  Malayan

culture,  our stand is, we do not know what  it  means

and  we Will not embark on making a slogan which might

be  misunderstood  outside  and  spark  off  what  has

happened in Ceylon. In Ceylon during the election  one

group suddenly decided casually to raise a slogan - they

did  not  know  what  it meant at that  time - and  this

started  the  events that ended in  the  Emergency  in

1958.  At least, we hope that this Government and  the

Opposition could at least prevent an emergency here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in talking about Radio Singapore and

the  Press  generally and what directions he  gave  to

them, the Minister said, "Yes, of course. If they work

against the interests of the country, then I will call

them  up  and  tell  them what the  interests  of  the

country are, and they should toe the line in so far as

the interests of the country are concerned."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, therein lies the difficulty, and

because  there  are these possible difficulties - honest

difficulties -  sometimes one  gets  into  a  difficult

situation and does something which normally should not

be  done in a democratic State. Now, how does one work

against  the interests of a country? My conception  of

that,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in a democratic country,  is

this - I take it that all this is against the background

of  a  democratic government - one talks  about  working

against the interests of the country when one indulges

in  treason  against  the State, that  is,  trying  to

destroy the State in one way or the other, or sedition

against  the  Government,  or  trying  to  upset  the

Government,  or  trying to create in  a  country  like

Singapore  communal  troubles or  religious  troubles.

These, as I understand them, are some things which are

against  the interests of the country. The  test,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is: does the Government think they  are

against  the  interests of the country? And  does  the

Opposition  also think they are against the  interests

of  the  country?  On  these matters,  Sir,  both  the

Government and the Opposition are agreed there must be

no  sedition; there must be no treason; there must  be

no  incitement to communal troubles; there must be  no

incitement to religious troubles. Therefore, we get to

the  situation  where all sections of the  public  are

agreed  that  those are matters which are against  the

interests of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democratic State where we believe in the party

system of democracy, each Party has a particular  line

of policy which it offers to the country at elections,

and  if that policy is acceptable, it is returned.  In

the  case  of  the  People's Action Party,  they  were

returned  on a programme with a 53 per cent vote;  47

per  cent  went  against them. They were  returned  on

certain  policies - 53 per cent of the voters voted  for

them on those policies, and 47 per cent against. If on

those  policy issues there is a divergence of opinion,

Mr Speaker, Sir, I am suggesting to the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



for  Culture  that  that is not  working  against  the

interests of the country. Definitely not. Certainly it

might be working against the interests of the Party in

power.  The Opposition's quarrel is on these  matters:

that  the Minister is interfering with Radio Singapore

and  the  freedom of the Press merely in the interests

of  his own Party. He does not wish his Government  to

be  shown up in a bad light. It is not undemocratic in

a  democratic State for the Government to be shown  up

in  a  bad  light. The truth of the matter is this - the

P.A.P.  Government is oversensitive; it does not  like

its  policies  to  be shown up in  a  bad  light;  and

anybody  who  dares  to do that  is  rapped  over  the

knuckles in no uncertain manner. Mr Speaker, Sir,  if

it  goes to press, one can say it is not a matter  for

the  Assembly to discuss in detail. But when it  comes

to  Radio Singapore, which is being kept alive out  of

public  funds, then it certainly becomes the  business

of  this Assembly to see that its policy is the proper

policy.  I ask the Minister this in all sincerity:  if

Radio  Singapore, in doing an honest job, holds  up  a

particular Minister in a light which the Minister does

not  like, or holds up the Government in a light which

the  Government  does not like, what action  will  the

Minister  take? Will the Minister take  severe  action

against  the  Head of Radio Singapore for holding  the

Government  up  to contempt, to ridicule?  Unless  the

P.A.P. is  prepared  to accept the  situation,  I  am

suggesting  to them, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  they  are

not a democratic government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It appears to me that possibly the two

topics  could  be taken together - Radio  Singapore  and

Press relations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Concerning the two objections that

the  Member for Farrer Park has raised to substantiate

his  point that there is interference with the  Press.

First, I think he is being completely inaccurate  when

he  says  that  newspapers are called  up  and  rapped

across the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



knuckles, and so on. I have been a newspaperman, and I

wish  the  Member  has read some  of  the  memoirs  of

journalists about what happened in Britain during  the

war.  Churchill held press conferences  from  time  to

time,   even  after  the  war;  interviews  by   Press

Relations  Officers,  whose  function  it  is  to  put

newspapermen   in   contact   with   statesmen,    and

politicians,  so that the latter can  put  over  their

views  to  try  to  persuade the Press  to  accept  or

understand the Government's points of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Radio Singapore, it is true that Radio

Singapore  will not be allowed to carry on  an  attack

against  Ministers. Similarly, it would not be allowed

to  carry  on an attack against the Member for  Farrer

Park  or the Member for Cairnhill. We will be just  as

strict  about  it.  In  fact, can  he  point  out  one

instance,  since  the  P.A.P. took  over,  when  Radio

Singapore  had - we could have done it if we had  wanted

to - attacked any Member of the Opposition? It must have

been  in the presentation of news because, as you will

have seen, Sir, in the days when we had two newspapers

here, the same news was presented, but because it  had

been  condensed  obviously one paper tended  to  place

emphasis - though  factually correct  - which  displeased

one side, whereas the Straits Times presented the same

news  in  a  way  which flattered the same  side.  So,

therefore,  this vague suggestion that the  Government

is  using knuckle-dusters to get the Press to blackout

the  speeches  or the activities of the Opposition  is

not  true. But we certainly mean it when we  say  that

the  Government has a right to approach  newsmen-I  do

not  mean  Communist newspapermen, but I do mean  both

foreign and local correspondents - have a chit chat with

them and say, "Your comments on this were quite wrong.

In  fact, this is what I think it should be." They may

accept  it;  they  may reject it. But certainly,  Sir,

democratic  freedom does not mean that the  Government

must  keep quiet and must not make its views known  to

newspapermen or people who work in the radio.  In  the

case of the radio, it is a Government department.  But

certainly it is not suggested that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Culture should instruct Radio Singapore,

for  example, to carry on attacks on the  speeches  of

the  Minister for Culture made today, any more than  I

would   instruct  Radio  Singapore  to   broadcast   a

commentary attacking the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding this

question  of the freedom of the Press, as I have  said

in  this Assembly, there has been no open intimidation

by the Government. If it is open intimidation, one can

easily   pinpoint  it.  What  is  more   sinister   is

suggestive intimidation. Sir, the Minister wants  some

illustrations. Take, for instance, the  reporters  who

have  Press cards to attend this Assembly sitting.  It

has  been said outside that if one does not please the

Government,  if one displeases the Government  in  the

presentation of the news, Press cards are withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Cairnhill  is  trespassing on  the  preserves  of  the

Speaker, because Press Admission Orders are issued  by

the Speaker, and cancelled only by the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I understand that point, Sir, but

the things that are said are like that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Who says?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It has also happened that Press

cards  to  the  Department of  Information  have  been

withdrawn. And it has been done to reporters who  were

not  so friendly towards, well, who had displeased the

Government.  Surely,  Sir, we on the  Opposition  have

taken  the  trouble to ask reporters, "What  is  wrong

with  your  paper?" "Tch! I say you don't  know,  man.

Tch!  Least said soonest mended. I don't want  to  get

into  trouble with this Government." That is  what  is

going  on!  It  may  not be true, but  the  fact  that

Government  has  at times taken action  which  is  not

democratic gives everyone a feeling of fear. It may be

unjustified.  "Don't play the fool.  This  Government,

tch, watch out! Least said soonest mended."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I just want to answer the point

raised  by the Minister for Culture. He has said  that

no  government  can  stand  aside  and  see  that  its

policies are not given proper presentation. I entirely

agree with him, Mr Speaker. But if they think that  a

newspaper has got hold of the wrong end of the  stick,

then  they are entitled to call the paper up,  have  a

talk  with them, and say, "This is the policy. I think

you  misunderstood it." But the democratic  test,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is this: after having done that, if  the

Press still continues not to support the Minister  and

attacks  him  on his policy - that is the  real  testing

time - what would the Minister do in such a situation?

If  he keeps quiet and says, "Well, I will defend your

right  to  criticise  me," then  he  is  a  democratic

Minister.  But  if he feels hurt, goes  into  a  huff,

calls  the Press up, and then gives it what he  thinks

it  deserves,  then he is not doing the  right  thing.

That  is  what we are complaining about. Mr  Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as has been

mentioned before, the phrase "against the interest  of

the  State" is quite a loose phrase. For instance,  an

anti-P.A.P. report can easily be  stretched  to  mean

anti-Government, because the P.A.P. happens to  be  in

the   Government;   and,  of  course,  anti-Government

reports can be said to be against the interest of  the

State,  Talking about knuckle-dusters, slapping,

arm-twisting, and all that - you do not need all that,  Sir,

to  exert  control. I think the Minister for Education

especially will bear me out when I say that the modern

method of teaching and educating people is not by

arm-twisting.  Teachers  control  their  classes   without

having  to  twist the children's arms. Is it necessary

to  summon the pressmen before each publication? It is

also  not necessary to limit the space or time of  the

reports.   Just  now  the  Minister  himself  admitted

calling  the pressmen one day and, let us  say,  paved

the way in establishing the atmosphere and the tune in

which his report should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



made.  Sir,  a seemingly innocent and harmless  but  a

well calculated tip from the Minister to the Press  is

quite  different and is not comparable with a protest,

no  matter  how vigorous, from the Opposition  or  the

members  of the public. I do not think I need go  into

details  about this because it is too obvious and  too

apparent.  It  would  be  an  insult,  Sir,   to   the

intelligence and the capability of the members of  the

Press  to say that they need detailed suggestions  and

instructions in each instance. Surely they are capable

of  carrying out an overall and general instruction on

principles  that  hold good at all times  and  in  all

matters.  But  a seemingly friendly and  harmless  but

well calculated tip from the Minister is sufficient to

make  the Press understand that they should take heed,

or else-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts to wipe out Opposition views is

clearly seen not only in the Press and radio but  also

in  the  bulletins  that Government  issue  at  public

expense.  In  other  democratic  countries,  bulletins

issued  by Government at public expense give both  the

views  of  the  Government  and  the  Opposition.  For

instance, here is one from America, when Mr Nixon was

in the Government, in which both Mr Kennedy's and Mr

Nixon's views are given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While talking about Government bulletins, I wonder

if  the  Hon. the Minister for Culture could  tell  us

whether  there  is any significance in putting  a  big

chop  on  a picture showing the Prime Minister shaking

hands  with  Mr Lim Chin Siong. I ask this.  Sir,  in

view  of all that has been said in this House  by  the

Member for Cairnhill about the gentleman concerned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I did not intend to enter into

this  debate, Mr Speaker, Sir, but it strikes me that

the  whole level of the discussion emanating from  the

Opposition is so puerile that-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know why at this late

hour the Minister for Finance is starting to embark on

unparliamentary words. Let us try and keep this debate

in as adult a manner as we can.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The impression that I intended to

convey, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that the argument used by

the   Opposition  would  disgrace  even   any   debate

conducted by the Fifth Form in our local schools. They

tried to put out the idea that the Ministry of Culture

is  exercising  some form of subtle control  over  the

Press. All Governments in any democratic country  have

relations with the Press, and it is their right to see

that  their views are fairly represented. Where  there

has  been misreporting, it is right for the Government

to  make representation to the papers concerned.  That

right they have conceded, but in no instance have they

brought  any evidence to show that we have  done  more

than  this.  In the one case where a Member  from  the

Opposition tried to give some evidence, he was  caught

on  the  wrong  foot immediately by you, Mr  Speaker,

Sir. The test of whether the Press is free is a simple

one. Has this Government closed down any newspaper  in

Singapore   on  the  ground  that  it  had  criticised

Government  policy? Can the Opposition name  one  such

instance?  So  it is obvious that what the  Opposition

are  really worried is that, by and large, the  P.A.P.

Government  has had a good Press. And may  I  suggest.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that the reason could  possibly  be

that  we have governed well. The Opposition have  also

expressed  dissatisfaction that their views  have  not

been  given  sufficient publicity in the Press.  Again

the  explanation could well be that if they had talked

more  sense, the Press might have printed a  lot  more

than they had done of what the Opposition had said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on this particular

question  of Press freedom, I got the impression  that

the  Opposition  were just like  blind  men  who  were

groping in a dark room for a hen which was not  there.

So we have this impression of their going through the

motion  of  suggesting that there is  something  there

when  it  is  not  there. In fact, the  Minister  for

Finance  asked  what papers had been closed  down.  We

have  closed down a few papers - the Week-Ender,  a  few

mosquito  papers.  In  what  way  have  we  tried   to

intimidate  the  Press?  The  Member  for  Mountbatten

talked  vaguely  of intimidation and so  on.  She  got

worked up,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



If  she  is  really trying to win the  favour  of  the

pressmen,  she is going about it in the wrong  way.  I

know  pressmen. One thing they resent  is  being  told

that  they  are stooges of somebody else. If  this  is

what  the  Members have been indulging in, I  am  very

sorry  if  tomorrow they get a poorer showing  in  the

newspapers  than  what  they have  got  in  the  past,

because,  as a newspaperman myself, I know  there  are

ways  of  winning over newspaper people, and the  best

way is not to suggest that they are stooges, which  is

what has been happening here for the last one hour.  I

am not supposed to look up there, Sir, I am looking at

the  Opposition! Perhaps I can give a word of  advice.

If the Opposition want to get a better press, let them

say  some bright things. Let them say some intelligent

things.  I  am  quite sure it would be very  difficult

even  for  the  Minister for Culture  to  prevent  the

Press, which is a competitive one, from publishing it.

They  have  to  sell  their newspapers.  If  there  is

something worth-while, they will publish it.  If  hon.

Members feel that they have been at a disadvantage for

the last eighteen months, I do not mind giving them  a

few  hints  in  private on how to  win  and  influence

newspapermen without twisting their arms  and  without

having to insult them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is this, Sir. The Government has

certainly to intervene in certain cases (which I think

the  Member  for Farrer Park has outlined)  when  they

affect  the basic structure of our society. If we  all

accept the democratic system, to that extent, we  have

the  right, in the present situation, to intervene  to

see  that that basic structure which we all accept  is

not   destroyed.  If  somebody  says  that  it  is   a

transgression - in theory yes, it is a transgression  of

absolute  freedom. If a newspaper indulges in  tactics

which  might incite communal hatred or race riots,  we

will intervene. In fact, during the last one year,  we

have  had  occasion to ring up the Press and  ask  for

their  co-operation to keep certain unpleasant stories

out  of the Press. In fact, we know that a failure  to

do  that-not  by the past Government, but  some  years

ago - resulted in the loss of many lives. When you  talk

of national interest, it is not the interest of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Government because we can, whether we  are  or

are  not the Government, get much more space than  the

Opposition  can ever get. But it is not to defend  the

P.A.P.  But  when  we think that the interest  of  the

country  as a whole is involved, then, to that extent,

we  are quite prepared to modify the absolute freedom,

which  nobody  accepts, not even in Britain.  To  that

extent, Sir, we concede that we do interfere with  the

Press. But where it means interference with the  Press

to  blackout  the Opposition. I think that  is  false,

because  a  good newspaper man works on a very  simple

principle-print all the news that is fit to print.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may go back

again  to  Radio  Singapore.  Although  we  have  been

discussing  for  quite some time  certain  aspects  of

Radio  Singapore, we have not really touched upon  one

side  of its functions, that is, the Malay programmes.

I  would  suggest to the Minister concerned to  listen

more  carefully to the programmes that  are  emanating

from  the  Malay section of Radio Singapore.  For  one

thing, the jokes which come out from the Malay section

of Radio Singapore are very filthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is about certain lectures which are

broadcast  by  the  Malay section of Radio  Singapore.

There  was  one  the other day on family  planning.  I

heard  it, and my children heard it. Some of the words

used by the Malay section of Radio Singapore, again if

I  may say so, are filthy. One of the expressions used

was  "ayer mani", that is, semen. So my little  child,

who is only four years old, came up to me and asked me

what it was. I think this sort of thing should not  be

broadcast over Radio Singapore, particularly when  the

radio  is  available to our little children.  I  would

suggest  to  the Minister to look more carefully  into

the Malay programmes of Radio Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to touch upon is

freedom of the Press. We have been wasting quite  some

time  on this subject. Not only today but probably  at

every sitting of this Assembly, this subject has  been

touched  upon. We say that the Press is not free.  The

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



says  that the Press is free. So I think that the test

of the whole matter is for the newspapers concerned to

say  whether they are free or not. I would, therefore,

suggest, Sir, to all the Press in Singapore to issue a

statement  tomorrow and say whether they are  free  or

not.  If  they will not say anything, that means  that

they are not free.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, we have only a few minutes

left. The Opposition is not accusing the Government of

open  intimidation. We do not say  that  we  want  the

Government  to  tell  the  Press  to  give   us   more

publicity,  because we do not require that.  But  then

the  Government  says  that we  are  saying  that  the

reporters  are stooges of the Government. We  did  not

say  so.  We are saying that there has been suggestive

intimidation. Well, the Government says one thing  and

we  say  another; so the best people to  know  whether

there has been or has not been freedom of the Press is

the public, and we leave it to the public.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is one point perhaps the

Minister  might want to answer. It is the first  point

raised by the Member for Geylang Serai.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. I do not know

about  the  dirty  jokes. It is  unfortunate  that  it

should  have been mentioned here, because we  want  to

increase  the audience. But as regards this particular

instance, I am not competent to say whether if you are

having   family   planning   lectures,   then    these

lectures - they   are  not  specifically   directed   at

children  but at adults. I think the best thing  would

be  for  adults  to ensure that if they  do  not  want

children  to listen to this programme, then send  them

to the pictures or something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the final point which was repeated, I say

that  it  works this way. If there is freedom  of  the

Press, then I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



suggest quoting the Member for Geylang Serai that if

the Press says nothing about it, he should be

satisfied.

alleviate  the unemployment problem of Singapore,  the

Government  had to consider the problem of setting  up

the  Work  Brigade as soon as possible. To  form  this

Work  Brigade  speedily  and  without  any  inordinate

expense, it was necessary to divert the energies of  a

certain existing organisation from its current task so

that  the  proper personnel could be diverted  towards

the  organisation and administration of  the  Brigade.

This token vote of $10 merely shows that although  the

Singapore  Government is not making use of  the  Civil

Defence Department at the present moment, it is  still

keeping the department available so that if it  should

prove  necessary  for Government to make  use  of  the

Civil  Defence  Department in an emergency, then  the

vote will be available.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this department is a

highly trained department, as I understand it. It is a

highly  specialised department and, after  having  had

all  this  special training, it is now being  used  in

running   some  might  say  a  slave  camp,  but   the

Government  says a labour camp. It seems  to  me,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that all this trained personnel is being

wasted  on  the Work Brigade, the personnel  for  whom

could quite easily be recruited from outside. All that

is  required  is  a sergeant major with  a  stentorian

voice.  I  am sure the P.A.P. could quite easily  find

those  people  without much difficulty. To  use  these

highly  trained  officers to do  that,  I  think,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is a waste of public funds. That is  the

first point. The second point is that, while they  are

doing  that  job, they are losing the  practice  which

they should be continuously receiving in respect of  a

highly important civic service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On the contrary, Sir, it is

because  the  Civil Defence Department  personnel  are

highly  trained personnel that they have been diverted

to  help  the  Work  Brigade in the training  and  the

handling  of men and materials. This job really  needs

somebody  trained  in  the way  that  they  have  been

trained.  If the Government had to get new  people  in

order   to   handle  the  Work  Brigade,  then   extra

expenditure would have been involved. On top of  that,

at the present moment, there is no visible need for  a

Civil  Defence  Department  working  towards  specific

objectives  in civil defence. It is only  killing  two

birds  with one stone that the Government has diverted

the  trained personnel of the Civil Defence  Corps  to

the Work Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,363,710 for Head 50 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 53 -



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 53 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a category of people in Singapore who

are   citizens  and  yet,  for  the  purposes  of  the

Immigration   and   Passports  Department,   are   not

considered  as  citizens. I refer, Sir,  to  the  vast

number  of  middle-age people who,  although  born  in

Singapore,   are   unable  to  produce   their   birth

certificates. Their age group falls in the over  40's,

that  is  to  say,  born before 1920.  They  have,  of

course,  their identity cards issued to them 12  years

ago,  in  1948,  indicating that  they  were  born  in

Singapore. At the time of the issue of their  identity

cards,  there was no inkling of Singapore citizenship.

Now, Sir, because they were born in Singapore they did

not  apply  for Singapore citizenship,  since  by  the

operation of law, they are automatically recognised as

citizens,  and  by the same process their  names  were

automatically also included in the electoral register.

During  the last elections they exercised their  right

to  vote. And yet, Sir, when it comes to the issue  of

passports,  they  are  asked to  produce  their  birth

certificates.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand this requirement is not only confined

to the Passport Office, but in some instances, also to

the  Social  Welfare Department when public assistance

is  sought;  and  in a few rare cases,  the  Education

Department  where  some  principals  insist   on   the

production  of  the birth certificates of  parents  to

determine their citizenship before free education  can

be given to their children. The production of identity

cards  is  not enough, although these were issued  way

back in 1948.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, these unfortunate people are

citizens  for  the purposes of election, because  they

can  and have voted, and yet are not citizens when  it

comes to demanding their other rights as citizens.  If

Government is going to take that line, then I think  a

dangerous  situation  would arise.  If  they  are  not

citizens,  then they should not vote; but  since  they

have  voted, what would be the position of the Members

of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



Assembly,  they having been elected by  an  electorate

which included people who are not citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My estimates, Sir, is that there are between 50,000

and 60,000 people in this category. I wonder, Sir,  if

the  Minister  could give an assurance that  ho  would

look into this inconsistent application of the law.  I

think  the  anomaly can be rectified administratively,

and I do not think there is any necessity to amend the

law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this problem,

in   fact,  has  been  occupying  the  minds  of   the

Government for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai must be aware; that, at

the  time  when  the identity cards  were  issued  (in

1948),  it was done in a very haphazard manner and  no

investigation whatsoever was made to ascertain whether

the  applicant  for  an  identity  card  was  born  in

Singapore or elsewhere, with the result that  a  large

number  of identity card holders who were not born  in

Singapore  were  shown as born in Singapore  on  their

identity   cards.  With  the  introduction   of   the

automatic registration of electors, the names of these

identity  card holders who were not born in  Singapore

were  also entered in the electoral register  for  the

purposes of election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can accept this position. A wrong

should not be perpetuated. In fact, the Government  is

now  looking  into this question in  relation  to  the

issue  of  new  plastic identity cards in  the  coming

year.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these people

with  identity cards, although they do not have  birth

certificates   to  prove  their  birth,   could   have

registered as citizens of Singapore if they  had  been

told to do so. The fact that it was mentioned that  it

was  not  necessary for people who  claimed  birth  in

Singapore  to  be  registered made it unnecessary  for

them to go through the process of registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people who were not born in Singapore, say in

1958, could become citizens of Singapore by the mere



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



process  of signing their names and taking an oath  of

loyalty, then surely these people with identity  cards

are  qualified  to be citizens too. If they  had  been

told  at  that  time,  then  they  would  have  become

citizens by registration instead of citizens by birth.

To  say that they have no birth certificates to  prove

their  birth, and therefore they are not citizens  and

that   they   have  to  go  through  the  process   of

registration  again is to declare that  they  are  not

citizens  of Singapore as yet. If the Government  were

to  take that line, it would mean that these 50,000 to

60,000 people had voted against the law and that  they

should  not have been put on the electoral  roll.  Who

knows whether these 50,000 to 60,000 people might have

put the P.A.P. into power?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Cairnhill should, bear the responsibility

for  all this confusion, because the citizenship  laws

came  into  being in his time. It was  his  Government

that  advised those who were born in Singapore not  to

apply for citizenship. I remember that the law had  to

be  amended subsequently to make provision  for  those

who  were  born  in  Singapore but could  not  produce

evidence of their birth in Singapore. In fact, at  the

moment, as a practice, we always advise those who have

no evidence of birth whatsoever to apply for Singapore

citizenship before they apply for Singapore passports.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that is the

only advice the Minister can give, I think it will not

be  enough,  because it will only affect those  people

who  apply for passports. But what about those  people

who are not applying for passports?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the colonial days - long before the days

of  the  previous Government - it was easy to  obtain  a

passport if a man said he was born in Singapore but he

could  not produce a birth certificate. All he  needed

to  do was to get an elderly gentleman or a lady older

than  he was to go to the Supreme Court to take out  a

statutory declaration saying that that person was born

in Singapore. That statutory declaration was accepted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



by  the Passport Office. Could the Minister assure the

House  that  a  similar process will  be  accepted  in

respect  of  these people not only for  the  issue  of

passports  but  also for other requirements - for  other

requirements of Government departments?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Just now the Member for Geylang

Serai said "there is a large number of people who were

born    in   Singapore" - he   called   them   Singapore

citizens - "who  are  unable  to  produce  their   birth

certificates".  It is very simple:  if  they  want  to

produce proof that they were really born in Singapore,

there are many ways of doing so. For example, if  they

are   Christians,  they  can  produce  their   baptism

certificates.   Or  they  could  produce   the   birth

certificates  of their brothers and sisters  who  were

born  round  about the time they were born,  to  prove

that  their  parents were then in Singapore.  Or  they

could  have their school leaving certificates to prove

that  they were in school in Singapore. Or they  could

have travel documents to prove that their parents came

here  not  long  before  they  were  born.  All  these

documents  could be produced if these people  want  to

prove that they were barn in Singapore. If they cannot

produce them, then it will be very difficult to  prove

their birth in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the statutory declarations of the past

being  accepted, we know so many things did happen  in

the  past; but, Sir, it is not the business of a  good

government to accept things which are not good.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in other words,

the   Government   will  not  accept   any   statutory

declaration.  In  that event, Sir, I think  we  should

amend  the law relating to statutory declarations  and

do away with them completely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other point raised by the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs, that if one does not have a birth certificate

he  can  produce his baptism certificate, that is  all

well  and  good if he is a Christian. But  what  about

those  who  are  non-Christians? Not all  Chinese  are

Christians  and,  of  course,  all  Malays   are   not

Christians. What about them? Now, I will give you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



an  instance, Sir, I was born in 1917. I have a  birth

certificate, but my brother who was born later than  I

was  (in  1920)  has  no  birth certificate.  We  have

searched  for it all over the place. We have  searched

the  Registry of Births and Deaths and we cannot trace

it.  There  are  other cases. Some of my  constituents

have  come  to me. We know that they were  born  here.

There  are elderly people who were born here. But  the

only  evidence that they can produce are not the birth

certificates  of  their brothers and sisters,  because

they  themselves have no birth certificates. The  only

evidence  they can produce is a statutory  declaration

by  an elderly gentleman, probably the brother, or the

uncle,  or the auntie of the person concerned. Now  if

the  Government  is  not  going  to  accept  statutory

declarations, then I have nothing more to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the citizenship law was promulgated by the  last

Government  during a time when it was very  busy - in  a

haphazard way. The Lim Yew Hock Government passed  the

citizenship  law so that they could get  300,000  more

votes for their election.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It seems to me that that is

completely  irrelevant. An issue has just been  raised

as  to whether or not Government will accept statutory

declarations.   That  is  all.   Let   us   stop   the

irrelevancies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, the Member

for  Cairnhill said that if a person has  an  identity

card  showing that he was born in Singapore,  then  he

could apply for Singapore citizenship. I remember when

the  citizenship law was put into operation, I applied

for  Singapore  citizenship,  and  I  had  to  go  for

registration.   Many   people  registered   themselves

without saying whether they had any birth certificate.

They  were  told that they need not have to  apply.  I

have two letters from the Assistant Minister concerned

relating  to this matter. At that time, a person  born

in  Singapore was shown as such on his identity  card,

although  he  did not have any birth certificate.  But

today if he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



wants  to  apply  for  Singapore  citizenship,  he  is

allowed to do so. But if he applies for a passport and

he  is not recognised as a Singapore citizen, then the

fault should lie with the Lim Yew Hock Government.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Government has missed the most important point in this

debate. If these people had applied for citizenship at

that  time,  they would have been granted  citizenship

without  even the production of a birth certificate - at

the  time  when  there was this mass application.  But

because  they had identity cards to show the place  of

birth  as Singapore, they did not apply; they  claimed

citizenship  by birth. And now because the  Government

insists  that before a passport could be  issued,  the

man  must produce his birth certificate. But, Sir,  in

the case of citizens of Singapore who were not born in

Singapore,  what  they  have  to  produce  is  just  a

citizenship certificate; it is a simple matter. So why

should  we make it difficult for people who were  born

in Singapore but could not produce birth certificates?

Could  not  the identity card that they  hold,  saying

that  they  were born in Singapore, be accepted  as  a

fact?  Even if it could not be accepted as a fact,  it

could  be  accepted as a substitute for an application

for  registration  as a Citizen in 1958.  There  is  a

residential  qualification in the identity  card - 1948.

There  is sufficient residential qualification  there.

So  why not grant them the passport when applied  for?

After  all,  there are not so many citizens  who  will

want passports to travel about; the number is limited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

answer to the Member for Cairnhill is very simple. If,

as  he  said,  the applicant has a Singapore  identity

card   showing  birth  in  Singapore   and   had   the

residential qualification, the simplest thing for  him

to  do  is to apply for citizenship, and then  produce

the  certificate of citizenship to the Passport Office

and he will get a Singapore passport. In fact, we have

advised  those  who claim to be born in Singapore  but

who  have  no evidence to prove their birth, to  apply

for citizenship.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory declaration by itself cannot be

accepted as proof of the man's birth in Singapore.  He

should   produce  supporting  evidence  of  the   kind

mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary just now.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I think there is a very big

difference   between   citizenship   by   birth    and

citizenship  by registration. There can be deprivation

of  citizenship by registration, but there can  be  no

deprivation  of  citizenship  by  birth,  unless,   of

course,  the man has done an act which is disloyal  to

the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think that is really the crux of the

matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there are two types  of

citizen under our laws - citizen by birth and citizen by

registration. If he is a citizen by birth, then he has

the  absolute  right  to  stay  on  in  Singapore.  No

Minister using his discretion can deprive him  of  his

citizenship.  As  for  myself,  I  was  born  in   the

Federation and I had to apply for citizenship. I am  a

registered citizen, and if the Minister did not  `like

my  face  or if I spoke too much and out of turn,  and

not  in the national interest, he could deprive me  of

my  citizenship. But had I been born in Singapore, Mr

Speaker,  I  could  talk as much as  I  like  and  the

Minister  would not be able to do anything  about  it.

That is the point of difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if a man was born in Singapore but

unfortunately,  because he cannot  produce  his  birth

certificate, the Minister is asking him to forego  his

inalienable rights in order to suit a certain practice

in  his  Immigration Department. The point  at  issue

really  is - and  I am suggesting it to the  Minister - is

this  man trying to get an advantage for himself which

he  should not get? The facts of the situation in such

cases  are  that he is not, because when the  identity

card  was  issued to him in 1948, nobody at that  time

had the foresight to see that citizenship was going to

come to Singapore. He told the truth. In 99 cases  out

of  100,  Mr Speaker, I am suggesting to the Minister

that  the people told the truth. Now, in one odd case,

maybe he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



told  an untruth, by mistake or deliberately. But even

in  that deliberate case, he could have - there  was  no

point  in his lying - gone and said, "I was not born  in

Singapore.    I   have   the   necessary   residential

qualifications",  and  they would  have  given  him  a

certificate of registration as a citizen. That was the

position  in  those days. Even there, the  reason  for

lying  disappears. So the Immigration Department says,

"Right.   Prove   your  birth.  Produce   your   birth

certificate, and then we will give you a passport.  If

you cannot produce your birth certificate, then you go

and  become  a citizen." Well, he becomes a registered

citizen;  he is not a natural-born Singapore  citizen.

He is a registered citizen. His rights are altered.  I

do  not  see  why  the  person  who  has  an  inherent

inalienable  right  to citizenship,  which  gives  him

complete  rights as a citizen and not a  99  per  cent

right  as a Singapore citizen where the Minister could

revoke  his  citizenship, should sell  his  birthright

because   it   suits  the  convenience   of   Ministry

officials.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The real crux of the problem

which  they have all the time been harping on is proof

of  identity, proof of citizenship, and proof of birth

in  Singapore. If a person can prove that he was  born

in Singapore, there need be no talk of citizenship. If

he wants to talk of citizenship by registration, then,

of  course,  he  has to prove also  that  he  has  the

qualifications in order that he can register.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, there is another point. Is

the  Government going to demand production of a  birth

certificate  before a man can even  vote?  If  such  a

birth  certificate  is not to be  demanded,  then  the

Government  is  going  to  accept  that  the  man  who

produces an identity card at the time of polling is  a

Singapore  citizen.  If  you accept  that,  then  they

therefore  say,  "We  do  not accept  it  for  another

particular  purpose. But for the  purpose  of  voting,

yes, you can vote." Unless, of course, the Government,

in order to be consistent, says, "Next time bring your

birth  certificate  with you  to  the  polling  booth.

Otherwise you will have no vote." You either take  one

line or the other.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

whole question boils down to how does one prove or how

can one believe that a person who claims to be born in

Singapore  was  really born in Singapore.  Members  of

this  House  will remember that there is provision  in

the  citizenship  laws that if  a  person's  birth  in

Singapore  is  accepted, he will be  registered  as  a

Singapore citizen under that relevant section, and his

citizenship cannot be revoked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think the real difficulty in this

matter  lies  simply  in the fact  that  the  Ministry

officials  in  connection with the issue of  passports

are  somewhat  lazy - I mean that in all seriousness - and

are not going out of their way to help the citizens of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, normally when a person swears a

statutory  declaration, this is the form the statutory

declaration will take: "I was present when this person

was  born. I saw his birth. He has lived in that house

...  "-that  is the form of the statutory declaration.

Any  other declaration is not worth the paper on which

it  is sworn. Now, if two persons swear a declaration,

then  it is prima facie evidence that that is correct.

Naturally the Ministry officials must investigate. But

this  is where the difficulty occurs, Mr Speaker - they

do  not.  They  just  say, "We  will  not  accept  any

statutory  declaration like that." That is not  right.

After all, when a person uses the due processes of the

law, one must assume that he is being honest. One must

not assume that he is dishonest. That is what Ministry

officials   are  assuming!  Everybody  who   makes   a

statutory declaration is a dishonest chap. There is  a

premium on dishonesty in Singapore, it seems! Why must

the  Ministry  officials assume that?  That  statutory

declaration is made. Naturally they need not  give  in

to  the  declaration like that, Mr Speaker.  I  think

they  are  in duty bound on the production of  such  a

statutory  declaration on oath to cause investigations

to  be made. And if, on investigation, they find  that

the declaration is right, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



let the passport be issued. If, on investigation, they

find that the declaration is incorrect or a falsehood,

then the law must take its course. And the person  who

makes the false declaration will be prosecuted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is what the Member for

Farrer  Park  has  asked for. When a person  swears  a

statutory  declaration, that is  only  in  support  of

other  evidence  which that person must  produce.  For

example, he must also produce pictures of the  family,

all  other  documentary evidence  that  he  can  bring

forth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I get this assurance from the

Minister? Supposing in the event that we are  informed

by the Hon. the Minister for Home Affairs that in such

a  case, the Ministry's advice is, "All right. Go  and

get  yourself registered as a citizen." Now what would

be  acceptable  to the Ministry to  make  him  into  a

Singapore citizen? I suppose residence. In that  case,

proof  of  birth  is not necessary. But  what  we  are

telling  the Minister is: why should you make  a  man,

who  honestly has not got a birth certificate but  was

born in Singapore, as a second-class citizen?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is no second-class

citizen!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister was

not  here when I made the point that if a person is  a

registered citizen, then that registration  is  liable

to  cancellation by the Minister. That is the point  I

was  making. But if he was born in Singapore,  as  the

Prime Minister was born, then nobody can-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have a birth certificate!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - then nobody can cancel his citizenship.

But  I,  born in the Federation, am liable to  instant

cancellation  as a citizen if I cause  displeasure  to

the Minister - on public grounds, of course! But that is

the  point  we are making: why should this  man,  whom

nobody can put out of Singapore, place himself in  the

position  of being put out of Singapore by a difficult

Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said

earlier,  there  is provision in the citizenship  laws

whereby if the person's claim of birth in Singapore is

accepted, he will be asked to register under a certain

section  of  the citizenship laws, and his citizenship

cannot be revoked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am obliged to the Member

for  Farrer  Park  for elucidating  for  me  what  has

proceeded before. But surely he must know that  if  .a

person claims he is born in Singapore, and, apart from

swearing   a  statutory  declaration,  has  sufficient

evidence  of surrounding circumstances to justify  it,

and  if  anybody  ever gets him out of Singapore,  the

Member   for  Farrer  Park  knows  exactly  what   can

issue - habeas  corpus, declaration of rights,  and  all

the   rest  of  it.  Why  should  the  State  initiate

proceedings when they are not necessary? The  citizen,

if  he firmly believes in the truth of his stand,  has

the  whole  panoply of the law and the facilities  and

services  of  people like the Member for Farrer  Park.

They would be willing to fight for his rights.

willing  to stand up to the Minister for Home  Affairs

in a situation such as that, where the declaration can

be  produced on those grounds and where the Minister's

officials have not made the declaration, the  Minister

will  have a hard time in court to justify his  stand.

But  there is only one in a thousand who will do that,

and the numbers are getting even less from day to day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $960,080 for Head 53 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 54 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 54 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to Head 54 - Police. I would like to get complete clarification from the

Minister  concerned,  because  this  matter  has  been

discussed on a number of occasions in the past.  After

a  lapse  of 18 months, the time has come  for  me  to

enquire  what  is the present position of  the  police

force  as a whole. According to the Police Report  for

1959 - I  do not know the position for 1960 - the  members

of  the  Police Force consist of the following: Malays

22  per  cent; Chinese section 19 per cent,  and  some

others.  During the past few days, the Prime  Minister

had   said  that  there  are  proposals  to  give   an

opportunity to the Malays in the police force, one of

which is a cadet scheme. I should like to be told  the

percentage  of the personnel mentioned.  Mr  Speaker,

compared   with  the  figures  I  have  just   quoted,

according to the report, of the regular officers, only

8  per cent comprises the Malay community, and 44  per

cent  consists of Chinese, while 48 per cent comprises

others.  As  regards the regular officers - the  higher

echelons - a  specific qualification  is  required.  But

what I am sorry to note is the position with regard to

the   regular  inspectors.  In  Singapore  the   Malay

community   represents  11  per  cent;   the   Chinese

represent  50  per  cent - almost  half - and  the  others

represent 39 per cent. Mr Speaker, in order to have a

balance  in the administration of the police force,  I

wholly  support the principle that new recruits should

be  engaged  from non-Malays, especially the  Chinese,

because  in  Singapore the majority  consists  of  the

Chinese population. But, Mr Speaker, I would like  to

explain  that the proposal as mentioned by  the  Prime

Minister has not been implemented in full. I fear that

the  reason  for this is the lack of encouragement  to

people  who  should deserve to hold  such  posts.  The

police, as an instrument of the State, has to maintain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



security  not  only against Communist  subversion  but

also  against  gangsterism  and  other  crimes.  So  I

submit, in my opinion, that there are members  of  the

police force who are dissatisfied with the question of

promotion.  This will no doubt result in the  lack  of

confidence  in the police force as a whole,  and  they

will  not  be able to discharge their duties,  because

there is no understanding between one another, and the

efficiency of the services will be reduced somewhat. I

would like a reply from the Minister concerned on  the

several points I have put forward just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I would also like to get

clarification from the Minister concerned  whether  or

not  Darjah  VII  qualification is  accepted  for  the

police recruits this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem

posed by the Member for Kampong Kembangan is not  new.

Nor  is this problem caused by the present Government.

We  inherited  a  police force with all  its  problems

already   in  existence.  The  higher  proportion   of

gazetted  officers  were non-Malays  and  the  greater

proportion  of  the  rank and file  were  Malays.  But

surely the Member for Kampong Kembangan should realise

that  this  was  the result caused by  the  system  of

education  in the past where the Malays, as  a  whole,

had  not  been given the opportunity to obtain  higher

education.  What  the Prime Minister mentioned  a  few

days  ago  was  the implementation of the Commissioner

cadet  scheme, whereby annually a number  of  suitable

candidates  from  the rank and file are  selected  for

training  to  prepare them for the School  Certificate

examination,   which  is  the  minimum   qualification

required for appointment as inspectors. They are given

not  more  than five years to prepare for  the  School

Certificate examination, and if they pass,  they  will

be  considered for promotion to the rank of Inspector.

This  scheme  has been carried on during  the  present

Government.  In  1959, five Commissioner  cadets  were

selected and sent for study. In fact, in 1959, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



decided that in future this Commissioner cadet  scheme

should only be confined to Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the qualification for entry into the police

force,  I  wish  to  remind  the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  that the qualification for entry  into  the

police  force  was fixed in 1951. If  the  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan thinks that this  qualification  is

too high, then I might inform him that during the last

Government,  when his colleague was a  member  of  the

Cabinet,  he  had  not  done anything  to  change  the

qualification.  We  have,  in  fact,  considered  this

problem  of entry qualification into the police  force

for  Malays early this year. A decision has been  made

to  change  the qualification from two  years  in  the

Sultan Idris Training College to Form 3 Malay,  to  be

in  line with the English qualification. This will  be

implemented in the coming year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also under consideration at the same time

the  introduction of a Force Entrance examination  for

those  Malay  candidates who have  no  opportunity  to

study  in  Form 3 Malay class. The Member for  Kampong

Kembangan  must  be aware that until the  standard  of

education  of  the  Malays  has  been  raised  to  the

required  standard, the proportion of  Malay  gazetted

officers, cannot  increase to an appreciable  extent.

What  we can do is to offer those who are already  in

the  force  scholarships under the Commissioner  cadet

scheme  to  advance  themselves, so  that  they  could

obtain higher qualification for promotion to inspector

rank.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am not

surprised  or  shocked  by  the  reply  given  by  the

Minister for Home Affairs. What I was directing at was

that  it  is a fact that the Member for Geylang  Serai

was  in the past Government. Whether he discharged his

duties  or not that was his responsibility. But  today

it  is  my  duty to point out that at that  time,  the

police  was  under the charge of the Chief  Secretary.

This  post was held by an expatriate officer. However,

Mr Speaker, at the moment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



I  wish  to  explain that the police is now under  the

control of an elected people's representative, it  is

the Minister who runs the police force. Why is it that

only  five  officers  are required  annually  for  the

Commissioner  cadet  scheme?  Cannot  the  number   be

increased  twofold or three-fold? The vote  could  be

increased  if  the Minister thinks fit, so  that  such

opportunities  could be afforded to  serving  officers

who  have no opportunity to gain promotion to the rank

of Inspector.



<br><br>7.32 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kandasamy, I am very sorry to hear it explained that the qualifications of the Malay members in the

police  force  are low. But when the  People's  Action

Party Government were returned in the elections,  they

declared  that Malay was to be the national  language.

Are  there  no other means whereby the Malay  language

could be accepted as a qualification for those who had

no  opportunity  during the colonial  regime  to  gain

promotion?  As I have said earlier, the  Minister  was

elected  by  the  people. He  himself  came  from  the

people. We should explore all avenues to increase  the

number  of officers for the Commissioner cadet scheme.

I  am quite sure that this is not beyond the means  of

the  Minister. The expenditure involved is not  great,

and  it  will  receive  the  support  of  all  parties

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, in fact, I

have  been  trying to show to the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan just now the difference between the  present

Government  and  the  past  colonial  Government.  The

colonial Government had in the past completely ignored

the  interests of the Malays. They had never paid  any

attention  to  Malay education or to  improving  their

status.  The  present Government has set up,  for  the

first time, a Malay secondary school, so that in  time

to  come  those who graduate from this school will  be

able to compete equally with those who pass the School

Certificate  Examination  or  the  Senior  Middle  III

Chinese Examination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



We  have offered free education to all Malays  in  the

secondary  school and the University.  These  are  the

concrete  steps that the present Government has  taken

towards raising the general level of education of  the

Malays.  In addition to this, in so far as the  police

force  is  concerned, we have this Commissioner  cadet

scheme  the purpose of which is to increase the number

of  Malay officers in the force eligible for promotion

to  the  Inspectorate. It is not a question  why  the

number of Commissioner cadets cannot be increased from

5  to  10.  In  fact,  we can send about  10  officers

annually  for  training, and the fact that  only  five

were  sent  in  1959  was because we  could  not  find

suitable  candidates. The Member for Kampong Kembangan

must realise that not everybody can study, or has  the

aptitude  to study, especially those who have  already

reached  the  age of 40 and above. I  can  assure  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan that all promising  Malay

officers  will be given a chance to proceed  in  their

studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister for Education please clarify

the main duties of these 61 Inspectors of Schools; the

number  of  vacant posts still unfilled; and,  lastly,

the  number of heads of schools and teachers who  have

been asked to act in these posts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Kandasamy, in reply to the Member for Tanglin  on  the

duties  of  inspectors,  it is  well  known  that  the

primary function of Inspectors of Schools would be  to

call   at  schools  regularly,  to  advise  on   their

organisation  and  management, to see  that  they  are

properly  administered,  that teachers  give  adequate

instruction;  in  fact, a rather multifarious  set  of

duties.  Unfortunately, it has been assumed  that  the

Inspectors act as watchdogs of the Ministry.  I  think

it is a most unfortunate impression which I have tried

my  best  to  correct,  because the  function  of  the

Inspectors  should  be  that  of  giving  advice   and

assistance  not only to the principals of schools  but

to teachers who may have problems which they face in a

particular  set of conditions. Perhaps teachers  in  a

particular  school  have not yet solved  the  problems

which   have   already   been  successfully   resolved

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of vacancies, it will be

necessary to go back to the previous Budget in which a

request  for  20  additional posts  were  called  for,

because it was felt that with the tremendous expansion

in  schools, adequate inspection had not been  carried

out  by  the  officers of the Ministry. As  it  always

takes  some time to get people appointed,  we  had  to

adopt  the  device of seconding senior  principals  of

schools  to  the Ministry to officiate and assist  the

Inspectors of Schools, to attend to complaints and  so

on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, a circular was issued inviting

applications  from all senior teachers and  principals

for appointment as substantive holders of the post. It

has  taken some time to process these applications.  I

understand  the  applications were  forwarded  to  the

Public Service Commission in June and July this  year.

It depends on when the Public Service Commission would

be  able  to  interview  and  to  make  the  necessary

appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I did not get the third question raised

by the Member for Tanglin. I would appreciate it if he

would repeat it again.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

third question is this. What is the number of heads of

schools  and teachers who have been asked  to  act  in

these posts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think the answer to that would

be under 20.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am

glad  indeed to hear from the Minister that  the  role

of  Inspectors  of Schools should be  a  constructive

one.  When they visit the schools, their main  purpose

should  be to give the maximum assistance to them  and

to   the   principals.  Unfortunately,  Sir,  in   the

implementation of that fine policy, I  regret  to  say

that  mistakes have been made and they have created  a

very  unhappy  impression in the  minds  of  heads  of

schools  and teachers. I think if the Minister,  after

having stated what the duties of Inspectors of Schools

should  be,  could  brief the Inspectorate  again,  it

would go a long way to improve the morale of heads  of

schools and teachers and restore good relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the functions which the Minister has just

referred  to  in  passing, but which I understand  has

become  the  main  function, is the  investigation  of

complaints sent in by writers of anonymous letters.  I

understand,  Sir, that these complaints  have  to  be

investigated within 48 hours from the moment they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



are  handed  over  to the Inspectors of  Schools.  Sir,

these anonymous letters belong to the category of what

might be called "yellow culture", and if they are  not

put  into  the  wastepaper basket,  then  they  should

really  be  sent to the Minister for Home Affairs  for

investigation;  but  for action to  be  taken  on  the

complaint of the writer of an anonymous letter who may

have  malicious motives, I think that creates  a  bad

impression among heads of schools and teachers. In one

instance,  an  Inspector came along and  said,  "I  am

sorry.  I  have  been  sent  here  to  investigate  an

allegation  made in a letter sent anonymously  to  the

Ministry." The principal naturally said, "If it is  an

anonymous letter, why should you be bothered  to  come

here?  That  letter  should be put in  the  wastepaper

basket  or it should be forwarded to the head  of  the

school for his investigation." But for an Inspector to

come   along   and   investigate   straightaway,   the

assumption is that the head and teachers of the school

are  guilty, and he therefore comes in the role of  an

Inspector from the C.I.D. to investigate. I  am  sorry

to say that that was not an isolated case. In fact,  I

understand  that  a  great deal of  the  time  of  the

Inspectors  of  Schools is spent in going  round  from

school to school to investigate complaints sent in  by

anonymous   writers.  Sir,  if  this  practice   is

encouraged, there will be no end of anonymous letters,

and  instead  of  the Inspectors of  Schools  spending

their  time  to  assist schools  to  attain  a  higher

standard of efficiency, they will be doing this  nasty

work  which  I  am sure they themselves do  not  enjoy

doing.  Therefore,  Sir, I am  quite  happy  that  the

Minister  has made a statement here to clear the  air,

because  I  was  most  unhappy  when  I  heard   these

complaints. These complaints were not founded on fact.

I  checked on them. I hope, Sir, there will be  a  new

beginning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I was surprised when I compared the

approach  of some Inspectors of Schools with  that  of

some  Inspectors of Police. The latter adopted a  very

constructive  approach. They would come along  to  the

heads  of  schools and say, "We believe that you  have

some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



problem  of  secret society gangsters trying  to  gain

influence over some of your students and we want to be

of help. Whenever you are in trouble, please give us a

ring."  That  sort of approach will help to  build  up

morale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that it be made known from now onwards

that if complaints are made by anonymous writers, they

will  be sent to the Minister for Home Affairs  to  be

treated  as  "yellow  culture"  for  investigation  or

thrown  into  the  wastepaper  basket.  Sir,  if   the

complaints  are justified and if the heads of  schools

are  reliable people, the complainants can go straight

to  the heads of schools. I am sure that the heads  of

schools  will respect the trust that the parents  have

in   them   and  will  treat  the  matter  as   highly

confidential.  It  grieved my  heart  to  notice  that

investigations  were  carried  out  by  Inspectors  of

Schools  based  on allegations sent in  by  anonymous

writers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid that the attitude taken by the

Ministry  of  Education  has also  impaired  relations

between  the  Ministry  and the schools.  Perhaps  the

Minister  is not aware of what is happening, as  these

things  naturally do not easily reach  his  ears.  The

heads  of schools are treated as if their time is  not

precious.  Sir,  many  of them  are  highly  paid  and

instead  of  their wasting time going to the  Ministry

just  to  take  delivery of some  documents,  or  some

cheques  of  small denominations, I  think  this  work

could be assigned to the school clerk. Time and again,

letters are sent from the Ministry addressed to  heads

of aided and Government schools with the words "Please

call, and take delivery of ...". One head said, "I  am

no  longer the head of the school; I am a peon."  Sir,

in my case, I took the risk - knowing that the Minister

would  understand - of refusing to go. I simply  sent  a

letter  saying, "I hereby authorise so and so to  take

delivery."  Because my time could be better  spent  in

the  office on other important matters than to go  and

queue up to take delivery of something which could  be

undertaken by my chief clerk. I took the risk, Sir. Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



course, according to Government procedure, they  could

still insist and say, "We want the principal to attend

because  the instruction is to him." But  I  know  the

Minister   has   got  more  common   sense   than   to

misunderstand my action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another circular went round with this

instruction,  "No  principal of a school  [that  means

including   Raffles  Institution]  should  leave   the

premises without permission from one of four people in

the  Ministry.  But any teacher can leave  the  school

premises  with the permission of the head." Sir,  just

think,  if a principal is treated like that, it  means

that  he  is no longer a dependable man. If  he  is  a

trusted   man,  surely  when  he  leaves  the   school

premises, he must be on school duty. But he has to ask

for  permission. He is then no longer a trusted  head.

He  is  even put in a position inferior to that  of  a

school  teacher, because the latter can just  ask  for

permission  from his head, but the head must  ask  for

permission from one of four Ministry officials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another thing is this. Maybe this has not

reached  the ears of the Minister. According  to  some

instructions given, no teacher and no head of a school

can   leave   the  State  of  Singapore  without   the

permission  of  the  Ministry. So whenever  a  teacher

wants  to  leave Singapore, we have to send  a  letter

requesting  permission. In the past,  the  head  could

give  permission to the teacher because he would  know

whether he would need to have him on a certain day. So

one  teacher  said,  "I want to visit  Johore  with  a

friend-



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

if  I  am  not  mistaken, we are now on item  (15).  I

cannot see how the Member for Tanglin can bring  in  a

matter concerning heads and teachers of schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> It is not a point

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

therefore wrote to the Ministry. Naturally that letter

would  go to the Inspectorate [Interruption]. I should

ask  for  clarification because I would not  take  the

responsibility of telling the teacher why he could not

go  out  of Singapore to Johore Bahru without  written

permission. Because if I were to give that permission,

that  would be ultra vires. I had no power to do  that

since  there had been a previous circular saying  that

permission  must  be obtained. Sir, that  request  for

clarification  was  sent in seven months  ago  and  no

reply has been received. The teacher concerned came to

me and I said, "To be on the safe side, you had better

apply  to me in writing and I will forward it  to  the

Ministry."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are pettifogging details which are very

unfortunate,  but they add to the accumulative  effect

giving  the  impression  that heads  and  teachers  of

schools  are no longer trusted people and are  assumed

to be potentially guilty persons who must therefore be

treated  as  such and who must be given very  detailed

instructions which they must observe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two weeks ago, a seven-or nine-page circular

went  round followed by another one containing  a  few

pages  on  tuckshop  management.  It  was  dated  28th

November, 1960, when the schools were already  closed.

Principals  of both Government and aided schools  were

asked  to  take  steps so that the  regulations  would

become  effective from 1st January, 1961.  Sir,  after

working a six-day week, are not heads and teachers  of

schools entitled to a vacation? I am afraid, Sir, I am

not  enjoying a vacation because practically every day

I am on duty. But most people would expect a vacation.

And  yet here come& along a circular expecting  orders

to  be  carried out during the holidays. That  is  one

point. Another point is this.
