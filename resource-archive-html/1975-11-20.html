<div align="center"><b>PRIMARY SCHOOLS PILOT PROJECT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Evaluation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  and  Education what is the evaluation  of

the Primary Pilot Project which is now in its

fourth year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Primary Pilot

Project   (PPP)  for  the  teaching  of   English,

Mathematics  and  Science  at  primary  level  was

evaluated  during  the period August  to  November

1973.   All  the  774  pupils  involved   in   the

evaluation were at the end of their second year of

primary  education. Half were  taught  in  schools

using  the  Project materials and the  other  half

were  taught  in schools using a variety  of  non-Project materials. The report shows that generally

there  was  a trend for the mean scores of  pupils

taught  in the Project schools to be significantly

better than those in non-Project schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the Ministry's

conclusion? What is the verdict on the Project? Is

it  intended  to  continue with  the  Project  and

eventually  to  incorporate it into the  Education

system?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> The answer is yes, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>REFRESHER COURSE FOR TEACHERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  and  Education when  the  last  refresher

course  for  teachers was held; how many  teachers

completed that course; how many teachers  of  five

years  and  more of teaching experience  have  not

attended any refresher course todate; and how does

such a course attempt to orientate teachers to the

social and economic priorities of the State.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Sir, refresher courses, also known as in-service

courses,  are conducted throughout the year.  Over

the   last  two  years,  4,105  teachers  attended

various  in-service  courses, averaging  50  hours

each  in  duration. This represents  approximately

35%,  or 17 1/2% per year, of the teachers with  five

years  or  more  teaching  experience.  Though  no

records  of  the correlation between  a  teacher's

years  of service and his attendance at in-service

courses  were kept before 1974, the present  trend

indicates that there is a six-year cycle in  which

every teacher will be given an opportunity for in-service  training.  The  last  in-service   course

attended  by 38 participants ended on 7th November

1975. Currently, four courses involving about  480

participants  are in progress. All  these  courses

help  equip  teachers to perform better  at  their

jobs.

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT OF EMPLOYMENT ATTITUDES IN SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education how the

Education Development Officers in the Ministry  of

Education and principals in the schools assist  in

developing   the  education  of  the  school-going

generation  to  ensure  that  the  latter  develop

attitudes to employment which collectively benefit

the State.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Sir, it has always been one of the objectives of

the  Ministry of Education to inculcate the  right

attitudes  and values in our pupils, such  as  the

right attitude towards employment and correct work

ethics. Education Development Officers and  school

principals have always been working in  close  co-operation  to  achieve these  objectives  through,

among  other things, regular assembly talks, civic

lessons,    extra-curricular    activities     and

educational  visits to relevant organisations.  In

addition,   the   introduction  of   the   subject

Education  for Living in schools is another  means

towards  achieving our objective. However,  it  is

becoming  increasingly clear that  the  home,  the

neighbourhood and the society have  as  great,  if

not  a  greater  influence  than  the  school,  in

developing  prevailing mores, wholesome  attitudes

and sound values.

<div align="center"><b>HAW PAR BROTHERS INTERNATIONAL LTD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress in investigations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Finance what progress has been made

in  the investigations into the affairs of Haw Par

and  in  particular (a) what further evidence  has

been  obtained  to  substantiate  the  allegations

against those former directors of the Company  who

had participated in Spydar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



Securities Ltd; (b) what steps have been taken  to

ensure  the  co-operation of  the  authorities  in

Kuala Lumpur, London and Hong Kong; (c) whether he

will  inform  the  House of  the  reason  for  the

resignation  of  Mr  G.  Starforth  Hill   as   an

Inspector and whether Mr Hill's resignation  would

in any way impede the course of the investigation;

(d)  whether  the validity of the  loan  of  US$29

million from Slater Walker Securities Lid  to  Haw

Par  is being investigated; and (e) what steps the

Board  of  Directors  of Haw Par  have  taken,  or

propose to take, with a view, to strengthening the

management of the Company.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not yet in a position to

report  to  the  House the progress  made  as  the

investigations  into the affairs of  Haw  Par  are

still continuing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inspector appointed by me under the Companies

Act  to investigate these affairs has informed  me

that he intends to submit an interim report by the

end  of  November. What further  evidence  he  has

against those former directors of the company  who

participated  in Spydar Securities Ltd  should  be

known when the report has been submitted to me.  I

have  been given so far only copies of a statement

by  Mr  Slater  explaining  the  circumstances  of

Spydar's   formation,  and  one   or   two   other

documents.   However,   after   five   months   of

investigations, he should have sufficient material

upon  which to base his interim report which  will

deal with the affairs of Spydar Securities Ltd and

a number of other crucial matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that there have also been other

investigations  which have not been  initiated  by

me.  They  include those by the Stock Exchange  of

Singapore and by the Commercial Crimes Division of

the  Police Force. These investigations  are  time

consuming and will not be completed for quite some

time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On steps to ensure the co-operation of

authorities in other jurisdictions, I am happy  to

inform  the  House that officers of the  Attorney-General  and  the Police Force have  received  co-operation from the authorities in Hong Kong, where

some  of  the matters have had to be investigated.

There  has  also  been  consultation  between  the

relevant  authorities  in  London  and  Singapore,

direct as well as through the United Kingdom  High

Commissioner  in  Singapore.  The  Government   of

Malaysia   has   also   been   informed   of   the

circumstances   which  led  to  my   ordering   an

investigation into the affairs of Haw  Par.  I  am

sure  there  is  now better understanding  of  the

reasons  why we had to take steps to preserve  the

integrity  of  our financial institutions  and  to

protect the interests of the smaller shareholders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the resignation of Mr G. Starforth

Hill as an Inspector, he has given his reasons for

his  resignation  in his letter of  27th  October,

1975, which has been published. I do not expect Mr

Hill's  resignation  to cause  any  delay  in  the

investigations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable  Members will be aware of the  changes

that  have  taken place recently in the  Board  of

Directors  of  Haw  Par. The  five  new  directors

announced   that  the  Board  will   examine   the

propriety of all claims against the Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the resignation of Mr Slater from Slater

Walker  Securities Ltd, certain offers in relation

to  the loan of US$29 million to Haw Par were made

through   two  merchant  banks.  These  were   not

considered  satisfactory and  were  not  accepted.

There  is possibility of a settlement between  the

new boards of Haw Par and Slater Walker Securities

Ltd.  So  it is better that I say no more on  this

subject.  If  there  is  no settlement,  then  the

wrangles  inside  and  outside  the  courts   will

provide everyone with the details of some  of  the

ingenious schemes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



and   complicated  transactions  that  the  Slater

Walker group carried on in the Far East.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not able to say what steps have been taken

or  will be taken to strengthen the management  of

Haw  Par.  This  is  a matter  for  the  Board  of

Directors of the Company. I have confidence in the

new Chairman and his colleagues on the Board and I

have   no  doubt  they  will  find  solutions   to

management and other problems facing the Company.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I am just wondering whether the Minister

will  inform the House of the interim report  from

the Inspector when it is available, or whether  it

would be made public immediately?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, when I do receive the report, I will

consider  it  in  the  light  of  the  information

contained  in that report. Some of the information

may  very  well be confidential and  of  a  nature

relevant  to  the negotiations with Slater  Walker

Securities Ltd. In those circumstances it  may  be

possible  that the report cannot be made available

immediately.

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments that are proposed in the Bill are

necessary to ensure confidentiality to persons who

seek treatment relating to family planning in  any

institution or clinic maintained or managed by the

Singapore Family Planning and Population Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment complements those provisions

contained in the Voluntary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



Sterilisation   and  Abortion  Acts   which   also

prohibit persons from disclosing relevant  matters

unless the person concerned gives express consent.

The  same penalties are also provided for in  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the Board, the number of

people seeking family planning advice or treatment

has  risen  from 30,410 in 1966 to 229,365  as  at

1974.  This represents 87.6% of married  women  in

the  reproductive age group making the  Board  the

biggest institution from which treatment or advice

is  sought  on  family  planning  matters.  It  is

important  that the confidence of such persons  is

maintained and they need not have any doubts as to

the  confidentiality  of the treatment  they  seek

from the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill-[Toh Chin Chye].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>DENTISTS REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has faced a shortage of dentists for a

long time with little hope of changing the present

dentist  population ratio of 1 : 5,500 to  a  more

desirable ratio of 1: 2,500 which would  meet  the

demands  for  dental treatment by  the  population

fairly  adequately, unless the number of  dentists

is  considerably increased. There are  at  present 249 qualified dentists in Division



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



I  of  the  Dentists Register and 171  unqualified

dentists  in Division II of the Dentists Register.

In  addition there are also 230 dental nurses  who

provide systematic dental treatment for about half

the primary school population of 360,000 children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the shortage of dentists a scheme has

been launched this year to train a new category of

dental operators, known as Dental Therapists. They

attend  a  three-year course, at the end of  which

they  should  be  able to perform  straightforward

dental  procedures  such as extractions,  fillings

and   making   dentures.  Twenty  student   dental

therapists have been enrolled this year  and  from

next  year  onwards  40 student dental  therapists

will  be  enrolled  each year. Dental  therapists,

however,  will  not  be  permitted  to  carry  out

surgical operative procedures on the soft  tissues

and bone of the jaws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first 10 years after the completion of

training,  dental therapists will be provisionally

registered  to work only under the supervision  of

qualified  dental  surgeons either  in  government

dental clinics or private dental practices.  After

10   years  of  service  under  qualified   dental

surgeons  and subject to their passing a  suitable

qualifying  examination, they will be  allowed  to

work  on  their  own  as registered  dentists  but

restricted  to  the class of work for  which  they

have  been trained. They will then be placed on  a

separate  list in the Dentists Register,  distinct

from  Division  I  (qualified)  and  Division   II

(unqualified) dentists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dentists Registration (Amendment) Bill seeks

to  provide for provisional registration for these

dental  therapists in the first 10 years of  their

service  and  their enrolment in the  Register  of

Dentists  if  they pass a qualifying  examination.

Provision  is  also necessary to  prohibit  dental

therapists   from   performing   certain    dental

procedures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken in the Bill to make

changes in the Dentists Registration Act. They are

administrative in character and are summarised  in

the explanatory statement attached to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first recruitment exercise carried out

this year there were 167 qualified applicants,  of

whom  24 were male and 143 female. They were given

a  manual  dexterity  test. Twenty  trainees  were

finally  appointed, 16 of them  were  females  and

four  males.  I  ought to add that  there  was  no

significant difference between the number of males

and females who passed the manual dexterity test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members  are  no  doubt  aware  that   the

Regulation of Employment Act was enacted  in  1966

to  regulate the employment of foreign workers  in

the  Republic.  The objective was to  control  the

flow  of  such workers into our country to  ensure

that  their  employment contributes to the  social

and economic development of our society. Under the

Act,   foreign  workers,  principally  those  from

Malaysia whose monthly salaries are not more  than

$750, are required to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



apply  for  a work permit before they start  work.

The  Work  Permits  Office has discovered  certain

inadequacies in the Act in nearly 10 years of  its

operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend certain provisions of

the   Act   with   a  view  to  overcoming   these

shortcomings.  The  Ministry has  discovered  that

some   work   permit  holders   are   working   in

occupations  other than those specified  in  their

respective  work permits. The Work Permits  Office

has,   for  example,  found  work  permit  holders

working as clerks when the permit has been  issued

to them to work as factory operators. Legally this

is  not an offence as section 8 of the present Act

prohibits   the  employment  of  an  employee   or

contract  worker only if he does not have  a  work

permit.  This  inadequacy in the Act  reduces  the

effectiveness of our control of foreign workers in

the Republic. Clause 2 of the Bill therefore seeks

to  amend section 8 of the present Act to prohibit

any employer from engaging any person who has been

issued  with  a work permit in any capacity  other

than  in  accordance with the conditions contained

in the work permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Regulation of Employment Act, as it now

stands,  does not cover self-employed  occupations

like   insurance  agents,  canvassers,   salesmen,

commission  agents and others. The  employment  of

foreigners  in  these occupations has  social  and

economic ramifications. The Ministry has found  it

necessary  at  times to regulate  administratively

foreigners   taking   up   certain   self-employed

occupations. To enable the Ministry  to  have  the

power  to bring such persons within the Regulation

of  Employment Act, clause 3 of the Bill seeks  to

amend section 8 to empower the Minister from  time

to  time  by Gazette notification to prohibit  any

non-citizen from engaging in any trade, occupation

or  other activity carried on for the purposes  of

gain unless he has obtained a work permit for that

purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Permits Office has also found that some

employers  and employees has connived  to  furnish

false  information with a view to seeking approval

for  their  applications for work  permits.  False

details, for example, have been provided on  types

of  job  and experience and qualification  of  the

applicants.  The giving of such false  information

is  not  an  offence under the present  Act.  This

practice must be discouraged to enable us to  have

better  control  of  the  recruitment  of  foreign

workers  for work in Singapore. Clause 5 therefore

seeks to amend section 14 of the Act to make it an

offence  for  any  person,  whether  employer   or

employee,  to  make  a  false  statement  in   the

application for a work permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has also taken the opportunity

to   introduce  two  administrative  measures   to

improve  the  operation of  the  Act.  The  first,

contained in clause 4 of the Bill, seeks to  amend

section 11 of the Act to provide for the levy of a

fee of $5 for the replacement of a lost, destroyed

or defaced work permit. This will encourage proper

custody of work permit cards. The other, contained

in  clause 6 of the Bill, seeks to introduce a new

section empowering the Commissioner for Employment

to compound any offence committed under the Act by

accepting from the person reasonably suspected  of

committing  an  offence a sum not exceeding  $100.

The  intention  is to expedite the meting  out  of

penalties to those who have infringed the  law  as

well   as  eliminate  the  time-consuming  process

involved  in  preparing for prosecution  in  court

especially in cases of minor offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



point of clarification from the Minister of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill says that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No employer or contractor shall employ an

employee or contract worker, as the case  may  he,

otherwise  than in accordance with the  conditions

contained in the work permit.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what happens if an employer, who originally

engages  a  worker as a factory hand, subsequently

promotes  the employee to a higher grade,  say,  a

clerical  post,  because  of  his  efficiency?  It

appears  that  there  is  no  provision  in   this

amendment Bill for appropriate endorsements on the

work permit of the employee concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that case a fresh application

will  have  to be made, because the original  work

permit only allows the person to be employed as  a

factory operator. If he wants to work as a  clerk,

it is a different job entirely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I would like to seek further clarification.

In that case the employer must first terminate the

services  of the employee before he can  submit  a

fresh application.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I would say that the employer should put in

an application before promoting his employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill-[Mr Sia Kah Hui].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to introduce a number of

amendments to the Employment Act, details of which

are summarised in the explanatory statement. I now

propose to elaborate on some of the more important

clauses in the amendment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will no doubt recall that in April 1972

the National Wages Council recommended  that

the existing bonus system in the private sector be

converted   into  a  system  of  an  annual   wage

supplement  supplemented by  either  a  negotiable

bonus  or  annual  wage  increases  and  that  the

maximum in regard to bonuses be raised from one to

three  months'  wages. These recommendations  were

accepted  by  the  Government in the  interest  of

rational and orderly wage increases. Section 46 of

the  Employment Act was then amended in July  1972

incorporating these recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present section 46 of the Act, a trade

union  of  employees is entitled to negotiate  for

the   payment  of  either  both  an  annual   wage

supplement and an annual bonus or both  an  annual

wage  supplement  and annual  wage  increases.  An

employer  is  given the right to  make  an  option

between  negotiating for the payment  of  both  an

annual  wage  supplement and a bonus  or  both  an

annual  wage supplement and annual wage  increase.

He will, however, be bound by his choice of option

for  the  duration  of  any  award  of  collective

agreement  which  may  be  made  regarding   these

payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer who cannot afford to pay any of the

aforesaid  combinations may offer to negotiate  to

pay  an  annual wage supplement or bonus or annual

wage increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of annual wage supplement payable by

the  employer who has paid annual bonuses  to  his

employees prior to 1972 is to be the equivalent of

the  average of the bonuses paid in respect of the

three years preceding the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



commencement of the Act, that is, 1972, or to  the

last  annual bonus paid, whichever is the greater,

subject  to a maximum amount equivalent  to  three

months' wages of his employees, except that  where

such  bonuses  were  based on exceptional  trading

results   or  increased  productivity  which   the

employer  finds have diminished to  a  significant

degree,  the  employer may negotiate for  a  lower

quantum of the annual wage supplement to be  paid.

If  an  employer  has not paid any  bonus  to  his

employees  or  has paid a bonus of less  than  one

month's wages before the commencement of this Act,

the  annual wage supplement payable by  him  shall

not exceed one month's wages of his employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, contrary to the provisions of section 46,

a number of employers have at the request  of

unions attempted or in some cases even paid annual

wage   supplements  in  excess   of   the   levels

prescribed under section 46. In a number of  cases

the  additional annual wage supplements paid  took

the form of ang pows and ex gratia payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an undesirable situation which, if

unchecked,  can  lead  us  back  to  the  pre-1972

situation  of disputes over bonuses and ex  gratia

payments  and disorderly wage increases. In  fact,

the Secretary-General of the National Trades Union

Congress,  in  a  speech  to  the  NTUC   Ordinary

Delegates  Conference in December 1974 said  that,

and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To take the lid off on bonus payments once

again,  would only be to provide a recipe  for  an

industrial free-for-all.'



<br><br>He  went on to tell the Conference that "this must

not  be  allowed to happen, least of  all  in  the

current climate of the economy".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is essential for us to

develop a sound national wage system based on  the

one  recommended  to  us  by  the  National  Wages

Council   in  1972.  A  system  of  orderly   wage

increases  will  contribute  greatly  to  a  right

investment  climate in our Republic.  Members  are

all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



too  well aware of the need for us to make greater

efforts to attract investment into Singapore.  The

years  ahead  are going to he different  from  the

last  five  years. We are unlikely to be  able  to

repeat  our years of double digit economic growth.

We  simply cannot afford undisciplined and chaotic

wage  increase  demands to hamper our  efforts  to

achieve   maximum  development  in  a  period   of

comparatively reduced growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill is,

therefore,  aimed at preventing the  situation  of

the  type  I have just described. There are  three

important  aspects  of  clause  2  of  the   Bill.

Firstly,  it  is now mandatory for  employers  and

trade unions of employees to observe the levels of

annual  wage supplement which have been frozen  on 1st July, 1972.

Secondly, employers may choose  to

pay  either both an annual wage supplement and  an

annual bonus or both an annual wage supplement and

annual wage increase. It will be an offence if the

annual  wage supplement, annual bonus  and  annual

wage increase are all paid or asked to be paid  at

the  same  time. The employer alone  shall  decide

which of the two combinations he shall opt for. It

is  an offence for a trade union or anyone to  ask

for  payments in variance of the option which  the

employer has chosen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, employers may only, with the prior

written  permission of the Minister  for  Finance,

pay  any  additional  annual  wage  supplement  in

excess of the frozen quantum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Bill in the House

on  19th August, 1975, 1 have received a number of

representations   from  organisations   like   the

Chinese  Chamber of Commerce, the National  Trades

Union   Congress  and  the  Singapore   Employers'

Federation.   As  a  result  of  some   of   these

representations  I have decided  to  introduce  an

amendment to clause 2 of the Bill. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



amendment  will  be  dealt  with  later   at   the

Committee  stage. At the moment I shall only  deal

with the other representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Trades Union Congress has requested

that  amendments be made to the Bill to allow  for

the continued payment of signatory bonuses and  ex

gratia payments which are made upon the signing of

a  collective agreement. The NTUC has argued  that

such payments are not really intended to evade the

provisions of the Employment Act relating  to  the

payment of the annual wage supplement or bonus. My

Ministry is of the view that such onetime lump sum

payments  are  not  an annual wage  supplement  or

bonus  payments  and are, therefore,  outside  the

ambit of section 46 of the Act. I see no objection

to  such payments being made if they are for  good

reasons, such as compensation for change of annual

incremental  date, or payment in  lieu  of  actual

amount  of arrears of wage adjustments, or payment

in  lieu  of  arrears  of  overtime  arising  from

backdating  of  new salary scales.  However,  such

payments  should not be made for the  purposes  of

inducement for signing the collective agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now deal with clause 8

of  the Bill. The Report of the Committee on Crime

and  Delinquency reveals that juvenile  crime  and

delinquency  has increased in the Republic  during

the period 1968 to 1972. The Report also discloses

that the majority of youths who flout the law  are

school  leavers  and  that  the  tendency  towards

criminal  or  delinquent behaviour  is  negligible

until  the age of 13 and strongest at the ages  of

15-16,  17-19 and 20-21. The Committee is  of  the

view that one of the solutions to this problem  is

the  adoption  of  measures to enable  our  school

leavers  to be trained and be gainfully  employed.

This  will  not only benefit the youths  concerned

but  also  provide a source of supply  of  trained

workers for the economy. The Government has  since

taken note of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recommendation of the Committee, and the proposed

amendments  to  the Employment  Act  is  to  allow

youthful  school  leavers to  be  trained  and  be

gainfully employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 8, children who are 12 and below 14

years  old  will  in  future  be  allowed  to   be

gainfully  employed in industrial undertakings  as

apprentices under any apprentice schemes  approved

and  supervised by the Industrial Training  Board.

Under  the  existing provisions of the  Employment

Act,  young persons between the ages of 14 and  16

are    required   to   obtain   certificates    of

registration  from  the  Commissioner  for  Labour

before  they may be allowed to work in  industrial

undertakings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill seeks to repeal Part IX of

the  Employment Act dealing with such registration

so as to facilitate the speedy employment of young

persons in the 12-16 age group. While measures are

proposed  to provide for the training and  gainful

employment  of  the  young,  it  is  necessary  to

continue to protect the health, safety and welfare

of  the  young in the 12-16 age group who will  be

working in industrial undertakings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 empowers the Minister for Labour to make

provisions   to  that  effect  in  the   form   of

regulations  to be gazetted after  this  Bill  has

been  passed. It is therefore proposed  to  repeal

all  sections relating to conditions of employment

of  children  and young persons  in  the  Act  and

incorporate them in the regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Trades Union Congress has written to

the   Ministry  pointing  out  that   with   these

amendments the number of workers between the  ages

of  12  and  18 will become greater and suggesting

that an amendment be made to the Trade Unions  Act

to  allow such workers trade union membership  but

without  the right to hold office or  to  vote  at

general  meetings  of  members.  My  Ministry   is

presently looking into the question of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



amending  the Trade Unions Act and will take  this

suggestion into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part XVI of the Employment Act, the

Commissioner  is  empowered to  conduct  inquiries

into  claims  lodged by employees  in  respect  of

matters relating to terms and conditions of  their

employment.  Such  inquiries are  informal.  Legal

technicalities  and forms are avoided  as  far  as

possible.  This  is  in order  to  achieve  speedy

settlement   in  the  interests  of  the   parties

concerned.  In  the experience  of  the  Ministry,

employers  are  usually  represented  by   lawyers

whereas the employees are not. We have found  that

the   presence   of  lawyers  at  these   informal

inquiries has tended to formalise the character of

the  proceedings leading to unnecessary procedural

complications, thereby delaying the completion  of

the  hearings. In many cases it has also made  the

parties involved less amenable to conciliation and

amicable   settlement  of  claims.  It   must   be

emphasised  that, in the majority of cases  before

the  Commissioner, the dispute is  purely  one  of

facts. Points of law are not usually at issue  and

therefore  the presence of legal counsel  at  such

inquiries is not necessary. There are also similar

provisions prohibiting legal representation  under

sections 27 and 63 of the Industrial Relations Act

which  include  representation in negotiations  at

conciliation   meetings  chaired  by  conciliation

officers of the Labour Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill therefore seeks to achieve

this  but allows an employee to be represented  by

an  officer  of  the  trade  union  of  which  the

employee  is  a  member  and  an  employer  to  be

represented  by  one  of his  employees  who  will

usually be the Personnel Manager.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Employers' Federation has requested

that   if  an  employer  chooses  instead  to   be

represented  by an officer of the trade  union  of

which he is a member in the proceedings before the

Commissioner, he should be allowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



such   representation.  The   Ministry   sees   no

objection    to    this    proposal    and    will

administratively allow an employer this option.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment Bill.

This  Bill  will look after the interests  of  our

workers  better. It is a judicious measure because

there  is  provision for employers to continue  to

pay  their  employees more than what  is  normally

paid  so  long  as they do not go against  certain

restrictions  contained  in  the  Act.  Sir,  this

situation is just like what happened in the  past.

In  those days it was the traditional practice  of

commercial establishments to give extra bonuses to

their employees if they had made large profits  in

the financial year under review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if employers want to give their

employees more bonuses than normally provided,  we

should  afford them this privilege. In  fact,  the

Minister  mentioned in his speech  that,  provided

the  employers do not go against the  restrictions

contained in the Act, they are allowed to give the

employees extra bonuses. In this way we  can  give

our  workers  more benefits, and I certainly  will

lend  my full support to the Bill because it  will

not   only  promote  better  relationship  between

labour and capital but it also will encourage  the

workers  to  work harder to increase productivity.

So this is a very good measure. Although there are

certain  provisions, generally speaking we  should

support those which are beneficial to the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the provision for the training of our

young  people,  this is also a very  good  measure

because  our young people will become a new  force

in our industrial development. From being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



semi-skilled workers at the end of their training,

they  will finally become skilled workers able  to

contribute  to our national economy. I  feel  sure

that  all parents and guardians will welcome  this

Bill  which  provides for the  training  of  young

people.



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Employment (Amendment) Bill

affects,  among  other things, the  provisions  of

section  46,  46(A) and 46(B),  which  were  first

enacted  to  give effect to the implementation  of

the recommendations of the National Wages Council.

The  NTUC  is  not  only  a  party  to  the  NWC's

deliberations but it has also actively worked  for

the  setting up of a system of regulating  orderly

increases in wages. In making my comments  on  the

present  Bill, I have discussed with my colleagues

in  the  NTUC,  namely, the Members for  Moulmein,

Telok  Blangah, Bukit Ho Swee, Kallang, Toa Payoh,

Aljunied  and Potong Pasir, and they  have  agreed

with what I am going to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern, whether as a Member of this House or

as  the  President of the NTUC,  is  that  certain

provisions  in this Bill may be unduly prejudicial

to the interest of the trade union movement and to

the  rights of workers to be organised into  trade

unions. It is appreciated that the present Bill is

consequential to the earlier amending Act of  1972

and  seeks  to  clarify  and  define  further  the

respective  rights  of workers  and  employers  in

relation  to  payment of annual  wage  supplement,

annual   bonus  and  annual  wage  increases   now

contained  in  the Act. My fear  is  that  certain

provisions in the Bill may, without the  intention

of   the   Government,   work   to   the   serious

disadvantage  of  the  trade union  movement.  The

provisions of the Bill I am referring to are those

set  out  in clauses 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and  8  of  the

Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill proposes to include a new

subsection  (13) to section 46 of  the  Employment

Act, making it obligatory for an employer to apply

to the Minister for Finance for written permission

whenever  he  desires  to pay  any  sum  of  money

additional   to   the   prescribed   annual   wage

supplement.  In  other  words,  an  employer   who

desires to pay more than one month or three months

of  annual  wage supplement, as the case  may  be,

must  obtain  the permission of the  Minister  for

Finance to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That requirement, in itself, is not a radical

departure  from  the  present law  regulating  the

payment  of  annual  wage  supplement  and   other

benefits. If an employer is willing and can afford

to  pay  over and above the prescribed  limits  of

annual  wage supplement under the Employment  Act,

it  is  a  simple matter for such an  employer  to

write   to  the  Minister  for  Finance  for   the

necessary  permission  to  do  so.  For  such   an

employer and his employees, the provision  of  the

proposed  subsection (13) of section  46  may  not

make any practical difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where an employer is not willing to pay or

admits  that he cannot afford to pay and seeks  to

embarrass   the   trade  union  representing   its

employees,   the   provision   of   the   proposed

subsection   (13)   may  provide   him   with   an

opportunity     to     create     mischief     and

misunderstanding at the expense of the trade union

movement.  It  is not too difficult to  imagine  a

situation where such an employer would protest  to

the  union  in negotiations over wages  and  other

terms and conditions of service that he would like

to  pay  more  than  the  prescribed  annual  wage

supplement except that he is prevented from  doing

so  by the Employment Act. And as a gesture of his

sincerity,  he  would even send a  letter  to  the

Minister for Finance, carbon copied to the  union,

but  it  would  be  so worded  as  to  convey  the

impression  that  the  application  is  made  with

reluctance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more serious situation may arise where an

employer  may be willing and can afford to  pay  a

more   generous  annual  wage  supplement  or   an

additional sum of money to his employees, so  long

as they are not represented by any trade union.  A

trade  union,  of  course,  in  anticipating   the

reaction   of   such  an  employer   against   the

representation  of his employees,  can  claim  for

higher  wages to offset whatever loss its  members

may suffer by way of annual wage supplement or any

other  additional payments. The snag is  that  the

workers  may  allow themselves to be  provoked  or

irritated by insinuations that they would not have

lost  such  benefits if they had  never  joined  a

trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, one of the more serious defects of

this  Bill  is that it seeks to prohibit employees

from   asking  for  payment  of  and  to  prohibit

employers  from paying any sum of money  over  and

above   the  prescribed  limits  of  annual   wage

supplement  or annual bonus. But there is  nothing

in  the  Bill  to  prevent  an  employer,  who  is

unwilling  or  unable to afford to  pay  over  and

above  the  prescribed  limits  for  annual   wage

supplement or annual bonus, from falsely  claiming

that  he is willing or can afford to pay over  and

above  the prescribed limits only if it  were  not

for the Employment Act. Such malice or mischief by

some    unscrupulous   employers   can   have    a

demoralising effect on workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of clauses 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of

the  Bill seek to make it easier for young persons

and  children  to  be gainfully  employed  in  the

Republic.   Though  the  Government  is  repealing

certain  provisions  for  the  protection  of  the

interests   and  welfare  of  young  persons   and

children,  I  have no doubts in my mind  that  the

Government will reproduce corresponding provisions

in the Regulations to be made under the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the various sections to be

repealed  by  the  Bill have become  outdated  and

their continued retention may work against, rather

than  for,  the  general interest and  welfare  of

young  persons and children. In that  respect  the

relevant provisions of the Bill are to be welcome.

I  do not think that any person, whether inside or

outside  this  House, can validly  object  to  any

statutory  provision to make it easier  for  young

persons  and  children to receive proper  training

and  acquire suitable experience to become skilled

artisans  or technicians under the supervision  of

either the Ministry of Education or the Industrial

Training Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the trade union's point of view, the

provisions  of the Bill governing the training  or

apprenticeship of young persons and  children  are

desirable  in themselves, except for  the  nagging

anxiety  regarding  the question  of  trade  union

representation for young persons and children.  It

may   be   contended   that   any   training    or

apprenticeship   scheme  duly  approved   by   the

Ministry  of Education or the Industrial  Training

Board  would not lend itself to abuse by employers

and  that the terms of an apprenticeship agreement

are incompatible with the principles of collective

bargaining.  If  it  is the fear  of  any  person,

inside  or outside this House, that representation

by  trade unions would upset the proper conduct of

any  apprenticeship scheme, I can assure him  that

the NTUC would not tolerate any attempt by any  of

its affiliated unions to meddle with the terms  of

service  set  out  in an apprenticeship  agreement

duly approved by the Ministry of Education or  the

Industrial  Training Board. But it should  not  be

forgotten   that   under   the   Employment    Act

apprentices  have been accorded the  right  to  be

represented  by  a  trade  union,  even  if   such

representation may be confined to safeguarding the

safety and welfare of apprentices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of NTUC is not directed so much to

the  young  persons  and children  who  enjoy  the

benefit  of  a  training scheme or  apprenticeship

scheme  duly approved by the Ministry of Education

or  the  Industrial Training Board, but  to  those

young  persons  and children who are  employed  in

small  private establishments without the  benefit

of    any   proper   training   scheme   or    any

apprenticeship agreement. Such young  persons  and

children  would be completely at the tender  mercy

of  their  respective employers. I have no  doubts

that  the  Ministry of Labour may include suitable

provisions   in   the  proposed  Regulations   and

instruct  the  Labour Inspectorate  especially  to

look  after the interest and welfare of such young

persons  and  children. It  would,  however,  make

matters  easier  for all concerned  if  the  trade

unions  are  permitted  also  to  look  after  the

interest  and  welfare of such young  persons  and

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, it prohibits trade unions

from  representing workers below  the  age  of  18

years. But with the enactment of this Bill, it  is

envisaged  that the number of workers between  the

ages  of 12 and 18 years may considerably increase

in  proportion to the total number of  workers  in

the  Republic.  It is, therefore,  desirable  that

such  workers should be allowed to be  represented

by  trade unions. Any fear that young persons  and

children, because of their tender years, may  lend

themselves  to exploitation by trade  unions  with

ulterior  motives,  may be  put  at  rest  by  the

imposition of conditions that young workers  below

the  age  of 18 years may not participate  in  the

management  of a trade union or in the conduct  of

any industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, if this Bill is adopted by this House

without  a  corresponding amendment to  the  Trade

Unions  Act  to reduce the minimum  age  of  trade

union  membership from 18 years to a lower age,  a

situation may arise which may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



lend   itself   to  exploitation  by  unscrupulous

employers. There is nothing, for instance, in this

Bill  or  in  the  Employment Act  to  prevent  an

employer  from  retrenching  or  terminating   the

service  of  young workers as soon  as  they  have

attained  the  age of 18 years. In  this  way,  an

unscrupulous   employer  may  assure   himself   a

constant supply of sweat-shop labour which  cannot

be  organised  into trade unions. In  making  this

request  to  the Minister for Labour  to  consider

more  seriously  the reduction  of  the  statutory

minimum  age  for trade union membership,  I  have

been  encouraged by the provision of clause 13  of

the Bill which seeks to rule out the participation

of  advocates and solicitors in proceedings before

the  Commissioner for Labour and  which  seeks  to

assure  a  trade union the right to represent  its

members in such proceedings.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Member

for  Boon Teck, who is also the President of NTUC.

I  agree with what he has said, but I wish to make

a further comment on the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 2 of the Bill, the proposed paragraph

(c)  of  subsection  (10) of  section  46  of  the

Employment  Act seeks to make it illegal  for  any

sum  of money to be paid in addition to the annual

wage  supplement  as  set out  in  a  contract  of

service  or in a collective agreement. I  have  no

doubt  that this particular provision is  intended

to  rectify the provision in the amending  Act  of

1972 regarding the upper limits for the payment of

annual  wage  supplement. But  the  fact  is  that

between  1st July, 1972, and today many  contracts

of  service  and collective agreements do  provide

for  the payment of additional sums of money  over

and  above  the prescribed annual wage supplement.

There  are  many reasons for such a  situation  to

arise. One reason is that an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



employer  wishing  to expedite the  signing  of  a

collective  agreement  may propose  an  ex  gratia

payment  to induce a trade union to forgo some  of

its claims and so conclude the negotiation for the

collective  agreement. Another reason is  that  an

employer may prefer giving such ex gratia payments

to  committing himself to a permanent modification

of the wage scales of his employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that whatever sum of

money  that  has  been agreed  to  be  paid  in  a

contract  of service or a collective agreement  in

addition  to the prescribed annual wage supplement

is  not  deliberately  made  for  the  purpose  of

avoiding  the relevant provision of the Employment

Act   regarding   the  payment  of   annual   wage

supplement or annual bonus. That being  the  case,

it  will be rather difficult for a trade union  to

explain to its members how the situation has  come

about, that it is permitted for such an additional

sum of money to be paid in October 1975 but not in

December 1975, since such additional sum of  money

has  been freely and voluntarily agreed to in  the

course  of  negotiations between the employer  and

the  trade  union.  I express the  hope  that  the

Minister  will give serious consideration  to  the

effect  of the provision of the proposed paragraph

(c) of subsection (10), section 46, in clause 2 of

the  Bill,  on  the  morale of  workers  who  have

conscientiously    and    rigorously     conducted

themselves  within  the  framework  of  legitimate

industrial relation practices in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel strongly on the points that I have

just  expressed. It is not because of the possible

effect of the proposed provision on the members of

my   own  union  but  because  of  its  effect  on

organised  workers in general, particularly  those

working     in     the    pioneer    manufacturing

establishments.  I am given to understand  that  a

considerable  number  of such  firms,  because  of

their healthy financial position and their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



willingness  to provide incentives to the  workers

and  not  because of any pressure brought to  hear

upon  them  by the union, are willing to  pay  and

have, in fact, paid more than the prescribed limit

of  annual wage supplement to their employees.  It

will  require  no  effort for  the  management  to

reconcile  itself  to  any  statutory  prohibition

against  the  payment of such  additional  sum  of

money  and  to apply for permission to  make  such

payment.   But   for  the  workers  to   reconcile

themselves  to the suspense of waiting  again  for

the  employer to pay the additional sum  of  money

previously  negotiated  for  and  agreed  to   may

require super-human efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of that consideration, I hope that

the  provision  of the proposed paragraph  (c)  of

subsection  (10)  be  reworded  to  make  it  more

equitable to workers who have legitimately come to

enjoy   such  greater  benefits  than   would   be

permitted in the Bill as it stands at present.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of

the  sentiments expressed by the Member  for  Boon

Teck as well as to give my support to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to elaborate a little

on  clause 6 of the Bill which seeks to repeal and

to  re-enact sections 68 and 69 of the  Employment

Act.  Clause 6 seeks to allow children of 12 years

and  above  to  accept gainful employment  in  any

industrial undertaking. Sir, I have had on several

occasions  both  inside  and  outside  this  House

mentioned  that  there is  a  dire  need  for  the

Ministry of Education to look into the question of

accommodating  students, who could not  go  beyond

the  primary  or  secondary level,  in  vocational

training  institutions. Sir, today  we  are  faced

with a situation in which there are many thousands

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



children whom we call school dropouts. But I would

not  term  them as "dropouts" if, in the light  of

this  Employment (Amendment) Bill, children  above

the age of 12 years may obtain gainful employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect I would like to suggest to

the  Minister  for Education that in  the  various

courses organised by the Industrial Training Board

and  conducted by the vocational institutes  there

should be full encouragement for the mastering  of

skills  at  the basic level. This point  has  been

amply  elaborated on by my Friend, the Member  for

Boon  Teck.  However, what I cannot understand  is

that  when  I  made the suggestion  that  the  ITB

should  conduct courses leading to certain  levels

of  skills,  it was flatly turned down almost  the

day  after my suggestion was made. And here,  Sir,

we  have  this Employment (Amendment)  Bill  which

seeks to do just that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck mentioned just now that

he  and  his trade union colleagues are  concerned

with this provision for children above the age  of

12  to  be  gainfully employed in  any  industrial

undertaking. I too am concerned. To me, this would

mean  that certain skills have got to be  acquired

at  a  tender age, and there are various types  of

skills  available  to  fit  into  this  particular

scheme.  I do not think there will be exploitation

of  young  labour  by  employers  because  certain

skills  are rather specialised in nature  and  its

supply may be limited. In the long run, the  child

concerned will benefit from his apprenticeship  or

from  his  course of training. It is the  ultimate

that Singapore looks forward to because we do  not

have, apart from human resources, other sources to

rely  on.  Therefore, every person  in  Singapore,

especially  the  so-called  dropouts   and   their

parents,  should realise that everyone must, work

for  a living and, as the Prime Minister has said,

"The world does not owe us a living."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a very minor point to

make  on  this  amendment Bill. If  this  Bill  is

passed,  it appears that if an employer wishes  to

pay  a  bigger  bonus  or  a  bigger  annual  wage

supplement he should apply for approval  from  the

Finance Minister to do so. The Finance Minister is

in  charge  of  the economy of the State.  If  the

economy  is  bad, the Finance Minister might  say,

"All  right,  this year we allow  the  workers  an

increase  of  5%."  But  why  should  the  Finance

Minister  be  in  charge  of  the  economy  of   a

commercial  organisation? If at  all  approval  is

necessary,  I  would  say  that  they  should  get

approval  from  the Prime Minister who  heads  the

Cabinet.   Industrial  matters  come  within   the

portfolio  of  the  Minister  for  Labour.  So  it

appears  to  me that it is a case of  passing  the

buck  from one Minister to another. I do  not  see

why  this particular matter has been passed on  to

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Member

for  Boon Teck, and I agree with the points raised

by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that from my own personal

knowledge  I  am aware that in quite a  number  of

establishments the managements and the  respective

trade  unions  have  agreed  on  the  payment   of

additional  sums  of  money  over  and  above  the

prescribed  limits for annual wage  supplement  or

bonus.  Such payments have not been made  for  the

purpose  of  nullifying  the  provisions  of   the

Employment  Act regulating the payment  of  annual

wage  supplement or annual bonus. They  have  been

made  solely for the purpose of giving  effect  to

the  interests  of the employer  rather  than  the

interests  of  the workers. For  that  reason,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, lam of the view that if it  is  not

possible for the Minister for Labour to accede  to

the   request  of  my  colleague  to  modify   the

provision of paragraph (c) of subsection  (10)  as

set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



out  in  clause  2 of the Bill, then  perhaps  the

Minister would consider changing the cut-off  date

from 1st July 1972 to, say, 1st July 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands now at present, the Bill if adopted

by  this  House without any changes at  all  would

undoubtedly   have  a  retrospective   effect   in

relation to the payment of such additional sums of

money  as  contained in collective agreements.  In

other  words,  the  moment this  Bill  is  adopted

without  any  modification,  any  provision  in  a

collective agreement to pay an additional  sum  of

money  over  and above the prescribed annual  wage

supplement would be nullified, regardless  of  the

fact  that  the  agreement had been concluded  two

years  before the implementation of this Bill.  If

the  provision of paragraph (c) of subsection (10)

can  be  adopted without any retrospective effect,

it  will help to soften the impact of the Bill  on

the workers even if there had been no modification

whatsoever to this provision.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the various points raised by the

Member  for Boon Teck have, in fact, been  covered

in my speech earlier on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he is unduly concerned over the fact that

some employers may seek refuge behind the proposed

amendments for their unwillingness or inability to

pay a higher annual wage supplement to members  of

a  union.  Any employer who is foolish  enough  to

resort  to  such a tactic will find that  he  will

have   a  lot  of  questions  to  answer  and   an

unsympathetic Government to contend with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also expressed concern that some

unscrupulous employers may offer their  workers  a

more generous annual wage supplement in return for

not  joining a trade union. I am afraid this is  a

problem that all unions have to face up to at  all

times.   This   is  not  a  problem  peculiar   to

Singapore. Unions must expect such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



divisive tactics from anti-union employers. It  is

up   to   union  officials  to  expose  the   true

intentions  of such employers and to convince  the

workers  that  their long-term  interest  lies  in

joining the union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate once again that the question

of  bonuses  has  been disposed of  in  1972  when

amendments were made to the Employment  Act  based

on  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Wages

Council.  The  quantum of bonuses then  prevailing

was  converted  into annual wage  supplements  and

frozen  at various levels as prescribed in section

46.  The Government has no intention to reopen the

whole  question of bonuses again as it  would,  in

the  words  of the Secretary-General,  NTUC,  mean

"the  resurgence of the previous  bonus  chaos  in

Singapore's wage structure by providing  a  recipe

for   an  industrial  free-for-all".  Instead   of

labouring on the question of bonuses or additional

payments or ex gratia payments, it would  be  more

helpful  if  the unions would dwell  more  on  the

question of a decent wage for an honest day's work

rather   than  expecting  extra  payments  without

putting  in  extra efforts. If, as it is  claimed,

there  are generous employers who are willing  and

can  afford to pay a more generous wage supplement

or  ex  gratia  payment  to their  employees,  the

initiative for such payments should come from  the

employers themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the interests and welfare of young

persons,  I  can assure the Member for  Boon  Teck

that  the Government is as interested as he is  to

see that there is no exploitation of young persons

in  employment.  In a small compact  country  like

Singapore,  with  a  highly  literate   and   well

informed population and a vigilant Government,  it

is  doubtful that any employer can get  away  with

exploitation of young persons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



without  being  discovered and punished.  However,

this  does  not mean that the trade unions  cannot

play  a useful role in keeping a check on possible

abuses   by  unscrupulous  employers.   I   shall,

therefore,  take the suggestion of the Member  for

Boon  Teck  into consideration when  amending  the

Trade Unions Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, line 40, at end, to add -"(15) Nothing

in paragraph (c) of subsection

(10), or in subsection (13), of this section shall

he  construed as applying to any payments made  by

an  employer  to an employee under a  productivity

incentive scheme."; and ".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Bill in this House

on  19th August, 1975, 1 have received a number of

representations  on matters covered  therein.  The

Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce  expressed  concern

that, under the proposed amendments to section  46

of   the  Employment  Act,  the  Chinese  business

community would not be able to continue  with  its

traditional wage system, which is characterised by

relatively   low  wages  and  high  bonuses.   The

National  Trades  Union  Congress  has  also  made

several proposals with regard to the Bill. One  of

these  is that the amendments proposed to  section

46 of the Employment Act should not be extended to

payments  made  under  any productivity  incentive

scheme.  It was of the view that unless  this  was

done employers would be prohibited from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



operating  an  incentive or  productivity  scheme.

This   would  frustrate  Government's  policy   on

productivity  of labour and deprive  employees  of

accrued  benefits  relating to existing  incentive

payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has never been the intention

of  the  Ministry to bring the traditional Chinese

wage  system  or  productivity  incentive  schemes

within  the proposed amendments to section  46  of

the Employment Act. The continued operation of the

traditional  Chinese  wage system,  especially  in

business based on family or kinship ties, would in

my view not disrupt orderly wage developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards productivity incentive schemes, the

Government has consistently urged that  firms  and

factories    must    seek   to   increase    their

productivity.  The  Ministry  has,   through   the

National  Productivity Board, already  begun  work

with  employers  and  unions  on  this  objective.

However,  it  is  necessary that  some  incentives

should be provided for increased productivity. The

proposed amendment to clause 2 will therefore meet

the concern of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce  as

well  as  of  the  NTUC. Bonus  payments  made  by

Chinese  firms under the traditional  wage  system

will  be  deemed  to  be  payments  made  under  a

productivity incentive scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the usual productivity incentive

schemes  in  unionised establishments,  they  will

follow  the  usual  process of direct  negotiation

between employers and unions, conciliation by  the

Ministry,   if   necessary,  and  upon   agreement

delivered  within  seven days  to  the  Industrial

Arbitration Court for certification under  section

24 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend the

Probation  of  Offenders Act to  provide  for  the

appointment  of volunteer probation  officers  who

will be empowered to supervise offenders placed on

probation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members of the House may wish to know  that

the   Community  Probation  Service   Scheme   was

introduced   in  1971.  Under  this  Scheme,   the

Probation and Aftercare Service enrols members  of

the public as volunteer probation officers to help

in  the rehabilitation of young offenders whom the

courts  place on probation. Since the introduction

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



Scheme,   347  persons  have  applied  to   become

volunteer probation officers. So far, 132  persons

have  been selected. Of this number, 53 have  been

put  on  the  job  and 79 are receiving  practical

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's objective in introducing the

Community   Probation  Service   was   to   secure

community  involvement in probation and  aftercare

work.  Probation  as a form of treating  offenders

works  best  in a community which understands  and

accepts  its  objectives, principles and  methods.

Furthermore, the Ministry realises that there is a

considerable pool of resources and goodwill  among

ordinary citizens, which could be tapped to assist

the  Service in its work. Since the implementation

of  the  Scheme, we have found that our trust  and

confidence  in  the  ability of  these  people  to

befriend  and  guide young people  who  have  gone

wrong has not been misplaced. My Ministry intends,

therefore,   to   encourage   further    community

participation and involvement in probation work by

strengthening  and  consolidating  the   Community

Probation Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways in which this can be done is to

empower  volunteer  probation officers  the  legal

responsibility for supervising probationers. Up to

now, volunteer probation officers have been acting

as   Welfare   Assistants  to   our   departmental

probation officers, and they have no powers  under

the  Act  to  supervise  probationers.  They  only

supplement  the  work  of  our  own  officers   by

increasing   the   frequency  of   contacts   with

probationers  at  their places of  work,  schools,

homes  or elsewhere. The Bill before the House  is

designed to vest volunteer probation officers with

statutory  powers to enable them to  work  closely

with our own officers in supervising probationers,

thus enhancing their effectiveness besides



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



strengthening the Probation and Aftercare Service.

The  volunteers  will handle the less  problematic

cases   with  the  necessary  guidance  from   the

Department.   Our   own   officers   could    then

concentrate  on the more difficult cases  and  the

preparation   of   comprehensive  and   evaluative

presentence reports for the consideration  of  the

courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the appointment

of  volunteer  probation officers by the  Minister

from  amongst  persons who  are  not  employed  as

Police Officers or Prison Officers. Initially, the

Ministry  intends  to  be very  selective  in  the

appointment of voluntary probation officers.  Only

those  who  have  demonstrated the right  attitude

towards  the  job and the aptitude  to  work  with

offenders will be appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends subsection (7) of section 5 of

the  Act  which  will enable the  Chief  Probation

Officer  to make available a copy of the probation

order  of  the  court  to the volunteer  probation

officer  if  such  a person has been  assigned  to

supervise the probationer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 6 of the Act and provides

for  the vesting in a volunteer probation officer,

the  same  respective  powers  and  duties  as   a

probation  officer would have under section  6  of

the  Act  if  the  latter had  been  appointed  to

supervise  the probationer instead.  In  addition,

the  clause empowers a volunteer probation officer

to  apply  to  a  court for the  discharge  or  an

amendment  of a probation order, with the  proviso

that  he must first seek the approval of the Chief

Probation  Officer  before  applying  for  such  a

discharge or amendment of the order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 6 amends sections 4, 5 and 13 of

the Act to provide that:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the work of a volunteer probation officer may

be  reviewed by a Probation Committee appointed by

the Minister under section 4 of the Act;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a court may appoint, under section 5 of the

Act,   a   volunteer  probation  officer   to   be

responsible for the supervision of a probationer;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) another volunteer probation officer or

probation  officer may be selected to supervise  a

probationer,  if  the volunteer probation  officer

originally assigned to his supervision  is  unable

to  carry  out his duties for any reason,  if  the

Probation  Committee considers it  desirable  that

another  person should be appointed  to  supervise

the probationer;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) female volunteer probation officers may be

appointed  to supervise female persons  under  the

Act; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) rules may be made which prescribe the duties

of volunteer probation officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Encik Othman Bin Wok].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend section

8  of  the Singapore Sports Council Act, 1973,  to

enable  the Council to establish and manage sports

clubs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the primary tasks of the Council is the

planning   and   implementation  of   Government's

"sports-for-all"  policy  which  calls   for   the

education and involvement of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



masses  in  the regular practice of some wholesome

form of physical activity. Towards this end, inter-constituency sports tournaments were introduced in

1972.   The  tournaments  are  organised  by   the

Singapore Sports Council working closely with  the

various  national  sports  organisations  and  the

sports liaison officers of the constituencies.  As

the   sports   programme  in   each   constituency

developed,  it  was found that  a  sports  liaison

officer  working  alone was  not  enough  for  the

proper co-ordination of sporting activities within

his  constituency. In view of this,  Constituency.

Sports  Associations were formed  to  provide  the

organisational  base for the promotion  of  sports

within  the constituencies and for the preparation

of  teams  for both inter-constituency and  intra-constituency   tournaments.   To-date,   39   such

Associations  have  been  registered   under   the

Societies Act (Chapter 262).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  of  the  House  will  recall  that

several  meetings  were held in  1974  to  discuss

inter-constituency sports. Though it was generally

agreed  that  the Constituency Sports Associations

should   be  independent  bodies,  it   was   also

recognised   that   to   ensure   success    these

Associations  should be managed by  officials  who

had  the  interest,  aptitude  and  background  in

sports.  Members of Parliament who attended  these

meetings  pointed  out various problems  connected

with the running of these Associations, apart from

difficulties in management and in the  recruitment

of   suitable   personnel  to   serve   in   them.

Subsequently, the Singapore Sports Council made  a

study  of  Constituency Sports  Associations.  The

Study  revealed that not all Members of Parliament

were  in  favour  of  forming Constituency  Sports

Associations  under  the  Societies  Act  because,

amongst  other things, the registration procedures

in  forming societies under the Societies Act  are

too  complex and the legal obligations of managing

an association



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



under   the   Act   are   too  burdensome.   These

obligations include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the submission of annual reports and

statements   of   accounts   audited   by   public

accountants;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the liability of excess revenue to income

tax; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) an annual election of office bearers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constituencies with Constituency Sports

Associations  are  also faced with  the  following

problems:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) difficulty in getting sports officers and

dedicated members to serve in the Associations  on

a  continuing basis. Officials serve in  a  purely

voluntary  capacity.  They  are,  by  and   large,

persons with full-time employment and untrained in

sports administration;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) difficulty in obtaining sufficient funds to

finance their sports programmes. The tax liability

on  excess  revenue discourages them from  raising

funds.  Furthermore, donations to the Associations

do not enjoy income tax relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the difficulties and

problems  I  have just mentioned have impeded  the

speedy    formation    of   Constituency    Sports

Associations and their operation. Needless to say,

such  a  situation  would  adversely  affect   the

implementation of our "sports-for-all" policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 8 of the Singapore

Sports  Council Act, 1973, will enable the Council

to   establish   Constituency  Sports   Clubs   as

proprietary  clubs under the Act, to, ensure  that

the  "sports-for-all" policy  can  be  implemented

successfully. This would enable all constituencies

to  overcome the technical difficulties they  face

in  promoting  sports through Constituency  Sports

Associations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 23 is a consequential

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment Bill.

Although the Constituency Sports Association in my

constituency  was formed two years ago  under  the

Societies Act, I believe that this amendment  Bill

will   simplify   the   procedures   involved   in

establishing  the  Constituency Sports  Clubs  and

sports   organisations.  I   believe   this   will

contribute   more   effectively   towards   inter-constituency sports activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has pointed out, this measure

would  avoid  the  problem of  having  to  present

annual  reports and statements of account  and  to

conduct  an annual election of office bearers.  We

know  that  many  officials  of  the  Constituency

Sports  Associations are also members of Citizens'

Consultative Committees and that a number of other

officials also belong to other organisations. They

are   all  attached  to  the  Constituency  Sports

Associations on a part-time basis and they  cannot

devote   too   much  time  to  the   Associations'

activities.   Therefore,   a   simplification   of

procedures would enable these people to carry  out

their task more easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, under the amendment Bill,

Constituency Sports Associations will be  exempted

from  paying income tax. The funds available would

therefore   be  greater.  I  believe   that   this

amendment   Bill   will   promote   sports    more

effectively so that our policy of "sports-for-all"

will be carried out on a wider scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this amendment Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Hon.

Minister for Social Affairs one question. While  I

welcome  the introduction of this amendment  Bill,

would the Hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



Minister  inform  the House as to  the  source  of

funds  for the Singapore Sports Council to  enable

it  to  establish  and manage the  various  sports

clubs and their facilities?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, as the Member for Sembawang has been

repeating  what  I  have said,  therefore  I  have

nothing to say to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for Punggol,

when  this  Bill  becomes an  Act,  the  Singapore

Sports Council will look into that matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I do not quite understand what the Hon.

Minister  means  when he says that "the  Singapore

Sports Council will look into the matter". I  have

asked my question after having made a search  into

past  Hansard records which state that the  source

of funds would, to a certain extent, come from the

Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, not all the funds of the Singapore Pools

(Pte)  Ltd, are  channelled  into  financing  the

Constituency  Sports Associations.  Of  course  it

will be desirable for these Sports Associations or

Clubs  to  raise their own funds.  But  if  it  is

necessary for the SSC to provide them with  funds,

then the SSC will look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I think the Hon. Minister has not got my

point.  I am talking about the Constituency Sports

Associations. The Constituency Sports  Association

in my constituency can very well look after itself

easily  enough,  even though it  has  to  pay  40%

income  tax  on  the  excess of  its  income  over

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this. As far as I can remember,

when the construction of the National Stadium  was

first  mooted, the Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd, was

formed  and, to a certain extent, the  profits  of

Singapore Pools were to be ploughed back  for  the

construction  of  the Stadium.  Subsequently,  the

National Sports Promotion Board was dissolved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



and  the  Singapore Sports Council was set  up  by

statute.  Now, I am given the impression that  the

SSC  has been experiencing some difficulties  with

regard  to funds to promote or provide more sports

facilities   for  the  inter-constituency   sports

activities;   not  for  the  Constituency   Sports

Associations in particular.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the point raised by the Member has no

relevance to the Bill before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, this question is definitely relevant because

if  the  Bill  seeks to amend  section  8  of  the

Singapore Sports Council Act, 1973, to enable  the

Council to establish and manage sports clubs, then

it means that the SSC will definitely have to have

some  sort  of  funds  to  manage  not  only   the

facilities but also the Constituency Sports  Clubs

that   may  be  constituted  at  a  later   stage.

Therefore, my question is relevant.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I have nothing more to add. I have clearly

stated just now that the SSC will look into this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> "The SSC will look into this" is a different

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the BilI.-[Encik Othman Bin Wok].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend certain

provisions  of  the University  of  Singapore  Act

which  have  become either obsolete or  inadequate

since the Act was first enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to section 3 of the Act

empowers  the  Minister,  on  the  advice  of  the

Council  of the University, to make amendments  in

the  future  without having to introduce  amending

legislation  in  Parliament.  This  provision   is

necessary  in  view  of the rapid  growth  of  the

University  and its impending move to Kent  Ridge.

Moreover, universities in many parts of the  world

have   found  their  circumstances  and  functions

altered and their operation rendered difficult  by

antiquated  constitutions  which  could   not   be

revised  without  great  difficulty.  The  present

procedure  of making amendments is too  cumbersome

and  time-consuming.  The amended  procedure  will

ensure   that  the  University's  growth  is   not

hampered or retarded by outdated provisions in the

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposed amendments mainly concern

provisions  in the Constitution of the  University

of  Singapore  as set out in the Schedule  to  the

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Constitution provides, under section

5,  for preference in the admission of students to

be   given  to  persons  domiciled  in  Singapore,

Malaysia  or Brunei. It is clearly desirable  that

preference  should  now  be  given  to   Singapore

citizens  above all others. The proposed amendment

seeks to rectify this anomaly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 13 and 16 of the Constitution provide

for  certain  governments and institutions  to  be

represented on the Court and on the Council of the

University, appropriate in the years before  1965.

These  outdated  provisions  are  deleted  in  the

proposed amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



Provision  is  made instead for some  of  our  own

institutions,  namely,  the  Ngee  Ann   Technical

College  and  the  Institute of Education,  to  be

represented on the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next proposed amendment relates to section 19

which  provides for the Deans of Faculties in  the

University  to  be  elected  by  their  respective

Faculties. The Deans are the key academic officers

of  the University. They are also responsible  for

the  general  administration of  their  respective

Faculties. It is therefore vital that persons with

the requisite academic standing and administrative

experience   be  appointed  Deans.  The   proposed

amendment,  therefore, provides for a Dean  to  be

appointed    by    the    Vice-Chancellor    after

consultation with the Faculty concerned to  ensure

that the most suitable person is appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next proposed amendment, which concerns

section  42, is a minor one. This section provides

for  a  Convocation to be held  annually  for  the

conferment of degrees. In practice, the Chancellor

now  confers  degrees  in writing  and  those  who

attend Convocation, having already graduated,  are

merely  presented to the Chancellor. The  proposed

amendment  seeks  to regularise  the  position  by

redefining the purpose of the Convocation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last proposed amendment of the Constitution

of the University seeks to delete the whole of the

existing section 45 which deals with the Students'

Union, and to introduce in its place a new section

45  on  the  same  subject. The intention  of  the

proposed   amendment  is   to   provide   a   more

comprehensive  range of organised  activities  for

the benefit of the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the reconstituted Students' Union

are  not  spelt out in the proposed  amendment  to

this  section.  They will form the  subject  of  a

statute to be made by the University for this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



purpose. It is the intention of the University  to

have  the new Students' Union made up of a  number

of  clubs, including a Political Club, to cater to

the academic and extra-curricular interests of the

entire  student  body. Every  student  will  be  a

member  of  the Union as well as a  member  of  at

least  one but not more than three of the  Union's

constituent  clubs.  Each  club  will   have   its

objectives  defined in its constitution,  and  its

activities managed by a Committee elected  by  and

from amongst members of that club.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years now, a few student, activists,

quite a disproportionate number of whom were  non-Singapore  students, have dominated the  Students'

Union.  They  have sought to give  the  impression

that  the whole student population is behind  them

in   their  activities  espousing  the  causes  of

communist  political  detainees,  interfering   in

labour  disputes  and  trade  union  affairs,  and

generally  taking up anti-establishment  political

issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new Students' Union Statute, such

students  will  have  to  rally  their  supporters

openly  under  the Political Club section  of  the

Students'  Union.  They  will  have  to   register

themselves  under  the  Societies  Act  like   all

political  parties, and assume responsibility  for

their  political activities like ordinary citizens

in  politics, without the protective camouflage of

academic  autonomy  and student  exuberance.  Only

Singapore   citizens  can  be  members   of   such

political  clubs, a requirement which  applies  to

all political parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the Students' Union will be to look

after  the  welfare  of the  entire  student  body

within  the  confines of the  University  in  such

matters  as  student welfare and  health  service,

recreational amenities, canteen facilities, and so

on.  The  Union  will  be managed  by  a,  Council

consisting  of committee members representing  the

various  clubs constituting the Union, the  number

of seats on the Council for each club being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



in proportion to the size of its membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union subscriptions will be collected by the

University and apportioned among the Union and its

clubs by the University Council as it thinks  fit.

Sufficient funds will be set aside for  the  Union

to  maintain its premises and pay its  staff.  The

balance  will  be  allocated among  the  clubs  in

proportion to their membership. All the  allocated

funds  will  be  retained  by  the  University  in

separate accounts for the use of the Union and its

clubs. The University will act as bankers for  all

student organisations. This will ensure that their

financial' transactions are not disrupted  by  the

annual change of office-bearers and that financial

records are properly maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill, which will be the new

section  13  of the University Act, provides  .for

the  application  of  the  Societies  Act  to  the

University  of Singapore Students' Union  and  its

constituent  bodies when they are  constituted  in

accordance with the new subsection (1) of  section

45 of the Constitution of the University. However,

the  Minister in charge of societies is  empowered

to  exempt  the  Union and any of its  constituent

bodies  from all or any of the provisions  of  the

Societies Act. I wish to state here that,  as  the

Minister  in  charge  of societies,  I  intend  to

exempt the Union and its constituent bodies except

the  Political Club section of the Union from  the

provisions of the Societies Act. This is because I

believe that the University authorities can  under

normal  circumstances well look after  the  proper

functioning of the new Students' Union. As for the

Political Club or clubs, I have already stated the

reasons   why  they  should  register  under   the

Societies Act like all political parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interim provision in the Bill makes it lawful

for  the  University to retain Union subscriptions

collected    by   the   University   before    the

commencement of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



the Act. This provision is made in anticipation of

the  University's new role as bankers of the Union

and  its clubs when the Act comes into force.  The

full amount of subscriptions thus withheld will be

used  for  the  benefit of the new Union  and  its

clubs. However, there is also an interim provision

for  the University Council to make grants to  the

existing Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed are in the best interests

of  the  University. I shall be pleased to  supply

any further information which Members may require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to

sections of the Bill which relate to the Students'

Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the University of Malaya was constituted

out of the two component colleges, namely, Raffles

College  and King Edward VII College, for all  the

time that we have had a university in Singapore, I

imagine   it  would  be  difficult  to  find   any

generation  of  students who  have  not  witnessed

their  union  experiencing  some  tribulation   or

vicissitude of one kind or another. I know because

I took an inordinate time to get my Degree!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EOGMs (Extraordinary General Meetings) may not

have  been held with the same regularity  as  AGMs

(Annual  General Meetings). But the EOGM has,  one

might  say,  become institutionalised. Indeed,  it

has  become so institutionalised that, at a recent

forum  attended by the Vice-Chancellor, the  Vice-Chancellor was asked (I am told) whether the  same

facility  to  allow students to call for  an  EOGM

contained in the current Union constitution would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



be  retained  when  the new statute  for  the  new

Students'  Union  is passed; not  indicating  very

great support on the part of the students for  the

Union leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years another device seems to

have  been  resorted to quite frequently,  namely,

the  EOCM  (Extraordinary  Council  Meeting).  The

difference between the EOCM and the EOGM,  as  far

as  I have been able to observe, has been that the

rate  of calling for the EOCM in moments of crisis

is  much more rapid than the EOGM, the gap between

one  EOCM and another, in fact, being a matter  of

days.   Perhaps,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   you   might

appreciate that just as an EEG or ECG can tell you

the  condition of a patient's health, the EOCM and

the  EOGM rate can be used to judge the health  of

the Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motions of no confidence too, Mr Speaker, Sir,

have  figured  among  attempts  at  censure  quite

frequently   throughout   the   history   of   the

University of Singapore Students' Union. In  fact,

the  Member  for  Kim  Seng has  himself  had  the

unpleasant  experience of a combination  of  EOCM,

EOGM  and  a  motion  of no  confidence.  Sir,  if

students   want   a  release  of   tension,   some

excitement, at the same time as they make sure the

Union is operating in their own interest, this  is

all fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, recently, events associated with the

Union  have taken a more serious turn.  About  two

years  ago,  as a result of the traditional  EOGM,

EOCM  and  motion of no-confidence,  a  number  of

individuals  were  elected  to  Union   leadership

including  Juliet Chin and Tsui  Hon  Kwong.  From

then  on  despite  pressing student  problems  the

Union seemed to have been directed towards what  I

would  like to describe as political agitation.  I

say "despite pressing student problems" because at

about  that time some students complained publicly

of  irresponsibility displayed by  some  of  their

fellows,  and editorial comments in the Undergrad,

now also known as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



Hsueh Hseng Pau, referred to a general decline  in

standards of behaviour, both social and moral, and

to  blatant  examples  of vandalism,  hooliganism,

immorality  and decadence. Despite  this  view  by

some  students  at  that time it  was  decided  by

student  union leaders to try to achieve what  was

described   as  a  maximum  exposure  to   social,

political, educational and academic issues.  Note,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that academic issues  take  last

place.  There  was  also no mention  of  students'

welfare and I believe students have commented upon

this lack of interest in students' welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this decision to stimulate a

consciousness  arousing,  national   service   was

criticised.  The anti-bus fare hike  campaign  was

launched.  The integrity of Members of  Parliament

was  questioned,  including my  hon.  Friend,  the

Member for Jalan Kayu. Some agitation against  the

Press   Bill   was  contrived.  The  Housing   and

Development   Board's  increase  in  service   and

conservancy   charges  was  severely   criticised.

Agitation on the ground of issues prevailing in  a

friendly  neighbouring country  was  mounted,  for

example, in respect of the Johore Bahru squatters.

The  so-called  Retrenchment Research  Centre  was

started  and  agitation was mounted ostensibly  on

behalf  of retrenched workers but, aimed also,  it

seems    to    me,    at   denigrating    workers'

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that it is all well and good

for  students to want to indulge in what has been'

described as conscientisation. But it seems to  me

that  the  awakening  that is being  contrived  is

directed  overwhelmingly in  the  direction  of  a

strident  emphasis on grievances and on opposition

to  Government action. Some student  leaders  have

become so hypnotised by this development and  have

apparently become so inward-looking that they  are

not  able to distinguish illusion from reality.  I

think  my  colleagues in the Philosophy Department

might describe them as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



solipsists. A solipsist may be likened to a person

who dreams he is a butterfly and when he awakes he

is  not sure whether he is a person who has dreamt

that  he  is  a  butterfly  or  whether  he  is  a

butterfly who is dreaming that he is a person. The

illusion and reality are confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small group of student leaders complain of

anti-people  action  by the  Government  and  they

identify  themselves  with the  people's  struggle

which,  they say, shall be a victory.  I  have  no

doubt  that  the  people's struggle  will  end  in

victory.  But  may  I ask this  small  coterie  of

students  whom  they  represent:  what  are  their

credentials?  In  fact, today they  called  for  a

solidarity  rally  and when I looked  out  at  the

lower  quadrangle, on which they were supposed  to

assemble for this solidarity rally, I was  greeted

by  a  smiling expanse of empty green with  a  few

students studiously studying under the shade of  a

tree.  A  very peaceful sight indeed, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad that a few individuals who have

suffered  from a distortion of judgment have  been

able  to bring the affairs of the Union to such  a

sorry  state in which, overpowered by the hot  air

that  they  themselves have generated,  they  have

neglected even mundane things like Union finances,

that  it is public knowledge that the auditor  has

given  only a qualified report. Yet the  minority,

who   are   student  leaders  and  their  personal

following, do not have the support of the majority

of  the students who simply want to swot it out in

the  library,  commuting between library,  canteen

and  lecture  theatre and who, despite  their  own

amusement  and  entertainment over the  antics  of

student leaders, seem reluctant to do anything  to

change  things  for themselves. But  this  is  not

unusual. In many other universities, as far  as  I

have  occasionally witnessed, it is a few who work

in  the Union while the large majority merely want

to  go  about  their  business  of  getting  their

education, training their intellects and preparing

for a role for themselves in society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where we are concerned, we are facing

the possibility that the student leadership at the

University  of Singapore may well find  themselves

manipulated  by those who do not have  the  woolly

idealism of students but instead a clear notion of

what they want, and what they want may not be  for

the benefit of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to attempts in the University to

express dissent, and this I did during the  debate

on  the  Annual Budget Statement. I have mentioned

that  our students should be warned against  being

pawns  of shadowy individuals who, while espousing

humanistic  aims  and freedom,  cynically  exploit

youthful  ideals.  It is for this  reason  that  I

support the passage of this Bill. The Union  seems

now  open  to  exploitation  with  the  leadership

exercising  themselves  over  imagined   political

grievances  which  have nothing  to  do  with  the

welfare  of  the  students  themselves  and  which

indeed have no foundation in reality whatsoever. I

imagine that it would be correct to say that  this

Bill  is in a way an expression of a no-confidence

motion  in the present way the Students' Union  is

being run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that in future the

administration will play a bigger hand than it has

been  able  to in the past in the affairs  of  the

Union.  In  this respect I can only refer  to  the

statement  made  by  the Vice-Chancellor  that  he

would  have the interests of the students at heart

in  respect of the Union. I would expect that  the

majority   of  the  students  would  accept   this

assurance,  and  I  think they do.  I  cannot  but

reprehend  the  reference made (in a  very  recent

student publication) to the Vice-Chancellor as the

chief  controller, namely, a man long  experienced

in  controlling student organisations - a sort  of

super  gestapo chief. This is another  example  of

the  kind of distortion a small coterie of student

leaders go in for. It would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



more reasonable to think of the Vice-Chancellor as

being a man of vast educational experience who has

reached  the top of his profession, whose academic

abilities   have  been  recognised   through   the

university bestowing on him an honorary award, and

so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration, I am sure, realises that with

authority  over  the  Union in  their  hands  they

should  seek at all times, as far as possible,  to

move  in  the direction that reflects the will  o~

the majority of the students and certainly towards

the  good  of  the  Union and the  development  of

student   community   potential   and   individual

intellectual and moral qualities in an  atmosphere

of  academic calm and stability. This  is  what  I

think the Vice-Chancellor wants. This is what  the

vast  majority of students and their parents would

want.   This   is  what  the  people  want.   This

Parliament represents the people, this is what the

people want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill

which  seeks to amend the University of  Singapore

Act  to  bring it up to date and to make  it  more

flexible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the Bill seeks to do away with or to

modify statutory provisions which were enacted for

purposes  which  have  been achieved  or  to  suit

circumstances which are no longer valid, I do  not

think there can be any question as to the need for

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill relating to the

Students'  Union,  however, may  give  rise  to  a

certain amount of confusion compounded by emotions

and sentiments. I do not doubt the usefulness of a

Students'  Union  or the desire  of  the  students

themselves  to  run their Union with  the  minimum

amount  of supervision by the University Authority

or any other authority. As it is, most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



University students have left the running  of  the

Students' Union and the various Students' Clubs to

a   relatively  handful  of  students.  There   is

certainly cause for anxiety when the few  students

who  are supposed to promote the welfare of  their

fellow  students  can freely  make  use  of  their

office   for  other  activities  making  not   the

slightest bearing on the welfare of students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who like to invoke the fashionable

slogan  on the sanctity of academic freedom,  they

should  also  consider  the fact  that  University

students  have no freedom of choice regarding  the

membership of their Students' Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Students' Union, even after the adoption of

this  Bill,  enjoys a privilege which  has  always

been denied to trade unions in Singapore, and that

is the privilege of being a closed shop union. The

moment  a  student  is admitted to  the  Singapore

University, he automatically becomes a  member  of

the    Students'   Union   and   his    membership

subscription   is  automatically   and   regularly

checked-off  or  collected by  the  University  on

behalf of the Union for so long as the student  is

enrolled in the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to request the

Hon.  Minister for Home Affairs and  Education  to

persuade  the  Minister  for  Labour  to  make  an

amendment to the Trade Unions Act and extend  this

privilege to the unions? I would recommend my NTUC

colleagues  to make the Minister for Home  Affairs

and Education a Friend of Labour!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the provisions of the Bill affecting the

Students' Union are seen from the point of view of

the  minority of students who seek to continue  to

use  the  name  of  the passive  majority  of  the

students'  body for their own ends, it is  obvious

that the provisions are unpalatable and constitute

a  threat to their sectional interest. But if  the

same provisions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



Bill are approached from the point of view of  the

general  body  of students, it is  patently  clear

that   the  provisions  are  necessary   for   the

protection  of  the welfare and  interest  of  the

general  body  of  students. The  merits  of  this

portion of the Bill should not be gauged from  the

volume  of noise made by a vociferous minority  of

students  but  should be judged on  the  basis  of

whether  the protection conferred by the  Bill  on

the   general  body  of  students  outweighs   the

reduction  of  scope for abuse by  a  minority  of

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the proposed provisions affecting

the  Students'  Union can only  serve  to  prevent

abuses in the conduct of students' affairs whether

by  the whole students' body under the name of the

Students' Union or whether by a sectional group of

students  under the name of one of  the  Students'

Clubs.  For  the vast majority of students,  there

cannot  be any valid and cogent objection  to  any

proposal   for  a  more  equitable  and  objective

distribution of funds on the basis of a number  of

students  participating  in  the  activity  to  be

financed.  It is a more democratic procedure  than

the  present basis of allocating common  funds  to

any  activity  according to whether a  handful  of

students think the activity is desirable. If it is

seriously  contended,  as  it  has  been  done  in

certain   quarters,  that  the   Students'   Union

constitutes  an  integral part of the  educational

process rightly associated with a University, then

it  is  more  urgent that the students should  get

their  lessons  correct. If a  few  students  have

repeatedly shown themselves unable or unwilling to

discipline  themselves to shoulder the  monotonous

routine  of catering for the welfare and  interest

of  the general body of students, it does not mean

that  this  House should also shirk the unpleasant

but  necessary task of restraining  a  handful  of

students   from   dramatically  exploiting   their

stewardship of the Students' Union for  their  own

heroics. For these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



considerations, I strongly support the Bill  moved

by the Minister for Home Affairs and Education.



<br><br>5.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 5 of the Bill puzzles me.

The  Minister  just now did give reasons  for  the

necessity for this clause, but I am sure there are

many  other  reasons that he has not disclosed  as

yet.  If  he has no other reasons, I am  wondering

why  clause  5 is being enacted and why  were  the

funds  collected for the benefit of the University

of  Singapore  Students'  Union  retained  by  the

University.   I   hope  the  Hon.  Minister   will

enlighten this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister for Home

Affairs  and Education is not going to be  popular

with some of the more union-active students of the

University  of  Singapore for  moving  this  Bill,

particularly  with  reference  to  the  provisions

relating to the Students' Union. This is  a  small

occupational hazard that he sometimes faces  as  a

Government Minister in discharging his duties  for

the  good  and well-being of the whole  community.

Perhaps  the  Minister in this instance  can  take

some  comfort in the thought that the  Member  for

Katong,  the Member for Boon Teck and I will  also

probably  come  in for some pointed criticisms  by

the  Students'  Union  leaders  for  speaking   in

support of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to bring the Students' Union within

the  ambit  of  the  Societies Act  has  certainly

generated  quite some synthetic anger  among  some

members of the Union. The Bill is misconstrued  as

being  deliberately repressive. They see the  Bill

as an act to end their very special and privileged

position  to  engage  in unrestricted  activities,

particularly  in  the political field  and  taking

refuge in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



sanctuary  of the University campus and under  the

cloak  of the oft-quoted but misunderstood concept

of academic freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a healthy sign, Mr Speaker, Sir, to see

some  of  our  students showing  interest  in  the

political   and  social  affairs  of  our   island

Republic.  I  only  hope that  their  interest  is

genuine and abiding and does not vanish as soon as

they leave the University and secure good jobs. It

is  important that we do not treat our  University

students  as  young,  immature  and  irresponsible

adolescents.  They  should be treated  as  adults.

Their  Union should be accorded the status  of  an

organisation for adults, no more and no less equal

than  any organisation for adults. They must enjoy

rights   and   privileges,  responsibilities   and

obligations, no more and no less than any group or

organisation of adult people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions, political parties and other

organisations in our State come under the ambit of

either the Trade Unions Act or the Societies  Act.

Therefore,  the intention behind this Bill  is  to

bring the Students' Union within the ambit of  the

Societies  Act. It should not be seen  as  placing

unusual  restrictions on the  students'  body  but

should  be regarded as placing the students'  body

on  the same footing as other organisations in the

Republic.  As  a  matter of  fact,  the  Singapore

Polytechnic  Students' Union is  registered  under

the  Societies Act. The People's Action Party,  as

any   other  political  party  in  Singapore,   is

registered under the Societies Act. The fact  that

the  PAP  is the ruling party today clearly  shows

that  organisations, including political  parties,

registered  under  the  Societies  Act,  are   not

necessarily hampered or restricted in carrying out

their functions and objectives fully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for all the activities of the Students' Union,

other   than   political  activities,   there   is

virtually of no consequence now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



that  the Students' Union has come under the ambit

of   the  Societies  Act,  particularly  when  the

Minister has now made it known that he intends  to

exempt  the  Students' Union and  its  constituent

bodies,  except  the  Political  Club,  from   the

provisions  of the Societies Act. What it  amounts

to  in  the end is that foreign students  enjoying

the  hospitality of the Singapore  Government  and

taking advantage of the facilities paid for by the

people of Singapore will henceforth not be allowed

to   meddle  in  the  political  affairs  of   our

Republic, as some of them had done so far. What is

wrong with that, Mr Speaker, Sir?



5,08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the risk of allowing my

personal integrity to be questioned once  more,  I

would  nevertheless  ask  the  Minister  concerned

whether  there  is any reason why  we  should  not

refer this Bill to a Select Committee, in view  of

the  evident  concern and interest  shown  by  the

students and some of the academic staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I approached the House just

now  my vision was arrested by the colossal claims

of  the  present  student  leadership  that  their

freedoms are being fundamentally attacked. In view

of that fact, may [just make some comments on this

Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wish to make a brief comment on clause 3

of the Bill and the amendment to section 45 of the

Constitution, contained in clause 4. Sir, clause 3

brings  the  Singapore Students' Union within  the

purview  of  the  authority of  the  Registrar  of

Societies.   In   the  light  of  the   Minister's

explanation, many of the anxieties of the  present

student  leadership must surely have been allayed.

But  it  seems to me that the big commotion  about

this  provision in the Bill bringing the Students'

Union  within  the authority of the  Registrar  of

Societies   is  misconceived.  Up   to   now   the

constituent bodies of the Students'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



Union  have all along been registered bodies under

the  Societies Act. It seems strange that hitherto

the  student leadership has not found it necessary

to  claim  that  its constituent bodies  have  had

their fundamental freedoms attacked. But now  when

the  provision in this Bill attempts to bring  the

Students'   Union  within  the  purview   of   the

Registrar of Societies' authority, this  claim  is

loudly  made.  I think there is some confusion  in

the thinking of the present student leadership and

it would be well for them if their articulation on

issues take on a sober and mature note.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 45 of the Constitution

allows  the Council of the University to determine

how  Union fees may be applied for the purpose  of

the Students' Union and its constituent bodies. If

the Students' Union shows any real alarm over this

amendment, I think it is based on the belief  that

the   Council  will  suppress  legitimate  student

activities  in  the future, which belief  at  this

stage  must surely be premature. As I see it,  the

reconstructed  Council  under  the  Bill  comprise

various  personalities  who  should  be  able   to

consider  and  decide  impartially  the  desirable

application of Union funds. To argue that by  this

amendment  the  Union  will be  hamstrung  in  the

application of its funds is, [think, to start  off

by  saying that the majority of the members in the

Council  will comprise puppets who are, therefore,

not  suitable  for  office in  the  Council.  This

argument is frivolous and, I think, facetious,  as

it  passes  adverse judgment on  the  capacity  of

people  who  have not yet begun to  exercise  this

capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in concluding, Sir, the point I wish to

stress  is  simply, or what surely  must  be,  the

accepted  principle  in the expenditure  of  Union

funds.  These  funds  are  largely  made   up   of

students' subscriptions during their stay  in  the

University.  They should, therefore,  be  expended

for the proper interest of the general body of the

students. If there should be an authority  set  up

to ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



that  such funds should not be expended wastefully

or  in  a manner contrary to the interests of  the

general body, then surely commonsense must dictate

that such an authority is welcome.



<br><br>5.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my full support

to this Bill. The Bill in no way hinders the basic

rights  of  our students as citizens of Singapore.

As  a university lecturer I can vouch for the fact

that  the  vast majority of our students are  hard

working,  well motivated and taking full advantage

of  the  higher  education that we  are  affording

them.   Most  of  them  are  not  concerned   with

Students'  Union  politics. As  the  Minister  has

pointed  out,  they are only a small  minority  of

radicals, most of whom are not Singapore citizens.

These  radicals do not realise that attendance  at

the  University  is  not  a  right.  The  cost  of

attending   it  is  very  heavily  subsidised   by

society.  Foreign students are here as  guests  of

Singapore,  paid for by the people  of  Singapore.

The   Government  of  Singapore,  as  the  elected

representatives of the people, have every right to

restrict whatever freedoms and whatever privileges

that these foreign students enjoy in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singapore students, since society is

paying  for their higher education, let  them  not

forget  that only a very small proportion  of  our

population    are   afforded   higher   education.

Therefore, society has every right to expect  that

both students and lecturers at the University make

constructive use of their time and facilities  and

that  the  University should  not  be  used  as  a

privileged, a protected political platform.  As  a

matter of fact, Sir, the Minister in his statement

has  generously  allowed  for  the  formation   of

political  clubs  in the University.  These  clubs

will allow the students to express themselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



politically and would serve as an outlet for their

exuberance,  for  their  social  concern  and   to

increase or heighten their political awareness  in

their  capacity as citizens of Singapore. I  would

hope  that our student leaders will learn  quickly

that  to be truly influential the leadership  must

be  sound, must be constructive, and their honesty

and integrity must he beyond question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent meeting between the Vice-Chancellor

and   the  students,  the  question  of  financial

probity  was  raised because the auditors'  report

indicated  some malpractices and misuse  of  Union

funds. This is something which I am very disturbed

and  very concerned about as a University teacher,

because  if the younger people with the  intellect

and  with  higher education do not have  financial

responsibility   and  are  not  able   to   assert

leadership   which  is  sound,  constructive   and

honest,  then  what  kind of leadership  can  they

subsequently  offer  to the people  of  Singapore?

Sir,   as   I  look  at  their  publications   and

statements,  I  find  that  they  do  not  reflect

appropriately  the  intellectual  standing  of   a

University.  The intellectual and factual  content

of  debate is appallingly low. The standard of the

Undergrad,  in  particular, has deteriorated  over

the  years.  The articles which are published  are

emotional  and full of ideological blinkers.  They

do  not reflect what the students have been taught

at  the  University, and I have challenged my  own

students   often  to  make  use  of  the  economic

principles  that  I have taught them  to  appraise

economic  policies and problems of  Singapore,  of

the region and of the world. I challenged them  to

make constructive replies to the garbage which  is

thrown  up in the Undergrad from time to  time  on

all  manners  of  social, political  and  economic

issues. If our students really want to make  their

voices heard and want to make an impression on the

people  of  Singapore and in the world  at  large,

then  they  should  be able to meet  argument  for

argument and to present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



facts  and to confront whatever opposing arguments

in a manner befitting people who have received the

benefit of higher education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have appeared at many University forums

and  debates  and  I  have found  that  the  great

majority  of  our  students are rational  and  are

responsive and responsible, and if we can  somehow

reach  out  to them to try and explain  things  to

them,   try  to  reason  with  them  in  a  proper

dialogue,  my  own feeling is that  many  of  them

would  respond. Unfortunately, it is  the  radical

lecturers and so on who seem to make the effort to

reach  out to these students. But fortunately  the

vast majority do not respond to them.



<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to

thank  those Members who have come out  positively

in  support of this Bill, and I believe  that  the

support is quite overwhelming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just touch on the speech by the Member for

Katong?   He   has  put  his  points   much   more

picturesquely in support of the Bill. I believe he

is  able  to  do so because, as he  said,  he  had

watched what happened from his office in the Extra-mural   Department,  which  overlooks  the   lower

quadrangle where they held rallies. As such, I  am

quite sure he speaks with solid experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It now, leaves me to answer two questions which

have  been raised by Members. The Member for Jalan

Kayu  wants to know why we do not propose to refer

this  Bill  to a Select Committee. There  are  two

reasons. The first is that it is quite a clear-cut

Bill.   There   is  no  controversy   except   the

controversy thrown up, as stated by Members, by  a

coterie  or  a  small group of vociferous  student

leaders   who  want  to  cloud  the   issue   with

distortions. Secondly, this Bill is merely  making

the  formal amendments. After the passing of  this

Bill, as far as the Students' Union is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



concerned,  a statute will have to be  enacted  by

the  University Council, setting out in detail the

provisions  of the new Students' Union  that  will

replace the existing one. As such, we do not think

there  is  any need for this Bill to go to  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question brought up by the Member for

Potong  Pasir  regarding  funds  which  have  been

retained  by the University authorities  and,  to-date, not released to the Students' Union, part of

the  answer  has, in fact, been  given  by  a  few

Members   of  Parliament  who  referred   to   the

qualified report given by the external auditors on

the  1974  accounts of the University of Singapore

Students' Union. I understand that the reason  for

the University authorities to continue to hold  on

to the subscriptions has already been given by the

Vice-Chancellor when he met the students recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-Chancellor told the students that he was

not  satisfied with the accounts of the  Students'

Union   because  the  accounts  showed  that   the

Students'  Union  was indebted to  the  Australian

Students'  Union to the tune of $45,000  and  that

the   Students'  Union  leaders  were  unable   to

satisfactorily  account for this debt  or  explain

why   they  were  so  heavily  indebted   to   the

Australian Students' Union. Another reason why  he

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-Chancellor and the University

administration,  who have a moral obligation  to

properly used for the benefit of the student  body

as  a  whole, therefore have rightly withheld  the

explanation  from  the Students'  Union  has  been

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tragedy of drug abuse has been presented

in  terms  of the individual drug abuser  and  his

family.  The  irreparable damage  caused  by  drug

addiction  to the health and career  of  the  drug

abuser  and  the  sorrow, anxiety  and  the  shame

caused  to  the family has often been  emphasised.

This, therefore, need not be elaborated upon here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is not sufficiently appreciated is the

threat  that  drug  addiction  poses  to  national

security and viability. If drug abuse were  to  be

allowed to grow unchecked, particularly among  our

youths,  we  would  eventually  be  faced  with  a

dangerous national security problem. In no time we

would  find that it had penetrated right into  the

vital and sensitive institutions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



State, like the Police and the Armed Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in fact, happened in South Vietnam during

those  tortuous years of undeclared war and was  a

major  factor  leading to its  eventual  collapse.

Drug  addiction  became rampant and uncontrollable

there.  It  not  only sapped  the  spirit  of  the

soldiers  to  fight  but  also  undermined   their

fitness  to  act out what little spirit  that  was

left in them. Thus from the very onset they had no

chance   at  all  despite  their  superiority   in

firepower,  military  hardware  and  sophisticated

gadgetry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some indications that there is a

Communist  plan  to use narcotics to  corrupt  and

soften  the  population of the various  states  in

South-East Asia for the purposes of subversion and

eventual  take-over. It is, therefore, vital  that

we take the severest of action now to forestall it

and  stop the supply of narcotics into the country

and check the spread of drug addiction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rampant drug addiction among our young men and

women will also strike at the very foundations  of

our  social fabric and undermine our economy. Once

ensnared by drug dependence they will no longer be

productive digits contributing to our economic and

social progress. They will not be able to carry on

with  their  regular jobs. Usually for  the  young

men, they turn to all sorts of crime, and for  the

girls,  to prostitution to get money to buy  their

badly   needed  supply  of  drugs.  Thus,   as   a

developing country, our progress and very survival

will be seriously threatened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, as it is situated, is in a rather

vulnerable   position.   The   "Golden   Triangle"

straddling Thailand, Laos and Burma, which is  the

source  of  supply of narcotics, is not  far  from

Singapore.  Being  a busy port, an  important  air

communication centre and an open coastline  easily

accessible from neighbouring countries, it makes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



detection  of  supplies  of  narcotics  coming  in

difficult.  Further, the manufacture  of  morphine

and heroin is not a complicated process and can be

done  in as small a space as a toilet. Our Central

Narcotics Bureau has intelligence information that

much of the heroin brought into Singapore has been

manufactured in illicit laboratories clandestinely

established in a neighbouring country. The Central

Narcotics Bureau also reported that there  was  an

abortive  attempt  to  set up  an  illicit  heroin

laboratory in Singapore itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroin is one of the most potent and dangerous

drugs. In the first half of 1974 only nine out  of

1,793  drug  abusers arrested consumed heroin.  In

the  corresponding period this year 1,007  out  of

1,921 drug abusers arrested consumed heroin.  Thus

the number of heroin abusers arrested increased by

almost  112  times  in  12  months.  This  is   an

explosive  increase  by  any  reckoning.   Equally

significant  is  the  fact  that  the  number   of

traffickers  arrested for dealing  in  heroin  had

also  increased from six in the first half of 1974

to 26 in the corresponding period this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statistics show clearly that existing

penalties  under  the Misuse of Drugs  Act,  1973,

have   not   been   a  sufficient  deterrence   to

traffickers.  In 1974 the Criminal Law  (Temporary

Provisions)  Act was invoked to detain traffickers

and  financiers,  and  31  major  traffickers  and

financiers have been detained so far. Despite this

threat  of  indefinite detention,  trafficking  is

still  rife.  This is because it is lucrative  and

syndicates   are  prepared  to  look   after   the

interests  of  traffickers  and  their  dependants

whenever they are caught and imprisoned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of this Bill, therefore, seeks to amend

the  Second  Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs  Act,

1973,  so  that the death penalty will be  imposed

for  the unauthorised manufacture of morphine  and

heroin irrespective of amounts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



involved.  The death penalty will also be  imposed

for the unauthorised import, export or trafficking

of  more than 30 grammes of morphine or more  than

15 grammes of heroin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of countries, including Malaysia,

Thailand,  Philippines,  Burma,  Egypt,   Nigeria,

Turkey  and  Iran, have imposed the death  penalty

for  the  unauthorised  manufacturing,  importing,

exporting  and trafficking of hard drugs  such  as

morphine and heroin. The death penalty provided in

the  Second  Schedule  of  the  Bill  is  a  close

parallel to the provisions in the Iranian  law  in

that   the  death  penalty  is  imposed  for   the

unauthorised  manufacture of morphine  and  heroin

irrespective of amounts involved, but in the  case

of   unauthorised   trafficking,   importing   and

exporting  of  those drugs the  death  penalty  is

imposed   only  when  the  quantities   exceed   a

specified weight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, trafficking

is  defined  as  selling,  giving,  administering,

transporting, sending, delivering and distributing

drugs.  It  is  not  intended  to  sentence  petty

morphine  and  heroin pedlars  to  death.  It  is,

therefore,  necessary to specify the  quantity  by

weight, exceeding which the death penalty will  be

imposed.  The weights refer to the pure substance.

For  heroin any quantity in which the pure  heroin

content is above 15 grammes will attract the death

penalty.   Such   an  amount   when   mixed   with

adulterants is sufficient to spike some 500 heroin

cigarettes. One heroin-spiked cigarette is usually

shared by a few beginners. Thus 15 grammes of pure

heroin can do considerable damage and ruin a  very

large  number  of  our youths.  As  a  comparison,

Iranian   law  provides  for  a  mandatory   death

sentence where the trafficking only involves  more

than 10 grammes of heroin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also allay the fear of those who may have

the    impression   that   drug   addicts    might

inadvertently be hanged as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



a  result  of  their having in their possession  a

controlled  drug  which  contains  more  than   15

grammes  of  pure  heroin.  The  heroin  that   is

commonly  used  by  drug abusers  and  addicts  in

Singapore is referred to as Heroin No. 3. This  is

currently  sold in little plastic phials, at  $32

per   phial.  It  is  usually  mixed  with   other

substances  in the proportions of about  40%  pure

heroin  and  60% adulterants. Each phial  contains

about   0.8   grammes  of  the  mixed   substance.

Therefore,  a  person will only be  in  danger  of

receiving  the  death penalty if  he  has  in  his

possession some 37.5 grammes of adulterated heroin

which contains 40% of pure heroin. This works  out

to  47  phials. And it costs about $1,500  to  buy

this amount at the current retail price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, most unlikely for a person who

is  in  possession of so much heroin to be only  a

drug  addict and not a trafficker. An addict  uses

between half to one phial of heroin a day. Even if

he is rich and can afford it, he does not buy more

than  two  or three phials at a time for  fear  of

being arrested and convicted as a trafficker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to determine the addictive

dosage  of  heroin  and  morphine  to  equate  the

weights  of  these two drugs for  the  purpose  of

imposing  the death sentence. This is because  the

addictive dosage varies from one addict to another

depending  on  the  individual's  physiology   and

psychological make-up. Therefore, medicinal dosage

is  used to differentiate the weights. Since every

gramme of heroin is equivalent in medicinal  doses

to  two  grammes of morphine, it is provided  that

trafficking,   importing  and   exporting   of   a

controlled drug containing more than 30 grammes of

pure morphine will attract the death penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although traffickers of morphine and Clause 4 of

the Bill makes statutory heroin dealing in

quantities up to but not provision for the

appointment of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



exceeding  the  specified  weights  will  not   be

hanged,  the  Bill provides for heavier  sentences

for  them than those in existence. Similarly,  the

maximum sentence for the unauthorised trafficking,

importing  and  exporting of opium,  cannabis  and

cannabis  resin  above  a  specified  quantity  is

enhanced.    For    example,   the    unauthorised

trafficking  of  heroin  from  10  grammes  to  15

grammes,  morphine from 20 grammes to 30  grammes,

opium  exceeding 6 kilogrammes, cannabis exceeding

10  kilogrammes  and cannabis  resin  exceeding  4

kilogrammes  carries the maximum  sentence  of  30

years  imprisonment and 15 strokes of  the  rotan.

Without the amendment such offences would at  most

be punishable with 20 years imprisonment or a fine

of  $40,000  or both and 10 strokes of the  rotan.

The  minimum sentence for such offences after  the

amendment  will  he 20 years imprisonment  and  15

strokes   of  the  rotan.  The  existing   minimum

sentence is three years imprisonment or a fine  of

$5,000 or both and two strokes of the rotan. These

stiffer  penalties  for the  lesser  offences  are

introduced to harmonise with the imposition of the

death penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken to include other

amendments in this Bill. I need mention  only  the

more  important  of  these  amendments.  Clause  5

reduces the quantity of morphine from 5 grammes to

3  grammes and diamorphine (heroin) from 5 grammes

to  2  grammes  for  invoking the  presumption  of

trafficking in these drugs provided in section  15

of  the Act. . The morphine and heroin retailed in

Singapore  contain an average of  40%  adulterants

and 60% adulterants respectively. Taking this into

consideration, the weights are lowered so that the

weight  of the pure substance is used consistently

in  defining the offence as well as for specifying

the penalties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



Director   and  other  officers  of  the   Central

Narcotics Bureau, and clause 8 confers on them all

the  powers of a police officer under the Criminal

Procedure  Code  in relation to  an  investigation

into  a  seizable offence. Clause 6  introduces  a

presumption that a person whose urine is found  to

contain  a controlled drug as a result of a  urine

test  has  consumed a controlled drug  unless  the

contrary  is  proved. Further, clause 11  provides

the  Director of Central Narcotics Bureau with the

power  to  require a person to attend an  approved

institution for treatment or rehabilitation if, as

a  result of a urine test, he deems such a  course

of action necessary. Clause 7 amends section 22 of

the Act to make clear that a person arrested by an

officer  of the Bureau may be taken to the Bureau.

All  these provisions are to strengthen  the  hand

and facilitate the work of CNB officers in dealing

with  drug  addicts with a view to  treatment  and

rehabilitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the more severe penalties and some of

the  other  provisions in the Bill  are  meant  to

provide   the   necessary   deterrence   to   drug

traffickers  and  pushers,  there   will   be   no

slackening in the Government's programme  to  deal

with the drug problem on other fronts. On the  one

hand,   there   will  be  greater  deterrence   to

traffickers  to cut off the supply  of  narcotics,

and  on  the other, every effort will be  made  to

treat and rehabilitate those who have already been

hooked   on   to  the  drug  habit   by   improved

rehabilitation facilities. The Drug Rehabilitation

Centre  at St John's Island has been enlarged  and

its  facilities upgraded to take in a total number

of  600  inmates at a cost of $900,000. The female

section  of the Centre has been completed and  can

accommodate  120  female  addicts.  Now  that  the

Vietnamese  refugees have left, the  drug  addicts

are now back at the Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Government made available to the

Singapore  Anti-Narcotics  Association  a   former

police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



post  at  Rumah  Miskin to be used as  a  half-way

house.  This  half-way  house  will  be  used   as

temporary abode for drug addicts who are unable or

not  ready  to  go back to their home  environment

upon   discharge   from  the  Drug  Rehabilitation

Centre.   A   comprehensive   programme   covering

enforcement,     penalties,     treatment      and

rehabilitation  is being built up  to  combat  our

drug problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the shocking statistics the

Minister  has  just quoted prove  that  this  Bill

needs   to   be  passed.  However,  I  am   rather

surprised, in fact, shocked, that "this Bill  will

not  involve the Government in any extra financial

expenditure."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clause 4 makes statutory provision for the

appointment  of the Director of Central  Narcotics

Bureau  and  other officers of the  Bureau."  This

will  necessitate an increase in staff  to  ensure

that  this drug problem is solved. Certainly, with

the  present staff that the CNB has,  it  will  be

impossible for a solution to be arrived at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, "clause 11 extends the power of the

Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau  to  send

any   person   to  an  approved  institution   for

treatment    and   rehabilitation."   With    this

amendment,  the Director will most certainly  send

as many people as deserved to be rehabilitated and

treated  to the approved institutions.  This  will

cost money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore surprising that the Minister has

not  taken  this extra financial expenditure  into

consideration  to  ensure  that  this  problem  is

solved.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill

on  the  misuse of drugs where the maximum penalty

for this offence carries a death sentence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is being introduced at a very timely

and  apt moment when drug offences in the Republic

have increased greatly in the last few months.  It

has  become  a  common offence. If this  lucrative

business of drug trafficking is not nipped in  the

bud,  our  Republic  may be  accused  of  being  a

distribution centre of drugs in this region.  This

will affect the good name of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months there has been an increasing

number of unauthorised trafficking of drugs in the

Republic,  and  press reports  confirm  that  more

offenders have been brought' to book. One  way  of

stopping  this trade from spreading is  to  impose

the death sentence. This will give second thoughts

to anyone indulging in this unauthorised trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although I support this Bill, I would like

to  state  that a situation may arise where  as  a

result  of  surprise  checks by  officers  of  the

Narcotics  Bureau, innocent people  without  their

knowledge  may  he found in possession  of  drugs.

These  innocent victims may have been  fixed,  and

this  might  even cost them their  lives.  So  the

question  of  benefit  of  the  doubt  should   be

carefully considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite a few instances. Recently, I came

across  an article in the press that an apprentice

in  an  electronics firm was charged and convicted

to  a jail sentence for possession of heroin.  The

accused  was  also reported to have put  drops  of

heroin  in  his  fiancee's  bowl  of  mutton  soup

without her knowledge in order to get her sexually

aroused.  She  was  also nabbed by  the  narcotics

officers.   Fortunately,  during  the  trial   the

accused admitted that he had put the drug  in  her

bowl  of  soup  without  her  knowledge,  and  the

magistrate  therefore acquitted the girl.  If  the

accused had denied this fact, she could also  have

been jailed, though innocent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case involved a foreign architect who

was  fined  by a magistrate's court after  he  was

found  guilty of possession of drugs in his  flat.

He  denied that he had taken drugs or had  allowed

any  guest  to  do so in his flat because  of  his

status.  He claimed that social parties  had  been

held in his premises before it was raided and that

drugs  could  have been left there by his  guests,

some of whom had overstayed on different occasions

before he left Singapore for a short visit abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two cases leave room for doubt. The

accused  could  be guilty or innocent.  Therefore,

when  the death sentence is introduced, care  must

be  taken  to  see that innocent  people  are  not

convicted. Genuine drug pedlars could fix innocent

people   by  placing  drugs  in  their  possession

without  their  knowledge and  then  tip  off  the

Central  Narcotics  Bureau for  an  investigation.

Arid if a victim is unable to prove his innocence,

he is in for trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill for the sake of

discipline in the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the two hon. Members

for  supporting this Bill. First of  all,  let  me

assure  the Member for Anson that if a  person  is

innocent  and that he is being framed  by  someone

who  tries to fix him by putting controlled  drugs

in  his premises, he need not have any fear. There

will  first be a thorough investigation and if  he

is  found innocent he will not be prosecuted. Even

if  he  were prosecuted, there is the second line,

which  is the court. A court will not convict  any

person  if  it  has a reasonable  doubt  that  the

accused is not guilty of the offence charged. So I

can assure the Member for Anson that persons found

innocent will not be prosecuted and sentenced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir raised the point

that  in the explanatory statement to the Bill  it

is stated that "it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



will  not  involve  the Government  in  any  extra

financial  expenditure.'.' May I  explain  to  him

that the introduction of the Bill itself does  not

involve  any extra expenditure. It does  not  mean

that  the  Government will not have to  spend  any

money on employing more enforcement officers if we

want  to  step  up our enforcement action  against

traffickers.  Even  if  this  Bill  had  not  been

introduced,  if  we  want to increase  enforcement

action more enforcement officers will have  to  be

employed  and  the Government will have  to  spend

more  money. So he can be rest assured that  there

is no contradiction in the statement at the end of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill - [Mr Chua Sian Chin]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a formal drafting amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to seek

clarification here. I wonder whether this Bill has

been  thoroughly scrutinised during  its  drafting

stage.  I  notice that the Minister  has  filed  a

series   of   amendments  which   are   not   only

consequential but substantial in nature.  I  would

just like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



get  an assurance from the Minister that the  Bill

has been carefully considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bill of this nature which introduces the death

penalty   should,  in  the  first   instance,   be

carefully  thought out, planned, and drafted,  and

there should be no cause for subsequent amendments

as we do now have. Surely there was ample time for

all these subsequent amendments to be incorporated

in the draft Bill itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I shall explain the reasons for my

amendments. The Member for Punggol has jumped  the

gun  by  asking for clarification so soon after  I

have  moved the first amendment to clause 3.  Some

of  the  amendments are merely formal, as  in  the

case of this amendment to clause 3. The amendments

to  clause 5, however, are not formal, and I  will

explain the reason at the proper time. Apart  from

the formal amendments, the other amendments are to

make the provisions in the Bill very clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Punggol that since

the  Bill introduces the death penalty we have got

to  be  very clear about its provisions. For  this

very  reason  careful thought has  been  given  in

looking over the Bill and we would like to make it

still clearer. Hence, these amendments. So it does

not mean that no careful thought has been given to

the  Bill.  In fact, a great deal of  thought  has

been given to it. If the Member will bear with me,

I will explain the amendments as they are moved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a consequential amendment to be made:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, to leave out lines 21 to 26 inclusive

and insert-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) by deleting paragraph (b) thereof and

and substituting thereof the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine (heroin)

contained in any controlled drug; or".'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is necessary to make it clear

that  the quantities of morphine and heroin  which

are  specified for the presumption of  trafficking

in  section 15 of the Act relate to the quantities

of  these  substances contained in any  controlled

for  the  cultivation  of  cannabis,  opium,  coca

of  Drugs (Amendment) Bill, heavy penalties are to

be  imposed  for  those who are involved  in  drug

trafficking. This is rightly so. Therefore,  I  do

not  know  why the Minister is proposing to  leave

out the punishment provisions. For myself I do not

think  it should be deleted, otherwise it destroys

the  spirit of the entire Bill because the  person

who  cultivates  cannabis, opium,  coca  plant  is

indirectly  involved in drug trafficking.  And  as

the Hon. Minister has rightly pointed out, it will

undermine the moral fibre of our society, the very

structure  of  it.  This  will  help  destroy  our

society.  So I think if we are to leave out  these

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I would like to seek clarification from the

Hon.  Minister on the matter of administering  the

punishment  of  the rotan on those  convicted  for

drug trafficking. I would like to know whether the

number of strokes of the rotan are administered at

one  and the same time or are they meted out  over

different periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this question, Sir, because in a discussion

with  some hon. Members I got the impression  that

if  a  convicted person gets the rotan  punishment

all  at one time, then the impact is felt. But  if

the  punishment  is given over a period  of  time,

then  even  a penalty of 100 strokes of the  rotan

will not have any deterrent effect at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I explain that the strokes of the rotan

when  imposed  by  the court are  administered  in

Prison  under  the authority of  the  Director  of

Prisons,  under  the  Prison regulations.  Usually

they are administered at one session. But when the

strokes  are administered, a medical officer  will

be  there to decide whether or not there should be

any respite.

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, in my Budget Statement, I

announced two income tax changes affecting  earned

income relief and capital allowances for passenger

cars used for business purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8(a) now proposes to effect an increase in

the earned income relief from $1,000 to $2,000 and

$3,000  for  those  over  55  and  60  years   old

respectively.   This   concession,   Members   may

remember,  was  meant  as  an  incentive  for  our

skilled  and experienced people to go  on  working

beyond  their normal retirement age. It  was  made

also  in  recognition of the fact that  the  older

people  will  need  to spend  more  money  staying

healthy and getting to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 makes an amendment to section 19 which

will  limit  capital allowances to a  maximum  of$

15,000  for those passenger cars registered  after

3rd  March, 1975, and used for business  purposes.

There   will   also   be   several   consequential

amendments  to this proposed limiting  of  capital

allowances  in  order that it will not  be  easily

circumvented.  First,  for  those  passenger  cars

acquired on or before 3rd March, 1975, it is  also

proposed  to  limit  further  claims  for  capital

allowances to a maximum of $15,000. Next, for  tax

deduction  purposes, running expenses incurred  by

those cars costing over $15,000 will no longer  be

fully   deductible  but  will  be  proportionately

reduced by the method in clause 4(b). Third, where

deduction  is allowable for renewal or replacement

for  the  cost  of  replacing a car,  the  renewal

allowance  in  respect of each car shall  also  be

subject to a maximum of $15,000. Finally, under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



clause  6,  it is proposed to make adjustments  to

the  calculation of balancing charge or  balancing

allowance, which may arise on the sale or disposal

of  a  car,  in  the  light  of  limiting  capital

allowances to a maximum of $15,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, when I moved the motion on

the Civil List in Parliament, I mentioned that  as

from  FY  75, the President will be paid his  full

salary  of  $12,000  per mensem,  but  the  entire

amount will be subject to income tax. Clause  3(a)

will,  therefore, subject the President's official

emoluments to income tax from 1st April, 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also being taken under this

Bill to incorporate some other proposed amendments

which  are  part  of  the  continuing  process  to

improve   upon   and  tighten  up   the   existing

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3(b), it is proposed to provide for

the  alternative  of  a reduced  withholding  tax,

besides  the  present full exemption, on  interest

paid  to  lenders abroad for loans which are  used

for  the economic or technological development  of

Singapore.  In  practice, it has been  found  that

some  flexibility  in  the  tax  relief  would  be

useful. Certain foreign loans have merits,  though

not  enough  to  qualify for total exemption  from

tax.  At present, there is no alternative  but  to

subject such loans to the full 40% tax. It is felt

that in such cases a fairer treatment would be  to

grant a reduced tax rate if full exemption is  not

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tidy up an earlier amendment in 1973 whereby

deductions would not be allowed for life insurance

premiums paid to insurance companies which have no

office  or  branch in Singapore,  it  is  proposed

under  clause  8(b) to extend this same  principle

and  deny  deductions for life insurance  premiums

paid to foreign governments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries impose very heavy tax liabilities

on  profits  of  our  shipping and  air  transport

enterprises operating in them. In order to protect

our own interests and also to strengthen our hands

in  any  subsequent avoidance of  double  taxation

negotiations with the country concerned, we should

have  a provision to enable us to apply reciprocal

tax  treatment, that is, impose equally heavy  tax

liabilities  on the other country's  shipping  and

air  transport enterprises operating in Singapore.

Clauses 7 and 9 provide for these enabling powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of administrating the Act, the

Comptroller of Income Tax has been faced  with  an

omission regarding penalties. At present, the  Act

does   not  provide  for  specific  penalties   on

taxpayers  who  are  obliged,  on  behalf  of  the

Comptroller, to withhold tax on interest  paid  to

lenders  abroad and who subsequently do  not  hand

over the withheld tax money to the Comptroller  or

even inform the Comptroller about it. This is akin

to  criminal breach of trust and it is proposed to

make   this   serious  offence   punishable   with

penalties  similar  to those  applicable  for  tax

fraud,  that is, a penalty of three times the  tax

withheld,  a  fine  of  up  to  $10,000  and   the

possibility of imprisonment. Interest charges  are

also  proposed for any delay in handing  over  the

withheld  tax  money  to  the  Comptroller.  These

penalties are provided under Clause 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Income Tax

(Amendment No. 2) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to clause 8 of the Bill

which  amends section 39 of the principal  Act  by

increasing   the  earned  income  relief   of   an

individual who is 55 years or 60 years of  age  to

$2,000  and  $3,000 respectively. As mentioned  by

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Finance just now, the earned  income

relief  is  being increased so as to  make  it  an

incentive to these people to keep fit so as to  be

able  to continue working. In this respect,  would

not  the  Minister for Finance seriously  consider

giving  similar increased tax relief to those  who

are maintaining their aged parents? I believe that

a relief of $750 allowed for the maintenance of an

aged  parent  is insufficient. To  my  mind,  this

should  be increased in view of the fact that  the

Government  is  now encouraging young  couples  to

have   smaller  families  and  at  the  same  time

encouraging them to maintain their aged parents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, this is not a matter which comes within the

intention  of  this Bill, which is to  effect  the

changes  I  have announced in my Budget statement.

Maybe  this  could  be  one for  the  next  Budget

debate.  While  I do not make any  promises,  this

obviously  can  be  brought  up  again   on   that

particular day. In relation to this Bill which is,

as  I  have  explained, to bring into  effect  the

changes   announced  at  the  last  Budget,   this

particular   suggestion  may  not  be   quite   so

appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>STAMP (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Stamp (Amendment) Bill is to

rectify anomalies and improve administration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present title of the Act, the Stamp Act, is

somewhat of a misnomer. It could, for example,  be

mistaken  for an Act dealing with postage  stamps.

Clauses 2 and 3 accordingly propose to change  the

title  of  the  Act from the "Stamp  Act"  to  the

"Stamp Duties Act" to reflect more accurately  the

nature of the provisions of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, payment of consolidated stamp duty on

cheques by banks has to be made on 1st January and

1st   July.  In  practice,  this  requirement   is

difficult  to  comply  with  because  banks  close

accounts  at the end of the preceding  months  and

cannot  always be ready to pay duty on the 1st  of

the  following months. Clause 4 proposes to extend

the date of payment of consolidated stamp duty  on

cheques  issued by banks by 6 days. The new  dates

for  payment  of  duty  will,  therefore,  be  7th

January and 7th July in each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also aware of the inconvenience encountered

by   statutory   boards  in  paying   stamp   duty

individually on a large number of receipts  issued

by  them. Therefore, I propose, in clause 5 of the

Bill,  to  extend  the  facility  of  consolidated

payment of stamp duties to statutory boards. As in

the  case  of  banks, the dates  for  consolidated

payment of stamp duty by statutory boards will  be

7th January and 7th July in each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a conveyance or transfer on sale of

property  is  subject  to ad valorem  stamp  duty.

However,  it  is possible for arrangements  to  be

made  whereby this duty can be avoided. It  is  an

established   principle  that   the   stamp   duty

liability  of  a  conveyance or transfer  must  be

determined at the time when it is executed. Except

for  a  voluntary disposition, if at the  time  of

execution there is no sale, then the conveyance or

transfer is not a "conveyance or transfer on sale"

and  therefore  not subject to  ad  valorem  stamp

duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of successful avoidance of duty based

on the recognition of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



principle was in the case of William Cory  &  Sons

Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioner, United Kingdom,

where  an  option  agreement  was  made  for   the

purchase of shares and at the same time, transfers

were  made  "pursuant to the option  agreement  to

protect  purchasers' rights" but not to "pass  any

beneficial  interest  in the shares".  The  shares

were  held  in  trust for the  vendors  until  the

option  was subsequently exercised. In  this  way,

the transfers were not subject to ad valorem stamp

duty   because,   technically,   they   were   not

"conveyances or transfers on sale". In  Singapore,

under  a similar arrangement, the option agreement

would  attract  only a nominal stamp  duty  of  $1

while  the  transfers or conveyances  so  executed

would be stamped at $10 each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 proposes an amendment to close this

loophole  and  provide for payment of  ad  valorem

stamp   duty  on  an  option  agreement  involving

conveyance    or   transfer   of    property    in

contemplation of a sale. The ad valorem stamp duty

would  be  refunded if, not later  than  one  year

after  the  making or execution of such an  option

agreement,  the  option is not exercised  and  the

sale not completed. It also provides for refund of

excess  duty paid if, within this validity period,

the  sale  has  been completed for a consideration

lower  than the value on which duty has been  paid

in the first instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a fee of $25 is charged when any

instrument  is brought before the Commissioner  of

Stamps for his judgment as to whether any duty  is

chargeable on that instrument. However, it is felt

that an adjudication fee of $25 is too high, as in

many  cases  the duty payable may be only  $10  or

less. Clause 7 reduces the adjudication fees  from

$25  to  $10  for  any  instrument  not  involving

immovable  property.  Adjudication  fees  for  any

instrument



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



involving immovable property remain at $25.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act presently provides that all instruments

chargeable  with duty and executed by  any  person

shall  be  stamped before being executed. However,

in   the   past,  the  Ministry  of  Finance   had

administratively allowed share certificates to  be

stamped  within two weeks after execution  because

companies  encountered difficulties  in  complying

with   the   provision.  Clause  8  of  the   Bill

regularises  the  position and  also  extends  the

practice  of  stamping  within  two  weeks   after

execution, to marketable securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a step to promote the development of a money

market  in  Singapore,  stamp  duty  on  bills  of

exchange  was abolished in March 1972.  Clause  10

proposes to delete a number of references  in  the

Act to "bills of exchange".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments are either consequential

in  nature  or  are  meant to tidy  up  procedural

matters.

<div align="center"><b>INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will be aware that for some

time  now the Government has been considering  the

question of introducing an export credit insurance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



scheme  to  help our exporters compete in  foreign

markets.  I  am  glad  to inform  the  House  that

arrangements  have been finalised  for  an  export

credit  insurance  scheme  in  Singapore   to   be

operated  by  a corporation owned jointly  by  the

Government, banks and insurance companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some doubt as to whether such a

corporation is required to register as an  insurer

under   the  Insurance  Act  (Chapter  193).   The

Insurance   Act   does   not   explicitly   define

"insurance  business",  nor  does  it  allow   the

Insurance  Commissioner to exempt  any  particular

type of insurance business from the provisions  of

the Act. The Act merely divides insurance business

into life business and general business and treats

as  general business all insurance business  which

is not life business. This would imply, therefore,

that  export  credit insurance  is  deemed  to  be

general   insurance  for  the  purposes   of   the

Insurance Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, export credit insurance is strictly not

insurance  business as it is generally understood.

The  Bill  therefore seeks to amend the  Insurance

Act to make it clear that the corporation will not

be  required to be registered as an insurer  under

the Insurance Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend section 74 of the

Companies Act so as to confer on the Minister  the

power to exempt certain corporations intending  to

issue debentures in Singapore from the requirement

that they should appoint a trustee corporation  as

trustee  for  the debenture-holders. The  proposed

amendment  would allow the Minister the discretion

to  impose such terms and conditions as  he  deems

fit when granting such exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of a corporation for the purposes

of  the Companies Act includes any body corporate,

whether  domiciled  in Singapore  or  abroad.  The

requirements  of section 74 of the  Companies  Act

thus  extend  to  supranational organisations  and

government-owned companies which may wish to issue

debentures in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In international bond markets, the normal

practice  is for the borrower to appoint a  fiscal

agent  rather  than a trustee.  The  fiscal  agent

would  be responsible for the payments of interest

and  of  redemption proceeds to debenture-holders.

The more onerous requirement, under section 74  of

our Companies Act, of the appointment of a trustee

has discouraged a number of reputable borrowers of

the   highest   credit   standing   from   issuing

debentures in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further step in promoting the development of

an  international  bond  market  in  Singapore,  I

propose  to waive the requirement of a trustee  in

respect  of  debentures  issued  in  Singapore  by

reputable   borrowers,  especially   supranational

institutions. The proposed amendment to section 74

of  the  Companies Act would allow  me  to  impose

certain conditions before granting such waiver  in

cases  where  I  do not consider an  unconditional

waiver justified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, 1970, the Government approved the

broad   policy   of   metrication.   Since   then,

significant progress had been achieved. Except for

certain  technical departments, the public  sector

has  completely metricated. Conversions have  also

taken  place  in  industries.  For  example,   the

construction   and  engineering   industries   are

substantially metric. As for the retail trade, all

major  supermarkets  went metric  from  1st  July,

1974.  Pre-packed  goods  are  now  available   in

standard  metric sizes, textiles are sold  by  the

metre  and petrol dispensed by the litre.  Efforts

are  now being made to encourage housewives to use

metric  units  in  preparation  for  the  day   of

complete metrication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our efforts at metrication, the

Government has found it increasingly necessary  to

regulate  weighing and measuring instruments  used

in   trade.  As  a  further  measure  of  consumer

protection,  it has also been found  necessary  to

regulate  the  manner  in  which  certain   goods,

especially  those pre-packed, are to be  sold.  In

the  light  of  these efforts, it is necessary  to

amend   and  re-enact  the  present  Weights   and

Measures Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill firstly defines the units of

measurements  permitted  for  trade  purposes  and

authorises  the use of metric units  in  place  of

local  and imperial units of weights and  measures

in  areas  and places of trade as decided  by  the

Minister  in  charge.  Exceptions  are  made   for

transactions  in  medicinal  drugs  and   precious

metals  and  stones  where traditional  units  may

continue to apply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a measure of consumer protection, the Bill

requires weighing and measuring instruments used

for trade to be constructed of approved patterns,

specifications, material and principles of

construction to ensure their accuracy. To reduce

opportunity for cheating, the Bill requires

instruments used for trade to be tested by an

inspector of Weights and Measures and

manufacturers and repairers of weighing

instruments to be licensed. Further, shortweight

and misrepresentation of goods sold will be

regarded as an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further measure for consumer protection, the

Bill requires some goods to be sold by a

particular unit of measure, some by approved sizes

and pre-packed goods to show clearly the net

quantity of their contents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where insisted upon by customers, the Bill now

provides that retailers should sell in metric

units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>7.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House would have read the official

report of the Select Committee and the reasons for

the proposed amendments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the submissions received by the

Committee  generally  reflect  that  the  Bill  is

acceptable to those who have a vested interest  in

its  provisions  - those who deal  in  traditional

Chinese  medicinal preparations and those  dealing

in   western  type  medicinal  preparations.   The

representations made, as Members  will  note,  are

for  fear  that rules or regulations,  if  applied

rigidly,  will cause difficulty to the trade.  The

fear has also been expressed that the fees imposed

may be so high as to cause financial difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that the purpose of the

Bill   is   not   to   stifle   trade   by   rigid

implementation,  neither is  it  the  Government's

intention   to   increase  revenue   by   such   a

legislation.   Because   patent   or    ready-made

medicinal  preparations are easily available  from

shops  and  even sarabat stalls, it  is  necessary

that  the  consumer be protected by ensuring  that

the   contents   of  such  medicinal  preparations

conform  to  standards  of  safety,  efficacy  and

reliability,   particularly   when   many   patent

medicinal  preparations can be  bought  without  a

doctor's prescription.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection the World Health Assembly at

its last sitting has called upon member-states  to

participate  in  a certification  scheme  for  the

quality control of pharmaceutical products  moving

in  international commerce. My Ministry is  taking

action to participate in such a scheme as well  as

looking into applying the revised requirements for

good  practices  in  the manufacture  and  quality

control  of drugs as formulated in the  report  to

the   Director-General   of   the   World   Health

Organisation.  Such a practice on an international

approach  will  no  doubt ensure  that  those  who

manufacture  medicinal products for  international

trade  conform  with  international  standards  of

manufacturing, hire properly trained personnel and

meet  other  requirements, such as properly  built

premises  and  storage areas as well as  equipment

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



are of a reasonable standard that will ensure that

the consumer is given a fair deal. Conforming with

agreed  international standards locally will  mean

that  Singapore  manufactured  medicinal  products

will  be  able  to find international  outlets  as

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major amendment to the Bill is the inclusion

of  the  Minister for National Development as  the

Minister  who  will be responsible for  performing

functions   relevant   to   veterinary   medicinal

products. As a consequence the Director of Primary

Production  will be responsible for the  licensing

of  veterinary medicinal products. The powers that

are  conferred  upon  the  Minister  for  National

Development or the Director of Primary  Production

in  the Bill will complement powers that have been

vested  in them under the provision of the Animals

and  Birds Act. This, however, does not mean  that

my   Ministry   and  the  Ministry   of   National

Development will work separately, Where there  are

common  areas of interest the two Ministries  will

be  working together in close liaison. Section  73

of  the  Act empowers the Minister for  Health  to

establish  committees which will comprise  persons

who  will  be  invited  for their  expertise  they

possess.  Such  cooperation is necessary  so  that

veterinary medicinal products consumed by  animals

do  not  contaminate or cause adverse  effects  on

human  beings when they are slaughtered for  table

meat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other related consequential amendments in

addition to this major



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



amendment are the inclusion of the definitions  of

veterinary medicinal products, veterinary surgeon,

veterinary centre and veterinary biologics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to section 39 are necessary so as

to  restrict the use of the title "dispensary"  to

only pharmacists, doctors and veterinary surgeons,

in  other  words, persons who have  been  properly

trained  and  qualified. This is  to  prevent  the

abuse  of  the titles. This is also in  conformity

with the provisions of the Pharmacist Registration

Act which contains similar provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 74 has also been amended to include the

word  "storage  or supply" so that premises  other

than   pharmacies  which  sell,  supply  or  store

medicinal products can also be brought within  the

ambit of this Bill. As it stands, section 74  only

provides  for  the registration of premises  other

than  pharmacies but are used for the retail  sale

of medicinal products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
