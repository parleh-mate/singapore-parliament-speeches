<div align="center"><b>TACKLING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

economy  is in a severe slowdown.  Earlier this week,  George

Yeo  and  Dr Richard Hu announced the third quarter  economic

results.  Our economy contracted by 5.6% compared to  a  year

earlier.   In  annualised  quarter  to  quarter  terms,   the

contraction  was  9.9%.  The sustained contraction  over  the

last  three  quarters  is  the steepest  that  Singapore  has

experienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th July, the Government announced a package of

measures   worth  $2.2  billion  to  help  Singaporeans   and

businesses cope with the downturn.  BG George Yeo made  clear

in  his statement in Parliament that this was only an interim

package, as the direction of the economy and the severity  of

the  downturn  was  still uncertain.   The  Government  would

monitor  developments closely, and stood ready to do more  if

conditions worsened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that interim package, conditions have indeed

worsened.   This  was  happening even  before  the  terrorist

attacks of 11th September.  But the 11th September



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>



attacks  caused  major shocks to the US and economies  around

the world, both short- and long-term.  The situation is still

fluid,  and no one can be certain how events will  play  out.

The  US  is  in  all probability already in  recession.   For

Singapore  in  2002,  MTI's best  guess  at  this  moment  of

uncertainty  is  that  growth next year will  fall  somewhere

between -2% and +2%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 12 to 18 months, we can expect low growth,

more  retrenchments and higher unemployment.  Even as we cope

with  the  cyclical downturn, we will need to make structural

changes  in our economy to adapt ourselves to the permanently

altered   environment.   Externally  there  will  be  further

disruptions,  as  the  US and its coalition  partners  attack

terrorist   organisations  in  Afghanistan,   with   a   high

probability  of  the  terrorists  striking  back.   We   must

therefore  psychologically prepare ourselves for a protracted

period of difficulties.



Second Off-Budget Package



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will implement a major package of

measures  to  help  the economy to tide  over  the  downturn.

These measures fall into eight categories:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Tax and fee rebates and reductions;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Assistance to local enterprises;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Property market-related measures;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Acceleration of infrastructure projects;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Employment assistance for workers and executives;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Help for the lower income and unemployed;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) New Singapore Shares; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h) Measures related to wage costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures should help all Singaporeans, especially

the  lower  income earners and the unemployed.   They  should

also   help  businesses,  especially  the  small  and  medium

enterprises.  Let me elaborate on each of them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>



Tax and Fee Rebates and Reductions



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this category of measures is two-fold.

We  want  to encourage enterprise, because the way to recover

is  for  the  private sector to create new opportunities  and

generate more wealth.  We also want to reduce business costs,

so that businesses can stay afloat and minimise job losses.



Promoting a Conducive Environment for Enterprise



Corporate Tax Rebates



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will grant companies a rebate on their

corporate  income  tax payable for Year of  Assessment  2001.

The  rebate will be 50% on the first $25,500 of tax  payable,

and 5% for any subsequent tax payable beyond that.  This will

cost the Government $570 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Year of Assessment 2002, a corporate tax rebate of

5% will be granted.  This will cost $405 million.  This is on

top  of the lower corporate tax rate of 24.5% and the new tax

exemption regime announced in the Budget Statement this year,

which also takes effect from Year of Assessment 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These corporate tax rebates will not apply to Singapore

dividends,  nor  to  income earned by non-resident  companies

which is subject to a final withholding tax.

Personal Income Tax Rebate



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement this year, the Minister for

Finance  announced  a  10% personal  income  tax  rebate  for

resident individuals for Year of Assessment 2001 and a cut in

personal income tax rates with effect from Year of Assessment

2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For YA 2001, the Government will grant a further 5%

personal income tax rebate, at a cost of $250 million.   This

will bring the total personal income tax rebate for this year

to  15%, and result in total tax savings of $750 million  for

taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For YA 2002, the Government will grant a 10% tax rebate

at a cost of $400 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>



on top of the reduction in the personal income tax rates.



Reducing Business Costs



Increased  Property Tax Rebates for Commercial and Industrial

Properties



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The July package included a 25% property tax rebate for

commercial  and  industrial properties,  for  one  year  with

effect  from  1st  July 2001.  In view of the  poor  economic

outlook, we have decided to be more generous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the 25% rebate, the Government will give a

fixed  rebate of up to $8,000 per year to all commercial  and

industrial properties, plus a further rebate of 30%  for  any

balance property tax payable.  This will mean that many  SMEs

who  own their premises, including more than 90% of HDB  shop

owners, will pay no property tax.  The new rebate scheme will

take  effect from 1st July this year and end on 31st December

2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since property tax is payable in advance, owners who

have  already paid their tax for the second half of this year

will  receive  refunds from IRAS, or if they have  still  not

paid, IRAS may withdraw their pink slips.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total tax savings from this measure is $880 million.

JTC and HDB will pass on these savings to their tenants.  The

Government encourages other landlords to do so as well.



Reduction in Stamp Duty Rates



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also decided to reduce stamp duty

rates by 30% on all instruments.  The new rates will apply to

chargeable  instruments (basically relating to  property  and

share  transactions) executed on or after 13th  October,  and

expire  at  the  end  of 2002.  This will reduce  transaction

costs   for   businesses  and  individuals  who  enter   into

agreements  where stamp duty is payable.  It  will  cost  the

Government $290 million.



Reduction of Petrol Excise Duty and Diesel Tax



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petrol excise duty is currently pegged at 40% of

pump price, subject to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>



floor  rates  that vary for the different grades  of  petrol.

With  effect from tomorrow, 13th October, we will reduce  the

petrol  excise duty from 40% to 35%, and also cut  the  floor

rates  proportionately  by 5 to  6  cents  per  litre.   This

measure  will  be  in place until the end  of  2002,  and  be

subject to review after that.  The Government expects the oil

companies  to pass on the savings arising from the  reduction

of  excise  duty  fully  and  promptly  to  motorists.   This

reduction in petrol duty should save motorists $120 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxis today pay a Diesel Tax of $5,100 per year. Its

purpose  is to close the gap between the fuel cost of diesel-powered taxis and petrol-powered private motor cars, since no

duty  is  imposed  directly on the  sale  of  diesel,  unlike

petrol.   In  line  with the reduction in the  petrol  excise

duty, the Government will reduce the Diesel Tax for taxis  by

$400,  to $4,700.  Revenue loss is $8 million per year.   The

Government  expects taxi companies to pass on the savings  to

their taxi drivers by lowering the taxi rental rates.



Road Tax Rebates



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also give a one-time $100 road tax

rebate for cars, taxis, goods vehicles and buses, and a  one-time  $20  road  tax rebate for off-peak cars, weekend  cars,

motorcycles  and trailers.  These rebates will be implemented

on 1st January 2002 for one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue forgone is $59 million.



Landing Fee Rebate



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the airline industry is reeling from the effects

of  the 11th September terrorist attacks.  Airlines all  over

the  world have been badly affected in terms of passenger and

cargo loads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the current turmoil in the industry, CAAS

will  give  a  10%  rebate on landing fees  to  all  airlines

operating out of Changi and Seletar Airports.  This will take

effect  from 15th October 2001, and remain in place  for  one

year.  Thereafter, CAAS will review the situation again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reduction will cost CAAS $20 million.



Assistance to Local Enterprises



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to measures to help local enterprises.

Local  enterprises form a significant part  of  our  economy.

They   make  up  more  than  90%  of  the  total  number   of

establishments,  and  account for more  than  half  of  total

employment.  It is thus important that we help them  to  ease

the pain of the economic slowdown.



Improved Access to Funds



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key issue for local enterprises is access to funds.

The  Government  already has in place  the  Local  Enterprise

Finance   Scheme   (LEFS),  an  affordable,  fixed   interest

financing  programme designed to encourage and  assist  local

enterprises   to   upgrade,  strengthen  and   expand   their

operations.   The scheme is administered by the  Productivity

and  Standards Board (PSB) through 28 participating financial

institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will enhance the LEFS to allow local

enterprises to have easier access to funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to help SMEs reduce their interest expenses, the

Government  will reduce the interest rates for both  new  and

existing LEFS loans by up to 1 percentage point, depending on

the duration of the loan, for a one-year period starting from

1st  November  2001.  This will increase  the  interest  rate

subsidy from the Government by $38 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to help SMEs access funds as banks become

more  cautious in the downturn, the Government will  increase

its  share  of risk under the LEFS from 70% to  80%  for  new

loans, for one year, from 1st November 2001.  This will apply

to all types of LEFS loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the very small companies, a new micro-loan

programme under LEFS will be launched.  To kick it  off,  the

Government will increase the loan line by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>



$250  million over five years and, the interest  subsidy,  by

$14 million over five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Loan Insurance Scheme will also be launched to help

SMEs,  especially those who lack collateral or track  record,

to gain better access to loans.  $6 million will be set aside

to  pay  for the cost of insurance premium over a  period  of

five years.  This should be sufficient to insure $500 million

in loans.



Enhanced  Package  for  Hawkers  under  the  Hawker   Centres

Upgrading Programme (HUP)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has a Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme

(HUP)  to  upgrade  HDB,  JTC  and  ENV  hawker  centres   in

Singapore, and to help stallholders who are not doing well to

retire  from the business.  When a hawker centre is upgraded,

stallholders  who  qualify are given  the  option  either  to

operate  in  the upgraded centres, or to take ex-gratia  cash

grants  and  give up their trade.  If the centre is  selected

for  standard  upgrading, then first-generation  stallholders

who  are  62  or older, qualify for the cash grant.   If  the

centre is selected for re-configuration and re-building, then

all   first-generation  stallholders,  regardless   of   age,

qualify.  The cash grant for a market stallholder is $15,000,

and that for a cooked food stallholder is $19,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the cash grant option more attractive, we will

raise  the  ex-gratia payments from $15,000  to  $18,000  for

market  stallholders, and from $19,000 to $23,000 for  cooked

food stallholders.  Furthermore, we will relax the qualifying

criteria, to offer the grants to all first-generation hawkers

regardless of age, for all HUP programmes, whether the centre

undergoes  a  re-configure or re-build, or  just  a  standard

upgrade.  This will apply to all stallholders affected by the

HUP since 1st July 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will select 10 more hawker centres for

the  HUP,  in  addition to the 19 centres  already  selected.

These measures will help the less viable hawkers to exit, and

allow more enterprising ones



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>



to come in and make full use of the upgraded centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also implement other measures to

help  hawkers.  These include staggered increase in rent  for

those who are due to pay market rents, subsidised rental  for

hawkers  renting alternative stalls in another hawker  centre

during  the  period  when their own centres  are  closed  for

upgrading, a removal allowance for all stallholders who  wish

to return to the upgraded centres, and further rental rebates

for  stallholders paying market rentals in all hawker centres

from 1st November 2001 to 31st December 2002.

Land and Property-related Measures



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the external outlook uncertain and the economy in

recession,  the  property market has  been  in  decline.   No

Government  can guarantee to maintain property prices,  which

have  to vary with market conditions and the property  cycle.

However, in Singapore, the Government is a major supplier  of

land  for  property development.  The Government,  therefore,

should  try  to  phase  its land sales to  be  a  stabilising

influence on the property market, and avoid doing anything to

exacerbate an over-supply situation.

Government Land Sales Programme



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has reviewed its land sales programme for

2001 and 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For residential sites, there are currently two sites

where  tenders  have  been launched and will  close  in  end-October  2001.   The  Government  will  proceed  with   these

tenders.  Interested tenderers may have expended much  effort

in preparing their bids, and the Government should not change

the  rules  mid-stream.  We will award  the  tenders  if  the

respective reserve prices are met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government will withhold the launch of the

last   four  sites  in  the  Confirmed  List  of  the  2H2001

Government Land Sales Programme, originally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>



planned  for  release  later this  year.   Instead,  it  will

transfer these sites to the Reserve List.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2002, the Government will suspend the sale of

residential  and  commercial sites from the  Confirmed  List.

However,  sites will still be made available on  the  Reserve

List,  and interested parties can apply to the Government  to

release  them  for sale.  This will provide  flexibility,  in

case market conditions improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also defer all sale of industrial

land for the rest of 2001 and for 2002.  In addition, we will

extend  the  Project  Completion Period  for  all  Government

industrial  land  sale  projects.  Currently,  developers  of

industrial sites are granted Project Completion Periods of  8

or  10 years.  This will be extended by 2 years for land sale

sites already awarded, thus increasing the Project Completion

Periods to 10 or 12 years.

Anti-Speculative Measures on Property



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, at the peak of a property boom, the Government

introduced  anti-speculation  measures  to  cool   down   the

property   market.   These  proved  timely   and   effective.

Subsequently,  when conditions changed,  most  of  the  anti-speculation  measures were lifted.  However, a  few  measures

have  remained, notably the income tax on gains from sale  of

property  within three years of purchase, the restriction  on

non-citizens  borrowing  in  Singapore  dollars  to   finance

property  purchases, and the 80% limit on  bank  lending  for

mortgage loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of this comprehensive package, the Government

has reviewed these remaining anti-speculative measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, part of the gains from the sale of property

within  three years of purchase is subject to income  tax  at

the  individual  or corporate tax rates.  The Government  has

decided  to  remove income tax on gains from  such  sales  of

properties contracted on or after 13th October 2001.  In  the

present market, there may not be much gains from the sale  of

such  properties, but you never can tell;  it  may  lift  the

mood.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, each Permanent Resident is limited to one

Singapore  dollar loan to purchase a residential property  in

Singapore for owner-occupation.  Foreigners who are  not  PRs

and non-Singapore companies are not allowed to obtain housing

loans  in  Singapore  dollars.  These  restrictions  will  be

lifted  with immediate effect.  Over the last few years,  MAS

has  progressively  lifted restrictions on  Singapore  dollar

lending  to  foreigners which are not critical for  stability

reasons,  and  this restriction on Singapore  dollar  housing

loans is one of the few remaining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government has decided not to lift the 80%

loan-to-valuation   financing  limit  for   mortgage   loans.

Although  this  rule was introduced in a property  boom,  its

purpose  was  not only anti-speculative, but also prudential.

The requirement that the owner of the property puts up 20% of

the  value in cash ensures a sufficient level of owner equity

in  the property.  It lowers the risk of default, and reduces

the likely loss to the bank in case of a default and a forced

sale of the property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow banks to lend more than 80% of the

value  of  the  property, it would be necessary to  introduce

some  form of mortgage insurance for the portion of the  loan

exceeding 80% of the value.  However, such mortgage insurance

does  not  presently exist in Singapore, and we do  not  know

whether it is feasible.  MAS is studying the matter,  but  it

is  not  likely that we can introduce such mortgage insurance

soon.



Exemption of Property Tax for Land under Development



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, the Government allowed property tax exemption

for  land under development in view of the difficulties faced

by  the  property sector. This measure was withdrawn  in  the

Budget  Statement  of  2000 when the property  market  showed

signs of recovery and transaction volume picked up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure will be reinstated with immediate effect.

However, the property



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>



tax exemption will be given for a period of two years instead

of  five years.  Projects that start foundation works  on  or

after today will qualify for exemption from property tax from

the  date of commencement of foundation works until the  date

of   Temporary  Occupation  Permit  or  11th  October   2003,

whichever is earlier.  For projects that have already started

foundation  works, the period of exemption  will  start  from

today.   The Government will monitor the property market  and

economic   conditions  and  review  whether  to  extend   the

exemption  after two years.  The revenue loss is $70  million

per year.



Rental Rebates for Commercial and Industrial Tenants



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various Government agencies will also be extending

assistance to tenants of properties under their charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC, for example, will give a 50% reduction in

refurbishment  charge for upfront payment lessees.   It  will

also  reduce the required rental security deposits from three

to  two  months for tenants and TOL holders who make  payment

through  GIRO.   A further 10% rental rebate  will  be  given

across the board to all JTC tenants until December 2002, with

effect from November 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help tenants of HDB commercial and industrial

properties,  HDB  will  extend the existing  rental  rebates,

ranging  from  10%-30%, to December 2002.  HDB  will  give  a

further   10%  rental  rebate  to  all  HDB  commercial   and

industrial  tenants, from 1st November 2001 to 31st  December

2002.   In addition, for tenants whose rent is being adjusted

to  market rate, HDB will spread out the rental increase over

the remaining term of their tenancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will benefit 8,400 tenants of HDB

commercial  properties and 10,200 tenants of  HDB  industrial

properties.  They will cost the Government an estimated  $103

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Government agencies and statutory boards will also

be  extending rental rebates to their tenants.  They  include

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2277</b></font><br><br>



BCA, AVA, NParks, MPA, SLA (Singapore Land Authority) and the

Singapore Sports Council.



Acceleration of Infrastructure Projects



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the limitations of stimulating the economy

through  pump  priming.  However, it is still  worthwhile  to

bring  forward,  selectively, the building  of  economic  and

social  infrastructure.  This way, we will take advantage  of

lower prices, help the economy, create some jobs, and enhance

our long-term capabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government agencies have identified more than 100

infrastructure  projects  that  can  be  implemented  quickly

within  the next 18 months.  These include upgrading the  NUS

campus,  expanding NTU teaching facilities, and  constructing

new  polyclinics  and  hospitals, such  as  the  Jurong  West

Polyclinic and Simei Community Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, accelerating these projects will inject some

$3.5  billion into the economy, with $280 million coming  on-stream in FY2001, $1.1 billion in FY2002 and $2.1 billion  in

FY2003.



Employment Assistance for Workers and Executives



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to helping people find jobs. More

Singaporeans  are  being  retrenched,  and  those   who   are

unemployed are finding it harder to find new jobs.   This  is

both  because of the economic slowdown, and also  because  of

the  rapid  restructuring  of our  economy.   Many  more  are

anxious  that  they  too  may  lose  their  jobs,  and   find

themselves  in the same difficulty.  Older workers  face  the

most serious problem, because they find it harder to adapt to

new    jobs,    and   they   also   carry   heavier    family

responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important part of this package is, therefore, to help

these  retrenched and unemployed workers.  The main  approach

is  to  encourage  and  fund training  and  skills  upgrading

programmes.   These are critical for life-long employability,

and  are  the  real  antidote to unemployment.   Workers  and

executives with up-to-date



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>



skills have a better chance of finding good jobs, and a lower

risk  of redundancy.  Therefore, we must help as many workers

and executives as possible to upgrade quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC has set up a Taskforce on Employment, led by Mr

Heng  Chee  How, Deputy Secretary General of the NTUC.   This

Taskforce has recommended to the Government several  measures

to promote worker training and upgrading.  The Government has

accepted these recommendations and will give its full support

to the work of the Taskforce.



Expansion of People for Jobs Traineeship Programme



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taskforce has recommended that the Government expand

the People for Jobs Traineeship Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower introduced this as a pilot

programme  in June.  It is a vocational conversion  programme

for  older workers that seeks to help unemployed workers aged

40   and   above  to  make  career  transitions.    Companies

participating  in the programme set up traineeship/mentorship

arrangements  to help newly recruited older  workers  to  fit

into  their  new  jobs  and new work environment.   For  each

unemployed  older  worker  that  the  participating   company

successfully  places, the company receives 50%  wage  support

per month, up to a maximum of $600, for three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the experience gathered from the pilot

programme, there is keen interest from employers.  Presently,

60  companies are participating in the programme.  Many  more

companies have indicated that they will also come forward  if

more funding support is available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to extend the benefits of this programme beyond

lower  income  production workers,  to  skilled  workers  and

management  staff.  Unemployment among this group is  rising,

as  industries  consolidate  and restructure,  and  companies

streamline  operations to reduce layers of middle management.

We cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>



slow  down  this  restructuring, but we  can  and  will  help

affected workers to find new jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will expand the scale of the "People for

Jobs Traineeship Programme" significantly.  It will raise the

ceiling  on  the 50% wage support from $600 to $2,000,  which

will cover skilled workers and management staff.  If you earn

$4,000, then the scheme will cover half of your salary, which

is  $2,000, which is a significant proportion and  $4,000  is

enough to cover quite a number of people in the middle levels

-  skilled workers, junior executives, secretaries  -  people

who  are  having the most transition problems now.   We  will

also lengthen the period of support from three to six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced programme will run for one year, starting

from  1st November 2001.  $200 million will be set aside  for

this enhancement.  This will cater to some 20,000 traineeship

places.   Whether  all  the places  will  be  taken  up  will

eventually  depend  on the employers and  on  the  unemployed

workers.



Enhancement of Skills Redevelopment Programme



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC Taskforce has also recommended that the

Government enhance the Skills Redevelopment Programme to make

it  more  attractive for employers to hold  and  train  their

workers and for unemployed workers to upgrade their skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts this recommendation. Currently,

unemployed workers and workers on temporary layoff  attending

full-time   and  part-time  SRP  training  receive   training

allowances.   The  Government  will  increase  this  training

allowance. For those taking full-time courses, this allowance

will  increase from the current $600 per month to 75% of  the

last  drawn salary, or $1,000 per month, whichever is  lower.

Those   on  part-time  courses   will  have  their  allowance

increased from $3.80 to $5.70 per hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who send their workers for training receive

absentee payroll support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>



under  the SRP.  This will also be increased to either  $6.10

or  $6.90  per hour per worker, depending on the age  of  the

worker.  These enhancements to the SRP will be for one  year,

starting on 1st November 2001 and they will cost $41 million.

Increased SDF Funding Support



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement the improvements to the SRP, the

Government will increase funding support for training through

the Skills Development Fund (SDF).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the SDF supports 80% of the fees for

certifiable  skills  training  from  courses.  This  will  be

increased  to  90%, for one year starting from  1st  November

2001.   With  this increased support, the value of commitment

for  certifiable  courses is projected to  be  $200  million,

generating 210,000 training places for the one-year period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To signal its continued commitment to worker training,

the  Government  will  also make a  one-off  top-up  of  $500

million  to the SDF.  This is expected to support 1.9 million

training places in total over three years.  With the  top-up,

the  SDF  can  further  intensify  its  promotion  of  skills

upgrading,  particularly in certifiable  skills.  Efforts  in

continuing education and training will also be stepped up.

Matching Grant for NTUC Education and Training Fund



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC set up an Education and Training Fund (N-ETF)

in  October  1998.  Since then, the Fund has  supported  over

57,000  training  places, with nearly 20,000 training  places

supported in the year 2000 alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N-ETF is an endowment fund with $40 million,

comprising $10 million raised by the labour movement, and a 3-to-1  matching  grant  of $30 million  from  the  Government.

Earnings  from the Fund are used to support the  training  of

union  members  in  approved  courses.   The  Taskforce   has

proposed, and the Government has agreed, to inject a  further

$15 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>



into the N-ETF, on the same 3-to-1 matching basis.

Intensification of Employment Assistance Services



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the economic downturn and the larger numbers of

unemployed, there are still jobs which go unfilled because of

mismatches in expectations between employers and job seekers.

MOM  has organised many job fairs but often with discouraging

results.   We must strive harder to improve our job  matching

efforts  and  promote  available  job  opportunities  to  the

unemployed.   CareerLink, MOM's one-stop career centre,  will

be  beefed  up  to  meet the increased demand  of  unemployed

Singaporeans for job assistance.  In addition, the employment

assistance  services  of the distributed CareerLink  network,

consisting of the Community Development Councils (CDCs), self-help  groups,  NTUC  and  the  Singapore  Professionals'  and

Executives' Cooperative (SPEC) will be strengthened.



Foreign Worker Policy



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As job prospects have diminished, there have been more

calls  for  the  Government to limit the  inflow  of  foreign

workers in order to protect Singaporean jobs.  But this would

be  counterproductive.  It is a fallacy to imagine  that  the

economy  contains  a  fixed number  of  jobs  so  that  every

foreigner   takes  away  one  Singaporean's  job.    Properly

managed,  the admission of foreign workers actually helps  to

create  more  jobs  and  to protect some  existing  jobs  for

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of foreign workers is perhaps most sensitive

in  the  middle  levels of the job market,  ie,  the  skilled

workers  and  professionals.  This group of  foreign  workers

often  competes directly with Singaporeans who  have  similar

training and skills.  But our economy needs them, just as  it

needs  construction  workers, domestic  workers  and  factory

workers  at the lower end, and top-notch scientists, managers

and professionals at the top.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's approach to managing foreign workers

and foreign talent is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>



control tightly the lower end of the skills spectrum, and  to

relax  the  restrictions  progressively  for  higher  skilled

workers and professionals.  This approach is sound.  In  this

downturn,   we   should  not  turn  foreign   workers   away,

particularly  skilled  workers.  That  would  hurt  ourselves

directly.  It  would also damage our reputation  as  an  open

society which welcomes talent from around the world, which we

have taken many years to build up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can and should do instead is to judiciously

tighten the criteria for skilled workers and professionals so

that  we  raise the quality of the foreign workers  who  come

here  to  help  Singapore compete for global investments  and

ensure  that  the  quality of foreign  manpower  admitted  to

Singapore   is   compatible  with  our  level   of   economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the decade since 1990, the skills and educational

profiles  of  the local workforce have improved tremendously.

The  profile of foreign manpower admitted should  not  retard

the  improvement  of  our workforce  profile.   Instead,  the

foreign  worker profile should be compatible with the  rising

need of industries for more skilled workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, criteria for employment passes. Foreigners with

acceptable degrees, professional qualifications or specialist

skills generally work in Singapore on employment passes.  The

Government  will raise the minimum salary to qualify  for  an

employment  pass from $2,000 to $2,500 with effect  from  1st

December  2001.   $2,500  will  be  comparable  with  current

starting salaries of local graduates.  This higher salary cut-off  will  apply  to  new employment pass  applications,  and

employment pass holders who change employers on or after  1st

December  2001.   Those who continue to work  with  the  same

employer  will  be  allowed to renew their employment  passes

generally unless there are some other reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, criteria for work permits which attract low

foreign worker levy.  We have a two-tier levy system for work

permits  - a higher levy for unskilled workers, and  a  lower

levy  for  those  who  are  better qualified.   Hitherto,  to

qualify for a low levy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>



work  permit,  a  person  needed NTC-3 (practical)  technical

qualifications,  or  other  academic  qualifications   deemed

acceptable.  Currently, more than half of work permit holders

are  on  low levy, but a large proportion have low  education

qualifications.  We will be raising the qualifying  standards

for  low  levy work permit holders to ensure that  a  greater

proportion  of them have at least completed secondary  school

education or possess NTC-3 (practical) qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the change in the salary criterion for

employment pass holders, the new criteria for low  levy  work

permits will be effected for new work permit applications, or

those who change employers on or after 1st December 2001.



Helping the Lower Income and Unemployed



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the economic measures above, the

Government  will  extend  a  helping  hand  to  lower  income

households,  or  those who have lost their  jobs.   They  are

hardest  hit, and they need assistance the most to tide  over

this difficult period.



Freeze in Undergraduate and Polytechnic Tuition Fees



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help students whose families are affected by the

slowdown, the Academic Year 2002 tuition fees for polytechnic

and  undergraduate  courses,  including  medical  and  dental

courses, will be frozen at the existing levels.  The Ministry

of  Education will review the fees for Academic Year 2003  in

the  second  half  of 2002.  The total revenue  loss  to  the

Government is $16 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many graduates are finding it difficult to get a job

after  graduation, and so face difficulty in  repaying  their

tuition fee loans and study loans.  Foreign students who took

up tuition grants with a three-year bond to work in Singapore

find  that  they cannot fulfil their obligations not  because

they do not want to, but because the job market has shrunk.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to suspend for one

year, repayment of tuition fee loans and study loans for  all

university  and polytechnic graduates from 1st November  2001

to 31st October 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Singaporean graduates of our universities and

polytechnics who had received tuition grants are required  to

serve  a  three-year employment bond in Singapore.   We  will

allow them to suspend this bond for one year if they fail  to

find  a  job upon graduation or lose their present job during

their  three-year  bond period.  After the  suspension,  they

will be required to serve out the rest of their bond period.



Easing Cash Flow of New HDB Flat Buyers



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that new HDB flat buyers may

have  cash  flow problems during this downturn.   To  address

this  problem,  HDB  will  extend its  Staggered  Downpayment

Scheme  to all first-time flat applicants from November  2001

to   December  2002.   Under  the  scheme,  first-time   flat

applicants can pay for the 20% downpayment in two stages, 10%

at  the  signing of Sales Agreement and another  10%  at  the

collection  of  keys, which could be two  years  later.   The

estimated loss in interest is $10.5 million for 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will also provide a contra-facility to lessees who

have  submitted resale applications for their existing  flats

and  are  buying new HDB flats that are completed or  nearing

completion.  This will enable them to use their cash and  CPF

proceeds  from the sale of their existing flats  to  purchase

the new HDB flats.



Financial Assistance for HDB Mortgages



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has earlier put in place financial

assistance  measures for HDB flat lessees  with  difficulties

serving  their  mortgage  loans as a  result  of  wage  cuts,

retrenchment or business failure.  The measures  include  the

Reduced  Repayment  Scheme,  deferment  of  monthly  mortgage

payment for six to 12 months, and extension of loan repayment

period.  These measures will continue to help HDB lessees.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>



Utilities Bills



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporean households are concerned about high

utilities   bills,   especially   electricity   bills.    The

Government is mindful of their concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World oil prices have recently been falling. This has

enabled Power Supply to reduce electricity tariffs by 4% with

effect  from  1st November 2001.  On top of  this,  from  1st

January  2002,  the Energy Market Authority will  reduce  the

price  cap  for  the large generation companies.   This  will

moderate their market power, and we can then expect tariff to

fall  further  by  about 6%, assuming oil  prices  remain  at

current  levels.   This translates to $270 million  worth  of

savings in electricity bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in this year's Budget, the Government gave

rebates on utilities bills as part of a new "Utilities  Save"

scheme,  designed to help the lower income.  The rebates  are

$350  for  households living in 1- to 3-room HDB flats,  $300

for  those  in  4-room flats, and $250 for  those  in  5-room

flats.   The  Government will now extend the  Utilities  Save

scheme  for another year, until April 2003.  This  will  cost

$226 million.



Extension of Service and Conservancy Rebates



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Government has been extending

Service  and  Conservancy  (S&C) rebates  for  HDB  1-5  room

households.   These rebates are graduated according  to  flat

size  to  help  the lower income households.  The  Government

will  now extend the S&C rebates for another year.  This will

cost $100 million.



HDB Rental Assistance



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are 37,000 low-income households living

in HDB rental flats.  These households currently enjoy rental

assistance depending on the size of the rented flat.   1-room

flat  tenants enjoy rental rebates of $12 per month and a  4-month  rent free period.  2-room tenants enjoy rental rebates

of $8 per month and a 2-month rent free period.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rental assistance was announced in this year's

Budget,  and  expires  in March 2002.   The  Government  will

extend  the existing rent-free period and rental rebates  for

one more financial year, to 31st March 2003, at a cost of  $8

million.



Enhancement  of  the Rental and Utilities  Assistance  Scheme

(RUAS)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development and Sports

administers  the  Rental and Utilities Assistance  Scheme  to

help   families  in  rental  HDB  flats  who  need  temporary

financial aid in their payments for rent, utilities,  service

and  conservancy charges.  The assistance is for six  months,

to be reviewed thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will raise the subsidy amounts and the

income eligibility criteria of this Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, MCDS will extend temporary financial

assistance   to  lower-income  HDB  flat  owners   who   face

difficulty  paying  utilities and maintenance  charges.   The

assistance will be for three months in the first instance, to

be reviewed further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These temporary financial assistance measures will cost

$5 million.



Hospitalisation Fee Assistance Scheme



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have comprehensive arrangements to help

Singaporeans  meet  their  medical costs,  through  MediSave,

MediShield and Medifund.  Nevertheless, many Singaporeans are

still  concerned  that they will fall ill  and  need  to  pay

substantial  medical bills during the economic downturn.   To

ease their worries, the Government will give a 10% rebate  on

all  class  B2  and C hospital bills, and on  subsidised  day

surgery,  to citizens and their immediate family members.   A

similar rebate scheme was implemented in 1999.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government will give more fee

assistance  to  patients  whose  family  circumstances   have

changed.   Retrenched Singapore citizens and their  immediate

family members can apply for additional help to cover another

40% of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>



their  bills.   This would apply to the families of  citizens

who have been retrenched on or after 1st January 2000.  Thus,

together  with  the  10%  rebate,  retrenched  citizens  will

effectively  enjoy  a 50% reduction in their  hospitalisation

bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fee assistance scheme will be implemented from 1st

November 2001.



Economic Downturn Relief Scheme



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all the above measures, some Singaporeans may

still  face  financial difficulties, because they  have  lost

their  jobs, or because of family circumstances.   We  should

take a targeted approach at helping unemployed and retrenched

Singaporeans.  This is far more discriminating and  sensitive

than across-the-board unemployment dole or welfare, which not

only  is  a  heavy  burden  on  the  State,  but  can  easily

discourage  people from seeking new jobs, thus worsening  the

unemployment problem that it hopes to alleviate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce a new initiative, the

Economic  Downturn Relief Scheme (EDRS).  Under this  Scheme,

Citizens'  Consultative  Committees (CCCs)  will  help  needy

Singaporeans to meet essential expenses, such as school fees,

school transport and food.  The CCCs may, after investigating

the  cases,  provide up to $200 per month of  assistance  for

three months, to be reviewed thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDRS would be helpful to families whose breadwinner

has  been  retrenched, or whose breadwinner has  fallen  ill.

However,  I  should  stress that the  assistance  is  not  an

automatic entitlement.  The CCCs will investigate each  case,

and  decide whether the applicant merits assistance  and,  if

so, how much and for how long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set aside $20 million for the

Scheme.  The CCCs can apply for funding from this sum,  based

on  their needs.  Disbursement to the CCCs will be supervised

by  an  EDRS  Committee, to be chaired by Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen,

Senior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>



Parliamentary  Secretary in the Prime Minister's  Office  and

Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme will be implemented with effect from 1st

November 2001, and run for one year.



New Singapore Shares



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Singapore Shares scheme is a new initiative to

give   Singaporeans  a  share  in  our  future   growth   and

prosperity.  The distribution is specially weighted in favour

of less well-off Singaporeans to help them during the current

downturn.   The Prime Minister had announced this  scheme  at

the National Day Rally in August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give New Singapore Shares to

citizens  on 1st November 2001.  Everyone receiving  the  CPF

Top-up  will  automatically also receive  the  New  Singapore

Shares.  Adult Singaporeans not receiving the CPF Top-up  can

also  receive the New Singapore Shares on 1st November  2001,

provided  they contribute at least $50 to their CPF  accounts

between  1st  January this year and 15th  October  2001,  ie,

Monday.   We  will  make special arrangements  to  issue  New

Singapore Shares to Singaporeans who miss this deadline,  but

contribute $50 to their CPF accounts by the end of the  year.

This $50 contribution is not a co-payment for the shares, but

a  way to ensure that the shares are not given to dormant  or

"dead"  CPF  accounts.   The New Singapore Shares  themselves

will be distributed free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Singapore Shares will be worth $1 per share.

The  shares  will earn annual dividends for five years,  from

2002 to 2007.  The dividend rate will be a guaranteed minimum

of  3% per annum.  In addition, bonus dividends equal to  the

real GDP growth rate of the preceding year (provided that  it

is above zero) will be declared annually.  The dividends will

be in the form of bonus shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shares will not be transferable or tradable.

However,  citizens  can cash them in with the  Government  at

face  value,  for $1 per share.  In the first 12 months,  ie,

before  1st  November 2002, citizens may cash in up  to  half

their shares.  After that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>



citizens can cash in their shares at any time without  limit.

Citizens  who keep their New Singapore Shares until  maturity

will  earn  the maximum amount of dividends.   On  1st  March

2007, the shares will mature.  The Government will redeem  in

cash all shares still outstanding at $1 per share.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each qualifying citizen will receive a basic allocation

of  shares,  the  number to depend on his  income  level  and

housing  type.  In addition, two groups of Singaporeans  will

receive  bonus shares  on top of their basic allocation,  and

these are the elderly and the NSmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost of the New Singapore Shares scheme is

$2.7 billion.   The Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, will

provide full details of the scheme on 16th October 2001,  ie,

on Tuesday, including who will get how much.



Measures Related to Wage Costs



NWC Recommendations



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC, in its recommendations in May, noted that with

the  economic  slowdown in the US and regional uncertainties,

Singapore  should take a cautious approach in  managing  wage

costs, and that wage increases this year should be lower than

the  wage  increases  last year.  It divided  companies  into

three  groups:  group (A) companies which are profitable  and

performing well;  group (B) companies which are making  lower

profits  and  facing  uncertain  prospects;  and  group   (C)

companies  which are incurring losses and performing  poorly.

For  the  last  group,  group (C), the NWC  recommended  wage

freeze or appropriate cost reduction measures, including wage

cuts through the variable component.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With conditions much bleaker now than in May, the

cautious  approach  recommended by  the  NWC  is  now  doubly

justified.   The NWC's specific recommendations for  each  of

groups  A, B and C companies remain appropriate, but now  far

more  companies are likely to fall into group B and group  C.

Therefore,  overall,  economy-wide,  we  should  expect  wage

settlements to be restrained or, in many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>



cases, frozen.  Workers should be prepared for lower bonuses,

wage cuts through the variable component or, at best, minimal

wage increases.



Annual  Variable  Component (AVC) and Non-Pensionable  Annual

Allowance (NPAA)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil service salaries have included an annual variable

component  since 1988, with payments made in the  middle  and

end  of  the year.  Last year, the annual variable  component

was 1 3/4 months  -   3/4 month paid out in July and one month

paid out in December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the civil service paid 3/4 month of AVC in

July.  In view of the current conditions, the Government  has

decided  that  there  will not be any year-end  AVC  payment.

However,  for  Division II, III and IV civil  servants  whose

salaries  are lower, the Government will make a special  one-time payment of 1/4 month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government will pay the 13th month Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance (NPAA) for all civil servants as

usual in December.



Salaries  of  Political Appointment Holders and Senior  Civil

Servants



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To send a clear signal that this is a grave situation,

and that the Government is taking the lead in wage restraint,

political  appointment  holders and  senior  civil  servants,

whose   salaries  are  tied  to  the  private  sector  salary

benchmarks, will have their monthly salaries cut by 10%  from

1st  November  2001 for 12 months.  All other adjustments  to

their  salaries  will  be  frozen during  this  period.   The

allowances  of  MPs  and  NMPs,  which  are  pegged  to   the

Superscale benchmark, will also be cut by 10%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the annual salaries of

political  appointment  holders and  senior  public  officers

contain  a GDP Bonus component that is directly tied  to  the

performance  of the economy.  With negative GDP  growth  this

year,   the   annual  salaries  of  Ministers  will   already

automatically be reduced by two months, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>



7.3%.  The 10% cut in monthly pay is on top of this.

CPF



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This package does not contain any cut in employer CPF

contributions.   The  Government has  decided  against  this,

because  employer CPF contribution rates were  only  recently

cut  in  1999, and then partially restored in 2000 and  2001.

The  CPF  is  meant for the retirement needs of members,  and

should  only be cut as a last resort.  It is not designed  as

an instrument for fine tuning wage costs from year to year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot guarantee that we will not need to

cut  CPF  contribution rates at some point  in  this  crisis.

After  11th  September,  we are in a totally  new  situation.

While we address the immediate problems through this package,

the  Government  will also be reassessing more  fundamentally

all  our economic strategies.  This will take several months.

We  cannot  rule out beforehand any options which may  become

necessary  for  us  to restore the basis of  our  growth  and

prosperity.



Conclusion



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a substantial package. Its

total  size  is $11.3 billion, equivalent to 7%  of  GDP.   A

summary  of  the  measures and the costs are in  the  handout

which  I  will  now ask the Clerk to circulate.   [Copies  of

handout*  (Cols.  2411-2416)  circulated  to  hon.  Members.]

Ministries will be providing further details of the  measures

under their charge in the week ahead.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2001/20011012/20011012-HA-0732411.htm">Table - Summary of Measures (Cols. 2411 - 2416)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 2001, the package will result in a Government

budget deficit of $4 billion.  For FY 2002, MOF's preliminary

estimate  is  that the package may result  in  a  deficit  of

approximately $1 billion.  A lot depends on the  growth  rate

for next year.  However, this Government has accumulated more

than enough surpluses since it took office in 1997 to finance

the entire package.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General elections must be called at the latest by August

2002.   After the elections, the reserves accumulated by  the

present  Government will be locked away.  The new  Government

will not have access to these surpluses. In this eventuality,

the   new  Government  will  have  to  seek  the  President's

permission  to draw down on protected reserves  to  fund  the

package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This package will help Singaporeans and businesses to

tide  over  the  downturn.  But large as  it  is,  it  cannot

restore  by itself our economy to steady growth.   We  cannot

spend  our  way to prosperity.  To grow we have  to  generate

wealth,  which  means producing and exporting, earning  wages

and  making  profits.   And that will depend  on  the  global

economy  and  foreign  markets, because  our  economy  is  so

heavily   reliant  on  external  demand.   Domestic   exports

amounted  to 85% of our GDP in 2000.  So our growth can  only

pick  up  again when external conditions improve.  Meanwhile,

we  must build up our capabilities and prepare to ride on the

recovery when it comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be resolute and resourceful to ride out the

current difficulties.  In the early years of independence,  a

previous  generation faced crises far graver than  this  one.

Yet they prevailed through sheer grit and determination.  The

people  backed their leaders and together they worked through

tough  policies on to success.  In that battle for  survival,

people  and leaders forged strong bonds of mutual  trust  and

confidence.   As a result, they were able, in one generation,

to raise Singapore from the Third to the First World.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tackle this crisis, we have more resources: a larger

economy  and stronger capabilities in the public and  private

sectors, plus a deeper sense of nationhood.  This downturn is

a  major  test for us, for all Singaporeans.  We will  tackle

the  immediate  problems.  We can remake Singapore  and  stay

relevant  in a changed world.  We will secure our future  and

make life better for all Singaporeans.  [Applause.]

<div align="center"><b>TACKLING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN</b></div>



<br>1.37 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for allowing me to join and take the lead in  this

debate, and put forth my views on the economic rescue package

just announced by the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very heartened to note that the package is

indeed  very wide-ranging, very well thought through and,  of

course,  very substantial, amounting to $11.3 billion.   This

is  in  addition  to  the $2.2 billion announced  previously.

However,  there  are so many measures and so many  incentives

being  announced  that I also cannot keep track  when  I  was

taking down the notes.  But allow me to make a few comments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I intentionally called this the "economic rescue

package" because our economy indeed needs rescuing.   As  the

DPM   has   said,  we  are  in  the  worst  recession   since

Independence.   In  1964 we suffered  a  4.3%  drop  in  GDP,

whereas  in  1985  we  only saw 1.6% drop,  and  now  we  are

expecting perhaps a -3% for year 2001.  But for the  rest  of

2001  and  the year 2002, the outlook still looks  uncertain.

Under  this  scenario,  the people and  local  companies  are

extremely  concerned.  In this cold raging storm which  would

last  into next year, or perhaps longer, the economic  rescue

package  is warmly welcomed by all.  The feeling is like  the

Chinese saying, "xue zhong song tan", which means, in a snowy

storm  you  get warm coal, and this warms the hearts  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to make some quick comments

and views on the various measures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the economic package of $11.3 billion, I feel, is

indeed very large.  In fact, in comparison, we know that  the

USA  has  announced  an economic stimulus  package  of  about

US$100 million, which is about S$180 million.  Malaysia  also

announced  a RM4.3 billion ringgit rescue package,  which  is

about  S$2 billion, and Hong Kong recently announced a  HK$15

billion  rescue  package, which is about only S$3.5  billion.

So,  in  contrast, I would like to say that it works out,  in

comparison,  on  a  population basis, in the  US  the  rescue

package amounted to about $640 per person; in Malaysia, it is

only about $90 per person; in Hong Kong, it is about $500 per

person;  and  for  Singapore's package of $11.3  billion,  it

comes  out  to about $3,500 per person (based on a population

of about 3.2 million Singaporeans and residents).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this package, indeed, is quite substantial. In fact,

the  Hong  Kong package, in contrast, after its announcement,

had been criticised by their locals as being insufficient and

would  not  help the economy.  This Singapore package,  as  I

said,  is very sizeable and should satisfy most expectations.

The  press  has  actually speculated that  the  package  will

amount to only $8-$10 billion.  So this $11.3 billion is even

higher  than  most  expectations, in  contrast  to  the  1998

package, which was $10.5 billion.  But in that package, about

$7.5  billion  was from CPF cuts.  So the actual contribution

from  Government was only $3 billion.  Therefore, in contrast

to  this  $11.3 billion rescue package, as announced  by  the

DPM, it is over three times the 1998 package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, I would like to call this economic

package  bold  and meaningful.  Bold because it  is  sizeable

enough to make an impact; meaningful because the measures are

thought out to be targeted at several specific sectors of the

economy  and  people who are most affected by the  recession.

These  are  the poorer families and unemployed, and  also  to

help  local companies so that they can survive the  downturn.

And  if local companies survive, in turn, they would help  to

sustain employment and preserve jobs for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first comment on the Singapore Shares is that the

concept of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>



Shares,  originally  suggested by the Prime  Minister  during

this   year's   National  Day  Rally,  is  innovative.    The

Government has means to pay out the huge sum of $2.7  billion

because  of  the accumulation of surpluses from this  current

Government.   The concept of Singapore Shares is  a  form  of

wealth  sharing and wealth redistribution, and is appropriate

and justifiable.  In good times, we save; in difficult times,

we  take out the savings to help the people, especially those

who  are  less  well-off and less privileged.   Therefore,  I

agree  with the principle of the Government to give  more  of

the  Singapore Shares to the lower income group.  Taking  the

amount of $2.7 billion, if we take a base population of about

2  million working adults and senior citizens, it would  come

to  about $1,350 per person over five years.  For a family of

two  adults of husband and wife, this would be about  $2,700,

which  is  quite a substantial and meaningful sum, especially

for  lower income families who will get more than this $2,700

per  family.   I  hope  that, of course, the  Government  can

continue  to  do well, accumulate more reserves  and  in  the

future, perhaps give us more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister a

clarification.   He said in his speech that for  the  current

$11.3  billion  package, there are sufficient  funds  in  the

current Government's reserves.  For next year, assuming after

the  election  which is definitely due by August  next  year,

there  may  be  a  need for the Government  to  call  on  the

reserves  because the new Government may not  have  reserves.

So  could  he clarify whether this present package  of  $11.3

billion is already accounted for and there is no need to  dig

into the reserves?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to divide my comments on the various

measures  into two groups: (1) measures to help  individuals;

and (2) measures to help local companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, measures to help individuals. On the intention

not  to have CPF cuts, I agree fully with the Government that

there  should be no further cuts in the CPF at this juncture.

Anyway, CPF cut is a very blunt instrument.  At present,  the

employer's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>



CPF  remains at 16%.  There is already a 4% of CPF yet to  be

restored.   Any  further cut in the CPF would mean  that  the

effective household income of Singaporeans is reduced.   Many

Singaporeans use their CPF to pay for housing loans.   Hence,

should  the CPF be cut, they will have to take out  of  their

own  disposable  household income to  service  their  housing

loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other substantial measures announced by the

Deputy Prime Minister, such as the additional tax rebates for

individuals, this again is most welcomed.  The lower  tax  to

be  paid by the people would mean that people would have more

money  to cover for household expenditure, schooling expenses

and  other  expenses that may need to be paid.   The  rebates

could  assist  in  some  form  of  stimulating  the  consumer

spending  which will have a beneficial ripple effect  on  the

retail sector, eating establishments and the overall domestic

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on measures to help companies, I am also in support

and  pleased  to  hear  about the  several  schemes  to  help

companies,  which  include enhanced LEFS, higher  SDF  rates,

lower  transport costs, reduction of stamp duties and various

other  measures.   I  would like to particularly  praise  the

scheme  which  is to gather $500 million of loans  to  assist

local   companies,  because  this  is  the  time  when  local

companies   do   need  help  in  terms  of  financing   their

operations.  As their revenue drops, they may find that  they

do  have a shortfall of earnings to cover their expenses.   I

do like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister that in implementing

the  disbursements of the loans, consideration  be  given  to

factors  that are not just, say, liberal but at least  easily

accessible for companies that are still viable and would need

the  loan  to  sustain their businesses.  Otherwise,  if  the

money is there, with $500 million, and the loan is hard to be

obtained  for  local companies, then it does  not  serve  any

purpose at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other measures to introduce pump priming

measures,   I   support   the  proposal   to   identify   100

infrastructure projects, such as upgrading the NUS



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>



campus,  constructing new polytechnics and various  projects,

to   be  accelerated.   However,  we  are  aware  that   such

infrastructure  projects have leakages of  income  mostly  to

foreign   sources.   Therefore,  besides  pump   priming   of

infrastructure projects, I would like to urge the  Government

to  also  consider  including in the pump priming  programme,

other  non-physical works.  These are in the  areas  of  soft

services, such as works to be issued by the Government for IT

and  software  development,  consultancy  contracts,  process

improvements, product development and R&D projects.   If  the

Government  can  push up more generously  these  non-physical

projects,   then  local  companies  can  also  benefit   more

directly.  The development of intellectual and human  capital

from  these  projects would be more enduring and have  longer

impact on promoting Singapore as a knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on some suggestions that the DPM may not have

covered  in his announcement.  First, I would like to suggest

allowing, on a very stringent and specific basis, families to

draw  on  their CPF in case they are really in dire  need  of

financial  support.   During this  very  difficult  financial

crisis, many people will lose their jobs and encounter severe

financial difficulties, especially those with young  families

and  children to support.  I would like to suggest that,  for

those  who  are severely affected and they have  run  out  of

savings and all other means of supporting themselves and  the

family,  they  should  be  allowed to  draw  upon  their  CPF

savings.   If the Government is concerned about flagrant  and

wanton  demands by certain people to spend their CPF savings,

which are actually meant for old age, the Government can  set

up  rules  to  limit  the withdrawals.   Withdrawals  can  be

limited  to only the Special Account, for example.   I  would

also  like to urge the Government to consider this suggestion

seriously  and,  perhaps allowing it on a stringent  case-by-case  basis,  and  also  with the support  of  the  Citizens'

Consultative  Committee  (CCC).  The constituency's  CCC  can

conduct  visits - they know the ground, they know the  people

well - they can investigate the financial status of each



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>



applicant and they can only give their support or endorsement

when they are persuaded that these families require financial

assistance and therefore can be allowed to draw on their  own

CPF savings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the need to urge our banks, both local and foreign

banks,  to  continue  to support our companies.   During  the

recession,  many  local companies will find  difficulties  in

cash-flow  management and making sufficient income  to  cover

overheads  and  pay the staff payroll.  Adding  to  the  woes

would  be  the  bankers calling at the doors  to  repay  bank

loans, or insist on accelerated repayments of principals,  or

even  payment  of higher interest rates, or to  provide  more

security cover, collaterals, or top up with cash.  Although I

agree that, in principle, we should not tell the banks how to

run  their  business, but there is reason for the authorities

to request the banks not to be overly panicky or being overly

predatory.   They commonly say that bankers are fair  weather

friends.   In  good times, they lend you plenty of  umbrellas

when the sun is shining.  But at the first sign of rain, they

will  scramble  to  snatch back the  umbrellas.   Worse,  now

Minister BG George Yeo has told them that a terrific  perfect

storm  is  blowing.   I  think they are  even  more  worried.

Hence,  I would like to ask the Government to urge the banks,

especially  local banks, who may have more local interest  in

their  heart,  to stay their hands in calling  on  defaulting

loans.  They should instead be sympathetic and call on  their

borrowers  to  see  how they can help them restructure  their

loans or allow them to defer their repayments.  It would be a

sad  case  if many companies collapse because of forced  loan

recalls by the banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, similarly, for housing loans, I am pleased to note

that  the  Deputy Prime Minister has said that the  HDB  will

introduce  some schemes to help HDB dwellers to  defer  their

loan  repayments.  On private residential properties, I would

like  to  also  call on the banks that, for Singaporeans  who

have  taken  up private residential property mortgages,  they

should be a bit more sympathetic and lenient in dealing  with

possible defaulting loans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the possibility of dropping property prices, many

properties can go into a negative equity, that is, the market

value of the property could be lower than the loan taken.  In

such  an  instance,  some banks would  be  quick  to  protect

themselves and ask for more cash or more collaterals.   Those

who  cannot meet the bank's demand will encounter forced sale

of  their  properties.  I understand that, in Hong Kong,  for

example,  there are about 300,000 loans that are  already  in

the  negative equity range.  I do not know how many are there

in  Singapore.   But  with the raging storm  and  the  coming

recession,  I  am  sure  that more  families  will  face  the

prospect  of negative equity.  So we would like to  urge  the

banks  to  be  more understanding and to try to  allow  their

customers' housing loans to be restructured or deferred.   As

Minister  George  Yeo has said, in time the storm  will  blow

over  and  then the umbrellas can be returned to the  bankers

gratefully  by the lenders, but please do not take  away  the

umbrellas when the storm is still raging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I would like to hail the move by the

Government  to have a wage cut of 10% for Ministers,  office-holders, top civil servants, MPs and NMPs.  This is  a  right

move,  especially  for  the  Ministers,  they  will  actually

encounter  a 17% wage cut, because 7% is from salary  formula

reduction and another 10% is from wage cut.  This is  a  good

gesture and a sign of good leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to repeat the fact that

this  economic package announced by the Deputy Prime Minister

is  most  warmly welcomed by all.  Let us hope that,  through

the  collective concerted efforts of our honest and effective

Government,  the hard work and drive of the  people  and  the

perseverance  and  pioneering  spirit  of  local   companies,

together  we  shall see ourselves through  this  dark  period

ahead.   And  let us hope that we can see some  light  sooner

than expected.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the current

downturn is very different



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>



from   the  last.   The  1997/98  crisis  was  felt  strongly

throughout Asia and arose from several factors, including the

high  level of foreign debt and the need for major structural

and economic reforms.  The growing US economy then was a huge

mitigating factor.  Despite there being some tell-tale signs,

Singaporeans  were largely caught by surprise.   Coping  with

the  crisis then required a lot of effort.  This time  round,

the effects are global.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, over the last few years, we have

proactively   begun  tackling  several  challenges,   namely,

reviewing   the   type   of  manufacturing   activities   and

investments,  promoting  knowledge intensive  industries  and

addressing    structural   unemployment    issues.     Hence,

psychologically, Singaporeans are prepared for the challenges

that we face as a country.  However, the global nature of the

downturn aggravated by the terrorist attacks in the  US  have

added  to  the  uncertainty and would prolong the  recession.

Singaporeans therefore need to be assured that we  have  what

it  takes  to ride out this challenging phase of our nation's

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the second package unveiled by the

Deputy  Prime  Minister will go a long way towards  providing

the  much needed assurance in a very concrete way but  which,

at the same time, contains a sense of reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now comment specifically on where assurance

can  be  found  by,  firstly, individuals and  families,  and

secondly, by businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, individuals and families. Recognising that

those  who  are  retrenched  would  need  assistance  to   be

retrained,  re-skilled and emplaced onto jobs, the Government

has  introduced a whole slew of schemes.  But  I  would  just

highlight and applaud the following three moves: firstly, the

inclusion of white collar and management staff, as  a  higher

proportion than before, has been dislocated by both  industry

restructuring  and the downturn;  secondly, the  devotion  of

sizeable  amounts towards SDF support so as to cast  the  net

even  wider;  and, thirdly, the refinements to both the  work

permit and employment pass criteria to ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>



that  foreign  contributors are those whose  skills  we  lack

rather than those who are simply more price competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, recognising the individuals and families who fail

to  secure  employment for a while may experience  cash  flow

problems,  the  Government has introduced  ample  reliefs  in

meeting  basic  needs,  such  as household  living  expenses,

education and health.  We can draw comfort from the freeze in

education  fees  and  suspension in  payment  of  loans,  the

reduction in electricity tariffs and extension of rebates  to

lower income families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is especially noteworthy are the following

three   measures:   firstly,  the  extension   of   temporary

assistance to lower income HDB flat owners, especially  those

in  three  and four-room flats as they have also  been  badly

affected,  but have hitherto been excluded or ineligible  for

assistance under current rules;  secondly, hospital  bills  - the  10%  rebate  for  B2  and C ward  charges  and  the  40%

assistance  for  those  who  are retrenched;   and,  thirdly,

additional  help  through CCCs for an  effective  meeting  of

needs at the more personal level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the business front. Recognising that

businesses,  especially  the  smaller  operations,  could  be

financially  strapped, the Government  has  sought  to  lower

operating  costs  and ease cash flow via  significant  moves,

including the steps taken to improve access to funds and  the

higher  property  tax  rebate  would  be  extremely  helpful.

Equally  helpful would be the corporate tax rebates amounting

to  a  hefty 50% rebate which will assist SMEs who  may  need

help to continue investing in the business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a general note, there is comfort in the example

set  by  the  Government to restrain wage cost in  the  civil

service  as  well as in the move to suspend  land  sales  and

remove the anti-speculative property measures.  Moreover, the

move  to  pump  prime  the economy to help  bolster  economic

activity   is   also  commendable  and  much   needed.    The

introduction  of  the New Singapore Share is  significant  in

bringing home the message that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>



should  stay united as a people as we take ownership  of  our

own future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, as the Deputy Prime Minister has stated,

the  challenges  of  economic strategy and employability  are

really  long  term  and  fundamental  issues.   However,  the

downturn  has  heightened some of these  concerns  which  the

Government  has now addressed in a very concrete  manner.   I

would  like to urge the DPM to ensure that all these measures

would be compassionately implemented.  I believe the unity of

Singaporeans   and   their  support  for   the   Government's

endeavours will see us through these testing times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I   welcome this package presented by the Deputy  Prime

Minister  and I would like to give some views on the  efforts

to  assist  our  nation  to  overcome  the  present  economic

downturn.   I  believe the steps will not  only  help  us  to

overcome  economic problems now but also open up new  avenues

to address the long-term problems even after we have overcome

the  present economic problems.  I believe the measures taken

by  the  Government are comprehensive.  It benefits not  only

the lower income group, but also those who are better off and

the   middle-income  group  who  is  also  affected  by  this

downturn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package of $11.3 billion and a deficit of around $5

billion  are very significant and can surely help to increase

harmony  in  Singapore.  It is balanced  in  its  attempt  to

assist   the  community  and  companies  to  overcome   their

problems.  But, on the whole, the community too will  benefit

from  the help given to companies because companies  will  be

able  to  retain  the  jobs for them  and  our  workers  will

continue to be employed.  I welcome the Government's move  to

continue  with  the rebates on conservancy charges  for  flat

owners,  including  bigger flats like the HDB  5-room  flats,

because  those who live in the HDB 5-room flats, who enjoy  a

better income, have also been affected by retrenchments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Downturn Relief Scheme, introduced to

overcome the bleak economy, is most welcome to help those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>



have lost their jobs.  I believe, if properly implemented  by

the  CCCs, which operate in all our housing estates, it  will

not only be able to help the group affected, but will also be

able  to  inculcate in them the feeling of nationhood because

they  receive assistance from the grassroots leaders who live

in their housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to touch on the

"People  for  Jobs Traineeship Programme" which is  specially

meant  for  the older workers who are 40 years and above  who

have  lost their jobs.  I welcome the $200 million set  aside

for  this  group  of  people.   I  believe  this  is  a  very

meaningful  effort  because it provides the  opportunity  for

those who have greater difficulties in finding another job in

the  long term.  Their effort to find new jobs and to retrain

these  workers  to adapt themselves to their  newly  acquired

jobs  would  be  better and it would surely  assist  them  in

taking care of their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is significant this time is that we give assistance

to  executives and skilled workers who have lost their  jobs.

I  believe  the  package  offered will  be  welcomed  by  the

executive  groups and skilled workers, because many  of  them

who  have  lost  their  jobs  feel  that,  due  to  less  job

opportunities and old age, it is a lot more difficult to find

new  jobs  although  they  have the  skills  and  educational

qualifications.  I would like to ask, from the  sum  of  $200

million,  how  many of the retrenched who are  40  years  and

above would benefit from the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I also agree with the Deputy Prime

Minister  that it is not timely for us to cut the  employers'

CPF contribution.  We agree that CPF is for workers to use in

their  retirement  and,  therefore, we  should  not  cut  the

employers'  CPF  contribution,  as  long  as  we  have  other

measures  to  overcome this problem.  This includes  lowering

the  costs of business operations.  The problem faced by  our

companies now is not due to loss of competitiveness,  but  it

is  due  to the fall in demands all over the world caused  by

the downturn in America, Japan and Europe.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>



It  is  worsened by the terrorist attacks on 11th  September.

We should implement other measures to help these companies to

lower  their production and operation costs so that they  can

retain their workers, and I hope that the Government will not

take early action to reduce the employers' CPF contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of foreign workers, I welcome the strict

measures  to  be taken to tighten the employment  of  foreign

workers,  and to bring in those who are skilled  rather  than

unskilled.  Some jobs which are now given to foreign  workers

could  benefit  our  own  workers, provided  our  workers  go

through retraining courses and are given assistance to  adapt

themselves to take up these jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope additional measures will be implemented to help

our   workers  to  change  their  mindset  to  grab  the  job

opportunities in the sectors which they are not interested in

presently,  so that they have a stable job to maintain  their

family  and, at the same time, we could lessen our dependence

on foreign workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe these additional off-Budget

measures  are  not only a package to assist  Singaporeans  to

overcome  this  downturn,  but that the  assistance  schemes,

including the training schemes, together with the plans  that

have  been arranged by the labour movement led by NTUC, could

also  help  our country and people to overcome the challenges

ahead.  Even after we have overcome the present downturn, our

workers  should  upgrade  their own skills  and  acquire  new

capabilities  to meet the competition from various  countries

that  are  now more competitive as compared to the  past.   I

welcome this additional package and I hope it will be able to

assist  and  strengthen  further  the  solidarity  among  the

people, the Government and employers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like

my  parliamentary  colleagues, I am also overwhelmed  by  the

package  just announced by DPM.  I find it very difficult  to

keep  track  of  the details and all the individual  measures

announced by him.  But there is really no need to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose to state that, prior to

coming  to  the House, what I had expected in the  package  - what  are  the  factors we must address - and  then  look  at

whether all the measures announced by the DPM will be  up  to

the task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first off-Budget package tabled

by  Minister George Yeo, it reflected a strategy to  do  just

about the minimum that was necessary to help the economy  and

also to hope that the projected recovery of the world economy

expected  in first quarter 2002 would lift Singapore  out  of

the  current recession.  The dose of medicine proposed by the

good Minister was calibrated to be about just right - not too

much, not too little.  That strategy would have worked if the

condition  had been favourable.  But it turns  out  that  the

confluence  of weather fronts had produced a severe  storm  - what  the  Minister had said, a perfect storm,  a  once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third quarter results show that our worst fear has

been  confirmed.   We  have, indeed,  experienced  our  worst

quarterly contraction since independence.  Furthermore,  with

the  terrorist attacks on 11th September, there is no  longer

any  need to second-guess the duration or the severity of the

recession.   The drop in consumer confidence and  air  travel

means that any hope of an early recovery in the US economy is

dashed,  so  much so that the top executives of SIA  have  to

take pay cuts to weather the severe buffeting the airline  is

expected to endure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that the recession in Singapore will

be  longer  than  expected and will be a difficult  one  -  a

recession  that  our people are not really mentally  prepared

for,   a  recession  that  Singaporeans  will  find  it  very

difficult to tackle, based on our own individual resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this severe economic recession, there is, indeed,

very  little that businesses or individuals could do to  turn

the  situation  around in the short term.  For  instance,  no

amount  of job training will allow the retrenched workers  to

find a job if no one is hiring.  Therefore, we, Singaporeans,

are  looking  to  the Government to provide the  steady  hand

needed to steer the ship



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>



through the stormy sea.  We are looking for bold measures, as

the  time for conservative step-wise measures is over.   When

we  look  at the US economy, we see that the Federal  Reserve

Bank has implemented nine consecutive interest cuts this year

to  tackle  its recession.  I was hoping that our  Government

could be just as aggressive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what kind of medicine do we need, Sir? It would be

useful to think in terms of long-term measures and also short-term measures.  I was hoping to see in the second package the

following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term, we have to protect jobs and also to

keep  people, who are already employed, working.   Therefore,

we  have  to  keep  businesses viable, make  less  profitable

businesses   more  profitable,  make  loss-making  businesses

profitable.   And  for those who are already  retrenched,  we

need  to provide assistance to help them to tackle the  costs

of basic necessities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, with weaker consumer confidence, our domestic

economy  is winding down slowly.  So, therefore, we  need  to

increase  the cash flow in the economy and keep our  economic

wheel  turning.   In  so doing, I was looking  forward  to  a

massive injection of cash into the economy, and the only  way

I can see it coming from is a massive reduction of Government

taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should be worried about creating a

dependency mentality in our people, Sir, I think it  is  time

that  we  did not worry too much, because now is the time  to

put help into their hands.  Like Mr Leong has spoken earlier,

xue  zhong song tan.  It is the time to send hot charcoal  to

the people in snowy weather, ie, to provide timely help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me state that, after listening to

the  Deputy Prime Minister, I am very impressed that  he  has

taken  a  complete relook at every issue facing the Singapore

economy  and has almost redone, single-handedly,  a  complete

revamp  of  all our tax issues.  Instead of having an  energy

drink - like Red Bull in its advertisement, he le jiu xing  - we had had an intravenous injection of energy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>



drugs,  and  I  think the economy will benefit  significantly

from this injection.  And since the Singapore economy is  not

dead  - it is just very sick - I think the injection of  this

massive tax cut will bring around early revivals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I am also very impressed that the

leadership has taken the pain to take a 10% pay cut and  also

forgo a certain amount of bonuses.  That indicates that  they

have  learned  their leadership skill very well from  ancient

military lessons that, in fighting wars, the generals and the

soldiers  must endure the same pain - the cold and  also  the

hardship - together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while it is heartening that the Deputy

Prime Minister has indicated a whole host of measures to help

businesses, it is also important that we realise the pain  of

those  in  the  lower income group and extend  assistance  to

them.  The package is quite comprehensive.  I just have a few

comments to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the extension of rebates in energy

bills,  utilities bills and service and conservancy  charges,

we  have always depended on the classification of HDB housing

types  as  a measure to provide such assistance.   I  believe

this  time  round, Sir, we should allow for greater  latitude

and  devise  an escape route for even those who live  in  the

bigger  HDB types, eg, 5-room and Executive flats.   This  is

because I believe some of them are really cash-strapped,  and

many  of  them are also faced with negative equity.  If  they

were to sell their flat today to downgrade to a smaller flat,

most of their lifelong savings will be wiped out.  In handing

out  aids to HDB dwellers, we should take the plight of  such

residents  into consideration and allow greater  flexibility,

even if they are staying in 5-room or Executive flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the anti-speculative measures, I was hoping

that  the Government will scrap the anti-speculative measures

and  which,  indeed,  the  Deputy Prime  Minister  has  done.

However,  I  thought he should also look at  the  payment  of

stamp



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>



duty  before  transactions,  because  that  was  one  measure

introduced and which is still in force today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is very important that we would like to look at

all  the  short-term measures announced by the  Deputy  Prime

Minister, we should also look at some of the medium-term  and

long-term  measures, to shift the economic  strategy  of  our

development  from  past strategies to newer  ones.   Perhaps,

because of time constraint, the Deputy Prime Minister had not

touched  very  much  on  this.  I was hoping  that  he  would

elaborate  that,  in future, we would shift  our  focus  from

multinational    corporations   to   local    entrepreneurial

enterprises,  a  shift  from Government-linked  companies  to

small and medium enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, what really impressed me is the fact that,

by  the measures announced and by the bold action taken, this

is  a Government in full charge of a ship in stormy seas -  a

Government  of  action  that our people  can  depend  upon  - responsive,  pragmatic and bold.  To make the measures  work,

we  need  the wholehearted support of Singaporeans.  In  this

respect,  we  have laid a good foundation by  the  leadership

taking a pay-cut.  Together, Sir, I think we shall be able to

sail through this stormy sea to calmer waters ahead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I am glad that the

Government has thought of the wide ranging measures  which  I

am  confident  will have a significant impact on Singaporeans

and  Singapore companies.  While many people had asked for  a

package  of  between  $10 billion and $15 billion  off-Budget

measures,  I think they never expected to get so much.   This

time  round,  as  opposed  to the past,  the  Government  has

pleasantly  surprised  everyone, which  is  a  $11.3  billion

package.  I applaud the Government for being bold this time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been pointless to give a small dose, like

what  Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen mentioned, like  the  $2.2  billion

measures  implemented earlier this year.  In  that  instance,

there  was no impact at all, and another small package  would

have meant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>



money  down  the drain.  Governments must have the  political

will  to take bold measures if they are really serious  about

making   a   difference  in  situations  like  the   economic

recession.   Most of the time, piecemeal effects  are  wasted

efforts.   Mr  Leong  Horn Kee talked about  the  ineffective

measures  taken by some other governments in this region.   I

think   this   time  round,  we  have  shown   to   everyone,

Singaporeans  and  to  the rest of the  world,  that  we  are

willing to take bold moves which are indeed necessary to make

any significant difference in situations like this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on a few issues. First of

all, it is the predictive capability of the Government.  Sir,

the  third quarter results of a negative 5.6% forecast and  a

negative 3% for the year are once again way off the mark,  as

has been the case for forecasts done by the Government in the

past few years.  I am sure that the Deputy Prime Minister and

the  Minister for Trade and Industry must agree with me  that

the  large negative swing of the economic indicators has  got

nothing  to  do with the September 11th actions in  the  USA.

The  fate  of the third quarter results was mostly sealed  by

then.   Many people are, of course, using September  11th  as

excuses for many things, but I think, in this case, at  least

for  the  third quarter results, that cannot be  the  reason.

Looking  forward  to the fourth quarter and beyond,  I  think

there  will  be  significant impact.  It is easy  to  say  in

hindsight,  but  we all know that the position  held  by  the

Government,  even three months ago, was quite different  from

what many industry analysts were saying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I am raising this issue is because I am

really concerned about the indicators that the Government  is

using  to  measure  the  future state  of  the  economy.   My

impression  is  that we are using old models  that  may  have

worked in the past but these models may not be suitable in  a

rapidly  changing new economy.  I would like to  ask  whether

the  Government  is  doing anything to put  in  place  better

models for predicting the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to touch on is the issue

of retrenched executives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>



and  professionals.   While  I am comfortable  that  we  have

sufficient measures to help the lower income families who may

be  hit  by  the  recession,  our  various  welfare  schemes,

including the public assistance, rental rebates, Medifund and

others,  are  tailored to help the lower income Singaporeans.

But  people  who were once drawing high income  but  are  now

retrenched  are  not eligible for any one of  them.   We  are

starting  to see many cases of Singaporeans who may be  asset

rich  but cash poor because of a sudden turn of events.  This

is  especially so for those in the 40s and 50s, who may  have

been successful in their careers and have a steady income and

have families to support.  They would have been committed  to

a  property  and  have many liabilities and responsibilities,

especially   paying  mortgages  for  properties,   children's

education, expenses and others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system of welfare schemes will not be able to

support them.  We must think of ways to ease their cash  flow

situations in the short-term.  For such people, it  does  not

make  sense to give them the type of assistance given to  the

lower income Singaporeans.  We need to think of new ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to start thinking out of the box

and  be  flexible on some of its policies.  I would  like  to

suggest that we allow such people to borrow money from  their

CPF   Special   Account,  as  opposed   to   withdrawing   it

permanently, that they be allowed to borrow so that they  can

draw  a  monthly amount to help them tide over the  difficult

times.   And when they are gainfully employed again,  we  can

institute  a  higher  monthly deduction from  their  employee

portion  of  CPF  to  repay back into the  CPF  account  with

interest, if we have to.  In this way, they do not have to be

dependent  on any of the welfare schemes.  With this  scheme,

we  do  not have to put extra burden on the public  funds  as

those  affected will be using their own money  in  case  they

draw  from their CPF.  It is much easier to justify  this  to

all Singaporeans than to support the asset rich and cash poor

Singaporeans with public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the extensive measures to help reduce

business costs which were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>



announced  by the Deputy Prime Minister.  But in my  opinion,

while they are going to be effective in the short-term, these

are  temporary measures.  In fact, the measures that we  have

been  used  to  in  the  recent past have  been  a  temporary

reduction approach of reducing costs. We have to put in  more

permanent cost reduction measures.  Most of the measures  put

in  place like rental rebates, property tax rebates,  rebates

on  charges are all temporary in nature and such an  approach

does  not  give  comfort to businesses that  we  have  indeed

identified a longer term solution for the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel it is about time that we seriously looked at

permanent  reduction  measures.   If  we  fail  to   do   so,

especially  at  this  point of time, we may  actually  see  a

structural destruction of our industrial base.  As  countries

like  China  and India catch up and are able to provide  same

resources at a much cheaper cost, we risk permanent  loss  of

our  industries and may see a hollowing of our  economy.   We

have no choice but to keep manufacturing as an important wing

of  our  economy and we therefore have to re-look at  how  we

price the various resources which make significant impact  to

the  cost of manufacturing.  For example, why cannot we price

industrial land differently?  The costs of land and  building

are  just  too  high, perhaps the highest in the  world.   We

already   have  a  mechanism  of  differential   prices   for

residential properties, different prices for HDB flats versus

private  properties.  It is really up to  the  Government  to

decide  how they want to price industrial land.   It  is  the

Government  which sets the price benchmark in this  case.   I

feel  that there needs to be a drastic reduction so  that  we

will be able to address this cost issue once and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that finally something substantial is being

done  to  help SMEs secure funding through the loan insurance

scheme.   The  $500  million will  go  a  long  way  to  help

companies  overcome their difficulties in securing  financing

for  activities.   In many cases, as has been  in  the  past,

there are companies with good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>



business deals but lack the financing and result in the deals

collapsing  or  collapse of the companies.  I hope  that  the

loan  insurance scheme will be implemented such that it  will

not  be  too difficult for companies to apply.  It cannot  be

left  to banks to decide solely on disbursement of this loan.

There  must  be  some  intervention and  involvement  of  the

Productivity  and  Standards  Board  for  the  scheme  to  be

successful because leaving it completely to the banks may not

change  the  situation  because  banks  have  typically   not

preferred to lend to small and medium enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of property prices, I am a little

disappointed  that the Government has become distracted  from

the  original  objective  of preventing  speculation  in  the

property market.  While I do sympathise with property owners,

and  I  too  own a property, that we have lost value  in  our

properties, I feel that it is for the long-term good  of  the

country  if we do not allow property price bubbles to develop

as  a  result of speculation.  If it develops as a result  of

genuine buyers, I think we have no choice, but if as a result

of  speculation,  this  is something we  should  not  accept.

While up to now property buyers in the last few years may not

have  made gains, as the Deputy Prime Minister indicated just

now,  my  fear  is  that  this  lifting  of  anti-speculative

measures will spark off a rapid rise in property prices again

by  people  who hope to make a quick gain, as  was  the  case

before 1996.  And if we build up another bubble and it bursts

again,  we may go the way of Japan where they never recovered

from the big burst of their property bubble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, I would like to applaud the

Government  for its leadership in identifying  the  extensive

off-Budget measures.  I am confident that we will be able  to

turn  things around as we start implementing these  measures.

It  is  always  important in situations  like  this  for  the

Government to take the leadership and to be bold rather  than

to  be  conservative.  I think if we err, we will err on  the

positive side rather than on the negative side in the case of

the  situation when we are too conservative in  the  measures

that we implement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in 1998, we had the Asian financial crisis.  At

that  time, it was just a mild cold but in the year 2000  and

this  year,  we came across a very serious influenza.   After

September  11th, with the flu, we were drenched  in  a  heavy

rain,  and  the  influenza has developed into something  much

more serious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, when I heard the off-Budget package announced

by  the  Deputy  Prime Minister, I am glad to know  that  our

health  is  still very strong in Singapore, and that  we  are

able  to pull through all kinds of stormy weathers and remain

safe  and  sound.  A few months ago, we announced  the  first

package of $2.2 billion and now this second package is  $11.3

billion,   making a total of $13.5 billion.  This is  a  very

comprehensive plan to help our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this package, we have very detailed plans and schemes

to  help  our  citizens,  including rebates  on  income  tax,

property  tax, HDB and JTC rentals, etc.  Among these,  there

are also extensions to the existing rebates on utilities, HDB

and JTC rentals, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that all these rebates are part

of  a  very  good package that will help our people  overcome

this  severe economic crisis. It is like the Chinese  saying,

"sending coal in a snowy weather or handing out umbrellas  in

heavy  rain".   It is a very good assistance package  indeed,

but we must not forget to look into the possibility of longer

term schemes to help our citizens.  The announcement made  by

the  Deputy  Prime Minister will surely be  welcomed  by  our

people.   The Government is able to do this because  we  have

"made  hay  when the sun shines, and prepared for  the  rainy

days".   During  good times, through prudent  management,  we

were able to accumulate surpluses so that when we come across

any  financial crisis,  we are able to fork out  extra  money

from  our coffers to help our people.  This is a good example

and  the  result  of cooperation between the people  and  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the whole, I think it is more important to have

long-term plans to help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>



the  unemployed people in particular.  How do we  help  them?

We  can train them, re-skill them and re-educate them in  the

hope  that they can quickly find a job.  But I am afraid  the

older  people,  those  who  are  50  and  above,  will   have

difficulty  getting  a  job  even  after  going  through  the

training   and  enhancing  their  skills,  in   the   present

circumstances.  I hope that the Government will take the lead

because if our retirement age is 62, and the people are  only

50  years old, they have 12 more years of working life.   The

Ministries  in  the  Government  should  go  through  various

avenues  to  help these people look for employment.   If  the

Government  can  take  the lead to  absorb  these  people,  I

believe   the   private  companies  will  also  emulate   the

Government's move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to feedback received, when an applicant

telephones  in  response to a job vacancy advertisement,  the

first question asked of him is invariably: "How old are you?"

If  the reply is 50 and above, he will be told, "Do not come,

you  are  too  old!"  If this trend persists, those  who  are

older and unemployed, or when they are retrenched, will  face

some very difficult times ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I am concerned about is that this

financial  crisis is not just in Asia but  it  is  global  in

nature.   With  the opening up of the Chinese market  to  the

world,  the  entry of China into the WTO, and its hosting  of

the  Olympic  Games in 2008, I think in the next  few  years,

China  will  be able to attract a lot of foreign  investments

there.   This  is also a good opportunity for our  people  to

invest  there, but, of course, we must have the  avenues  and

the  way to go there.  If you depend on special companies  to

go  into  China, you may have difficulties.  I hope that  the

Government  or  MTI  will take the lead  again  to  lead  our

entrepreneurs there. Small companies should endeavour to join

together  so  that they may have the scale and  resources  to

venture  into the China market. When you venture into  a  new

market, there are lots of challenges facing us there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Government to consider giving

some sort of special loans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>



to  those who are venturing into the China market, or to help

them  make some arrangements and give them assistance. As  it

is  said: "The business world is like a battle field."   When

we  fight  a war, we must have the vanguards to charge  ahead

and  lead  the  rest  of the army forward.   Of  course,  the

vanguards are taking the biggest  risk.  But for the sake  of

a  victory in a war, they will risk their lives and take  the

lead  forward.  Similarly, in the  business  world,  when  we

invest  in a new market, the challenges are tough and severe.

The  Government  should give them greater  encouragement  and

instill  in them more confidence, so that we will be able  to

create  more  opportunities for our own  people,  spread  our

second wing and venture into this emerging market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Dr Wang Kai Yuen said that the utilities rebate

is  a  very  good measure to assist people to overcome  their

financial  difficulties.  But for those who  live  in  5-room

flats  or  private properties, they are not entitled  to  the

benefits  under this scheme.  I believe that in this  present

economic downturn, they too are having  similar difficulties.

I  think  they  too  need some form of  assistance  from  the

Government.   I  hope that apart from HDB flat dwellers,  the

private  property owners should also be given some  utilities

rebate,  so  that they can share the happiness  and  hardship

together with their fellow countrymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, DPM mentioned about the wage cut for our

Ministers and senior civil servants.  I believe that this  is

something  which  our people will all agree  with.   It  also

shows  that we are prepared to share our woes together.   Our

leaders  have  put in a lot of efforts to make  policies  and

work  out strategies to lead our country. In good times, they

lead us to prosperity and in bad times, they guide us out  of

troubled  waters. Our people generally appreciate what  these

leaders  have  done.  They realise that it is  not  easy  for

these  leaders to lead our country through bliss  and  gloom.

But  during a financial crisis when the people are  suffering

under adverse circumstances, the Ministers also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>



announced  that  they  will take a pay  cut.   This  is  very

laudable indeed!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, during bad times, we are not giving up our efforts

to  attract  foreign investments here in Singapore.  It is  a

difficult time, because many companies will  choose to invest

in  China  instead of Singapore.  There may be  opportunities

for  them to come here, but we must also review the terms and

conditions  we  offer to these foreign  investors  so  as  to

continue  to  attract them to come here.  We should  simplify

our  administrative procedures to make it easier for them  to

set  up  their businesses here in Singapore, so that  in  the

process we can create  more job opportunities for our people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have just one short point to make and two clarifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point actually arises from my having sat in some

recent dialogue sessions where some professionals have raised

the   issue  of  infrastructural  work,   now  that  we   are

accelerating some of the major projects to the tune  of  $3.5

billion.  I believe PWD, which was corporatised not that long

ago,  is  still  enjoying a moratorium  on  major  Government

projects, and this results in PWD having a lion share of  all

this  work.   We have many professional firms  -  architects,

engineers,  various building consultants -   who  are  having

very  bad times.   They are struggling.  And while it is nice

to  have  acceleration of these projects, I  trust  that  the

entire amount would not end up going towards the corporatised

PWD,  leaving all of these firms out in the cold.  I do  hope

some consideration will be given to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two clarifications are: first, with regard to

hospital  fee rebates for classes B2 and C, we are  targeting

at  citizens and their families.  I was not clear on  whether

family  members who are non-citizens would also  qualify.   I

work  in  a hospital.  Very often, we would see citizens  who

struggle with dealing with fees for their family members  who

may  not  be citizens.  So that would be a good clarification

to have.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is with regard to the New

Singapore  Shares.   I  just  want  to  make  sure   that   I

understand.   The shares will be given through CPF  accounts,

current or non-current accounts.  By that, I understand  that

all  non-CPF  account holders will not qualify  for  the  New

Singapore Shares.  The New Singapore Shares are not the  same

as CPF Top-ups.  I think they are meant to give all Singapore

citizens  the feeling of belonging and of sharing.   A  large

percentage  of  home-makers  would  not  have  CPF  accounts.

Surely, it cannot be right that they will not be eligible for

the New Singapore Shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is all that I wanted to raise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in a  short period of three months, we are  now

introducing a second package, and this time it is  for  $11.3

billion.  I think the important thing for us to do now is  to

restore  the  confidence of the people, because many  workers

are   worried  that  they  would  lose  their  jobs  and  the

businesses are worried that they would collapse.   After  the

September  11 event, many people were saying that  the  World

Trade  Centre  had  collapsed and  the  companies  here  will

collapse too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, $11.3 billion is a big sum of money. But no matter

how much we have instilled in our economy, the most important

thing  is  to  maintain the confidence  of  the  people,  the

businesses  and the Government.  The Feedback  Unit  recently

conducted a survey on how much confidence the people  had  in

the  Government  in  leading us out of the  present  economic

crisis.  Only 56.5% stated that they had great  confidence in

the  Government's  capability in pulling us through,  another

34%  or so said that they had some confidence, not very  much

but not very little, but just some confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we increase the confidence of this 34% in

the  Government?   If  this survey  is  conducted  after  the

introduction  of  this package by DPM, I am  sure  many  more

people  would have greater confidence in the Government.   In

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>



Skills Development Fund alone, the Government will be putting

in another $50 million.  I am sure this will give people more

confidence  that the Government is serious in  equipping  the

workers so as to enhance their employability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People for Jobs Traineeship Programme will benefit

those in the middle income group because, prior to this,  the

concern  was on the lower income group only, but now  we  are

looking  into  the benefits for the middle income  people  as

well.   But these people still do not have confidence in  the

Government.  Many of them have reservations about  undergoing

retraining or skill enhancement.  Many people say  that  they

do  not  feel good about going back to the classrooms or  the

workshops.   I  think  we  should make  them  feel  good  and

confident  in  being retrained.  As many of my  parliamentary

colleagues have said in this House, many people above the age

of  50  cannot get a job. Now, even those above 40 are having

difficulty  getting a job. Nowadays, at 40,  you  are  looked

upon  as an old man.  That being the case, then half  of  our

population  would be deemed to be old people.    I  think  we

should change this perception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government is granting a rebate on

diesel  tax.  This will benefit the taxi drivers.  Many  taxi

drivers told me that nowadays after queuing for four hours at

the  airport,  they  could  not get  any  tourists  as  their

passengers   - no more American or Japanese tourists.   After

deducting their costs, their net income is just about  $10  a

day.   I hope the taxi companies will pass on the benefit  of

this diesel tax rebate to the taxi drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that is worth mentioning is the

Government's   decision  not  to  cut  the   employers'   CPF

contribution.   I  think this is a good  reassurance  to  the

people.   Of course, if the recession gets worse, I think  we

cannot  rule  out  the  possibility of  a  reduction  in  the

employers' CPF contribution again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have the people lost their confidence? This is

because  in  the last few years, we have been developing  too

fast.  Many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>



companies are relocating and we have been importing a lot  of

foreign  talents.  Many people who were retrenched could  not

find  an  alternative job, and they put the blame on  foreign

talents.  And now with China coming up, many people are  also

blaming  China for all these problems.  These are  challenges

which the Government will have to face and tackle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has now introduced this package where a lot of money

is put into our economy.  I think this will help to boost the

confidence of the people.  As I see it, there are four levels

of  problems.    First, the superficial level.   We  have  to

enhance   the  employability of the people, and  the  country

must  have the competitiveness. We have been emphasising this

even  in the 1960s, but the people just looked at the surface

of  the  matter  and  were not prepared to  look  beyond  the

superficial  level. In 1970s and 1980s, when faced  with  the

economic  downturn  and recession, people  began  to  look  a

little deeper, which I shall call the sub-surface level.  The

people  were  persuaded to cooperate with  the  employers  to

suffer a pay-cut to keep their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Asian financial crisis in 1997 brought the

people  to  the inner level, where they began to realise  the

importance  of  skills  upgrading  and  retraining  to   stay

competitive and enjoy better employability. The September  11

event  in   2001  gave the people a rude jolt that took  them

into  the  deep-inside  level where  not  only  the  ordinary

workers  but  also  the  middle and senior  management  level

people  are  feeling the pinch.  The people begin to  realise

that  they  have to look far and beyond the present problems.

I  think  the Government has a very long telescope which  can

see very far ahead. Perhaps, the Government should share this

telescope with the people, so that they can look farther.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members were talking about handing out umbrellas

during rainy days.   I think, in the present day context, the

umbrella  is  not good enough, because it has its limitation.

The feeling is that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>



should  hand  out umbrellas when it is raining.  I  think  we

should  build up an environment whereby companies can   carry

on  with their businesses, rain or shine, storm or no  storm.

We  should  convey this message to everybody.   Nowadays,  in

every  HDB  neighbourhood, we have  built  covered  walkways.

Residents  can  walk along the covered walkways  to  the  bus

stop even when it rains. But, I heard that where there is  no

covered walkway, the residents would complain that they could

not  walk  out to the bus stop when it rains.  I asked   them

why  they did not get an umbrella. They said that it was  too

troublesome. They would rather wait for the rain to stop.   I

think  if  you have to catch a bus to go to your destination,

you  should  run across to the bus stop, whether there  is  a

covered  walkway or not, even if you do not have an umbrella.

Otherwise,  you  will  not catch the  bus  and  get  to  your

destination in time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think DPM should emphasise to the people that they on

their part too must  trim themselves in a difficult time like

this  and  make every effort to lift up their heads  and  not

walk  around with their chins down. The people must not  lose

their  confidence.  Whether  or not  there  is  an  umbrella,

whether or not there is a covered walkway, life must  go  on.

We should work together hand in hand to make Singapore strong

and  competitive.   Yes,  what  we  need  is  confidence   in

ourselves!



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, before I came

to this Chamber this morning, I listed down a list of what  I

thought  Government  could do in so far as  these  off-Budget

measures  to  resuscitate the economy to achieve  growth  and

employment  opportunities in our economy  are  concerned.   I

must  say  that the Deputy Prime Minister's list far exceeded

my  expectations.  My list also included cuts  in  Ministers'

and  Members of Parliament's salaries and allowances.  So  it

is a sincere and genuine list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one policy that I really could not understand, and

perhaps the Deputy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>



Prime Minister could explain, is the GST.  I believe that one

of  the  most  powerful instruments that we can  do  in  this

present  circumstance actually is to reduce the rate  of  our

GST  without dismantling the structure of the GST  operation.

Why  do I say that it is important?  It is not a question  of

just  3% makes no difference to price cuts and whatever.   It

is  really a question of a reduction of perhaps 2%  and  with

that,  a very sizeable flow of liquidity in the economy.   It

might  not  make  much  difference  to  price  as  to  affect

spending.  But, nonetheless, it gives opportunities for small

businesses  and  other businesses to survive and  to  improve

their  present situation.  If you estimate the GST collection

at  about  $1.5 billion a year, a reduction of 2% could  well

mean  $1  billion  immediate and sustained injection  in  the

economy throughout.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems in resuscitating measures in off-Budget measures or fiscal spending measures is the time lag.

Although  we  have here $11.3 billion, you can  see  that  it

takes  probably two or three years before this whole  package

can be fully worked out.  What we need now is actually a very

strong  dose for resuscitating the economy.  So I  hope  that

the  Government  could really think about  this  and  perhaps

consider this once more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I would like to raise is for the

support  of  small and medium-sized enterprises.   There  has

been  this  policy suggested of a new look  to  assist  local

enterprises.  One of the items listed here is the micro  loan

scheme.   I  really applaud this new out-of-the-box  type  of

thinking  by the Government in trying to look at these  micro

loan  features.   Of course, it will take time  before  micro

loan features and micro loan lending can work out.  But there

are   many   countries   where  such  schemes   have   worked

successfully.  So I would like to support this and  urge  the

Government  to  work  full  steam ahead  on  such  assistance

schemes for small and medium enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reducing rental property and property taxes, one of

the  problems that tenants always face is that the owners  of

property



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>



do not pass down these rebates to the tenants or the lessees.

So I wonder whether there can be some measures or instruction

or  some  conditionality placed such that tenants do get  the

benefits  of  this.   Because right  now  it  is  really  the

tenants,  not just the owners but also downstream across  the

economy, that people are faced with difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trying to assist SMEs, I note in this Executive

Summary  that the Government talks about "improved access  to

funds  for  local enterprises", and this "improved access  to

funds"  is really clearly underlined.  This has been  one  of

the  complaints by SMEs that many of them do not seem to  get

the  benefit of these funding schemes by Government.   So  by

improving  access, I really believe that the Government  must

work  out  features  and  processes for  them  to  avoid  the

bureaucracy  network and bureaucracy difficulties  that  they

face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government could work out measures

within  this  assistance package to the  SMEs  to  help  them

refinance  their lendings.  One of the complaints  that  SMEs

have  been bringing up is that although interest rates  right

now  are low, they are stuck with rates that they have  fixed

sometime ago and that this difference in spread really is now

made  by the banks.  So they are thinking and asking of  ways

and  means  by which the authority and we, as the Government,

can  help  them by refinancing such schemes and whether  such

refinancing packages that are announced today can be packaged

into this difficulty that is specifically faced by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with what one of my colleagues, Mr Inderjit

Singh,  talked  about  just now on  some  of  the  investment

criteria and requirements for industrial properties from  the

JTC  authority.   I believe that investment criteria  by  JTC

should be relaxed so that you do not need to put in such high

investments  in  order to secure leases.  Perhaps  even  such

lower investment criteria might generate more employment  for

our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise the point that I agree

with  the  Deputy Prime Minister that this present  situation

needs  a  complete re-look at how our domestic economy  would

have  to perform in the future.  One of the suggestions  that

SMEs  have been bringing up is that they hope that they could

also  be  part  of  this  effort  in  re-looking  at  how  to

revitalise over a long term our domestic economy and how they

can  actually  also make their views heard at higher  levels,

whether  at  statutory  boards or at  GLCs,  where  they  can

provide   downstream   facilities   as   well   as   business

opportunities and contracts, so that the economy as  a  whole

downstream can also benefit from the leading sectors  in  our

economy.   The view is that at the current stage,  what  they

can  do  in  presenting their views is usually done  only  in

committees that are called from time to time, feedback and so

on.   But  in  actual business environment context,  many  of

their  views and capabilities, perhaps even their weaknesses,

could be improved upon.  So I hope the Government could  take

a  new  look at these whole measures and assist the  economy,

not  just this present package but also in the coming one  or

two years to come.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, this downturn is

sharp,  and the Deputy Prime Minister has described  this  as

the    steepest    downturn   Singapore   has    experienced.

Singaporeans are hurting and having to make some very painful

decisions  in  everyday life.  A couple of days  ago  when  I

talked  to some of my grassroots leaders, they gave  me  some

anecdotal  evidence  which,  I  think,  really  rings   true.

Individuals  are  having to make decisions  like  whether  to

leave  their  children  in  kindergartens  or  withdraw  them

because  they  cannot  afford the fees due  to  retrenchment.

There  are  others who work in coffeeshops who tell  me  that

even  decisions as minute as wanting to buy a soft drink have

become  marginally  significant.   Also,  individuals,  young

people  who  are at work, are afraid to go on  leave  because

they  are  afraid  that when they come back,  they  would  be

amongst those who are retrenched.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this environment, the evidence is that

Singaporeans  are  doing their best to help  themselves,  but

they  are  also looking to the Government to do its  part  to

help  them through this period of difficulty.  In that sense,

I  think the package has been a very significant one.  It  is

significant,   first,  in  terms  of   its   size   and   how

comprehensive it has been.  I think, secondly,  it  has  also

been  significant because it demonstrates that the Government

has  the will and commitment to come out with a large package

to  help  Singaporeans when there is a time  of  need.   Many

times  in  this House in the last several years, I have heard

questions raised on why we accumulate surpluses and insist on

putting  money away for a rainy day, and the Finance Minister

has  been  hard  put  explaining the  Government's  rationale

behind  this  prudent budgeting policy and  attitude  towards

reserves.  I think this particular experience demonstrates to

Singaporeans that the Government does have the resolve to use

the  reserves  when the need arises and that a rainy  day  is

like what we have today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I also would like to add my voice to the

chorus of others who have lauded the leadership shown by  the

Ministers,  other top civil servants and MPs to  take  a  pay

cut,  in particular the 17% pay cut that the Ministers  would

be  taking.   Sir,  there  are many  types  of  leadership  - leadership  by  example which demonstrates an empathy  and  a

shared sense of purpose, is perhaps the most compelling,  and

I congratulate the Government for taking that initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has also stressed one

important point which I thought in our focus on dealing  with

this  downturn and the measures that have come about in  this

package  we  should not overlook, which is  that  after  this

cycle is over and we come out of it, how well positioned will

Singapore  be  to  meet the longer term  challenges  and  the

structural  changes.  In particular, Sir, we have  been  made

aware  of many of these fundamental movements, like the shift

of the economic centre of gravity towards Northeast Asia with

the emergence of China, like the need to diversify our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>



economic  base  more into services and in  the  manufacturing

sector  away from the electronic sector to other  areas,  the

need to move up the skills ladder and also nurturing our SMEs

as  another  engine of growth.  And I think many of  the  new

measures  that  have been introduced in this package  can  be

harnessed to not just help deal with the pain of the downturn

but also position Singapore for the longer term challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the slew of measures that the Deputy

Prime  Minister  has  outlined and  I  would  like  to  focus

specifically on two or three key areas.  The first is that  I

think  it  is good that we have come out with a package  that

would  help many HDB residents meet their mortgage  payments,

etc,  with respect to their home loans.  The key though, Sir,

is   there  are  other  aspects  which  I  thought  I  should

highlight,  in  particular  with  respect  to  the  upgrading

packages  that  the Government has introduced,  ie,  the  MUP

programme.  These require typically for a household to commit

between $10,000 and $20,000 expenditure, if they also opt for

the  space-adding  item.   This is a  significant  amount  of

money, and in the minds of many householders it is a sum that

they are not prepared to commit.  There are two categories  - those  who have already committed to it and the payment  will

be  due  over  the next year or two because the projects  are

nearing  completion.  Then there are those who are having  to

make a decision over the next few months in a period of great

uncertainty, and for whom this financial burden  would  be  a

pivotal  factor  in  making their  decision.   We  have  some

schemes  in  place but they are targeted at the  elderly  and

those  who  are below a certain income threshold.   I  wonder

whether the Government could consider broadening the scope of

this in order to make it easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part, Sir, is on the servicing of housing

loans.  I am considering the question of those in the private

sector,  those  who  are  taking  up  loans  from  banks  and

servicing loans on private homes, whether there is scope  for

some  of  them to be able to tap into the Special Account  of

the CPF, especially when they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>



been retrenched and contributions to the Ordinary Account dry

up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wanted to address is the Economic

Downturn  Relief Scheme, which is to be administered  through

the  CCCs.   I think this is a very welcome move  because  it

brings assistance to the ground, closer to individuals and is

to be administered through individuals who know the area well

and the needs of their residents.  I would ask, however, that

this  be  administered in as efficient a way as  possible  by

allowing  the agencies on the ground, whether it is the  CCCs

or  the CDCs, to acquire more manpower in order to do the job

more efficiently and, at the same time, in terms of criteria,

there is a tendency for such schemes to be bogged down  by  a

lot  of evaluation.  And the question is whether we can be  a

little bit more relaxed with the criteria so that help  where

needed  can  be given quickly and it needs to be done  in  an

early and expeditious manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point is on the delivery of the service

itself.  Sir, we live in a system where we are used to a very

brisk  and  efficient  form  of service  delivery.   This  is

excellent,  but especially at a time of trial like  this,  we

may  need to alter the mindsets of many of our civil servants

or  counter staff and even those on the ground who are  being

entrusted with the responsibility to administer some  of  the

services we are talking about, like financial aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it takes a lot for an individual in hardship to

swallow  his or her pride and to come out and ask  for  help.

What  we  want to make sure is that we do not make that  task

more difficult by either making the process too brisk or  too

open,  denying them the confidentiality for the privacy which

would  help them preserve their dignity.  I would  urge  that

the  Government seriously consider some form of  training  or

guidance  for those who are entrusted with this,  both  civil

service  staff,  but,  as importantly,  the  volunteers,  the

grassroots  leaders who are being asked to  do  this  on  the

ground,   because  they  need  to  be  made  aware   of   the

circumstances.  This is not just about telling people,  "Here

is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>



form,  here  is the scheme, fill it up, let's  do  it.",  but

reaching  out  to  them in a manner that  is  empathetic  and

sympathetic.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> I would

just like to say that the schemes that were introduced by the

Deputy  Prime Minister were very comprehensive.  I have  just

two  questions  here.  One is the retraining  programmes  for

retrenched  workers.   I  am  curious  to  know  as  to   how

successfully  those who are retrenched are retrained  and  to

find  a job again.  Is there some kind of feedback here  that

we  could  have that would be useful to know how  useful  the

retraining  programmes  are?  The other  issue  leads  to  Dr

Jennifer Lee's point about the New Singapore Shares  and  the

position  of  women  and  housewives which  she  has  already

raised.   I  am not going to go further, but may I  beg  your

indulgence here to ask for another group of people, and  that

is,  the destitute elderly in the welfare homes.  It  may  be

quite  right and justified to let them partake, to a  certain

extent,  in this scheme that is coming down the Singaporean's

way.  We have no record in many cases of their histories.  We

do  not  know how they have contributed to what Singapore  is

today and since we have a scheme now called the New Singapore

Shares to benefit all Singaporeans, I appeal that it is their

right to be included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, if I may, on the whole question about

what  Mr  Iswaran has brought up.  In helping the people  who

need  financial aid, I have a slight reservation  here  about

the  role  of  the  CCCs.   We have already  present  schemes

through the FSCs and the CDCs and they have already got  some

kind  of  training in handling sensitively  people  who  come

through their doors for help.  Could we not perhaps use  them

rather than a new instrument in this area like the CCCs?

<div align="center"><b>TACKLING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to tell the PAP Government that the morale

of  the people of Singapore is now very low.  Many people are

worried  that the economy will get worse.  Many of  them  may

lose  their jobs and the businesses may go bust.  The  people

are  concerned that once they have lost their jobs,  or  when

their  business  collapses, how are they and  their  families

going  to survive, as the cost of living in Singapore  is  so

very high.  I do not think I need to reiterate this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of my previous speeches, I have urged the

Government not to make the burden of living so hard  for  the

people.   But the Government always says that all things  are

"affordable" to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the economy is good, our people may be able to

afford  the services and facilities, but barely so.  At  this

time of a severe downturn, the Government should promptly re-examine the charges and tariffs to see whether they are still

"affordable"  to  the people.  In the Government's  so-called

"market  economy" and privatisation of public  services,  the

bottom line is inevitably that the charges are affordable  to

the  people.  Now, these people lose their jobs, but the cost

of  living  is  still  the same. The burden  has  not  become

lighter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this package is concerned, it has not broken

through  the  Government's existing framework.   Through  all

these  rebates  and  temporary measures,  the  Government  is

trying  to  show that it cares for the people.  In  order  to

help  the  low-income  families, the  fees  of  the  tertiary

institutions are frozen.  I think what the Government  should

do  is  to reduce the fees, the charges, the conservancy  and

service charges and the utility charges.  A temporary  freeze

is not enough.  How can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>



you put off the fire on a cartload of wood with just a cup of

water?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this package introduced by the Government, it says

everybody can get a $200 subsidy.  In a family, if  the  sole

breadwinner loses his job and is unemployed, how  is  he  and

his  family going to live with $200?  In the present economic

situation, the Government should first of all find out how to

reduce the burden of the people.  For example, GST.  Will the

Government  consider reducing the GST or to suspend  GST  for

the  time  being?  As for those who are the sole breadwinners

of  the  family, once they have lost their job, I  think  the

Government should see how many dependants they have, and  use

it  as  a  basis  of  consideration,  just  like  our  public

assistance  scheme.   I  think  only  in  this  way  can  the

Government give them some genuine help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government should also conduct a

comprehensive review on the foreign talent policy.   Yes,  no

doubt, if we want to be a hub of the global economy, we  have

to  adopt  an  open-minded attitude to accept  these  foreign

talents.   But the problem is how do we define talent?   From

what  I  understand,  to  qualify their  applicants  for  the

Employment  Pass  system, many companies are  making  use  of

various loopholes to employ foreign workers to save on  their

manpower  cost,  and  I think this is not  a  very  foolproof

method.  I have written to MOM on this, but to no avail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singaporeans are born in this country.

They   have  completed  their  national  service,  they  have

shouldered their responsibility as citizens.  But now,  these

foreign  talents  are coming here to snatch away  their  rice

bowl.   Of  course, from DPM's speech, I understand that  the

Government  has already begun to look into this matter.   But

whether  or  not this matter can be effectively  resolved,  I

think  it  is still doubtful.  The Government should  take  a

deeper  look  into  the matter and work  out  some  means  to

oversee  this system.  We should not reject our local talents

and  ask  these foreign talents to take up jobs  which  could

actually  be taken up by our own citizens.  I think  this  is

unfair to our own people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2330</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This present package can be said to be more presentable

than the two previous so-called off-Budget packages.  In  the

previous  packages, the main emphasis was on saving  business

costs,  and  the  workers are the people  who  suffer.   This

package can be described as a "painless" package.  Why is  it

painless?  Because the General Election is coming.  After the

election,  the  pain  will  come.   Singaporeans  should   be

mentally prepared for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, today the Government has announced the new off-Budget  package at a total cost of $11.3 billion.  We welcome

this package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce

and  Industry had urged the Government to introduce a package

of  no  less  than  $10 billion, and to have  more  bold  and

efficient  off-Budget measures to help  the  businesses  tide

over  the  difficult times.  The various chambers of commerce

and  the  Singapore  Confederation of  Industries  and  other

organisations   have  also  made  similar  appeals   to   the

Government.   This  package announced by the  Government  has

fully illustrated that the Government has the confidence  and

capability  to  deal with the present economic problems,  and

has  also  placed  great importance on  the  appeals  of  the

business community. It has shown its sincerity in wanting  to

help the business community get out of this crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this package, there are some adjustments that have

been  adopted,  just like it was mentioned  by  the  previous

speakers  before me but, on the whole, this  package  is  one

that is praiseworthy.  On behalf of the business community, I

would like to express our sincere thanks to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new financial assistance package is a measure to

stimulate our economy, to help our economy turn around  at  a

faster pace.  It is indeed a shot in the arm for our economy.

Particularly,  in this package, there are various  assistance

schemes.  Financial assistance schemes were introduced in the

hope that the employees from the various sectors - industrial

and commercial sector, property sector,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2331</b></font><br><br>



service  sector  and  the  SMEs - would  be  given  more  job

opportunities,  so  as to help the unemployed  find  jobs.  I

think   the  workers  from  the  various  enterprises  should

treasure and seize this opportunity, and make full use of the

measures  in this package and adopt a more positive  attitude

in  their  work, to continue learning, to upgrade themselves,

to re-skill themselves, and to enhance their competitiveness.

In  this situation of economic recession, as employees,  they

should  be more realistic in their expectation.  They  should

not  add  on to the burden of the employers, because  in  the

present  situation  it  is a very important  thing  that  the

businesses do survive, so that the workers are able to retain

their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the employers will also make full use

of  the measures under this package and strengthen themselves

so  that  they  are able to ride through this stormy  weather

and,  if  necessary, the various chambers of commerce  should

work  together  with  the relevant authorities  so  that  the

measures could be more effective in their implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enterprises should look at the long-term perspective

and  take  this opportunity to reposition themselves  and  to

restructure  their  businesses so  that  they  could  perform

better  after  the  economy  has turned  around.   With  this

package  announced  by  the  Government,  apart  from   being

grateful   to   the   Government   for   understanding    our

difficulties, we also hope that the Government would  quickly

implement  these measures so that they could  have  immediate

effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also hope that the Government would allow these

measures  to be implemented over a longer period of time  and

to  avoid  withdrawing these measures the moment the  economy

turns  around, like in the past. I think we should  give  the

businesses some breathing space so that they will be able  to

recover from this crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that so long as we could

maintain  and  manifest this spirit of tripartism  among  the

Government, the labour and the management,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>



with  each  party  giving  its best,  and  all  working  with

sincerity  and  unity,  we  will surely  pull  through  these

difficult times and head for a brighter future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, first of all, I do not understand Mr Low  Thia

Khiang's  remarks.   I think we should  not  give  the  wrong

impression to our people.  The important point here  is  that

during a recession, when any citizen cannot afford to pay for

his  or  his children's education fees, we have all kinds  of

financial  assistance schemes to help him. There  are  always

various  kinds  of  bursaries available to the  students,  to

ensure  that they are not deprived of the opportunity  to  be

educated just because they could not afford the fees.  I  can

say this with full conviction because in the 1980s during the

economic  recession, I was one of those  who  depended  on  a

bursary to complete my studies.  For others who require  help

to pay for their utilities bills, HDB rentals, loans, etc, we

are also providing them with various kinds of assistance.  We

must  make them feel assured that help is on the way  or  has

been  given to them.  We should not exacerbate their  worries

and concerns or they will not be able to sleep properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the DPM's $11.3 billion

package.   It  is  a  comprehensive  and  wide-ranging   help

package.    From  the  big  businessmen  to  the   small-time

stallholders, from management staff to ordinary  workers  and

so  on, to students, undergraduates, graduates, they have all

been considered in this package so that everybody can benefit

from  it.   I  believe that this package can  allow  all  our

people to pull through the crisis and preserve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>



their  energy so that when the economy turns over, they  will

emerge stronger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a story that goes like this:

an  intelligent person came across a fish which was caught in

a  small  puddle of water.  The fish pleaded  with  the  man,

"Please  save  me!  Give me the water that you have  in  your

container."   The intelligent man replied,  "The  sun  is  so

strong  and it is so hot here.  Even if I give you the  whole

container of water, it will not last long as it will  dry  up

soon, and you will die in due course.  So, I am going to  dig

a canal all the way from the seaside to here so that you will

be  able to swim to the sea and stay alive."  The fish sighed

and  said,  "By then, I would have become a dried fish."   In

this  story, the thinking of both the sage and the  fish  was

not  wrong.  But, a well thought out plan that takes ages  to

be  implemented  will  not save a man in immediate  distress.

When  we  are in a predicament, we need immediate reliefs  to

solve  our immediate problems.  But, of course, we  must  not

lose  sight  of long-term effective solutions.  So,  at  this

time,  we must depend on the Government to look after  us  in

the  short  term, and at the same time, plan  for  long  term

strategies to keep us in good stead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present circumstances, our tripartite partners

should  stay united to maintain our competitive edge, in  the

hope  that  we can see the happy situation of full-employment

again in the not too distant future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, right now we are facing an economic

crisis  which is quite different from the past.   Apart  from

workers  from  the  manufacturing industry, particularly  the

electronics   industry,  employees  in  financial,   banking,

airlines  and all the various logistics companies - even  our

white-collar  workers - are affected.   There  is  a  Teochew

saying  to  the effect that where the shade is, you  sit  and

enjoy the cool.  To that, I want to add:  wherever there is a

job,  you will go and grab it.  How do we help our workers go

to  where the work is?  The important thing is that  we  must

strengthen  our  work-matching efforts, that  is,  train  our

workers  to  turn  to other jobs where they can  have  better

prospects.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>



this  package,  the  extension of the  period  for  the  wage

subsidy  will  also  be  a piece of very  good  news  to  our

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lower income group, the high utility bill driven

by  increasing oil price is a perpetual headache.  So this is

a  good  time  to lower the electricity tariff to  help  them

lighten  their  burden.  The Government understands  workers'

difficulties  by giving them a 10% rebate for  their  medical

bills.  I am particularly moved by the Government's effort to

further  give  the retrenched workers another 40%  off  their

hospital bills.  This is really xue zhong song tan -  sending

hot burning charcoal in snowy weather.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the $20 million in the package to help the

unemployed  workers, I think it is a very  timely  help.   It

gives  them three months' help in their daily lives.  In  the

past  few  months,  during our meet-the-people  sessions,  we

frequently come across workers who come to us for help.  I do

not  agree  with what Mr Low Thia Khiang said that  the  $200

subsidy was a pittance and useless in helping the unemployed.

In fact, the $200 can ensure that we have a continuous supply

of  water  and electricity in our flats.  It can  give  us  a

basic livelihood.  At this time, I think this subsidy is very

timely.  It is welcomed.  I do not understand why some people

feel that this package is not necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has done so much. I hope to see that the

people in the grassroots also show more care and concern  for

the  people.   For  example,  the coffeeshop  and  restaurant

owners  can pass down some of the benefits they will  receive

in  the  form  of  rental  and  utilities  rebates  to  their

stallholders.  The coffeeshop owners should also  adjust  the

prices  of their beverages and food so as to help our  people

tide over this difficult period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past eight months, from January to August

this year, the HDB has helped about 8,000 residents tide over

their  difficulties by adjusting their housing loan repayment

period.  I hope that the HDB can also consider the plight  of

the   shop   tenants  by  giving  them  similar   sympathetic

treatment.   Do  not  pressurise them  too  much  when  their

rentals are in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>



arrears.   Recently, one shop owner came to me  and  told  me

that  he  was  in financial difficulties and had  received  a

lawyer's letter from HDB threatening him that if he failed to

pay up the rental arrears immediately, he would be liable for

all  legal costs to be incurred subsequently.  I believe  HDB

should be more sympathetic towards the small-time businessmen

who are in genuine financial hardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in 1997, during the economic crisis, we

also  had  provisions for every sector to help their  workers

tide over the difficult period.  In 1998, we appealed to  the

public  transport operators to pass on the benefit of rebates

to  their  commuters to help workers tide over the  difficult

times.   I was glad that the Government effected a 5%  rebate

on  public transport charges for the whole year of  1999,  so

that  commuters who take public transportation to work, would

enjoy  lower  transportation cost.  I  hope  that  this  time

round,  during this present recession, which is more  serious

than  that in 1999, similar arrangements can be made to  help

our  workers.   I hope that the bus companies will  seriously

consider this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has addressed the issues of many

people  and  many  workers have taken  the  heed  to  upgrade

themselves.   Now  it is for the business community  to  look

into ways and means to cooperate in the tripartite spirit  so

that  we can come out with more effective solutions.  I would

like  to  appeal to the employers that before  they  retrench

their workers, they should consider other means first, as was

the agreement among the tripartite partners in 1997.  At that

time,  the  three parties agreed that during  the  recession,

retrenchment  of workers would be the last  resort.   I  also

hope that, in the unfortunate event the company has to resort

to  retrenchment, the employer should be more sympathetic and

compassionate to the workers, by giving the workers more time

and  longer  notice before they are retrenched.   You  cannot

just  give them a phone call and kick them out.  I hope  that

the  employers will be able to reduce that kind of grievances

and pains to the workers.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this off-Budget package of $11.3

billion is better than the $10 billion as predicted by  many.

It  is  better by some 13%.  Compared to $2.2 billion of  the

previous  package, it is about five times more.   It  can  be

seen  that  the  present   recession  is  indeed  very,  very

serious.   It  also  shows  that  the  Government   has   the

determination  to  help the people who are affected  by  this

recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package basically comprises four main points.

First, it reduces business cost  to keep the businesses  from

collapsing;  secondly, it helps to preserve  jobs  and   help

those  who  have lost their jobs to go through the  difficult

period;   thirdly,   it    enhances   and   accelerates   our

infrastructure  construction to stimulate the  economy;  and,

fourthly, it prepares us for the future challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, unemployment rate has been climbing from last

year's  2.2% to the present 4%.  By the end of this year,  it

is  likely  to  reach 4.5%.  I believe some  20,000  will  be

workers  retrenched this year.  There are so many people  who

have  lost their jobs.  At a time like this, I believe  those

affected workers really do not know where to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the Deputy Prime Minister's statement, I

feel as though I have been given a shot in the arm.  With all

the  various  measures  announced  in  the  package,  he  has

certainly  given something for everyone, and the much  needed

help to the workers to tide them over for the time being.  On

the  one  hand, opportunities for retraining are provided  to

the  workers to prepare them for better jobs to come, and  on

the  other  hand, more money will be pumped into  the  Skills

Development  Fund  to  finance training  programmes  and  pay

training allowances to the workers. I think if the people are

interested  in  upgrading  themselves,  by  undergoing  these

training courses, they will certainly benefit from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the individual side, the Citizens' Consultative

Committees (CCCs) are vested with the authority to disburse a

subsidy of $200 per month to every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>



deserving  resident in the constituency, under  the  Economic

Downturn  Relief Scheme.  This subsidy will  help  to  defray

the  expenses of the unemployed individual and  help  him  go

through the training.  Once he falls sick, his hospital bills

will  be reduced by up to 50%, and beyond that, there is  the

Medifund  which  can  help the very bad  cases.   So  medical

expenses  should  not be a problem, even to  the  unemployed.

With  the  utilities rebate, HDB rental rebates and  deferred

payment  of housing loans, etc, in the short-term, those  who

are  retrenched or who are unemployed will heave  a  sigh  of

relief.     But  no  matter what kind of package  you  offer,

there  is bound to be some categories of people who  are  not

covered,  for example, the old people of 50 or 60  years  old

and above. Perhaps, our Community Development Councils (CDCs)

can  find  some  ways to help such people on  a  case-by-case

basis,  according  to  their  individual   circumstances.   I

believe  if  we  can  do this, then this package  would  have

covered  almost the entire population. Anyone who needs  help

will get  help under this  package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, some companies may feel that they

have  too many workers in hand.  Their expenses are too  high

and  they have no choice but to cut cost in its struggle  for

survival.  These people can make use of the various  measures

in  the  package to save their costs and help tide  over  the

difficult  times.   As  for  those companies  with  redundant

workers, apart from retrenchment, they can resort to  SDF  to

get  about 50% subsidy to send these workers for training  to

get  ready  for the good time when the economy turns  around.

Then  they will have a choice to retain their workers  or  to

retrain  them  for future use, and they will  have  a  better

future.   So on this side, this series of measures  can  help

our  businessmen in cost-cutting and provide subsidies to pay

for  their workers' salaries.  It is very beneficial and will

help the companies to survive.  It will also help our workers

to keep their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring forward our infrastructure construction is the

normal practice in times of economic downturn to create



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>



jobs  and  to  stimulate the economy.  This time round,  some

$3.5 billion worth of projects are in the pipeline.  This  is

very  important to our construction industry.   I  hope  that

when  we  have so many projects available, amounting to  $3.5

billion, we can go step by step, with numerous small projects

to  benefit more contractors.  Some people may have  no  idea

what   is   the   magnitude  of   $3.5   billion   worth   of

infrastructure development.  Let me tell them  that  you  can

build two Chua Chu Kang new towns with that amount.  So it is

a  very  massive  amount.    Within  a  short  time,  it  can

stimulate the building construction industry and bring it out

of its doldrums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has certain regulations for the purchase of

flats. This package has made provision for the payment of the

20%  downpayment to be spread over a longer period.   On  the

other   hand,   the   private  property  buyers,   especially

foreigners, can use Singapore dollar loans to purchase  their

property  and  the  exemption  from  capital  gains  tax  for

property  sales. I think this will also give a boost  to  the

building  industry.  Basically, the building industry  is  in

the  doldrums for a long period.  There are many reasons, one

of  which  is  man-made.   Although this  man-made  deterrent

factor  is not completely removed by this package, the  other

concessions  given  can  stimulate  our  building   industry,

thereby   giving  our  building  industry  players  and   the

construction workers a ray of hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the global trend of globalisation and transition

into  a  knowledge-based  economy, we  have  to  prepare  our

workers  for the future. As we know, the economy of Singapore

is  in  a  restructuring phase.  This is  the  time  for  our

workers  to  go  for training and retraining.  The  unskilled

workers  should  go for training to become  skilled  workers,

while the skilled workers should go for further retraining to

enhance their skills. Those with low education should go  for

enrichment  studies  to  raise their educational  level.   We

should use the low period to retrain our people.  I think  it

is  very important that we prepare and equip our workers  and

enterprises so that when the time comes, they will  be  in  a

position to seize the right opportunity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for issue of employment pass and work

permit  have been reviewed.  I believe this is a step in  the

right  direction to prepare us for the future.   As  for  the

New  Singapore Shares, not much details have been given.  The

total   amount  is  $2.7  billion.   I  have  made  a  mental

calculation.  With a population of 3 million, on the average,

each citizen should get about $1,000.  For a small family  of

four,  you  get about $4,000.  If they stay in a small  flat,

with  a  lower income, they get more.  It may well be  double

the  amount, say, $8,000. On the average, each family  should

get  about $5,000.  You get a guaranteed 3% dividend  on  the

$5,000.   Then,  with economic growth, you  would  get  extra

bonus  shares.   So,  every Singaporean family  would  get  a

direct  benefit  of $5,000, plus interest of  some  5-6%  per

year.  The New Singapore Shares are indeed a great gift  from

the Government, by their conscience, to the people.  Even  at

this  difficult  time,  the people  are  able  to  share  the

benefits of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other angle, during the recession, people need

a lot of money.  The market also needs injection of money and

funds.   So when the New Singapore Shares are issued  and  by

March next year, some of the recipients will cash it.  Let us

say,  in  the  next six months, some 50% of  the  shares  are

cashed, there will be $1.35 billion of cash flowing into  the

market. This will surely stimulate consumption in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the entire package, we can say that the Government

has  really taken into consideration all the difficulties and

hardship of the people in various stations of life,  and  has

given  them  a very strong stimulus and a shot  in  the  arm.

After  the package has been implemented, we will get our  own

shares  or  benefits.  In the process,  the  people  who  are

suffering  from  the impact of the economic downturn  can  be

given  a  helping  hand  to  prepare  themselves  for  future

opportunities when the economy turns around.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

believe that we must thank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  for this very generous, comprehensive,  bold

and  far-reaching package of $11.3 billion.  I agree with  my

colleague,  Prof. Low Seow Chay, that it is a  good  economic

package.   It is definitely not an election ploy, as  alleged

by  the Opposition.  I believe that this package deserves the

support of all Singaporeans regardless of party line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are facing a crisis of enormous proportions, and

where  the people are crying out for help, it would be  wrong

not  to  do  something about it.  It will  be  wrong  not  to

support such a package.  We should do what is in our national

interest  and  what  is  good for  the  common  good  of  all

Singaporeans.   I  am therefore glad that the  Government  is

leaving  no stone unturned and taking all necessary steps  to

assist  the  lower  income families, the unemployed  and  the

elderly.   In  particular, I welcome  the  Economic  Downturn

Relief  Scheme  which  I  believe will  bring  immediate  and

practical assistance to affected families, and help  them  to

tide over the current recession.  The involvement of the CCCs

and grassroots leaders is a plus point, as I believe that the

grassroots  leaders know the ground well and they can  better

administer  such a scheme.   They can follow up  by  visiting

the families and take follow up action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the more stringent criteria for the issue

of  employment passes and work permits.  This  will  help  to

address  the  concern of some Singaporeans on the competition

for  jobs  in the recession.  However, we must bear  in  mind

that  there is no doubt that we need good foreign workers  to

ensure  our economic competitiveness.  The world is changing.

If  we  do not have good foreign workers, we may not get  the

investments  that we need to produce better results  for  all

Singaporeans.  At the same time, the higher criteria for such

permits  will ensure better selection and give a  balance  to

the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hail the move by the Government for a

voluntary  monthly wage cut of 10% for senior civil servants,

political  office  holders  and  Members  of  Parliament.   I

commend the Government for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>



the  sacrifice that it is undertaking for the common good  of

our  people,  and  setting an excellent example  of  selfless

service   to  the  people.   By  this  move,  the  Government

demonstrates clearly that it understands the problems of  the

man-in-the-street, that it stands shoulder to  shoulder  with

the  people  and  bond with the people,  in  this  moment  of

crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has shown the way for us in this

crisis.  All Singaporeans must rally and unite as one  people

behind the Government.  Then our future will be secured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has weathered many storms before, since

our  separation  from Malaysia in 1965.  This  crisis  is  no

different.  We shall overcome, but we must keep faith and run

the race.  No problem is insurmountable if the people and the

Government  work closely hand in hand to face the  challenges

ahead.  Sir, make no mistake about it.  We, as a people, will

emerge  stronger from this crisis and we will have  a  deeper

sense of common destiny and nationhood.



<br>4.08 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for

this opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are faced with the worst recession this country

has  seen  in  more  than  30 years.  With  unemployment  now

hovering at about 4% and potentially rising, there is an  air

of  uncertainty  that hangs over us.  For the  many  who  are

employed,  they are now less confident that their  jobs  will

remain  for the future; and for those who have recently  lost

their  jobs,  there is less certainty that  their  jobs  will

return when the shower of recession passes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that this recession did not come about from

within,  but  from without.  Economic forces not  within  our

control have buffeted us since last year, beginning with  the

slowdown  of  the US economy.  And it did not help  that  the

September  11  terror  attacks  on  America  accelerated  and

deepened  the  recession.  Indeed, one  would  say  that  the

September 11 attacks had hastened the slide of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>



world  economy.  For Singapore whose economic well  being  is

much  dependent on exports to the US and the other  developed

countries, this is bad news indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not surprised therefore when Ministers George Yeo

and  Richard  Hu informed the people that the  economy  would

shrink  by  perhaps more than 3% this year.  This is  perhaps

unprecedented  as our people cannot remember  a  time,  since

independence, when the economy did so poorly.  For the  post-65  generation,  accustomed to robust growth,  these  figures

bring   home   the  reality  of  our  vulnerability    -    a

vulnerability  that  tells us that we too  can  be  as  badly

affected  as our neighbours were in the last Asian  financial

crisis of 1998.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told to be prepared for the long haul. The

economy does not look like it is going to recover before  the

second  half of next year.  And beyond that, many have  their

doubts  as  to  whether or not there will  be  any  signs  of

recovery if the global situation remains unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond these figures, for the people of Singapore, the

teeth  of  recession  will  begin to  bite  when  people  get

retrenched and when there is less money to bring home.  These

are  real concerns, as with unemployment and salary cuts, the

pressures of paying their bills will surely mount.  How  will

the  utilities bills be paid?  Will there be money to pay for

conservancy  charges?  How will the fees for  the  children's

school and tuition be provided for?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, Sir, I am gratified that the

Government  has  come  up with a second round  of  off-Budget

measures.   The  series  of measures  are  clearly  aimed  at

providing  relief  for the individuals and  businesses.  What

Singaporeans  must  know and realise is that  the  Government

cares.   Earlier this year, when the first round of  measures

was introduced by Minister George Yeo, he mentioned then,  if

I  may  paraphrase, that there was a drizzle, but  we  should

nonetheless  have  our umbrella ready  in  case  there  is  a

shower.   Now  that  the  shower is upon  us,  the  umbrella,

represented by these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>



measures,  should provide Singaporeans with much  relief  and

protection from the rain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we done enough? Should we do more and can we give

more?  Are all Singaporeans covered by these measures?  There

are no doubt questions that have been asked and no doubt will

be   asked   by  many  Singaporeans.   These  are  legitimate

questions.  However, even before we begin to ponder on  these

questions,  we  should  sit  back  and  appreciate  what  the

Government has done, ponder on the greater challenge and  the

greater worries ahead of us, and think of our response  as  a

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accepting these measures, we must look at the horizon

and  beyond.   We must realise that Singapore  has  a  narrow

export    base    that   is   concentrated   on   electronics

manufacturing.   Over  the years, our  global  share  of  the

electronics  market  has  been  dwindling  because  of   keen

competition  from emerging economies.  Both India  and  China

and  other  emerging  economies  are  increasingly  competing

directly  in  our  export turf.  Our present  cost  structure

makes  it  difficult  for  us to  compete  effectively.   The

result,  as  we  are  beginning to see,  and  we  are  seeing

elsewhere, is a hollowing out of our manufacturing  industry.

With  the hollowing out of our manufacturing industry,  there

will  be  a  greater displacement of jobs.  How do we  ensure

that our people can continue to stay employed in a meaningful

manner in the face of these challenges ahead of us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we succeed in economic restructuring, our very

own   economic  survival  may  be  at  stake.   When  we  are

confronted  with questions like our long-term  survival,  the

other  questions relating to civil liberties and human rights

pale   by   comparison.   Just  so  that  I   will   not   be

misunderstood,  Sir, I am not saying that  these  issues  are

unimportant.  Indeed they are.  What I am saying is  that  we

need  to  maintain a proper perspective and  balance  to  the

issues at hand.  The reality is that no one speaks philosophy

on an empty stomach.  The basic physical needs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>



must  be provided for now and secured for the future.   There

is  a  choice  to  be  made.  We can either  close  ranks  in

uncertain times and collectively seek to bring in more grains

for  the  family or we can choose to bicker and stay divided,

while  the  result is the family goes hungry.  We can  either

choose  to  be  grateful for what we have  and  treasure  the

present for the future, or we can gripe about what we do  not

have and gamble the future with what we have for the present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced a series of measures that

seek to help Singaporeans stay the course for the moment.  No

doubt,  we will have to restructure the economy to deal  with

the  challenges of the future and, no doubt, our people  will

have  to  be  retooled  to  meet the  demands  of  tomorrow's

economy.   But  for  the  moment, against  a  bleak  economic

landscape,  we  will  have to dig in and  stay  united  as  a

people,  believing as always that we will  ride  through  the

rough  economic weather together.  We have done this  before,

in  1968, in 1973, in 1985 and, more recently, in 1998.  Now,

more than ever, we face the biggest challenge yet.  I have no

doubt that if the people's confidence remains reposed in  the

Government,  as  they have done in the  past,  we  will  ride

through this stormy weather together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing me to join in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that Mr Sin Boon Ann has given a Churchillian

speech here, but I am afraid that the Opposition do not agree

with  him.  It is true that this round, the downturn  of  the

economy  is  unlike the others. In 1963/64, we  had  the  oil

crises.   In 1985/86, we had the economic downturn, and  then

recently  in  1997/98 we had the financial crisis.   So  this

time it is apparently quite different and it is quite serious

because  it  is not purely on costs alone.  It is a  cyclical

effect.   From what I know of cyclical effect, world  economy

rises  like waves.  Now we are apparently in the trough.   So

we  have  to wait for things to turn around and get into  the

crest again.  I suppose the $11.3 billion off-Budget



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>



measures  can  help Singaporeans and Singapore businesses  to

tide over this period.  Hopefully, it would not be too long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Prof. Low Seow Chay has given four reasons for

these particular off-Budget measures.  But I can think of the

fifth  reason.   I think the fifth reason is also  political.

Election is just around the corner.  It has a bearing on  the

off-Budget measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a targeted approach to those who are unemployed.

What  does  it  mean  by "targeted"?  It  is  quite  surgical

actually.  Of course, Government's main policy is it does not

believe  in giving away handouts.  But when it comes  to  the

Government's purpose, the PAP's purpose, their own rules  are

all not taken account of.  I mention this because I am in the

Opposition and we feel it.  The Government MPs, of course, do

not  feel  it.  How do you like, if you are in a constituency

like  Potong Pasir working very hard, trying to do a  lot  of

things for the people, when your prospective candidate  comes

along, knocks at the door and asks, "Are you in some sort  of

trouble?  Here you are, $200."?  Or, "Here is a coupon  ($40)

for  you  to buy your rice and your bread."  [Interruptions.]

No,  these  are Government funds he is giving away.   CDC  is

Government fund.  So when I read about this targeted help for

certain people, I begin to wonder how does it affect  us  and

the  Opposition.   And then giving away New Singapore  Shares

free  of charge!  I think Prof. Low Seow Chay again has  made

it  very clear, in fact, about a small family in an HDB  flat

who is very poor, and here you have somebody coming along  to

give  them  $1,000 or $2,000, and in the end, they  ended  up

with  $5,000 shares.  How do you think this family will feel?

You  give him the money, of course he accepts.  What  do  you

think?   He  is  not  going to say "no".    Surely,  he  will

definitely accept the money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point is this: we are not supposed to give away

things  free.   You have to earn your money and  if  somebody

comes to give you something free, obviously you are obligated

to him.  So, to put it more frankly, I think this is buying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>



votes.  No doubt, these schemes are all supposed to be  quite

altruistic  to  help  people tide over  this  very  difficult

economic  situation  in  Singapore,  which,  I  believe,  the

Government  wants to do.  But the way they do it  is  a  very

great   disadvantage  to  the  Opposition.   So,   obviously,

politics  has a part to play in this $11.3 billion off-Budget

measures.  At first, it was only $2.2 billion - that was  not

many months ago - and suddenly this amount has increased five

times.  I was wondering why suddenly it has increased to five

times.   So  they must add in all these things,  like  giving

away  shares  free of charge, giving away money  to  targeted

people  who are in need of money.  So probably you  add  them

all up, it comes to $11.3 billion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget is basically, from what I have heard from

many  speakers here, to tide over this very difficult period.

I  have never heard this will improve our economy.  I suppose

even with the people in the PAP think tank, we cannot improve

the  economic situation at this point.  We just have  to  sit

and  wait.   It  is  just  like a  flu.   There  is  no  cure

apparently for flu.  You just have to let it take its course.

So  I  hope the Government will admit that this is a kind  of

flu,  an  economic flu, where they cannot do anything.   They

just  have  to  sit tight, give some financial  help  to  the

unemployed, people who are sick, old age and those in the HDB

flats  who  are given lower rentals.  Just sit  and  hang  on

until  the  whole  thing is over, until  good  weather  comes

again.   My  point is that even how smart the  PAP  is,  they

cannot do anything about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Inderjit Singh has mentioned about taking

away  the  anti-speculative measures in land.  I  agree  with

him.   The  Government believes that land value  just  cannot

escalate sky high all of a sudden.  That will cause a  bubble

effect, people become multi-millionaires overnight.  It shows

that  the Government wants land prices to be high.  And  then

the  suspension  of land sales makes land become  more  rare,

thus  the prices will go higher.  The point is this: if  land

prices  go  higher,  and with all these  off-Budget  measures

given to, say, an HDB dweller, and he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>



saves  a  bit  of money, and when the time comes  to  upgrade

himself,  when times are better, all the prices of land  will

shoot  sky  high and all that the savings that  he  has  been

given  by the Government will go into the purchase of  a  new

flat.   So where does he stand?  He is still not much better,

despite  the  $11.3  billion  off-Budget  measures  that  are

supposedly given to him.  All these tens of dollars  that  he

can  save from all these off-Budget measures will be used  up

when he buys a new flat which costs hundreds of thousands  of

dollars.   So  I  do  not know.  It seems  that  this  policy

counter-cancels each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I hear training for the retrenched. I have heard

this  many times.  Whenever there is a problem, it is  always

retraining.  We have so many retraining programmes.  What  is

happening to all these retraining programmes?  Are they doing

any  good  at  all to the workers?  I personally  think  that

there  is something wrong with our education system.  I think

we  should  start in our schools.  We should  teach  them  to

read,  write and converse properly in English, and  let  them

understand  the  language.  Without an understanding  of  the

language, you can learn nothing.  So we should go back to the

basics  -  teach them the 3R's, teach them the right attitude

towards work and the willingness to change their work when it

needs  be.   I think that will save a lot of these retraining

programmes that we have been speaking of many times  in  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is I do agree that we should have pump

priming.  But in your pump priming measures I see that  there

is no pump priming in building more schools.  I have objected

many times in this House and said that our classes of 40  are

too  large.   You cannot teach a class of 40.  No  wonder  so

many of our students leave school without even knowing how to

read  and  write  proper  English.   I  think  there  is   no

opportunity to teach them properly.  So we must have  smaller

classes.  If we have more smaller classes, you just  have  to

build  more  schools.  I do not see any of this  money  going

into building more schools.  I wish they did.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>



think we need at least another 25% more schools built.   Then

you  can  have one-quarter less of our school size.   At  the

moment,  we  have  got  about 40.  I think  30  should  be  a

manageable  size.  And I wish some of this money will  go  to

activate the economy, pass the money around a bit to go  into

building  more schools - 25% more schools than what  we  have

today.  I see the Minister for Education is not here today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome, of course, lowering of rentals in HDB flats.

HDB  shopkeepers are for many months now in a bit  of  a  fix

with  very,  very poor business, mainly because young  people

have changed their style of living and they do not believe in

shopping  in  their  own neighbourhood shops  anymore.   They

prefer  to  go  to  the supermarket and nice  air-conditioned

shops  to  do their shopping.  So I think anything that  they

can do to help the HDB shops are welcome by me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the rebates given to HDB flat dwellers.

In the first place, why should water and electricity bills be

so  high?  If you keep them low, you do not have to give them

all  these  rebates.  So I hope that after all these  rebates

have been given, like what Mr Low Thia Khiang said, all these

utilities bills should remain permanently low.  It shows that

with  the  need to give rebates, all these bills and  charges

are definitely too high.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your

permission to clarify what Mr Chiam said?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Thank you, Sir. Mr Chiam lamented

in  his speech just now, complaining that the prospective PAP

candidate is giving money in his constituency.  He said  that

the  Opposition could feel it.  I am afraid I have to clarify

that   I  have  a  different  view,  because  he  said   "all

Opposition".  Sir, I have no complaint if the prospective PAP

candidate in my constituency gives away assistance and money.

I think he should give more, the more the merrier.  I welcome

it.  I would be worried if he is not giving.  Then I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>



be   asking:    "Is   the  PAP  Government   treating   every

constituency the same and fairly?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe, and I am confident, Sir, that the

voters  in Hougang cannot be bought over just by giving  them

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

just  heard from Mr Low that Mr Chiam does not speak for  the

Opposition in this House and I wonder whether Mr Chiam speaks

for  his  constituents in this House.  He has  said  that  we

should  not  give away anything for free.  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister  has  given  out a list of the  measures  just  now.

Perhaps  Mr  Chiam would like to tick off what he thinks  his

constituents  should not be getting.  I am  sure  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister would be quite ready to oblige him by  taking

this off and not making it available to his constituents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my part, Sir, I rise in support of the Ministerial

Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister to tackle the economic

downturn.   At  a  recent  dialogue,  someone  asked  me   in

reference to the emergence of China as an economic  power  to

the US as a magnet for talents, and to Singapore for our lack

of  competitive advantage.  He asked me, "Have we gone beyond

the  limits  of  our development?  Have we  over-reached  our

potential?"   He went on to say that Singaporeans  have  been

told  time and again that we are, or can be, the best in this

and  that.  Perhaps it is time that we be realistic and teach

our  young to lower their expectations of the good  life  and

accept being not the best.  I told him in no uncertain  terms

that  that was not a viable option for us to build  a  secure

future.  That kind of spirit will be the start of the end  of

Singapore  as we know it.  We may be a little down  for  now,

but  we are certainly not out.  As a nation, we have overcome

enormous  difficulties in the past.  We must not lose  heart,

and we will prevail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these off-Budget measures are comprehensive, broad-based and touch on the concerns of Singaporeans across-the-board. They must also be considered together with all the

other prudent policies, programmes and measures that the  PAP

Government has been putting in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>



place  all  along, both in good times as well as  bad  times.

These  measures  can  be grouped into  two  main  categories:

first,  those  measures that will help affected Singaporeans,

both  businesses and individuals, to tide over this difficult

period  by  way of cost cutting and income support;   second,

measures  to  help Singapore as a nation, and  this  requires

both  businesses  and individuals to do our part  to  adjust,

restructure and upgrade our skills and capabilities so as  to

be  more competitive in the changed economic environment that

will emerge from the present economic downturn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the worst recession since Independence.

Contrary  to  Mr Chiam's opinion that it is only cyclical,  I

think it is a very structural and very fundamental change  in

the  economic  environment.  It is made  worse  because  many

industries and companies have barely started to recover  from

the  last financial and economic crisis when their businesses

were  hit  again early this year.  The decline was too  quick

and  devastating.   Many  people were expecting  a  recovery,

whether  described as "V-shape" or "U-shape",  as  one  would

normally  expect  after the downturn.  Many  did  not  expect

another recession to come so soon after.  Many did not expect

the  severity  of this recession.  Measures to help  affected

businesses and individuals in the near term to alleviate some

of the pain and hardship are therefore very crucial for their

survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost-cutting measures give us some breathing space.

Income  support schemes lighten our financial burden for  the

time being to tide us over while we consolidate and wait  for

the  dark clouds to pass.  I am happy to find in this package

measures  that  many  people have  been  asking  for.   These

include  improved  access  to funds  for  local  enterprises,

reduction of business costs through property tax rebates  and

lower   petrol  prices,  diesel  tax  and  utility   charges,

extension  of HDB loan scheme and S&CC rebates  and  the  New

Singapore Shares which are free and pay a guaranteed  minimum

of  3%  per  annum.  I welcome this scheme  which  is  unlike

previous sale of shares in Government companies where  people

have to pay for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>



those  shares  and have been disappointed by  the  inadequate

returns  or  the losses from such investments.  Further,  the

New  Singapore  Shares  pay bonus  dividends  pegged  to  the

preceding  year's GDP growth.  This is important,  especially

in  a  downturn,  as people will find the  extra  money  most

useful.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.35 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot disagree more with Mr Chiam's opinion that

we  should just sit and wait.  We cannot afford to simply sit

tight and wait for the storm to pass.  While cost cutting can

reduce  our expenditure and income support can alleviate  our

burden, this must not distract us from the need to take other

painful  measures, painful decisions to adjust  and  position

ourselves  to  be  more  competitive  in  the  future.    All

businesses  and individuals must actively look  out  for  new

opportunities and seize them.  To be in a better position  to

achieve  that,  some may need to reorganise and  acquire  new

capabilities.   This package contains important  measures  on

People  for  Jobs Traineeship Programme, Skills Redevelopment

Programme and the SDF funding.  To just rely on cost  cutting

and   income  support  alone  is  like  surviving   on   your

accumulated  savings.  Someone who has  been  retrenched  may

have  some savings in cash.  He may live on this for a while.

But  these  savings  are finite and would  soon  be  depleted

unless  he  is  able to replenish them by earning  wages  and

making  profits.  His old job may never come back again  even

when  times  are better.  To gain a new income, he  must  see

where  the  prospects are, reorganise his skills and  acquire

new ones to fit into those prospects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this recession is the most severe economic crisis

since Independence.  The economy shrank a devastating 5.6% in

the  third  quarter.   It is estimated  that  the  number  of

unemployed may hit 80,000, or 4% of the workforce.  Our  near

term prospects are bleak.  This has prompted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>



the  implementation of this package worth a  total  of  $11.3

billion.   I  am  very  relieved to  note  that  the  present

Government  is  able  to  finance this  entire  package  from

surpluses accumulated since it took office in 1997.  But some

people said times are so bad that we should dip into our past

reserves.   I would like to take a moment here to reflect  on

this point.  Some said things cannot get any worse than this.

But is this the worst case that can happen?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent times, it is hard for us, especially for the

young, to fathom the financial cost of armed conflicts.  Wars

and  conflicts occur in far-off places, like Bosnia, Chechnya

and  Sri  Lanka.  We see pictures of the dead and the injured

and  can empathise with the human suffering.  But what is the

financial  cost  of the devastation?  What  is  required  for

repairs  and  rebuilding?  Consider for a moment  the  damage

caused  by the recent terrorist attacks on Manhattan and  the

collapse  of the World Trade Centre.  The financial  cost  to

New  York city runs into more than $100 billion and the  city

is seeking US$54 billion in Federal aid to help its recovery.

We  can  then just begin to imagine how much more is required

to  rebuild an entire nation if some form of conflict were to

occur.  The conflict on the other side of the world has  only

just started.  The definition of "war", in this instance,  is

not clear.  The physical arena may not be contained.  How  it

will  develop  and end, no one can tell.  We do  not  have  a

Federal government we can look to for aid.  I think we should

be  very  prudent before dipping into our protected  reserves

too early.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the off-Budget measures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I have the opportunity to

clarify  with Mr Ong Kian Min?  Sir, I certainly did not  say

that I want Mr Goh to stop the residents at Potong Pasir from

accepting the shares.  In fact, I did say that if shares,  or

anything  free  is  given  to a resident,  it  will  be  most

welcomed.   But  I  also  did  say  that  the  receiver  will

certainly be obliged to the giver.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

I welcome the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>



Government's  announcement of this package.  It  costs  $11.3

billion, and it is a lot of money.  In fact, I was very happy

at  the  size of the package that was announced.  And  I  was

even  happier  that I am going to explain to my  constituents

how  helpful the Government was until I heard the  speech  by

the  hon.  Member for Hougang.  His basic point was that  the

Government was not doing enough.  He highlighted the instance

of  the  $200  financial  assistance  package  and  that  the

Government  could do more.  What I wanted to hear  from  him,

perhaps  later on, is whether he will clarify  how  much  the

Government should help each individual Singaporean.  Perhaps,

he  has  the figure in mind.  Similarly, the hon. Member  for

Potong Pasir said that the utility charges should be as cheap

as  possible.  Perhaps, he could tell us how cheap should the

utility  charges be.  If it is a possibility, then he  should

go  on  and set up a utilities company and offer these  cheap

services.  I am quite sure the relevant Minister can consider

the  cheapest  utilities service for all Singaporeans.   But,

Sir,  what is frightening is this tendency to highlight  that

we must try to give as much to Singaporeans as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my interaction with Singaporeans shows that

Singaporeans  are people with dignity.  And  at  times,  they

feel  very  shy  even to approach the relevant  agencies  for

assistance.  This sense of dignity is something important and

it  is something that the Government has worked very  hard to

ensure  that  everybody keeps it and every Singaporean  walks

with his shoulders raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very easy to call upon the Government to

spend  the  reserves  because we have  built  up  a  sizeable

reserve.   But  we must be very careful and always  have  the

long picture or the long path ahead of us in mind whenever we

consider measures.  It reminds me of a classic case which  is

highlighted  in  many management studies where  a  person  is

flying on a plane across a desert, the plane crashes and  the

person  survives with a bottle of water.  The choice that  he

has is that when he is thirsty, he can take several



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>



gulps and continue the uncertain journey without any water in

the  bottle, or he can take sips along the way, or even forgo

the  water for the time being and hope that he will reach  an

oasis, or a town, or some other resourceful place, very soon.

If everybody were to take the choice that has been offered by

the  hon.  Member  for Hougang, whereby everybody  takes  the

immediate  gulp  and finishes the water immediately,  then  I

think  what we will have is a lot of dead Singaporeans  in  a

very short period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are very thoughtful. They are aware that

this  Government  cares for them, but  it  cares  with  great

prudence that we have to conserve our resources for the  long

run  because the path ahead is uncertain.  Everybody  thought

that the 1997 crisis was the last crisis.  But, here, we have

another  crisis.   In the last four days,  some  people  have

become  optimistic  and  they said that  things  have  turned

around.   But  the FBI has just issued another  warning  that

terrorist  attacks can be expected and we may have a  further

economic crisis.  So we need all these resources and we  must

dispense them prudently and judiciously.  While the  call  of

the  hon.  Member for Hougang looks very attractive and  very

easy,  I  think that is not the slippery path that we,  as  a

country, should take.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the package. The present

economic  crisis has a different impact on different  sectors

of  society.  The measures have been expected for  some  time

and  I  am  glad that the Government has chosen to  introduce

these  measures  immediately.  I am happy that  the  measures

that  have been announced today have something for everybody.

It is both substantial and far reaching.  Sir, businessmen  I

have met have clamoured for tax rebates, lower property taxes

and  increased  access for Government funds, bank  loans  and

other assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed glad that the Government has chosen to

give  help  to  businesses in the various areas.   This  will

certainly  help  companies to retain  or  raise  new  working

capital.   There was some good news for the property  sector,

like the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>



suspension of the land sales programme, deferment of sale  of

industrial  land,  the  removal  of  capital  gains  tax  for

properties which have been held for three years, or less, and

the  lifting of the restriction of Singapore dollar loans  to

foreigners for property purchases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am equally pleased that the Government has acted

prudently  in  not  removing the 80% cap  on  housing  loans.

There  is  a  sizeable number of Singaporeans who  feel  that

property prices still remain high and the removal of this 80%

cap  will  lead to another speculative property  boom  cycle.

Sir,  I  am  very  happy that the Government has  decided  to

retain this 80% cap on housing loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the programmes offered for

the lower income and the unemployed.  Sir, I am thankful that

the  Government  has shown its usual concern  for  the  lower

income  and  the unemployed.  The extension of the  utilities

rebates,  reduction of electricity tariffs and  extension  of

the  HDB  rental  assistance scheme will  certainly  be  much

appreciated   by   this  group  of  Singaporeans   who   need

Government's  help most.  At a time when people  are  worried

about  jobs  and retrenchment, the Government's  decision  to

give  a  10%  rebate for C and B2 hospital  charges  for  all

citizens  is  timely.  The added 40% assistance  on  hospital

charges will certainly be a big help for families of citizens

who have been retrenched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting up of the Economic Downturn Relief

Scheme  for Singaporeans is certainly a very welcomed effort.

The  provision  of $200 per month for three  months  is  very

helpful   for  families  where  the  breadwinner   has   been

retrenched  or cannot find employment.  Sir, the  Member  for

Hougang  said  that  $200 does not  go  any  way  in  helping

families  because the amount is too small.  What he fails  to

understand  is  that this is one of the many programmes  that

are  made  available to Singaporeans who are in difficulties.

He  himself  highlighted that in his constituency  there  are

schemes also.  For example, in Jurong constituency,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>



we  have  a CCC fund, a Jurong Needy Residents' Fund and,  on

top of that, we have various other schemes under our CDC.  So

it  is  not  a case of the $200 being an isolated  assistance

package  for  residents.  There are various other  programmes

and  various  other  NGOs  out there  which  are  all  coming

together  to  offer assistance to Singaporeans.   This  is  a

formula which has worked in Singapore, and we should stick to

this  successful  formula because we want to  encourage  this

spirit  where every Singaporean feels that he has a  part  to

help each other in overcoming any crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this package, combined with various other

assistance schemes made available to our people,  will  go  a

long  way to show that the Government and the community  care

for the downtrodden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Government has initiated a novel

scheme to grant all Singaporeans a share in our future growth

and prosperity, ie, the New Singapore Shares.  It is simply a

money-in-the-bag scheme designed to ensure that  Singaporeans

receive  the  fixed money value and dividend for the  shares.

This is a welcome scheme as it avoids the pitfall of granting

Singaporeans listed-company shares whose prices are  volatile

in  a  free  market.   It also avoids a situation  where  the

Government  is  blamed for share price  downturns.   Sir,  in

short, this scheme is beneficial to everyone who will receive

these shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional measures designed to pump-prime the

economy,   eg,   increased  infrastructure   spending,   will

certainly create both new business and new jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am equally happy that the Government will look at

the  quality  of  Employment Pass applicants and  adjust  the

minimum  wage  for Employment Pass holders to  $2,500.   This

will  go  some  way  in preventing companies  from  employing

foreigners   because  they  are  cheaper  than  their   local

employees.   This has been a particular ground  of  complaint

from many Singaporean executives who have been retrenched.  I

hope that this small move will tilt the balance in favour  of

Singapore executives who have been at times



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>



unfairly displaced by foreign Employment Pass holders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I listened to the package being unveiled

earlier,  I was reassured that the Government did not  go  to

the  other  extreme of putting forward a very lavish  package

which will give Singaporeans a sense of total reliance on the

Government.  I think the package is well-balanced.  It  gives

the  right dosage of help to Singaporeans.  I think it  is  a

very good package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I once again welcome the package.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  the  package  of  measures  offered  by   the

Government  is most welcome and should give fairly sufficient

comfort   to  various  sectors  of  our  society,   including

employers  and  employees, property owners and  tenants,  and

also our senior citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be certain sectors of our society which may

not  benefit  from  this  package.   This  will  probably  be

announced by them, in no uncertain terms, through Members  of

Parliament  or  through the press, and I hope the  Government

would hear them out and help them, if possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, in order to tackle the economic downturn,

as  expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister, we must  generate

wealth.   How?  There must be more investments in  Singapore,

both foreign investment and local investment.  There must  be

more  opportunities  for  the  manufacturing  sector  to   be

increased  and  enhanced, both locally  and  globally.   More

markets  must  be  located and nurtured, both  in  the  ASEAN

region  and  in the world at large.  For this, we  need  more

joint  ventures  and  good  relations  between  partners   in

industry  and  corporations  of  various  nations,  and  also

between various governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial services and professional services must

also  find  new  areas to expand into.  Various  professions,

including  the  banking sector, must  liaise  more  with  our

neighbours to form liaisons and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>



joint  ventures, and the Government could come in to  play  a

major role in this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Inderjit Singh and other colleagues in this

House,  I am also concerned about the swift downturn and  the

overall  economic crisis in Singapore and, no doubt, in  many

other  countries  in ASEAN and the world  as  a  whole.   The

question is: what are the fundamental areas which we need  to

address  as  soon  as possible to arrest  or,  at  least,  to

minimise the problem?  I hope the Government and the  private

sector  would  work hand in hand in a symbiotic  fashion  and

revisit basic policies, review these policies critically  and

come  up with fresh ideas in order to keep pace with all  the

changes  that have taken place globally and locally  for  the

last  few  years.   I  am sure, if given  the  opportunities,

Ministers,  parliamentarians, the civil service, the  private

sector,  including businessmen, professionals, academics  and

non-governmental organisations, could all discuss and come up

with some concrete and consensual ideas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ask why Singapore is doing, on a relative

basis, a lot worse in terms of GDP growth.  This year, we are

told, it is minus 3%, compared to our usual competitors,  eg,

Hong   Kong,   Korea,   Malaysia  or  Taiwan,   despite   our

understanding that we have stronger fundamentals and policies

in Singapore, as we are told by the authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is constantly stressing on the need to

retrain  our  workers.  Whilst this is necessary and  prudent

for our economic progress, is there any clear direction where

the  new  and growing industries are so that workers can  get

useful guidance and, thereafter, make a more intelligent move

as  to  where  they want to be retrained?  How  much  is  the

Government willing to shoulder the cost of such retraining in

these uncertain areas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those aged 40 to 50 are especially vulnerable when they

have  families  to feed and mortgages and other  payments  to

make.   Our  citizens and persons working in  Singapore  have

paid taxes, both direct and quite a lot of indirect taxation.

This is indeed a rainy day today.  If it is necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>



to  dip into our nation's reserves, the budget surplus or the

interest  from  the  nation's reserves,  the  country  should

assist  its  citizens to retool and tide over this  difficult

period.   There  should  be  more money  pumped  in  for  the

following  areas, including job retraining,  temporary  child

relief  for  families who are struggling to  pay  for  school

fees, food, uniform, textbooks and transportation to and from

school.  These are sectors I am sure the authorities can look

into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the economic crisis, there may be more cases of

bankruptcies   and   company  liquidations.    Professionals,

including architects, doctors, lawyers, etc, are not  allowed

to  practise if they are pronounced bankrupt by  a  court  of

law.   Can  the  laws be reviewed to make  Singapore  a  more

forgiving  society,  because  persons  may  go  bust  and  be

bankrupt  not because they are immoral, corrupt or lazy,  but

due  to economic circumstances beyond their control?  Can  we

relax  our bankruptcy laws if we want to have a more creative

and risk-taking society?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I also raise the issue of Goods and Services Tax?

The  GST is presently 3%.  Can we not temporarily suspend  it

or  reduce  it to 1% or zero, with effect from November  this

year to December 2002?  The GST was introduced, I believe, in

a  sense,  with a lot of flexibility.  So, if the  demand  is

there  for flexibility in times of crisis, this is one sector

where  the Government could seriously look into and, if  need

be,  increase  it back to 3%, and hopefully  not  more,  when

times are better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the national duties of banks in terms of times

of crisis?  The Monetary Authority of Singapore gives limited

licences  to very few entities for them to practise  banking.

In that sense, it is the state's asset that is being given to

these  banks  to practise banking.  So when a national  asset

like  that  is  given to banks, the banks have  to  now  turn

around  and contribute to the nation's interest in  times  of

crisis.   I  would  suggest,  in  this  instance,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, that they must reduce interest rates  to  tide

things over.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>



They,  I believe, would have made fairly huge profits in  the

last  few  years,  and now it is necessary  for  them  to  be

generous and help their customers by reducing interest  rates

on mortgages, loans and overdrafts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, we must work hard and work hand in hand with

other countries, because we live in an inter-dependent world.

I  would  like to commend the Government's kind  gesture  and

care  shown  to our citizens and people staying in Singapore.

If more could be offered in future, it would be most welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope and pray all these measures are sincere and

that  it  is  a  genuine gesture and not too related  to  the

coming  General Election.  Singaporeans will  have  to  judge

that,  not  just  during General Election time,  but  in  the

months and years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom requires that the Government of the day review

our  current economic policies.  Global events are beyond our

control.  It could be said that Singapore can do little about

that  and, therefore, there is little our Government  can  do

about  major crises when they arrive on our shores.  Be  that

as  it may, let us all do our best, both the proposition, ie,

the  PAP  Government, and the Opposition too,  and  also  the

academics,  the professionals and the citizenry as  a  whole,

and come up with new ideas.  And concrete steps must be taken

to  tackle  as  best as we can and minimise our economic  and

social problems.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,   Sir,  I  congratulate  the  Government   for   its

generosity   in  presenting  this  $11.3  billion  off-Budget

package announced by the Deputy Prime Minister.  We have been

thrown  into  exceptional times, and the  adverse  conditions

created  by  the  terrorist actions of  11th  September  need

exceptional   measures   of   succour.    This   package   is

comprehensive, covering big business, SMEs, white-collar  and

blue-collar  workers, the retrenched and the unemployed,  the

ill  and the underclass.  As my colleague, Dr Ong Chit Chung,

said, it leaves no stone unturned.  What is distinctive about

this package is that it acknowledges as well the woes of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>



middle   management  middle  class  worker,   the   so-called

"sandwich"  class.   This is much to be  lauded.   Innovative

measures,  such as the New Singapore Shares and the  Economic

Downturn Relief Scheme, are also praiseworthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the NWC recommendations, the Deputy Prime

Minister said, "... we should expect wage settlements  to  be

restrained,  or  in  many cases frozen.   Workers  should  be

prepared  for  lower bonuses, wage cuts through the  variable

component,  or at best minimal wage increases."   This  is  a

very  important message to give at this time when we  realise

too  that  even profitable companies may need to  preserve  a

little bit of fat for the bad times ahead, and we should  not

have  workers who unrealistically push for higher  increments

at the risk of losing their jobs in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read recently about some people calling our middle

class  the  "New Poor".  Some people would like us  to  think

that  this so-called "new poor" need exceptional help.  I  do

not   deny,   Sir,  that  they  need  some  help   in   these

unprecedented  circumstances.  But in times like  these,  the

ones  truly deserving of exceptional help are not the  middle

class.   The  middle class workers who still  have  jobs  can

learn  to moderate their expectations and spend more frugally

on necessities and not luxuries.  And they are better able to

pull through than the truly poor that I will be describing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this package is indeed good and we should not

criticise  it like the Opposition, who, as usual,  leaves  no

stones  unturned.  Sir, while it is true that we will  always

have  the poor with us, that should not stop us from  helping

them.   Some are poor because they are idle or irresponsible;

some  are  poor because their skills or education levels  are

low;  some  because  of  unplanned  events,  commitments   or

tragedies  have  drained  their resources;  some  because  of

sickness  or  disability;  and  some  because  of   lack   of

opportunity.  I will deal with each of these classes one at a

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the idle. The Government must continue to create

jobs.  This package may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>



not exactly promise that, but it at least enables the bulk of

companies  to stay afloat so that more jobs are not  lost  in

the  days  ahead.  If people are idle because  there  are  no

jobs,  the Government is to blame.  If they are idle  because

they shun work, they need to wake up.  No amount of financial

assistance will help them if they are irresponsible, if  they

spend  more than they earn.  The Government cannot help  such

people.   They must first help themselves.  As  the  Book  of

Proverbs  says, "A little sleep, a little slumber,  a  little

folding of the hands to rest - and poverty will come  on  you

like  a bandit and scarcity like an armed man."  There should

be  no  handouts  to  those whose only activity  is  to  stir

themselves out of their sleep to open their hungry mouths  or

stretch out their empty hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite increasing retrenchment, the Ministry of

Manpower has found some jobs still going a-begging.  Perhaps,

this  may  be  due  to  the imperfect  dissemination  of  job

information,  and  I  welcome the  efforts  to  beef  up  the

CareerLink  service and CDC services to find jobs  for  those

who want to work but perhaps are looking at the wrong places.

On  the  other  hand,  if the jobs go a-begging  because  job

seekers  are  still picky, they must be shaken out  of  their

unrealistic expectations.  With a perfect storm brewing,  the

fishermen cannot afford to sit down and do nothing.  They may

not  have  the luxury of waiting out the storm, as  Mr  Chiam

would like them to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the skill-less. Some jobs have left Singapore,

never to return.  Some people have no education nor skills to

take up the jobs available.  Retraining and re-education  are

indeed  very  important to give these  poor  ones  hope.  The

package  has  a very extensive scheme of help for  those  who

need  to improve their employability.  Yet, at the same time,

the  Government, as the policy implementer, must realise that

some people may really be too old or too intimidated to learn

new  things in unfamiliar circumstances.  Aptitudes therefore

have  to be considered.  I may know that aircraft technicians

are in short supply but I may not have the aptitude for that.

And what if I choose to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>



upgrade  to  a skill which, in itself, would become  obsolete

before  I complete my retraining?  Financial help to pay  for

courses  and training is good, but not enough.  I  think  the

Government must make an effort too to match the right  people

to the right courses of training, and actively encourage them

to  keep  them on course through counselling and motivational

measures.  This need not always be in the form of money.   In

service  jobs, for example, and many service jobs are  crying

for  workers, it could be in the form of upgrading the  image

of  professionalism of certain jobs and changing the  mindset

of both the served and the serving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the unfortunate. This category of people includes

those who are struggling to set up new businesses or striving

to  keep  old  ones  above water because of  September  11th;

people who face untoward tragedies like the recent deaths  of

breadwinners, people who have been retrenched and people  who

have been impoverished by an unexpected turn of events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these just need short-term help, a booster which

will  heave them over the unexpected hump.  For some  of  the

retrenched,  the retraining and re-education being  given  to

the   skill-less  may  be  relevant  too.   But  for   others

retrenched,  perhaps the only help required is  provision  to

weather the storm till the jobs return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that another way of helping such people is to

work  out  a  scheme which allows them a moratorium  on  debt

repayments.    The  previous  speaker,  Mr   Chandra   Mohan,

mentioned the reform of bankruptcy laws and I think we  could

look  into  this  too  when  we reform  those  laws.   Viable

businesses may be cash-strapped and close up because they are

unable  to  resist the creditor pressure.  My  colleague,  Mr

Leong Horn Kee, referred to banks, for example, who take away

the umbrellas when the rain starts coming down, the umbrellas

that  they  lend  to you when the sun was shining.   Judicial

management procedures are costly and not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>



available  to  all  forms of business.  If  businesses  close

prematurely, more jobs will be lost and more pain  inflicted.

In  these  exceptional times, when even the mighty Swiss  Air

can  fall, how much hope do the small businesses and  hawkers

have?  The business cost reduction exercise announced is wide

ranging  and  very welcome, but my point is  that  more  non-financial measures will also be helpful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will venture to raise the difficulties of another

group  of  the  unfortunate.  These are the  property  owners

whose  most costly asset has gone into negative equity.   The

amount they owe CPF and the bank is more than the amount they

can  recover  from sale of their asset.  If they  sell,  they

will not be able to find the cash to top-up their CPF and the

balance  of  what  they owe to the bank.  Hence,  while  they

realise  that  it  is  better for  them  to  downgrade  their

residences,  and though they are willing to do  so,  many  in

fact cannot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is assistance aplenty for HDB householders with

schemes which include the Reduced Repayment Scheme, Staggered

Downpayment Scheme, extension of loan payments and the contra-facility scheme.  Would it be possible for the Government  to

add  to  its  package  a  scheme  to  allow  householders  to

downgrade  to  reduce their commitments  and  postpone  their

repayment  back  into their CPF accounts  (with  interest  of

course) till the sun is shining again?  Could the HDB contra-facility  scheme, or some sort of bridging  loan  scheme,  be

extended too to landed and HUDC property owners, so  long  as

what  they  are selling is their own residence and  not  some

investment properties?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the sick. The category of poor who most need help

are  those who cannot help themselves. We have the reputation

of  having a hard-headed, no-nonsense Government.  Many  even

think that we have a hard-hearted, no-sensitivity Government.

As  this  package  shows,  this is an undeserved  perception.

There  is a whole gamut of assistance measures for those  who

face medical emergencies at this time.  The 10% rebate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>



for  class  B2 and C charges and subsidised day-care  surgery

and  the  40%  additional fee assistance for the families  of

retrenched citizens is a very huge load off their shoulders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a rational, level-headed Government when all

around  us is gloom, panic and paralysis.  We need it  to  be

decisive and firm.  Yet, all these do not mean that Ministers

do  not have EQ (emotional quotient).  Perhaps, we just  need

Ministers  to  wear  their  hearts more  obviously  on  their

sleeves,  more visibly at this period of time.  And  I  think

17.3%  pay-cut is one such gesture.  Is enough being done  to

help  the  sick,  disabled and elderly in this  new  package?

Maybe,  though  I feel the assistance schemes could  also  be

extended   to  those  whose  family  members  are  not   just

retrenched  but  others  who  are  severely,  chronically  or

terminally  ill.   These are burdens  which  are  beyond  the

ordinary citizens even in good times but at times like these,

they  become  onerous and can drive many to  desperation  and

deep despair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, to put a soft edge to our policies, we need

more  representation from the gentler sex  in  policy-making.

As  they  say, women hold up half the sky.  God made men  and

women  complementary and a softer touch  is  lacking  perhaps

because we have too few women involved.  On this count, I  am

very heartened to hear rumours that the Government party  has

indeed  selected many women candidates for the next election.

Some seats in this House may, of course, be vacated for them,

but  that  is  the way of things, the political eco-cycle  at

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the softer touch, and here I am just giving an

example, should we not have, for example, waived maid  levies

for  those  who  are  quadriplegic, or severely  handicapped,

especially   if  this  encourages  them  to  be  economically

productive?  I know of a quadriplegic who earns his own  keep

painting  with his mouth.  A large chunk of what he earns  is

swallowed  up by the maid that he employs to look  after  his

needs.  He does not have any family members to help him  and,

in fact, does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>



not  want to because he is trying very hard to be independent

and to stay away from an institutional home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, Sir, the deprived. We have some who are poor

because  they  are deprived or bereft of opportunity.   These

include single mothers with young children, who cannot  leave

home  to  work;  elderly  persons who are  physically  and/or

mentally  active  but not trusted with most  types  of  work;

young  and  old in between jobs, perhaps as they are  in  the

throes  of  a long course of study; and well-educated,  well-trained people who have come out into the job market  at  the

wrong time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that there are many loan suspension and grant

and aid schemes for such people, especially those in full and

part-time  courses and for the new graduates.   But,  Sir,  I

would   like   to   suggest  some  more  ways   of   creating

opportunities and I hope the Government will consider these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, for those who can work at home, can we find some

ways  of providing that work to them, such as the setting  up

of  cottage industries?  For this, perhaps more relaxed rules

for home offices/businesses.  For those who are elderly, some

special  schemes for job matching, jobs that  allow  them  to

keep their dignity and also schemes to encourage employers to

look  for these elderly.  There should be more publicity  for

job-matching schemes.  There should be continued  efforts  at

pump priming and job creation.  One popular refrain from many

small  businesses is the request to downsize the  Government-linked companies' (GLCs) preserve so that they do not soak up

all the available opportunities, and perhaps, even to get the

GLCs  to  boot-strap  the SMEs as they  go  into  new  fields

together.  Lastly, give more Government contracts to SMEs  by

tendering out Government jobs in smaller chunks so that  they

can manage it and, together, we can rebuild the economy.



<br>5.12 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, when the DPM was giving his Ministerial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>



Statement,  he  rounded up with the remark that  it  was  the

people  working  with  the Government that  helped  Singapore

overcome  the  past  crisis.  I completely  agree  with  this

sentiment.   If  we  look  at all the  crises,  not  just  in

Singapore, but throughout the world, for every crisis, it  is

the ordinary men, women and children that suffer the pain and

misery.   It  is  the  ordinary people and  citizens  of  the

country  that  have  to make the greatest  and  most  painful

sacrifices.   When  times are good, when the  economy  booms,

they  are  the forgotten lot.  We think of the rich  and  the

successful  in terms of accumulation of wealth and  position,

but not the ordinary people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September 11th incident is one example. Within

hours of the collapse of the World Trade Centre, US companies

were  announcing  lay-offs.   They  knew  the  buildings  had

collapsed  but they also knew how many people  they  have  to

retrench,  in  terms  of  thousands.  Retrenchment,  throwing

people  off to the streets, was the first option for many  US

companies.   Workers had to bear the brunt for  the  sake  of

capital and capitalism.  I hope Singapore employers will  not

follow  the US example.  Retrenchments must not be the  first

option.  It must be the last.  I hope people understand  that

retrenchment does not only affect the worker, it affects  his

family   and   himself  or  herself,  both  emotionally   and

financially.  I am therefore happy that this package actually

has  a focus that addresses the concerns of many citizens  in

this  country.   The concerns are a sense of job  insecurity,

fear   of  losing  their  jobs  or  retrenchments,  fear   of

difficulty  in  getting another job, and the fear  that  they

will  not  have enough money to meet even their basic  needs.

In  that  light, assistance to make businesses remain  viable

without resorting to retrenchments too easily is welcomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards job creation, I would like to ask whether it

is  possible to give additional tax incentives to businessmen

who  start  business investments now in this  most  difficult

time.   I  also hope that the implementation of  this  scheme

will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>



hindrance-free  and administratively easy,  just  as  it  was

announced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the things that I wanted to say have already

been covered.  So I just want to talk about one other aspect.

When we tackle the present crisis, we must not lose sight  of

life  beyond  this crisis.  And one of the important  lessons

that we can learn from this crisis, or even the US system, is

that  even  with  the best of technology, with  the  best  of

things that the Americans have, technology alone was not able

to help them when real disaster and difficulty happened.  All

the  talk  about high-tech, small government, was not  there.

When people are in deep crisis and who suffer most, they look

to  the  government for help.  They look for ordinary  chaps,

the  unsung  heroes, the underpaid people, the teachers,  the

nurses,  the  policemen, the firemen, the counsellors.   They

were  important  in  their lives.  The churches,  the  church

leaders and other religious practitioners were the ones  whom

people turn to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we do a review of our policies, in terms of

economics,  it  is  not just important to look  at  enhancing

economic wealth  - it is important, we need money, we need  a

good  life  -  but we also need social cohesion, we also need

welfare.  So we have to strike a balance between economic and

social  needs, and I hope we keep it that way.  And  in  this

light,  I  wish  to  compliment the  leadership  for  showing

example by taking the lead in taking a pay cut.  I think this

is important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that the Government remains

flexible.  One of the main things I hear for years  was  that

there would be no unemployment benefits.   There would be  no

welfare benefits.  But today, in this package, there is  some

relief  for  people who lose their jobs. You do not  call  it

unemployment  benefit.  You call it by another name,  but  it

still  meets  the need, and this is the flexibility  that  is

needed.   And  I hope this flexibility will be  reflected  in

many other things when we do a review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the present crisis has reduced our

economic capital, but it does not mean that we will  have  to

reduce our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>



social  capital.  With this package in this  crisis,  we  can

actually review our policies and increase our social capital,

and  to come out stronger.   Again, I want to say that I hope

that  our  employers will take advantage of  this  relief  to

strengthen their businesses.  I hope they will not  use  this

relief  as  an example to lay off workers and add on  to  the

pain  and misery of the working people.  And I am sure,  just

as  we had overcome all past crises, we can work together  to

reduce pain in this crisis and come out stronger in the world

after the crisis.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic measures taken to deal with the

downturn are indeed a booster to our economy.  There are also

measures  that  are  taken to deal with the  across-the-board

problems and challenges that we will be facing.  I would have

thought that the DPM would try and see whether we can  put  a

bit  more money into the pockets of individuals, so that they

will be able to boost the economy.  I would have thought that

he would have considered, say, rebate on maid levy, rebate on

child  care and other indirect taxes, which would have  given

an immediate boost to the economy.  I hope that he could tell

us  why he has not considered giving rebate on other indirect

taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is really important in the prolonged recession

that  we are going to face is the question of social strains,

and  I think this is a very important issue that we must bear

in  mind because, in economic recessions, a lot of people are

going  to  be affected.  It will cut across ethnic, religious

and  class  lines.  Therefore, I think it is  very  important

that  we have to watch out for these strains.  Especially  in

Singapore's  multi-racial  society,  we  will  have   to   be

sensitive and to respond effectively to deal with such issues

that  could  be  played  up by the  Opposition  parties.    I

thought Mr Chiam would be around, but he is not  around.   As

an  Opposition  leader, together with other Opposition  party

leaders, I hope  they will join the Government to look at  it

from a united way in tackling this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>



problem.   It  is  not  a  problem of  the  PAP  itself,  the

Government   in   power  today.   It  is   the   problem   of

Singaporeans, and I think this is very important  because  we

are  all  in the same boat, and we cannot afford to rock  the

boat.   If Singaporeans are going to be divisive and to  hear

the  Opposition say that this is a vote buying ploy  that  we

are doing, then I think they are seriously wrong.  This is  a

very serious problem that we are all facing in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would urge Singaporeans to stand united in tackling

this problem in a most cohesive way, because if we do not  do

this,  then we will fall apart and Singapore will  crack  up.

And  who  will  lose  at  the end of the  day?   Singaporeans

themselves  will be the losers.  So I would urge Singaporeans

to  stand  behind  the  Government and  tackle  this  problem

concertedly.  And with the will that we have, I  am  sure  we

will  be  able to brave the storm.  So I hope the  Government

would  encourage voluntary organisations and other  community

groups  to  join  the  CCCs  to tackle  the  problem  at  the

grassroots level.  Because this is a problem of the community

and  everybody has a role to play, and if they can join hands

and  funding  support can be given to these organisations  to

also  tackle the problems of the unemployed, then I think  we

will take a concerted approach to deal with the issues at the

local level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we could look at it from the point of

social  cohesion, and in the Singapore context, this is  very

crucial  for  the survival of Singapore.  And in  hard  times

like  this, we must stand united and look forward to tackling

various complex problems and challenges that we are facing at

this juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue that I would like to bring up is

that the number of unemployed people will increase.  And  for

them,  unemployment may be prolonged, because  it  will  take

some time for the economy to pick up.  With the hollowing  of

the  manufacturing sector, the older workers and perhaps even

younger  workers   -  professionals,  semi-professionals  and

technical persons  -  will all be affected.   It will be  for

the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>



time  that  we will see more long-term unemployed workers  in

Singapore.  I think this is likely to happen and I would like

to  find  out  from  DPM  what are the long-term  contingency

measures   that  we  will  take  should  there  be  long-term

unemployment  faced  by workers.  I  think  this  is  a  very

important issue that we need to look at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the Economic Downturn Relief Scheme,

which has been introduced, would provide temporary relief  to

workers who are currently unemployed.  I feel that the scheme

should   be  a  bit  more  generous  than  the  $200  monthly

assistance  provided.  It could be reviewed and I  hope  that

DPM could look at whether the public assistance scheme, which

is  based on the number of persons in the household, could be

applied.  It could be calculated on the basis of up  to  four

persons per household.  In fact, the public assistance scheme

is  a  bit more generous than the $200 which is at the moment

set  aside to help the unemployed.  Sir, I think we  need  to

look  at  the  longer  term measures to deal  with  prolonged

unemployment  affecting workers.  This needs to be  addressed

and I would like to ask DPM whether Government has thought of

long-term measures to tackle this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue we need to look at is the issue of

job  creation.   With the economic recession, jobs  are  very

unlikely to be created in the next one year or so.  But there

is  a  need  to look at how we can absorb some of  the  older

workers into the job sector.  I would like to ask DPM whether

the  public as well as the Government-linked companies  would

be  looking  at some ways in which jobs could be  created  to

absorb  some  of  the older workers.  In the longer  term,  I

think job creation will become an issue, especially when many

of  the  industries in the manufacturing sector are going  to

hollow  out.  I would like to find out whether the Government

has  any long-term plans to look at how we could create  more

jobs for people who are coming on stream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those are some of the issues that I would like to

bring up.  The other issue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>



that  I  would like to raise is the waiver of income  tax  on

retrenchment benefits.  Workers who are retrenched or given a

golden handshake have to pay tax on their benefits.  It  will

be  indeed helpful if tax on these benefits could be  waived.

I  would  like  to  ask DPM if the waiver of  income  tax  on

benefits   given   to  workers  upon  golden   handshake   or

retrenchment  could be considered, and this  will  be  indeed

helpful for the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  Singapore is clearly in crisis.  This is largely caused

by  external  factors.   But  I think  besides  the  cyclical

downturn,  there are also some structural problems that  will

need to be addressed.  I have read through the materials  and

after  listening  to the Deputy Prime Minister,  I  find  the

present package to be rational, targeted, realistic and quite

substantial.  I think it is clearly a sincere attempt to  try

to   help,  although  there  must  be  recognition  that  the

Government cannot cure all the problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question, therefore, which has been raised in

this  House,  is  whether  this is a General  Election  ploy.

Speaking as a non-partisan Member of the House, I think there

is  only  one thing that I could see that is potentially  and

perhaps  inadvertently political, and this is  in  using  the

CCCs  to  administer assistance for the lower income.   These

grassroots  organisations, as I understand it,  do  not  come

under the Opposition Members of Parliament.  But beyond  this

one  point, I really think that the package is not a  General

Election  ploy.   In  that  sense,  I  would  encourage   the

Opposition  not  to  play political football  in  this  game.

Singaporeans, I hope, will vote by conscience, even  if  they

do take money from the CCCs.  More than that, I disagree with

the hon. Member for Potong Pasir, Mr Chiam.  This money would

not  be  easily handed out because it is targeted, it is  not

something  that  the CCCs can just give to whoever  says,  "I

would  vote PAP."  So I do not think we should take too  much

of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think we should look at the package rationally and

see  whether it will help people.  I also, on the same token,

want to say that I acknowledge the effort to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>



lead by example in the political leadership taking a pay cut.

Let me then turn to the package.  Many things have been said.

I  find  it generally good but I have some questions I should

like to put to the Deputy Prime Minister.  The first of these

are rather itty-bitty, specific points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is on property market. Of all the anti-speculation measures, it has been chosen that the 80% cap on

loans remains.  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  we should not instead trust the market.  The banking

sector, Sir, has been chastened by what has happened, so have

purchasers  largely.  I think it should be left  to  them  to

evaluate risks and that the market and the purchasers have  a

free  play with this.  If anything, it should be the  capital

gains  tax  that is a better tool to keep.  This  80%  margin

should not, in a sense, be a sacred cow, I hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second measure I welcome very much is the People for

Jobs  Traineeship  Programme.  When it was  first  announced,

there  was a cap on salary assistance of $600 and now it  has

been  moved  to  $2,000 as the maximum, and I  welcome  this.

This is something really that people in Parliament called for

and  it  has now been reconsidered.  And I think the contrast

to  the  first  point, Sir, is that here we  are  willing  to

reconsider it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is on the mismatch of jobs. Sir, it is

true  that  with structural change, there may be unemployment

in  some  sectors  while jobs go wanting  in  the  other.   I

welcome  the  Ministry  of Manpower in  taking  a  much  more

proactive  role  in  trying to match people.   But  I  wonder

whether  we should also think of using the private sector  to

help  us - employment agencies, head-hunters, especially  for

the  managers  and  professionals  who  may  find  themselves

unemployed.  I think this is not a sector of the market  that

the Ministry of Manpower has much experience, as compared  to

the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point, Sir, regards foreign talent. I too

welcome the adjustment in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>



policy.  I generally believe that we should have an open-door

policy  for  foreign  talent but I  appreciate  the  need  to

tighten the criteria.  As far as I understand it, one  change

is  that the employment pass criteria will now be $2,500,  up

from  $2,000 per month.  I am not here to debate on the  $500

with the Deputy Prime Minister.  But the principle of the peg

is  something that, I think, might be reconsidered.   In  the

Deputy Prime Minister's remarks, he mentioned that the $2,000

figure  was  approximately the salary of a new  graduate.   I

would  put to him that this is probably the wrong peg because

this  pegs the entry point for foreign talent to exactly  the

people  who are most vulnerable - new graduates.   These  are

people who have spent a lot of money and time to get educated

but  have  no track record to show and they want  that  first

job.  So I think, in principle, that peg is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next disappointment, Sir, is about the New Singapore

Shares.  I am confused why it should be tied to CPF.  While I

welcome  it so much as a concept, I think that this  must  go

beyond  the CPF top-up.  This is particularly so because  CPF

top-up,  as  at previous sittings of the House,  was  clearly

demonstrated  not  to  have worked  for  all.   There  was  a

sizeable  number of CPF account holders who did  not  do  the

necessary things that would have availed themselves  of  this

top-up  scheme.  I think the challenge of the  New  Singapore

Shares  as  a  new idea is to instead value all Singaporeans,

and  here  I join the minorities of Members of the House  who

have  spoken  out in favour of home-makers, and I  would  add

retirees  too, who contributed to the country  in  the  past.

Home-makers  really  will  play an essential  role  when  the

breadwinners lose their jobs.  They may be the ones who  will

hold the family and therefore the society together.  And they

will be the ones, I hope, who make sure that children get  to

schools.   I  think  in this situation, Sir,  if  we  do  not

recognise the home-makers, we are doing them and ourselves an

injustice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may broaden the points now. I would like to

turn  to the nature of the response that is revealed  in  the

off-Budget measures announced.  In some cases, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>



measures are largely incremental, adjustments up or down by a

few  percentage points, and, in other cases,  a  longer  time

line  is  given.  The first point about the nature  of  these

measures  is  that they create more complex rules.   I  think

there  may  be  a  need  to explain and  facilitate  the  new

programmes   for  those  who  need  them.   I   am   thinking

particularly of the small and medium enterprises and the less

well-educated.  If we make these rules too complex, then only

those  who  can  understand and get their act together  could

apply  for them and maybe, Sir, perhaps they do not need  our

help if they can navigate very complex rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, putting the package together is one thing. But I

would  call on the Deputy Prime Minister to muster the  civil

servants  and  others and task to bring this  to  the  ground

level to make sure that they do effectively reach out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than this, Sir, I think that the challenge for us

is  to  see that the structural change may need Singapore  to

take  a  deeper  and longer term look at our strategies.   In

this  sense, it is like the oil crisis of the mid-70s.    The

USA  and USSR had very different reactions.  The USA saw  the

need to cut and prune, not subsidise oil as the USSR did.  Of

course,  we know now who won out in that one.  Crisis demands

a  reaction but it is a vital question how we react and  deal

with  problems.   For  many  social  problems,  tensions  are

inescapable.   We need to come out of this stronger  than  we

went  into  it.   So  I do tend to agree  on  the  danger  of

welfarism.  But, Sir, I would welcome a trust that people  in

Singapore are now prepared to help themselves.  And, in  this

sense, I do appreciate such measures as the wage support  for

training being raised from $600 to $2,000.  I think this is a

good  sign  of  something  bigger.  Helping  Singaporeans  is

therefore  not  a  question of cost but of getting  essential

things done, with whatever cost it takes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn then to what is not here in the off-Budget

measures, which I hoped would be there and thought  could  be

helped.   Comparing these measures to those  taken  in  1998,

there is an absence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>



of  efforts  to  lower cost of operations in  areas  such  as

Telecoms and port charges.  Sir, I realise that these are, of

course,  free markets and players can set their prices.   But

there  are  few players in these sectors and I am asking  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister if he believes they  are  competitive

enough  worldwide  or,  if not, why were  these  cost-cutting

measures also missing from his package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, for the longer term, I would ask the

Deputy  Prime Minister if it is not timely for Government  to

take  efforts  to  review  various  measures  such  as:   (1)

Government  costs and practices, for example, customs,  stamp

duties by Government in different agencies; (2) the long-term

economic strategy, especially regarding SMEs, the development

of  services  and, of course, strengthening of  our  domestic

economy;  and  (3)  to think consciously  of  constructing  a

social  safety  net,  not a traditional  welfare  scheme  nor

widespread subsidies, but targeted and sufficient help as  we

seem to be coming to in these off-Budget measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We perhaps need to articulate our social safety net

better  to understand what it is, what we are trying  to  do.

Otherwise,  the  Nominated Member of  Parliament,  Mr  Thomas

Thomas, suggested that we are actually giving "dole"  but  by

different name.  I think we really need to conceptualise what

it is we are trying to build.  My own instinct is that we are

trying  to create not a safety net which may entangle  people

but  a sort of trampoline that can help people, down on their

luck, bounce up again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, therefore, in this context set out some wishes

of  what  I  would like to have seen added to  the  list  and

perhaps  Government  might  consider  if  the  recession   is

prolonged.  I do not want to break them out into little  bits

and pieces but to see them in terms of broader strategy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is, I think, the strategy must be for

solidarity  in our society.  And here the first  item  on  my

wish  list  is  something  that was mentioned  by  the  Prime

Minister as a possibility during his National Day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>



speech.  This is that he might give double tax deductions for

those  who  give  to  Institutions of  Public  Character  and

charities.   Sir, I do believe that it is good  to  encourage

many-helping  hands even in this time of  crisis.   Companies

and   individuals  can,  despite  the  crisis,  find  it   in

themselves to give money to charities to help others.  If so,

I  think  they should be recognised by the Government doubly,

literally doubly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, in terms of solidarity, I do share a

concern  that  race or religious discrimination  might  rise.

Looking  back again to the downturn in 1998/1999, there  were

some  concerns  that  there  were some  incidents  of  racial

discrimination  in  hiring.  Again,  when  jobs  are  scarce,

people  may  take  all sorts of criteria into  consideration,

some  of  which  are  relevant  and  some  of  which  may  be

irrelevant.  Here, I would ask the Government to be  prepared

again  to use moral suasion to change the minds of employers,

to  monitor complaints and to even, if the problem  persists,

consider legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third item on solidarity, I believe that

children should be our focus.  I hope, Sir, we are beyond the

point where young people will come out of school early in bad

times,  in order to try to find a job.  We should have enough

that the young will have enough reserves to really invest  in

their own education and Singapore's future.  And I would call

on  the Ministry of Education to especially target schools to

monitor  and recommend special assistance programmes  if  any

child should face problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning, Sir, next to the professionals. I do believe

that  the  professionals need help, and I have mentioned  how

the   private  sector  should  be  used  for  job  placement.

Additionally,  we need training, counselling, and  to  really

recognise the fact that we are going to deal with a whole new

category  of people who are out of a job.  There  are  people

who used to earn, perhaps, I do not know, $10,000 to $20,000,

and  we  need  to cater to them in a whole different  way  to

encourage them to take on new roles in society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, is whether it is now timely to start

to fund necessary risks and new directions.  Under this broad

thrust, I would suggest that one of the things we may need is

a  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise Bank or  Venture  Fund.   I

appreciate that these off-Budget measures have got an item to

enlarge  the  existing scheme.  But I share the concern  that

the  scheme  presently works through banks  which,  in  their

effort  to  be prudential, may not understand SMEs fully  and

therefore there may be a need to have a SME Venture Fund that

can  give  more focus and is willing to take more  risks.   I

believe  this is a real need, Sir, because small  and  medium

enterprises are often being a source of new job creation when

an  economy is restructuring.  An example of this, of course,

is the USA in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Therefore, the

SME  Bank can certainly help create jobs, not least for  some

of the out-of-work bankers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing I would like to make is about export

insurance.  Some countries, such as USA, do underwrite  risks

to  a much larger degree than Singapore.  If in this time  of

crisis, Singapore companies are to be emboldened to find  new

markets  and  find new products and to go  out,  I  think  we

should  go  further.  The present scheme of  ECICS  insurance

companies, I think, is not enough.  We should be prepared not

to  subsidise them but to share risks with them.  And I think

a  major  Government  statutory  board,  such  as  the  Trade

Development Board, is better able to do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, if the strategy is to go towards a

new  economy, this crisis may be a good time to help the  new

economy  and the Internet companies which have been so  badly

hit.   Government has done a very good job in creating an  e-Government.  I would ask them now whether we should invest in

efforts  to  make  an e-private sector for  productivity  and

gains   in   the   long  run.   Here,  Sir,  it   is   beyond

infrastructure but rather to underwrite efforts  in  training

as well as to align the Government's procurement and approval

systems  so  that  companies which  use  Internet  might  get

preference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>



And  so  we  could create a market for Internet and companies

that use Internet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two last challenges, Sir, and how we can use this

downturn.   The first again is a challenge put  up  by  Prime

Minister Goh during his National Day Rally speech.   This  is

whether  we can improve our service in Singapore.  Really,  I

think  that this is a good time for training and that  people

will suddenly wake up to the idea that their job is something

they  value  and they should be doing much better  than  they

are.   And  we  should take advantage of this to help  change

attitudes  of  service staff.  There is after  all  a  higher

expectation of people who are willing to spend money in times

like this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, which may seem a little light

hearted, is how to make productive time of this crisis.  This

is  that we need to cater to leisure in Singapore.  With  the

downturn, people have less money to spend.  With the  concern

about air travel following the events of 11th September, they

want  to  travel less, but there is still need for  families,

for  singles,  for everyone, to have a good time.   And  this

time,  Sir, is a good opportunity for Government to think  of

how  to  synergise and offer Singaporeans to have  affordable

good  times  in  Singapore.  Work  with  the  private  sector

hotels, with statutory boards like Sentosa, and other  things

should  be  undertaken to this end.  We should aim  to  offer

Singaporeans,  especially  in the coming  December  holidays,

special  theme promotions, so that we can have some  of  that

good  mood  at  affordable prices and also help our  domestic

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I would say that I support the off-Budget measures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I will take the break now

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for giving me this opportunity to add my comments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic slowdown in the region triggered by the US

economic  problems took another dive after the 11th September

terrorist attacks.  Many Singapore companies, especially  the

SMEs,  are hurting badly because this time around, they  have

lower  reserves,  having barely recovered from  the  previous

crisis  in 1997/1998.  Revenues are down as demand for  goods

and  services dries up.  The only way for companies out there

to  survive  this severe downturn is to cut costs drastically

while waiting for demand to revive.  For most companies,  the

major fixed costs are rental and manpower costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Confederation of Industries, of which I am

a Council Member and also Vice-President, came up with a wish-list  three  days ago.  It contains a list of  what  we  feel

would  be necessary and helpful to companies to survive  this

downturn.   I  am  happy to note that many of these  requests

have  been  taken into consideration in the package announced

today.   I  would  like to thank the Government  for  such  a

generous and bold package.  It has generally met expectations

which are high.  It has something for almost everybody,  from

national  servicemen  to the elderly, from  entrepreneurs  to

retrenched workers.  I am sure it will assist many  companies

in  helping them to contain costs and retain as many  workers

as  possible during this trying time.  However, I would  like

to  make  the  following comments and  suggestions  that  the

Government may wish to consider further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on manpower cost cutting. For many companies,

wage  cost, including CPF contributions by employers, is  one

of  the  biggest cost items.  I agree with DPM that  the  CPF

should not be used as a tool



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>



for  adjustment of short-term labour costs.   In  the  longer

term,  however,  the  Government  should  seriously  consider

reducing  the  CPF  contribution rate from 16%  to  something

lower,  say,  about  12%.   It is a  significant  saving  for

employers  and will help them to retain more workers  and  be

more  competitive  in  the long term.   In  the  short  term,

employers  of  course  will  take other  measures  to  reduce

manpower  costs to a level commensurate with  the  volume  of

business,  such as salary cuts, shorter work week, compulsory

no  pay leave, and so on.  To maintain industrial harmony  at

the  workplace  at  a time like this, it  is  important  that

employers discuss and share their problems and plans with the

employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, rental costs. This item is less flexible to

adjust  unless landlords are prepared to reduce  rentals.   I

welcome  the  Government's decision to further  increase  the

quantum  of  property tax rebates.  I urge all  landlords  to

pass this saving to all their tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, financing costs. I am glad to note that DBS bank

has  taken  the lead in reducing its prime rate to  4.5%.   I

urge  other  banks  to  follow  suit.   Interest  rates  have

remained  rather high for some time, despite the  substantial

lowering of interest rates in the USA since the beginning  of

this  year.  More importantly, banks should be more  flexible

and  understanding at this time of crisis and be prepared  to

restructure  loans  to  help  companies  to  ride  out   this

downturn.  In this respect, MAS has influence over the  banks

and  finance companies, and I hope that it will exercise  its

moral suasion accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For job creation, new companies must mushroom and

existing   companies  must  expand.   SMEs  have   difficulty

accessing capital at times like this to grow and create jobs.

The Government should seriously consider starting a SME bank,

or a development bank, which has been raised by the SCI at  a

press  conference  a few days ago, and also  by  some  of  my

colleagues  in this House.  Without a development bank,  like

what we had in the 60s and 70s, many of the companies that we

know of today



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>



will  not have flourished and succeeded.  I am happy to  note

that   the  Government  will  be  establishing  a  micro-loan

programme to help very small companies.  I will wait for  the

details to be announced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, cash-flow management. I thank the Government for

the  corporate tax rebates that will certainly help  to  ease

cash  flows of companies.  To help some companies  tide  over

this  period, the Government should allow companies that have

corporate tax payments from previous years' profits to  defer

these  or  restructure  and pay in smaller  quantums  over  a

longer period of time.  The Government should also allow  for

tax  offset on losses incurred in overseas ventures by  local

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport costs. To help companies reduce their

transport  costs,  the Government has reduced  petrol  excise

duty  by  5%.  This is most welcome.  It should also consider

removing  the ERP charges, except during the peak  hours  of,

say,  8  am to 9 am and 5 pm to 7 pm.  I drive into  the  CBD

from time to time during off-peak hours and I do not see  any

heavy  traffic, or traffic jam, at all to justify ERP charges

during off-peak hours.  With the ERP system in place for some

time  now,  it  is  also time for the Government  to  further

reduce  road taxes, ARF and import duties for cars and  other

commercial vehicles on a more permanent basis.  We are  still

the  most  expensive place in the whole world for owning  and

operating  cars and other commercial vehicles, and these  all

add up to the operating costs of companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On GST, I would like to add also here my call for the

Government to consider suspending temporarily the 3%  GST  to

reduce cost of transactions and cost to companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the personal side, the Government has been generous

in  granting an additional 5% rebate for personal income  tax

for  the  Year  of  Assessment 2001.   Some  individuals  are

currently encountering difficulties in paying their taxes and

I   hope   the   Government  will  consider  allowing   these

individuals to pay their income taxes from the previous  year

over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>



a  longer  period of time as this would help to lessen  their

cash-flow problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On infrastructure projects, I am happy to note that the

Government  would be injecting $3.5 billion into the  economy

to speed up infrastructure projects.  However, given the open

economy  of Singapore, how do we ensure that the benefits  of

this  expenditure  and its multiplier effects  will  stay  in

Singapore  and  accrue to Singaporeans?  The  Government  may

wish  to consider schemes for this to be achieved, all  other

things being equal.  If there is too much leakage out of  our

economic system, our efforts would have been futile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, I would like to suggest some

measures.  Singapore has become quite an expensive  place  to

do   business  in,  especially  for  rentals,  transport  and

manpower  costs,  compared  to  our  neighbouring  countries.

Moving up the value-added ladder by being more innovative and

creative   will  take  some  time.   In  the  meantime,   the

Government should look into more measures to reduce  domestic

costs  within our control so that more of our companies  will

be able to survive.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  this opportunity to speak.  The people are hurting.

More  of  my  residents are coming to see  me  about  housing

loans,  utilities bills they cannot pay, increasing utilities

bills, loss of jobs, looking for new jobs, worry about  their

children's education.  Therefore, the measures that  DPM  has

announced  are  very welcome.  And those  measures  are  very

reassuring to the people in Singapore because it demonstrates

that the Government understands and cares about how they  are

coping with the problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly pleased to note that the Government is

freezing  the fees for undergraduate and polytechnic tuition.

I  wish I knew this last night. Because last night, one of my

residents  came to me and said, "I am very worried  about  my

daughter.  She is going to the university next year  and  the

fees are going to increase."  And I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>



assured her that the Government will make sure there will  be

fee  loans, and so forth.  And if I had known this,  I  would

have told her, "Don't worry, the fees will be frozen for  one

year,  and  perhaps longer, and it becomes more  affordable."

So  I think these are very welcome.  And as a lecturer in the

university, I am quite sure my students will be very  pleased

to know that the fees will not be increased for one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easing of cash flow of new HDB flat buyers would also be

very  useful.  A lot of residents come to me and ask for help

because  they cannot pay the 20% downpayment.  By  staggering

the downpayment in two stages of 10% each is very helpful  to

many of them.  The utilities bills, as I have said, have been

increasing.   The  reduction  of  tariffs  and  extension  of

utilities rebates will also go a long way to help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses will definitely welcome the improved access

to  funds  by  the Government introducing an  improved  Local

Enterprise   Finance  Scheme.   But  I  like   to   join   my

Parliamentary colleagues, Mr Leong Horn Kee and  Mr  Lew  Syn

Pau, to call upon our banks to help.  The cost of funds is  a

very  important business cost.  A lowering of  this  interest

rate will go a long way to help reduce this cost element.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is showing a very good example by cutting

the  salaries of Ministers, political office holders,  senior

civil  servants and also the MP's allowance.  It  shows  that

the  Government  understands the suffering and  pain  of  the

people.   However, the real answer to our current crisis  and

difficulties  is  a  strong economy.  I urge  the  Government

therefore,  and  I  know they are doing  what  they  can,  to

concentrate its full resources to revive the economy  and  to

grow  a  strong  economy  that will pull  us  out  from  this

difficult period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I would urge Singaporeans to take the many

opportunities which are made available by the Government  for

retraining  and  upgrading for a New  Economy.   Singaporeans

will  have to be less choosy in selecting the jobs they want,

or the location of the job they want,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2385</b></font><br><br>



and  perhaps  take  a  lower salary  and  tide  through  this

difficult  time.   By working together,  we  will  solve  the

problems  that we have today.  With proper planning  and  the

Government  looking  at the strategy, I  look  forward  to  a

stronger future for Singaporeans of this generation  and  for

our children and their children as well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  this  off-Budget package.  We  are  able  to  do  so

because  of  our  prudent  management  of  our  finances  and

resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at my meet-the-people sessions, three

major areas of concern and request kept recurring:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Requests for jobs;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Concern about the rising electricity and water

bills, SC&C charges and their current mortgage housing loans;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Inability or problems in meeting their hospital

bills and education and transport costs and, for the business

community, they always complain of no business or  very  poor

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had wanted to see how Deputy Prime Minister would

address  these  issues,  and I  must  say  that  I  am  quite

comforted  by the fact that he has given very good assurances

as to how these issues would be tackled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time around, I can feel the urgency, the worry and

the  fear,  more  so  than  in the  previous  1985  and  1997

downturns.    This  time,  the  effect  is  more  widespread,

involving  white and blue-collar workers and  involving  many

categories of our workforce, from the driver to the  manager,

young  professionals and recent graduates.  In  the  previous

downturn,  I remember when we offered jobs to some  of  those

people  who  had  no  jobs,  they  turned  it  down.   I  can

understand at that time why they did that, because there  was

a lot of family support.  Many of the members of the families

had  jobs.   So the family support was there.  But this  time

around,  I  notice that they are less choosy and  they  would

accept whatever jobs that we offer to them.  I can understand

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>



this  recession  must  be  quite widespread.   Not  only  the

manufacturing sector is involved, but the other  sectors  are

also  involved,  and this has affected other members  of  the

family.  Thus, the family support has shrunk and this created

this sense of uncertainty, this fear and this worry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the only way out is job creation and job

preservation.   To  do that, I think the  Government  has  to

provide  that ambience for the business sector to be able  to

create jobs and to preserve the jobs.  Looking at the package

and  listening to DPM, I know that there is a genuine  effort

to  achieve these goals.  And this package obviously contains

a  lot  of assistance programmes to do this.  But the man-in-the-street  should  not feel that the Government  is  helping

this  sector more than them because, if they will go  through

the  package presented, there is a lot for them too.   I  am,

therefore,  glad to see many changes made to help  businesses

to survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember our earlier assessment of the downturn. We

put  a  lot  of emphasis on cyclical cause for this downturn.

But  when I speak to businessmen, they always tell me,  "Doc,

there  is  a  structural  element  there".   This  afternoon,

listening to DPM, he has called for structural changes to  be

made  to  our  economic health, and I am sure this  would  be

supported very strongly by the business community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must be prepared for change in our

lifestyle.  We have to scale down our expectations  in  terms

of  expected  income,  job choices, housing,  recreation  and

spending habits.  No longer can we be too choosy about  jobs,

expect  high  income.  We have to earn every  cent,  and  not

expect  it.  We have to take on jobs now taken up by  foreign

workers, including construction work.  We have to review  our

maid  employment.  For example, we should encourage  some  of

our  Singaporeans  who are unemployed to  take  up  part-time

housekeeping jobs.  Hourly-paid jobs are also a  way  out  in

these difficult times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fear that the foreign worker is taking away a

lot of our Singaporeans'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>



jobs,  and this has been addressed by DPM.  I agree with  him

that  the  tightened criteria are very important, because  he

said  that  the  profile  of  the  working  Singaporean   has

improved.   There  are  more graduates  and  there  are  many

Singaporeans   who   are   tertiary-educated,    and    their

expectations are very high.  We send the best of our students

to  Cambridge,  Oxford, Stanford, etc, to study.   They  come

back,  their  expectations are high and, therefore,  some  of

them  will  feel hurt.  Hence, it is timely that  we  have  a

better set of criteria to employ our foreign workers.  What I

am  saying  is that we must not make Singaporeans  feel  less

valued, and I agree with these stricter criteria now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A targeted approach to those who have lost their jobs is

correct.  I think Mr Chiam got it wrong.  I do not know  what

he was saying.  But let me say that no amount of rhetoric, no

amount  of great speeches can make a man happy, especially  a

breadwinner, when he has got no job.  Therefore, our approach

must  be  targeted.  We must go straight to his problem,  and

his  problem is that he needs finances to pay his PUB  bills,

his  children's education, his transport bills.  That is  why

we have to target it.  So we provide the $200 to them.  It is

one  of  the  various ways that the community is helping  all

these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bukit Timah CDC, all the Members of Parliament in

that  CDC  are given a package, a certain sum of  money,  and

they disburse this fund accordingly so that there is not  too

much  red  tape.   If there is too much red  tape,  the  poor

fellow  will  be running all over the place to  collect  that

$200.   But  that is how we have done it at the  constituency

level,  I  am sure not only in my constituency, not  only  in

Bukit  Timah,  but also in all the other constituencies.   So

when  I heard the hon. new Nominated MP calling the CCC "this

new  animal",  I was a little bit lost.  This  CCC  has  been

around for years, and the CCC has been the best body to  dish

out  these funds to the people.  They know the ground.  Well,

maybe she is new.  Let us forgive her.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I think the call for retraining is

important, because we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2388</b></font><br><br>



must  seize  this  opportunity now.  We must  really  go  and

entice  our workers to go for retraining.  The new  jobs  are

going  to  be different.  They are no longer the  same.   And

this  special "People for Jobs Traineeship Programme" is very

good.  We must encourage that and I support it very strongly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package, as presented, is more than reasonable, and

it will take quite a while for it to sink in.  But I am happy

that we are able to respond to this current economic downturn

with another package so soon after the first package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all in this together. Everyone will have to chip

in - the unions, the Government and business.  We will accept

the  pay cuts, we will overcome, because we have the resolve.

We  have the means, we have the political will and we  are  a

united people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam called these off-Budget measures a political ploy. Why should we apologise?

If it is a political ploy, so what?  I think there is no need

to apologise that this package is a political ploy.  There is

an  election coming, but that should not be the reason for us

not  doing this, which is necessary and right.  Moreover,  we

are using the surpluses saved throughout these five years  in

office to help Singaporeans ride through this crisis.



<br>6.38 pm



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the

Members  who  have spoken on this Ministerial  Statement  and

have  supported  it.   As it has been a  long  day,  I  shall

endeavour to be brief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with what Mr Inderjit Singh said,

questioning  the predictive ability of MTI.  I  freely  admit

that MTI's predictive abilities are limited.  As the Minister

said  day  before yesterday, we have been high  by  too  much

about as often as we have been low by too much.  But that  is

the  nature of our economy.  It is open, it is very dependent

on  external  conditions.  Nobody can be sure which  way  the

world economy will go.  Therefore, we cannot tell



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2389</b></font><br><br>



which  way the Singapore economy will go.  We can guess,  but

we cannot be certain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this year, there was a serious

question what would happen to the US economy.  It had  slowed

down.  Was it going to be a V, was it going to be a U?  Would

the  recovery come back because it is a cyclical problem,  or

was  there a deeper structural issue?  And there was a  range

of  views  amongst  the best analysts -Morgan  Stanley,  J  P

Morgan,  Goldman  Sachs - all the people who  have  a  vested

interest in predicting what is going to happen.  They put out

their  various opinions, arguing persuasively, some  that  it

would  recover  quickly, others that it  would  be  a  deeper

longer  haul.  And we were quite concerned about the  matter,

to  the  extent that GIC had a special study done internally,

comparing  all  these  different views  and  analysing  them,

particularly a view from Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley  who

was  the most pessimistic of them all, with good reason,  and

trying  to  come to some conclusion which of these views  was

correct.   And after reviewing all of them, we  came  to  the

conclusion that there was not going to be a quick pick-up,  a

V, but neither was it going to be an indefinite recession, an

L,  but it would be a U.  A paper was deliberated, discussed,

accepted and adopted as the basis on which GIC operated  and,

indeed, on which the Government also made its assumptions and

plans for the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the best opinions can be wrong. If there are other

opinions outside, we will try and pick them up, but  this  is

not  something  which we can tell for certain,  even  without

11th September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, it looks gloomy now. We cannot say for

sure  that it will not pick up within 12 months or 18 months.

Things  will turn.  Nobody can predict when.  But we  are  at

this pass.  It is a grave situation.  We have implemented  an

$11 billion package to deal with this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first bundle of measures we have had are the tax

measures.  Some hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>



Members have asked for additional enhancements.  For example,

Dr  Vasoo  asked  for  waiver of income tax  on  retrenchment

benefits.   I  am happy to say we agree to that  straightaway

because,  in fact, retrenchment benefits are not  subject  to

income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo also asked for rebates on maid levy and

childcare.  We have not done this.  The reason is  that  even

now  with the maid levy at a constant level - it has not been

increased  - the number of maids has been going up.   In  the

middle of a recession, the demand is still there and we  have

just  left  the levy as it is.  We have decided  that  rather

than  help people with levy, childcare or maids specifically,

it  is  better for us to reduce income taxes, give you a  tax

rebate, New Singapore Shares.  The money is yours, the assets

are  yours, the shares are yours, it is up to you  to  decide

what  you  want to do with them.  If you want to  save  them,

that is fine.  If you want to invest them, that is fine.   If

you want to use them to hire a maid and pay the levy, that is

fine also.  It is your choice.  You have the freedom.  Let us

not  decide for you that it is good that you have a maid,  or

it  is  good  that  your child goes to childcare  instead  of

staying  at  home  with  your parents and  parents-in-law  or

grandparents-in-law.   So we have not  gone  for  maid  levy,

childcare, specific items.  We have gone for broad approaches

which  leave  people the maximum flexibility to  decide  what

they need, what is their most urgent requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen asked for landlords to be compelled to

pass on their property tax savings to their tenants.  This is

an  old issue which we have looked at many times because,  on

previous  Budgets, we have also had property tax rebates  and

we  have  also  wanted it to go through to the tenants.   And

while  we  can do it for JTC, HDB and Government tenants,  we

have  not been able to do it for the private sector.  We have

decided  it  is  not  wise to do it for  the  private  sector

because  the tenancy agreement is a private contract  between

the  landlord  and the tenant.  They settle the  terms,  they

settle  the  price.  If the terms are not right,  either  the

landlord will kick the tenant out, or the tenant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>



will  quit  and  go  somewhere else.  And  the  next  tenancy

agreement, which is signed, will take into account the newer,

lower  property  tax  and the newer,  more  relaxed  property

market.   So we have not compelled it.  Given a soft property

market, there will be pressure on the landlord to pass it  on

anyway  because if he did not pass some of it on, the tenants

will just go elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the biggest question on tax which many MPs

raised  -  Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr  Chandra

Mohan  and Mr Lew Syn Pau - is why not reduce GST.  It  is  a

lot  of  money.  With a stroke of the pen, you can waive  and

distribute  largesse all around.  It is precisely  the  wrong

thing  to do.  We want to achieve a certain objective with  a

certain budget.  The Government still needs money.  I  cannot

just  forgive all taxes this year.  The tax has to come  from

somewhere.   What  is the least bad tax?  There  is  no  such

thing  as  a  good  tax because all taxes  are  bad.   Nobody

volunteers to pay tax but, of all the taxes we have, I  think

the least bad tax is the GST.  It is broad-based, it does not

weigh  heavily  on the poor or the rich; it  does  not  weigh

heavily on any particular good; it does not weigh heavily  on

any  particular  group of companies.  It is uniformly  spread

over the whole economy and its revenues can be used for other

worthy purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to achieve a specific objective, I would say,

raise  money from the GST which is already there and we  will

use  that  to  achieve our objective, reduce  business  cost,

property tax, incentivise businesses to profit, corporate tax

rebate, incentivise individuals and help them have some money

in  their  pockets, personal tax rebates,  asset  share  with

Singaporeans, lower income groups, New Singapore Shares  -  I

use  the money, I distribute that.  It is $11 billion.   What

should  this $11 billion consist of?  I think we  are  better

off  having it consists of these specific items, each with  a

particular  purpose, rather than reducing the GST which  just

distributes money all round without solving any problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I go on to assistance to local enterprises. There

are  three points.  One, Government should ask banks  not  to

recall loans, not to panic, reduce interest rates, mortgages.

Mr  Leong Horn Kee said to keep the umbrella open and  others

also  would  like, maybe, bigger umbrellas.  The  very  brief

answer is that interest rates are already coming down and you

can see the banks reducing their prime rates.  The more basic

answer  is  that  if  the Government  advises  banks  not  to

foreclose   on  their  loans,  to  forebear,  to  lend   more

generously   in  a  downturn,  the  Government  takes   moral

responsibility, and if something goes wrong  with  the  bank,

then the Government has to answer for it.  The bank will come

to  the  Government to say, "I did this.  Now my  loans  have

turned  bad, you have to bail me out."  And that  is  a  very

serious moral hazard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan said that banks have a national duty

because  they  have  a precious licence.   Firstly,  we  have

introduced  competition  into the  banking  sector  so  these

licences are not that scarce.  There are many banks which are

competing  for  the business.  Secondly, the  first  national

duty  of the bank is not to run into trouble and the way  not

to  run into trouble, is to make prudent decisions, long-term

decisions, but careful ones, hard-headed decisions, assessing

which company is viable and should have its loan extended  or

rescheduled; which company is not viable, and they better cut

losses.   And the shrewd banker is the one who knows  how  to

cut his losses with a bad customer, but knows how to extend a

line  and  keep his good customers through an  upturn  and  a

downturn.   Some  of our Singapore bankers  are  very  shrewd

bankers.   Those  of  you who are in the business  will  know

which  are  the shrewdest ones and it shows in  their  bottom

lines.   I  am  not  a commercial banker and  it  is  not  my

business to go and tell them whom to lend money to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the SME bank and SME lending terms, in general, I

have  a lot of sympathy for the idea that SMEs ought to  have

access  to  funds and we should have schemes which will  help

them where they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>



have  specific  problems, because they do not  have  a  track

record,  where they cannot borrow because they  do  not  have

ability to prepare the documentation and their justification,

but  they  have good business ideas and they should  proceed.

But  I  think  setting up a SME bank is  not  a  very  viable

proposition  because in this day and age, to be a  bank,  you

have to be a big bank.  Unless you are a very large bank, you

are  not able to muster that ability and capability to assess

customers,  to have the economies of scale to lend,  even  to

SMEs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the biggest SME lenders in Singapore are big

banks,  including foreign banks, and amongst the local  banks

which  are  not small, there are a few who have a  reputation

for having a SME clientele.  I do not think it is the size of

the  bank which is the problem.  It is the orientation of the

bank,  whether it is focused on lending this sector, and  has

people who understand how this sector works, and can tell who

is  a  promising entrepreneur and who is just telling a  good

story;  or  whether it is not or is unable  to  have  a  feel

because the staff do not speak Teochew, or maybe they just do

not  know how the business culture works.  I do not think the

SME  bank  is a solution.  What we have done with  the  Local

Enterprise Finance Scheme plus the micro loans, plus the loan

insurance, I think, will help significantly.  The  last  time

we  had a problem in 1998, we had expanded these loans.  That

already  made a considerable difference.  This time,  we  are

loosening  the terms further.  Let us see how it  works  out.

If we need to, we can do some more later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on local enterprises. Dr Jennifer Lee asked

about  the  PWD  Corporation moratorium taking away  projects

from  the private sector.  I think she does not have to worry

because   out   of   $3.5   billion  worth   of   accelerated

infrastructure  projects, only about $100  million  worth  of

contracts  will  go to PWD Corporation under the  moratorium.

But  we  have to abide by the moratorium because  that  is  a

legal  obligation.   If  you break that,  then  you  have  to

compensate PWD Corporation and apart from the expense of  it,

it is right that once we have made a commitment, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>



should  stick by that commitment and not lightly  change  it.

There are enough jobs to go around.  PWD Corporation is now a

private  company  - $3.5 billion minus $100 million  is  $3.4

billion  -  I  think  there  is enough  gravy.   Anyway,  PWD

Corporation  is  not  a construction  firm.   It  is  only  a

consultancy   firm.   Even  if  PWD  Corporation   does   the

consultancy,  the actual construction will be  done  by  many

other players in the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, land-related measures. Mr Inderjit Singh asked

about  permanent cost reduction for the future, for  example,

on  industrial land because the rebate is temporary and  this

is  a  longer term problem.  He has a point because, in fact,

it  is  a  longer  term  problem, because  our  companies  in

Singapore are competing against companies which are operating

in  Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and their land prices are going

to  be lower than ours for a long time to come, and not  just

for  these  next one or two years.  So, what do  we  do?   We

could  adjust  our industrial land prices down  and  keep  it

there for sometime.  That is possible.  But in the long-term,

it  is not a complete answer because, even if you leave  your

industrial land prices at two-thirds of where they are today,

there  will  be  land in other parts of Asia  which  will  be

cheaper.   We  cannot match them on price, dollar-for-dollar.

What  we  have to do is to match them overall,  in  terms  of

land,  capabilities,  manpower,  skills,  infrastructure  and

offer  a  value proposition which makes sense for  people  to

come to Singapore and invest in Singapore.  Even then, it  is

uphill because the Chinese are building up their capabilities

considerably.  You have heard BG George Yeo talk  about  this

and  many  of you have visited and seen it too.  We  have  to

reassess our overall strategies and decide what we can do  in

manufacturing, and if manufacturing possibilities  are  going

to be more constrained now, what we can do in services, which

is  the many different types of service industries.  There is

no  quick  answer.  I do not have a solution  today.   It  is

something  which  the Government is studying  and  will  take

several months to consider.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Chiam See Tong also asked

whether removing anti-speculative measures will lead to  sky-rocketing   property  prices.   I  think   in   the   present

circumstances, that is not likely.  The market is  down.   If

you  get  what  the  stock market people  call  "a  dead  cat

bounce",  which means it hits the ground, it bounces  up  and

falls  dead  again, that will already be a slight improvement

from where you are.  At some stage, the mood will change  and

the  market will take off again.  At that point, we will deal

with  that  situation.  We have been through the  cycle  many

times.   I was the one in 1996 who announced the pricking  of

the  bubble and in 1998, we had to reverse that and  here  we

are  reversing  the  last of it.  It will  not  be  the  last

adjustment  but  you  cannot not do anything  throughout  the

cycle.   There are adjustments we can make, even though  they

are not fully effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether we need the 80% rule and

whether we can leave it to the market.  The answer is that we

would  like to leave things to the market as much as possible

but  most countries have a restriction on the degree to which

you can lend against property for mortgage loans.  There is a

reason  for this because, if you lend 100%, the risk  to  the

bank  goes up.  And if there is a downturn, first, the  buyer

has  less equity put in, he has not put his own cash in,  the

chances  of his saying, "Let's default.  I will lose nothing.

It  is  the bank's money anyway." will be greater.  It is  no

loss, I buy a property, I borrow 100%;  if the value goes up,

I  collect  the  upside, if the value  goes  down,  the  bank

carries the can.  We want him to have 20% standing there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if, in fact, the value goes down and the bank

does  carry  the can with the 20% buffer, the bank  has  some

comfort that it will be able to recover the loan.  From  MAS'

point of view, from the banking system's point of view,  that

is  very important.  So I think there is a reason for the 80%

limit,  which is valid in an up-cycle as well as in  a  down-cycle,  and  we should not change it just to deal  with  this

temporary problem.  There is more to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2396</b></font><br><br>



the  issue  than  what  I  have explained.   It  is  quite  a

complicated  matter.   The  developers  have  discussed  this

several times with MAS and MAS will be putting out a somewhat

fuller  reply and you can study that, and we can  discuss  it

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, acceleration of infrastructure projects. Mr Leong

Horn Kee asked for pump priming to include soft projects  for

local companies.  The answer is that we already contract  out

soft contracts to the private sector.  For example, the civil

service  needs training and development programmes and  these

are  open  to  competition by all service providers  and  the

Civil Service College has to compete for the training dollar.

They  do  not automatically get their contract, they have  to

compete.  They are on a self-funding basis and they  have  to

be  better  than  the other suppliers in  order  to  get  the

contract.    Furthermore,   the  accelerated   infrastructure

projects  already  include soft IT  projects,  like  software

development for schools and for hospitals; like the  Ministry

of  Health's  cancer  registry and the  central  immunisation

registry.  These will be open for bidding by local companies.

We have included some soft projects there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam wanted pump priming to also include schools. I

sympathise  with that but, in fact, in terms of  schools,  we

are already building as many as we need and as many as we can

build.   The  Ministry of Education has  a  regular  planning

pipeline.   The  Fifth  Secondary School Building  Programme,

with  $332  million to build seven or eight  new  schools  by

2005, has started, but no school has been completed yet.   So

that is going full steam ahead.  Then, there is the Fifth  JC

Building Programme, which is $139 million, starting in  2002,

to build three JCs by 2006.  These had already started before

this  package, but what is in this package is an acceleration

of  the  construction of the regional ITE campus.   We  agree

with  him  that education is an area where it makes sense  to

bring forward infrastructure construction, and we are pushing

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, queries on employment assistance. Mr Hawazi asked

how many older retrenched professionals and executives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>



will  benefit from the People for Jobs Traineeship Programme.

MOM's  estimate is that the $200 million will support  20,000

places  and, of these, about one-third will go to  retrenched

professionals and executives.  All of them are  meant  to  be

for  older workers, if you interpret "older" to mean  40  and

above.   Of  these older workers, we hope one-third  will  be

retrenched  professionals and executives, but MOM  cannot  be

sure  because  we are ramping up the programme from  quite  a

small  pilot project.  There is a lot of interest.   We  will

push hard to encourage employers to take it.  And I hope  the

unions  will  also  push from their side to  encourage  their

union members to take it up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema asked whether training programmes were

effective in helping retrenched workers.  Mr Chiam See  Tong,

more  pungently,  asked  whether retrenched  programmes  were

doing  any  good.  According to an MOM and NTUC  survey  last

year,  three out of four retrenched workers who took up full-time SRP training were able to secure re-employment within 3-6  months  after  their training.  Mendaki did  a  survey  of

retrenched workers whom they had sponsored for full-time  SRP

training,  and 70% were re-employed within three months.   In

this  downturn, it will take longer.  Jobs are harder to come

by.   But  at least the results are promising and I think  we

should press on with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we come to foreign talents. Mr Simon Tay says

that  the employment pass criterion of $2,500, which is about

the  starting salary for graduates, may be too low.  I  think

what  we  are looking for is a cut off which is not too  low,

but  really we are not looking to price the foreign graduates

out  of  the market.  We want foreign graduates of a  certain

quality,  and the $2,500 is really an indication of the  kind

of graduate we are bringing in and also the kind of job which

the  foreigner  is doing.  We found out that  there  was  one

employer  who had several employment pass holders  at  $2,000

washing  dishes  and plates.  I do not think  he  was  really

paying  $2,000.  The employer said that he was paying  $2,000

and  I  do  not know what else the foreign worker might  have

been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>



doing.  But if an employer is really paying $2,500, then I do

not think the foreign worker is a bottle or dish washer.   He

will be doing a proper job as a proper professional.  And the

requirement  is  not  just the salary  but  that  he  has  an

acceptable degree.  So what we are looking for is the quality

of the person who comes in, and even if the price is somewhat

lower,  he  makes a contribution and he adds to  the  mix  of

people  available in Singapore to be employed.   And  if  you

exclude them, you will be worse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang says:</b> "Are these really talents? Why

don't  we  exclude them?"  I read that this was  one  of  the

planks of his "new poor" manifesto.  So he must be trying  to

warm up, thinking that the general elections are coming.  Let

me  answer  quite directly like this.  If you  kick  out  the

foreigner, it does not follow that the local will get the job

for  more pay.  The company may go.  This year, EDB is hoping

to   bring   in  $9  billion  of  foreign  direct  investment

commitments,  almost  as  much as we  are  spending  in  this

package.  It will create 15,000 manufacturing jobs and  7,000

service  jobs.   One-third of those  manufacturing  jobs  are

foreign, somewhat less than that in service, but let  us  say

one-third  of these jobs are foreign.  So 22,000 jobs,  about

one-third foreign, means 7,000 foreign workers.  Do you think

that if we said "thou shall not employ foreign workers",  EDB

will  collect $9 billion of foreign direct investments?  Will

they  come?   Or  will they say, "Thank you very  much.   You

don't allow me to recruit foreign workers in Singapore.  I am

off.   I'll  go to China.  I can get any number of workers  I

want.   I  can go to Mexico.  I can try Vietnam.    They  are

opening  up."  Will they come to Singapore?  Because  we  are

going  to  have 7,000-odd foreign workers come in with  these

investments,  therefore we are going to create  about  15,000

more new jobs for Singaporeans, through EDB's efforts. So the

foreigners have actually created jobs for Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take 7,000 foreigners who are already in

Singapore and we say, "you go home."  And tell the employers,

"You now replace them with Singaporeans  -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>



engineers,  architects, technicians."  Will  they?   Or  will

they  not  be  off somewhere else, just as the new  companies

will be off somewhere else?  So it is quite plausible, it  is

very convincing and very persuasive to make this argument  to

say  all this is against Singaporean interests, and it sounds

even  better  in  Teochew.  But if you sit  down  coolly  and

analyse it, what we are protecting are Singaporeans.  What we

must  manage  is how to use the foreign workers, the  foreign

professionals and the foreign talent to maximum advantage for

Singapore, and that is what we are trying to do when we raise

the  cut  off for the employment pass to $2,500, and when  we

tighten  up the requirements for skilled work permit  holders

who pay lower levy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, help for the lower income and unemployment. Mr

Ang  Mong  Seng and Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked for  extension  of

Utilities  Save to private property dwellers and S&C  rebates

and Utilities Save to executive flats, because it stops at 5-room.  I think we should look at the package in totality.  We

have  balanced the package.  For the lower income groups,  we

have  Utilities  Save.  We have got the New Singapore  Shares

weighted heavily towards the lower income groups, which means

that as you go up to bigger flats, which usually means higher

incomes  and  higher wealth, the share from this distribution

will  have  to be less.  But at the same time, we  have  also

granted  income tax rebates, and the higher your income,  the

more you are paid, the more tax you have paid, the higher the

tax  rebate  you are going to enjoy.  So it is a bundle.   If

you   look  at  just one side and say, "Can I have  Utilities

Save?", then the 3-roomer will say, "How about giving me  the

tax  rebate too?  I didn't pay any tax, but never mind,  just

give  me the rebate."  So it has to be a bundle, and we  have

tried to balance the package.  In this case, even though  the

Executive flats, the 5-roomers and private property owners do

not get very much under the Utilities Save, the Energy Market

Authority   intends  to  lower  the  wholesale   prices   for

electricity in January.  Electricity prices will  come  down,

and that will flow through to all the households.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>



And  generally speaking, the bigger households  consume  more

electricity.  So if we take it as a bundle, I think  we  have

been fair to everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong asked why charge so much for utilities

that there is a need to give rebates.  The answer is that our

utilities  charges have really gone up and down  with  energy

prices.  Energy prices have gone up, they are followed up  to

recover  the  cost  of the energy.  Energy prices  have  come

down,  they  have  gone down to pass on the benefits  to  the

consumers.   The  other components of energy  cost  have  not

changed  in  Singapore  -   the wage  cost,  financing  cost,

infrastructure  capital cost.  In fact, they  have  gradually

come down.  And as we have corporatised PUB, which became the

Singapore  Power, and now it has become different  generating

companies,   we  have  been  able  to  squeeze   productivity

improvements  out  of  Singapore  Power,  which   have   been

significant, because of the very considerable efforts of  the

management  and the very close cooperation they have  enjoyed

with  the unions in Singapore Power.  And what you are seeing

in rebates now really are the benefits of the union's and the

management's   efforts  being  passed  on   to   Singaporeans

including  those who live in Potong Pasir.   So  rather  than

asking why they were so high before, I think Mr  Chiam should

be  grateful  that through the close working relationship  of

management and unions, we have been able to derive  something

good  which we are now sharing with Singaporeans in a  moment

of need.  Of course, if he does not want it, that can also be

arranged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Dr Vasoo asked for more generous EDRS, so did Mr

Low  Thia  Khiang.   Generally, there is a request for  more.

Again,  more  has to be in the context of the whole  package.

We  have many schemes to look after the people.   If you  are

unemployed, we help you to find a new job, we help you to  be

retrained for a new job.  If you do get a new job, we subvent

half  your salary for six months, up to $2,000.  We try  very

hard  to  get  you  in a place where you are  productive  and

working, and I think that will work for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2401</b></font><br><br>



large  proportion  of Singaporeans.  For a small  proportion,

despite everything we do, they will have a problem.   And  if

all  our  other welfare schemes do not work  -  we have  many

welfare  schemes, including health schemes,  rental  schemes,

education  schemes   -   then, finally,  comes  the  Economic

Downturn  Relief Scheme, and we make an arrangement  to  help

you  tide over a difficult spot.  So I think you have to  see

the  whole  scheme in perspective, rather  than  take  a  $11

billion project, pull out one small component and say this is

too  small.  But you must look at the elephant in  the  face,

you must not just look at the hair on the tail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have the design about right. We have put $20

million  aside.  We have Mr Chan Soo Sen in charge.  He  will

dole it out to the CCCs according to their need, including to

CCCs  in opposition wards if they establish their need.   And

from  our  experience, operating in the CCCs, making  grants,

assessing  cases, we think that we will be able to work  this

scheme  and  this will make a significant difference  on  the

ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, New Singapore Shares. Ms Braema talked about

reaching  out to the elderly in welfare homes.   Dr  Jennifer

Lee  talked  about  Singaporeans  without  CPF  accounts    - homemakers.   I  think  she  means mostly  housewives  and  I

suppose a few husbands.  Mr Simon Tay says, "why tie this  to

CPF   Top-ups  when  this  whole  arrangement  has  not  been

satisfactory?"  I think it has not been shown that this whole

arrangement is not satisfactory.  What we want to  do  is  we

want  to  have some participation on the part of  the  person

receiving  the  New Singapore Shares.  It is not  just  manna

from  heaven, you look up and something good falls into  your

lap.   We  want you to do something.  And what are we  asking

you  to  do?  Pay $50 into your own CPF account,  just  as  a

token that you are still here, you are participating, and you

want  the  shares.   If you are working, it is  automatically

done.   If  you have already participated in the CPF  Top-up,

we  will treat it as done, because you have already put  some

money in.  If you have not, we will give you till the end  of

the year, and you top-up $50, and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>



will  give you the New Singapore Shares.  It is your $50  and

later on you can withdraw it, but we want that participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the CPF Top-up the last time, I think there were

about 200,000 accounts which did not top-up.  Does that  mean

it  has  failed  or  does  that mean  we  have  succeeded  in

discriminating?  If the person did not make the effort to top-up,  should I give him a CPF Top-up?  Should I give  him  the

shares?   If  it  is an old person in an old  folks  home  or

welfare  home, or if she is a housewife who is not  familiar,

then  I think we should make the effort.  We should go, visit

and  explain  to them, persuade them.  If they cannot  afford

the $50, I think somewhere, somebody can afford the $50, help

them,  pay  it  in, collect their due share  as  a  Singapore

citizen.  Similarly, with housewives.  If necessary, we  will

go   door   to  door.   In  fact,  all  the  CCCs,  all   the

constituencies, are presently in the process of  doing  this.

Despite  this, if you still do not want to put $50  in,  then

should I give you the shares?  I think that they should  stay

in  a  pool and next time I make a distribution, those people

who  do  participate  and put $50 in,  they  should  get  the

shares.   So  I do not think that just because not  everybody

has topped up, that means it was a waste of time on the other

hand.   In  fact,  you  can  make a  contrary  argument  that

everybody did it anyway, so there was no point doing  it.   I

think  that  is  also not a valid argument, but  there  is  a

reason why we want the $50 participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, measures relating to wage cost. Several Members

talked  about  using  CPF - Mr Leong Horn  Kee,  Mr  Inderjit

Singh, Mr Iswaran.  Of course, they all qualify that the  CPF

is  to  be  used  only in extremis, but I notice  that  their

various  extremes  are all different.  So  just  putting  the

ideas  together,  there are already three or  four  different

circumstances in which you would withdraw the CPF.   I  would

say, not rule out, but in extremis.  Not extremis under their

definitions and not extreme yet, but in a difficult situation

it  is  something which we can consider.  I  would  be  quite

reluctant because it has taken us a long time to build up the

CPF,  to  reach  40%, to have employers accept  it,  to  have

workers used to it, to have a nestegg for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>



your  retirement, and when you retire, to be quite  sure  you

have  the Special Account which will be there and that  gives

you $40,000 in cash or thereabouts, $40,000 in the house, and

at  least see you through absolute bare requirements.  If you

take  it  out now, it is very fast to take down, it  is  very

slow to build back up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985/86, we cut the CPF 10 percentage points. It

took  us into the early 1990s to restore it - seven to  eight

years.   This time we cut in 1999, we intended to restore  it

quickly,  faster  than last time, we reached  six  percentage

points, four more to go, now our timetable has been derailed.

It  will take us a long time to build this back up again.  So

I  would not lightly touch this.  On the other hand, I  would

not say an absolute impossible.  Never say never.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, other issues have been raised by Members. Mr

Leong Horn Kee asked for confirmation that the $11 billion is

already  accounted for and will not come from  the  reserves.

As  I  have  explained in my main statement, the  accumulated

surpluses  since this Government took office can finance  the

whole   package.   But  after  the  General  Election,  these

accumulated  reserves  will  be  locked  away  and  the   new

Government  will be starting from scratch and they  will  not

have accumulated surpluses.  If by then the economy is strong

and  the  Government revenues are healthy,  they  might  have

enough  to fund the package.  If not, then they will have  to

ask   the  President's  permission  to  draw  down  protected

reserves  to fund the package.  I think we cross that  bridge

when it comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Dr Vasoo and Mr Simon Tay talked about

the  need  for  longer  term  strategies  to  deal  with  the

challenges - unemployment, competitiveness, services, and  so

on.   They are quite right.  This is something which  we  are

working  on  and I have explained this.  It is not  a  simple

matter.   Because Dr Wang Kai Yuen said, "Well,  we  need  to

articulate some vision, MNCs to Singapore companies, GLCs  to

small and medium



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>



enterprises."  Sounds good.  And, in fact, not wrong  overall

as  a  direction, but to go beyond that slogan, to make it  a

strategy, to make it work, what are these local companies and

SMEs going to do?  They are going to do handicraft?  How  are

they  going to make a living?  What is this enterprise  going

to venture into?  These are not easy questions to answer.  If

you  took a laissez-faire approach, you would say, just  open

up, let a hundred flowers bloom, and some of them will become

beautiful.   But  in the real world, sometimes  when  you  do

that,  you get a lot of weeds.  Sometimes when you  do  that,

the  garden does not grow, and you have to add fertiliser and

help  it  to grow, and then see which one succeeds  and  then

push  those.   We  are investing in biotechnology,  molecular

biology.  We are talking about promoting services.  These are

general  ideas.  Biotechnology, more needs to be worked  out;

services,   we   have  done  specific  items  like   banking,

telecommunications; others, we are studying.  But they do not

lend  themselves to glib answers because services are such  a

diverse  field,  so many different types of  activities  that

there is no single strategy which would work for all of  them

and  there  are  different complications  which  we  have  to

account  for each of the different services we might promote.

So these are things which we are working on.  But their point

that today we have only dealt with the short-term package and

the long-term strategies, which we still have to worry about,

that point is well taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I end with Dr Tan Cheng Bock who said, "No need to

fear."   And  I  think that is right.  We have resources.   I

think we have a plan to deal with this.  We have the cohesion

and  the  resilience  with this.  We know  it  is  a  serious

situation.  We have been through such problems before, and we

can  manage.   There  is  no cure for  flu,  Mr  Chiam  says.

Indeed,  it will take time for this downturn to work  through

and  meanwhile, what you can do is to stay warm,  look  after

yourselves and try not to make things worse.  If it  is  flu,

you drink chicken soup.  But today this package is a lot more

than chicken soup.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to let these work through. You cannot

restore the economy to health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>



tomorrow.  Beyond that, it depends on what we do.  It depends

on  whether  we  can  get  strategies  which  will  work  and

implement  them.  And it depends on your having a team  which

will  work out strategies and make them work for you and with

you.   Mr Chiam says apropos the New Singapore Shares  (NSS),

this is vote buying - receiver will be beholden to the giver.

I  would  say, do not just be beholden to the giver  but  ask

what  is  it  which has enabled the Singapore  Government  to

generate  the surpluses, to have the savings tucked away,  to

be   able   in  this  situation  to  render  this   help   to

Singaporeans, which is not insubstantial, not  $200,  but  if

you  work it out by the time the whole package comes  in  and

you have the NSS, it is $2,000-$3,000 per household, and more

than that at the lower end.  Which government does that?  Why

is this Government able to do that?  And how can we make sure

that  the  Singapore Government continues to be  able  to  do

that?   It  is our job to make sure of that, and  I  hope  Mr

Chiam and Mr Low Thia Khiang will help us.  [Applause.]



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Can I seek clarifications, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to clarify, first of

all,  that I did not say that we should stop allowing foreign

talent  to come in altogether.  What I am saying is  that  we

have  to define what do we mean by "talent" and how does  the

policy   itself   not  threaten  the  jobs  of  Singaporeans,

especially at this point in time.  Otherwise, it is going  to

alienate a lot of people.  From the reply of the DPM, he said

that EDB is going to have $9 billion FDI and we will bring in

probably two-thirds of the total employment created by  these

companies and one-third will be foreign talents.   If  we  do

not allow these companies in with foreign employees, they may

decide to go somewhere else, eg, China.  And it seems  to  me

that  allowing  foreign workers to be employed by  companies,

which  are coming here to invest, seems to be the only factor

that  we  are  able to attract investments.  So what  is  the

factor which actually attracts investors to invest here?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2406</b></font><br><br>



And  how important is the policy of foreign talent?  Can  the

DPM explain to us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Government has decided to

tighten  the issuance of employment pass and also  raise  the

ceiling from $2,000 to $2,500.  But there is a problem.  Even

without  raising it, there is this existing  problem.   While

you  set a target to say that to qualify for employment pass,

a person must be paid, let us say, $2,000 or even $1,500, how

do  you  make sure that an employer will not have  a  private

agreement  with  a  worker?  Instead of  paying  $1,500,  the

employer  pays his worker $1,000 or $800 and makes  him  wash

dishes.  This was what the DPM said.  How do you prevent that

from happening?  Because I think that has been happening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is: how do you also make sure that

employment  pass  holders come in for the  specific  jobs  of

employment and they do not go into some other areas or  part-time  jobs  or  take  up jobs in other sectors  as  well  and

compete  with  other Singaporeans?  These are real  concerns,

especially at this point in time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I have in my speech said that perhaps the

Government  should actually also look at cost of living,  how

to  cut  the  cost  of  living of  Singaporeans  during  this

downturn.  Besides the help, what about the cost of living?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope DPM will touch on these matters.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I establish

that  Mr  Low Thia Khiang supports the policy of bringing  in

foreign  talent to Singapore, whatever these other qualms  he

may  have  about  specific implementation problems?   But  he

supports  the idea that we need foreign talent and we  should

bring them in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no quarrel

with  the need to bring in foreign talent.  I have made  this

quite  clear  in  my speech.  I said we understand  it.   The

question  is: how do you go about it and does the policy  not

in  a way threaten and alienate Singaporeans, and how do  you

justify the need?  That is another point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I have made my explanation and I

asked him whether he believes me that if you do not allow  in

foreign workers in a reasonable proportion, EDB will  not  be

able  to  bring investments in.  Does that mean that  we  are

dependent  on foreigners?  To some extent, yes.  But  if  you

look  at  the City of London, which is the greatest financial

centre  in  the world, there are very few Englishmen  working

there.   There  are  Japanese,  Koreans,  French,  Americans,

Australians, a few Englishmen, Scotsmen.  So if you said  you

wanted  only  Singaporeans to be employed, can you  become  a

financial  centre?  You go to New York.  You walk  along  the

streets  -  all  shapes  and sizes of  human  kind,  colours,

dresses and languages.  That is why they are a vibrant  great

centre,  the  Big Apple.  If you go to Silicon Valley,  there

are  East Europeans, Israelis, Indians, Koreans, PRC Chinese,

Singaporeans,  Japanese.  That is why the Silicon  Valley  is

the powerhouse for IT and electronics for the whole world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do we want to become like that or not? We have

practical problems managing.  I put it at $2,500, he may make

a  side deal with his employer.  I put it at $10,000, he  may

still  make a side deal with his employer.  He goes off  duty

in   the   evening.   Instead  of  going  home  and  watching

television, he decides to go and wash cars.  Can  I  stop  it

completely?   No.   Can  I police it  and  catch  it  and  do

something about it when we find it?  Yes.  How can we be sure

that the person who comes in is not a bottle washer?  We have

to  assess the quality of his degree, the sort of company  it

is,  whether it is a reputable company, what sort of jobs the

company claims it is doing, and after that we will visit  the

company once in a while just to make sure whether he is  next

to  the  bottles being washed or whether he is  sitting  down

really  designing something in front of a screen.  There  are

no  cast  iron  solutions to this.  This is  something  which

every  country has to deal with, even countries which totally

shut   out  foreign  workers,  like  Japan.   And  they  have

Iranians,  they have all sorts of strange people who  are  in

the  underground  economy  and  without  which  the  Japanese

economy could not work properly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are problems we have. I am glad that Mr Low

Thia  Khiang  has  made it quite clear.  He  is  not  against

bringing  in  foreign workers.  We share his  objective  that

this should not cause problems for Singaporeans and should be

for  the overall good of Singaporeans.  But we cannot promise

that every Singaporean who feels he has been out-competed  by

a foreigner will get redress.  That is not possible.  Because

there  are  many  reasons  why a  particular  person  may  be

preferred or not preferred, may find a job or not find a job,

and cost is only one of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what we are doing about the cost of living, I do

not  understand what Mr Low Thia Khiang means.  I suggest  he

read  the  Executive Summary again which I have  distributed.

We  have  distributed New Singapore Shares.   We  are  giving

service  and  conservancy rebates.  We are  giving  Utilities

Save  rebates.  We have got electricity charges about  to  be

trimmed.   We have frozen university fees.  We are suspending

repayment of the loans.  Any Singaporean who is in difficulty

can  get help and we have promised to do that.  Then we  have

also  cut hospital charges.  So these are things we are doing

to  address  the problem of the cost of living in  Singapore,

and  it  is  not a problem of things becoming more expensive.

Because  if  you look at the figure, for the  whole  of  this

year, our inflation is less than one-and-a-half percent.   In

fact,  prices have been down every month since May,  ie,  the

CPI.   But it is a problem of people not having quite as much

to  spend because bonuses are down, salaries are cut, and you

have less money to spend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what do I do? I cannot give you the same money as

you had last year when it was a 10% growth year.  But if,  as

a  result of this tightening, you do not have enough for your

bus  fares,  through the EDRS, through the other schemes,  we

will  make  sure  that  you  will not  go  without  what  you

absolutely need.  The frills, we cannot ensure.  But what you

absolutely need, you will not go without.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay: May I just ask the Deputy Prime Minister

about the double tax deductions for charities, an idea



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>



mentioned by the Prime Minister during his National Day Rally

speech?



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is not in this package. But it

is not something we have ruled out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wong, would you like to withdraw the

motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion, by leave, withdrawn.
