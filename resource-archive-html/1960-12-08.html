[29th   November,  1960],  "That   the   Assembly

approves  the financial policy of the  Government

for the year 1961."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on  behalf of the  electorate  of

Upper  Serangoon  constituency,  I  support   the

motion  of the Minister for Finance which  reads,

"That  the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1961."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long Budget Statement delivered by the

Minister  for  Finance  in  this  House  on  29th

November,  1960, gave a penetrating and objective

analysis  of the financial and economic situation

confronting the self-governing State  at  present

and  in the years ahead. In the colonial era  and

the era of the Lim Yew Hock Government, there has

never  been such a Minister for Finance who could

have  given  such a comprehensive and substantial

analysis  of the financial and economic situation

confronting  the  people of Singapore.  From  the

economic  point  of view, had  the  Minister  for

Finance  given  us  in his Statement  approximate

figures of the profits derived locally by foreign

enterprises in the past one year, and had he told

us  what  percentage of their profits  they  were

prepared  to re-invest locally, then  his  speech

would have been more complete, though perhaps  we

have no such need. But anyway, we must thank  the

Minister  for  Finance for his  great  effort  in

handling the finance and economy of Singapore  in

the  past  one year. He has pointed  out  to  the

people  of  Singapore the right way of overcoming

the  financial and economic difficulties  through

their  own effort. The people can see,  from  his

review of the conditions of economy and trade  in

our  State this year, that in the 1½  years  of

office, the P.A.P. has not only brought about  an

unprecedented stable political situation but also

a  new situation of increased trade and expansion

in  production after a short period  of  economic

standstill.   Our  Friends  on   the   Opposition

strongly put forth their propaganda that when the

P.A.P. gained power, factories would  be  closed

and  trade  would  come  to  a  standstill.  This

phenomenon has not come about at all. Of  course,

we  have  no  reason at all to be too  satisfied,

because  the increase in trade and the  expansion

in  export still cannot raise the living standard

of   the   workers  and  labourers.  Our  rapidly

increasing  population  gives  us  many  problems

which are difficult to settle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think it is necessary to emphasise

the   realistic  policy  adopted  by  the  P.A.P.

Government in dealing with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



the  economic  problem. The P.A.P. believe  in  a

society  where there is no exploitation. However,

we  will  not  be so blind as to enforce  radical

socialistic  and economic measures, because  this

will  unnecessarily upset the social and economic

order  or  structure.  According  to  the  Budget

Statement  of  the  Minister  for  Finance,   our

industrialisation  programme  will   be   carried

mainly  through  the system of private  and  free

enterprise.  Thus  honest  capitalists  need  not

worry  about their capital investments not  being

protected by political measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working classes of Singapore, as a whole,

have  fully understood the situation in Singapore

and have expressed their tolerance and wisdom  in

their  struggle  for  better  living  conditions.

During the past year, without their co-operation,

the  manufacturing industries and trade could not

have  expanded. Generally speaking,  the  working

classes  are  not  to  be blamed  for  industrial

unrest under the free enterprise system, except a

few  of  them.  In my opinion,  so  long  as  the

capitalists  and  employers give their  employees

reasonable pay and reasonable working conditions,

the  workers  of  Singapore will  shoulder  their

responsibilities to proceed with their production

work for the sake of the State's prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debates today and the coming days, our

friends  on the Opposition will certainly scratch

their  heads  to think out some minor  points  in

order  to attack the Government, so as to pretend

that  they  are the champions who fight  for  the

welfare  of the people. I maintain that they  are

all  short-sighted people. No matter how or  what

they  say,  even when their lips become  dry  and

their tongues get parched, they will not be  able

to  show  their talents in order to convince  the

people.  Surely they will exaggerate  and  attack

the  Government,  saying that it  has  given  the

people a burden to shoulder in respect of the tax

proposals  put forth by the Government.  But,  in

fact,   the  Minister  for  Finance  has  already

pointed out that in the eight new taxes of $10½

million,  only $750,000 will be directly  derived

from bachelors whose income is less than $310 per

month, or from those families whose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



income is less than $500 per month. What is  more

important is that all the revenue from these  new

taxes  will  be  completely spent on  the  social

welfare  of the people as well as on the economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while reviewing the financial

conditions of our State, I think it is  necessary

to   comment  on  several  points.  Firstly,   at

present,  the  two  countries - the  Federation  of

Malaya  and  Indonesia, which are inseparable  as

far  as  our  State's economy  is  concerned - are

pressing ahead along their own courses they  have

chosen.  It  is not an easy task to maintain  and

promote efficiency in the co-operative offices in

these    territories    under    these    complex

circumstances.  The  efforts  put  forth  by  our

Minister for Finance in this respect deserve  our

appreciation. Secondly, up to the present moment,

capitalist  countries  have  not  given  us   any

positive   and  practical  assistance.   In   the

apportionment   of  finances   for   our   future

development  plan, our Minister for  Finance  has

said  that  he  has  no undue  hope  for  foreign

finances.  This  is  very  proper  and   correct.

Thirdly,   the   expenditure   of   the   various

departments  in 1960 is less than  the  estimated

expenditure  by  $37  million.  Naturally  it  is

partly  due  to the savings in the administrative

expenditure.  On the other hand,  it  also  shows

that  our  State  lacks highly skilled  technical

people.   At  present  the  Government  has   the

responsibility of recruiting technically  skilled

people  either from overseas or locally in  order

to  fill these vacancies. By our long-term  plan,

those  scholars at present studying abroad or  in

the  local universities should try their best  to

equip themselves with knowledge and skill so that

they  may be able to shoulder the heavy  task  of

improving the living of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's

financial policy.



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Government  has  presented us  its  Budget  as  a

pattern  of a fiscal policy; and it is  a  P.A.P.

Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



as  the  Hon. the Minister for Finance repeatedly

rammed  down  our throats at every  turn  of  his

speech.  Not  the Singapore Government,  but  the

P.A.P.  Government, and the P.A.P. Government  is

allegedly  a Socialist Government. And what  have

they  produced, Mr Speaker, Sir? If  this  is  a

socialist Budget, all I can say is: I cannot  see

the sheep for the wolf's clothing. What I see  is

just  the wolf - a Budget to tax the poor and  some

of  the  rich,  a  Budget that has  no  provision

whatsoever  for the unemployed who are tragically

increasing  in  numbers, a  Budget  that  has  no

provision  whatsoever for the  under-employed,  a

Budget that does not even take into consideration

the  retired worker who at the end of a long  and

useful life finds himself no longer able to  work

and,  like a squashed orange, is thrown into  the

gutter.  Not  one  word of old  age  pension,  or

unemployment  insurance in  this  P.A.P.  Budget.

"Asians", says the Hon, the Finance Minister, "no

longer  accept  poverty as the natural  order  of

human society." That is in Hansard, Vol. 14,  No.

1,  col.  12,  paragraph  2,  Mr  Speaker.  Must

Singapore accept it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Finance says in col.

40, paragraph 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...there is every hope that if we increase

the   inducements  and  facilities  for   private

capital  investment,  we  have  every  chance  to

achieve  a  sufficiently high rate of  growth  to

provide work for our growing population.'



<br><br>Let  us  examine  that.  Despite  what  he  calls

"improved  conditions" in trade and industry  and

the impetus that he alleges the P.A.P. has given,

the  figures he indicates for the last 18  months

show  employment for only 1,049  workers  in  new

small   industries  and  the  total   anticipated

employment, if all the `pie-in-the-sky'  projects

are  achieved at a cost of over $100 million,  is

employment for 2,500 workers, and if  we  add  to

these projects still vaguer possibilities of  all

the  enquiries and assume that each and every one

of   them   eventuates,  the  total   number   of

employment on these would be 2,000 - 1,049  already

employed,  and a probability that  2,500  may  be

employed in the years to come.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the Minister equate these facts with

his  assertion  that the rate of  our  industrial

growth   will  meet  the  needs  of  our  growing

population?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I

never said that!



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> `a sufficiently high rate of growth to

provide  work for our growing population.'  I  am

not  suggesting  that  industrialisation  is  not

valuable.  It is, Mr, Speaker, Sir.  But  it  is

important  that  the Government should  recognise

and  that the people should know that the maximum

possible industrialisation in the most favourable

circumstances cannot employ more than 10 per cent

of  our  unemployed.  Let  us  not  increase  the

tragedy  of those who suffer idleness at  present

through no fault of their own, by pretending that

they  will get employment, and deluding them into

hopes  that  can never be achieved. We  ought  at

least to tell the truth to this tragic sector  of

our population even if we cannot help them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Finance has also

spoken with roseate optimism about the future  of

our  trade and commerce. There is not one  single

businessman I have spoken to who does  not  state

categorically  that  our  economy   is   sagging.

Nothing dramatic - just sinking quietly like a ship

in  a  calm sea; and yet it has been the  unusual

good fortune of this P.A.P. Government to have  a

tremendous  boom  in the Federation  which  would

normally   have  meant  a  boom  of  considerable

prosperity  in  Singapore,  but  which  has  only

succeeded in cushioning the depression which  has

set  in with the advent of the P.A.P. Government,

a   depression  which  progressively   saps   our

economic  structure. It is a  pity  there  is  no

businessman in the P.A.P. to tell them the  facts

of life. Figures are helpful, but statements like

"There is a solid and substantial revival of  the

economy this year" based on selected figures, are

wholly  misleading and unfair to the people,  Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Three!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Hon, the Minister for

Finance wishes to elucidate, he might try; but he

should not interject from his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> There is one small item I must touch

upon and that is the Workers' Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Works Brigade!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think it would help

considerably  all  round in our  appreciation  of

what the Member for Joo Chiat hopes to contribute

to  the economic thinking of this country, if  we

refer to things by the names they are referred to

in the Budget and in the newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I did not quite catch the point

raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, in the Estimates, in

the  Budget  speech and in the newspapers,  there

are  references made to the Works Brigade. If  we

are  to  coin new nomenclatures for the  same  or

different  things,  then  perhaps  we  might  get

ourselves  lost  well before the Member  for  Joo

Chiat is finished in the next few minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not wish to go down

to  the  personal  level; but  names,  names  and

names.  Is  that all what the Prime  Minister  is

capable of saying? What does it matter whether it

is  the  Works  Brigade or the Workers'  Brigade?

What  is in a name? It is really the merits  that

count. The P.A.P. Government has changed so  many

names  in this country that we are apt to  get  a

headache. I feel like calling some names too, but

I think I had better not digress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems to me, Sir, that the

establishment of the Works Brigade and  the  work

it is doing negates the basic principles of trade

unionism.  The Works Brigade is cheap  labour  at

below  the  market rates for Government projects.

In the long run, this is an unhealthy approach to

the  needs  of the country and one to  which  the

trade unions of the country should awaken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> No, Sir, I do not wish any more

interruptions.  It is the duty of Government,  as

an  employer,  not to undermine the  trade  union

movement by a reserve of cheap labour, but to pay

in full for the services it receives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter on which I must touch is the

question  of the treatment of the civil servants,

and  the  tender generosity of the Government  in

stating   that   they   are   willing   to   have

negotiations for partial restoration of  variable

allowances;  or is "restitution"  the  word  used

instead  of "restoration"? I cannot remember.  It

is a tragic farce that Government should offer to

give  the  civil servants a very small percentage

of  what is their rightful due with one hand, and

then  take  it  away in their increased  taxation

with the other. And what is more deplorable,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  is that there is in  existence  a

freely    negotiated   agreement   between    the

Government  and the Civil Service for arbitration

on  pay and conditions of service, and the  civil

servants   have   pleaded   earnestly   for    an

Arbitration Tribunal to be appointed to  consider

their  legitimate complaints about the manner  of

the  reduction of variable allowances  and  about

the  need for such reduction in the light of  the

Surplus Budgets of the P.A.P. Government. Despite

the   formal  agreement  freely  negotiated,  the

Government refuse to arbitrate because they state

that this is a matter of policy. I am reminded of

the  story  of  the  Chinese  cook  in  a  Muslim

household,  who  was in no uncertain  terms  told

that  pork should never be brought to the  house.

One  day he was found eating pork. When asked for

an  explanation,  he said, "This  no  pork;  this

fish.  I  put pork in water. I say, `Pork,  pork,

you no pork. You fish." And so we have government

as the major employer encouraging-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I am very confused, Sir. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> And so we have Government as the major

employer  encouraging  employers,  by  their  own

conduct, to deny solemn agreements freely entered

into.  [Laughter.] Laughter or no laughter,  that

is  what  is happening. In the case of the  Civil

Service  the sum involved is not very great,  but

the  number of people involved are a large number

of  loyal servants of the country. Not only they,

but  their dependants, and the trade which  their

expenditure brings. It is a shameful  thing  that

Singapore should dishonour its obligations to its

civil   servants   and  pretend   generosity   in

restoring  them  just enough  to  pay  their  own

income tax increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Indonesia, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the

Finance  Minister's remarks about our trade  with

Indonesia highlight what has been known  by  most

of  us,  and  that  is that the Prime  Minister's

mission  to Indonesia has been a complete failure

despite the pink smoke screen emanating from  the

Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why pink?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> This failure emphasises the need for a

well-trained    experienced    Singapore    Trade

Commission permanently established in Djakarta. I

therefore welcome the statement of the  Hon. the

Minister  for  Finance that a Trade and  Cultural

Commission  will be established in Djakarta.  Not

only  in Djakarta, Mr Speaker, Sir, but  also  I

think  in other neighbouring territories, and  as

far as China, there is an imperative need for  us

to  establish  permanent Trade  Commissions.  One

final  matter,  Mr Speaker, Sir. The  newspapers

have given the impression that the Government has

promised to stand-still taxation for three years.

My understanding of the Finance Minister's speech

is that that is only in respect of Property Tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You read the wrong newspaper!



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> There is no promise at all in respect

of income tax or any of the other taxes. Will the

Hon. the Minister for Finance clarify?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the business tax. I would like most

emphatically  and  most  forcibly  to  draw   the

attention of the Hon, the Minister for Finance to

this  point, and that is, despite what  he  might

say   about  the  economic  conditions  of   this

country, those of us who mix with business people

in  this  country know that many  a  business  is

being  run  at a loss. To put a business  tax  of

$1,000  on a big limited company would  not  hurt

that company. But unfortunately, a tax of $750 on

the smaller companies will hurt them tremendously

and  will cause them great hardship, because most

of  them are now being run at a toss. I hope  the

Finance Minister will not laugh that one off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that this Budget is

not  a Socialist Budget, nor is it a Budget  that

adequately meets the realities of today  and  the

economic problems of tomorrow of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall vote against the motion.



<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has

placed  before us facts and figures to prove  his

contention  that everything is plain sailing  and

that  there is nothing to worry about. Yet,  Sir,

by  his  own calculation, he says that about  $30

million  will  not  be  spent  from  this  year's

Budget.  This  in  effect  means,  again  in  the

Minister's  own words, that `there will  be  less

rural  roads and bridges this year, less  doctors

and specialists, less maintenance work by P.W.D.,

fewer   scholarships,  fewer  fellowships,  fewer

police  constables,  fewer  teachers  and   fewer

technicians.' The people of Singapore, Sir,  will

have  everything  less  in  1960.  And  yet   the

Minister for Finance tells us in effect  that  we

have  never had it so good. I say, Sir,  that  we

have   never  had  it  so  bad,  what  with   the

increasing number of unemployed and more to  feed

on less income per head.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Stop producing!



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, admittedly

there  has been an increase in the flow of trade,

but this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



seeming   prosperity  is  not   the   result   of

Government's initiative but an act of God.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of rubber, Sir, has been good, and the

increased  output  of  this  commodity   in   the

Federation  of Malaya and its export through  the

port of Singapore has, again as the Minister  has

pointed  out,  directly benefited the  State.  In

other  words,  Sir,  we - I  mean  the  people   of

Singapore - live on the exertions and  goodwill  of

our  neighbours.  This state  of  affairs  cannot

continue,  and will not continue for  long.  This

House  is  no  doubt  aware that  the  Federation

Government  is making every effort to expand  the

port  facilities at Port Swettenham and  Sebarang

Prai;  and  then there is even talk of exploiting

the  harbour at Port Dickson, not to mention  the

proposed  international airport at Kuala  Lumpur.

Nothing,   Sir,   can   induce   the   Federation

Government to stop proceeding with these schemes.

At  the  same  time, they are in the  process  of

establishing  a rubber and stock exchange  market

in the Federal capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this hive of activity in the Federation

points  to  one  fact. Very  soon,  and  probably

during the life-time of this Government, a  large

portion  of  our  entrepot trade  will  cease  to

exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other support of our

economic  life,  Indonesia, has already  shown  a

tendency  to crack. The Minister for Finance,  in

his  Budget  speech, and here, Sir, I quote  from

Hansard, Vol. 14, No. I col. 14, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Many of the problems arising in our trade with

Indonesia are long standing and difficult.  While

we are a free trade economy with controls reduced

to  the barest minimum, the Indonesians prefer  a

policy  of  "guided economy".  This,  in  effect,

means  the imposition of controls over all  major

aspects of trade and production. What we have  to

do  is  to  meet  the legitimate requirements  of

Indonesia's guided economy in such a way  as  not

to destroy our entrepot trade.'



<br><br>That  was what the Minister for Finance  said  in

his Budget speech. Whilst on the one hand we must

give credit to the Prime Minister for his efforts

to improve friendly, relations with Indonesia - and

I admit he has to some extent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



been  successful - the economic  relations  between

the  two  countries  have not shown  any  visible

signs  of  improvement. The key to  our  economic

survival is our entrepot trade. This is  not  the

first  time that the Government of Singapore  has

sent  missions  across the Java sea.  During  the

David  Marshall  regime,  a  similar  Ministerial

mission  spent  some  time in  Djakarta  followed

later   by   two   fact-finding   missions   from

Indonesia.   Though   there   was   some   slight

improvement   in   relations  between   the   two

countries, nothing came out of the whole  affair.

In  fact, Sir, at that time, there was no  guided

democracy and no guided economy to contend  with.

As  I see it. Sir, the basic fact then was, as it

is  now,  the desire of the Indonesian Government

to  eliminate what it calls the smuggling  trade.

Singapore,   being  a  free   port,   places   no

insurmountable restrictions on its  imports,  and

hence  does  not in the nature of things  control

the commodities that enter its waters nor enquire

into  the sources of the imported goods. In other

words, Sir, not all goods imported into the State

of Singapore from Indonesia have gone through the

proper  controlling authorities at  the  port  of

loading.  Hence  what  we call  free  trade,  the

Indonesians  call smuggling. What the  Indonesian

Government wanted Singapore to do was to  be  its

policeman.  And  this  situation  Singapore   was

unwilling to accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only would it create a bad precedent, Sir,

but  it  would also upset the whole structure  of

our free port status. The position today is still

the   same,  guided  economy  or  not.   To   the

Indonesians, it is not only a matter of  national

pride but also a matter of economic survival.  If

they  can  manage to seal this  leak  and  a  few

others in Borneo and Sarawak, they feel they  can

certainly overcome the periodic economic stresses

that seem to confront them from time to time.  My

sympathies, Sir, are with them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this, it could be seen

that  the economic survival of Singapore  depends

largely on the goodwill and tolerance of our  two

great neighbours, Indonesia and the Federation of

Malaya.  How long we can depend on this goodwill,

again only the gods can tell. It is therefore the

duty  of the Government of Singapore, whether  it

be the P.A.P. Government or any other, to provide

alternative sources of livelihood for its  people

before disaster overtakes them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's Five-Year Plan is an admirable

paper,   but  what  are  the  basic  facts?   The

industries  that  are  envisaged - flour   milling,

textile  weaving, steel milling  and  a  host  of

other   manufacturing  projects -  will  no  doubt

provide  employment  to many.  But,  Sir,  having

produced  such  goods, the job is to  sell  them.

Unless   we   can   produce  cheaply   and   sell

competitively I see no hope for an industrialised

Singapore,  however hard Government  may  try  to

induce investors to set up industries. We are not

the  only  country in Asia which is  thinking  in

terms of industrialisation. And we are not in the

fortunate  position which some of these countries

are  in,  where they have a huge local population

who  can  easily consume the products that  their

industries   produce  without   bothering   about

exports.   As   I   see  it,  Sir,   Government's

industrialisation  policy,  among  other  things,

faces  two uncompromising barriers. The first  is

the  lack of a ready and large enough home market

to   act  as  a  cushion  and  to  make  industry

worthwhile;  and, secondly, the  tariff  barriers

that  have been and will ultimately be put up  by

other   producing  countries,  as   has   already

happened in Indonesia and only a few days ago  in

the   Federation  of  Malaya.  Both   these   two

countries  which  are  our  logical  buyers   and

consumers  have  their own  Five-Year  Plans  and

industrial  policies; hence we cannot  place  any

confidence  in these markets. On the other  hand,

Sir,  we cannot hope to follow the lead taken  by

Hongkong,  where primarily because of  its  very,

very  cheap  labour it has been able  to  capture

some  of  the  world's markets.  It  is  obvious,

therefore,  that  by the time our  industries  go

into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



full  gear  most  of  the  possible  markets  now

available to us will have already been  taken  up

by   the  local  industries  in  the  territories

concerned, or will have been checked one  way  or

another by tariff barriers. Sir, I do not dare to

predict  that Government's industrial  plan  will

end in failure. But I do say this - that so long as

our  economy  is tied in the way  it  is  to  the

goodwill  of  our neighbours, the  way  ahead  is

indeed  bleak  and dark. I therefore  hope,  Sir,

that  while  implementing  its  industrial  plan,

Government  would at the same time  make  greater

efforts  to convince our neighbours, particularly

the  Federation of Malaya, that they need  us  as

much as we need them. The only way to do this  is

to  put  the general political atmosphere in  its

proper perspective. Our Prime Minister here, Sir,

proclaims  that  his  Government  is  a   Leftist

Socialist  Government.  Across  the  Straits   of

Johore,  we find the Tunku vociferously repeating

that  his  is  a  Rightist  people's  government.

Whilst, on the one hand, the people of both these

territories   tend   to  regard   themselves   as

Malayans, the Government of both territories  are

poles  apart.  Somewhere, Sir, there  must  be  a

link, a link that would strike the right note and

bring  about  a  common  understanding  of   each

other's  problems.  For only then  can  there  be

mutual  trust and mutual respect, the foundations

upon which to build a prosperous Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are on the subject of our

relations  with  the Federation,  I  am  somewhat

perturbed to note that it is the intention of the

Government   eventually   to   have    a    trade

representative in Kuala Lumpur. I wonder  whether

this  is  a wise move. If the object is  to  have

closer  relations  with  the  Federation  in  the

economic field, then I think it is the wrong  way

to  go  about it. Kuala Lumpur is only 200  miles

away,  a  matter  of only an hour's  flight  from

Singapore. Nothing would jeopardize the relations

between these two countries more than to  have  a

representative  in  Kuala Lumpur,  a  fact  which

would  only  tend  to emphasise  the  distinction

rather than the common interests of both. Sir,  I

would  advise Government to think again  on  this

matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

last  year  we  humbly and earnestly  warned  the

Government that their policy of the big knife and

the big axe-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The broad axe.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - and the broad axe was being

carried out too far; that the drastic cut in  the

variable allowances of Government servants was  a

hasty   and   premature  step  and  might   prove

unnecessary because the threatened deficit  might

turn  out  to  be a surplus. As usual,  Sir,  the

arguments of the Opposition were met by a barrage

of  ridicule sneers and laughter. We also  warned

the Government that the drastic reduction in the

spending   power  of  thousands   of   Government

employees  to  the  tune of millions  of  dollars

would  have a chain reaction and that there would

be  repercussions on the economy of the  country.

Sir,  after  14  years, the  truth  is  out.  Our

forecasts  were correct. The year 1959 ended  not

with  a deficit but with a surplus of $9 million,

according  to  the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara, and the year 1960 is likely to end with a

deficit of $37 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> A surplus!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> With a surplus of $37

million.  Ordinarily, Sir,  surpluses  should  be

welcomed.  But  these surpluses as  a  result  of

drastic  under-expenditure and drastic  pay  cuts

have  had  very adverse effects on the  country's

economy.  The  result is that there  has  been  a

general  tightening  up  of  the  people's  purse

strings.  People who have money are reluctant  to

spend, and those who would like to spend have not

got  the money or have not got jobs' whereby they

can earn money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has mentioned two

aspects which are considered remarkable.  In  the

light  of  what I have said, Sir, the explanation

is  quite  simple. May I refer to  Hansard,  29th

November,  1960, Vol. 14, No. 1,  col.  18  which

reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All in all, the indications are that there was

a  solid  and substantial revival of the  economy

this  year.  What is remarkable in this  economic

revival  is  that  the  expansion  in  trade  and

production  did not bring about any  inflationary

process.  The  currency in  circulation  for  the

Malayan    dollar   area   remained   practically

stationary,  being $1,162 million in January  and

$1,166 million in September.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, we know now why. Because there was

not  much  money  in  circulation  owing  to  the

drastic cut in the millions that could have  been

spent   and  that  could  have  started  a  chain

reaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prices of consumer goods did not rise. On the

contrary, -'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member will not give

way, the point of information cannot be raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the Hon. the Prime

Minister will have his chance after my speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will have forgotten what

he said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prices of consumer goods did not rise. On the

contrary,  the  official index of  retail  prices

showed  a  decline of 5.4 points  from  317.2  in

January to 311.8 in September.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, further down the column the Finance

Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Taking into account all items of consumer goods

in  the  course  of the year, there  has  been  a

significant  fall in prices. There are  very  few

instances in contemporary economic history  where

economic  expansion and falling  prices  occurred

simultaneously.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Sir, because in most countries there

was not this-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Pay cut!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - counter action on the part

of   the  Government  to  bring  about  not  more

prosperity,  but a decline in the  prosperity  of

the  country. The fact that the Indonesian  trade

declined was another sign. I shall later on  deal

with  what  I consider to be the real reason  for

the  surpluses. Sir, when the Government  imposed

that pay cut unilaterally-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You must have suffered quite a lot!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> -it was assumed that there

would  be  a  huge  deficit,  and  therefore  the

Government  had  to  take drastic  measures.  The

Minister  for Finance, in fact, said that  unless

he took such measures, the boat might sink.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. Sir, I think I am right

in  assuming that the hon. Member was in  receipt

of  a  variable allowance which had been reduced.

Is it in order for a Member to speak on a subject

in which he has an interest financially?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Minister for Finance

with that sparkle in his eyes is probably raising

this point of order with his tongue in his cheek,

because  he  does know that this is a  matter  of

general policy, and any Member can speak  on  any

matter   of   general  policy,  whether   he   is

personally interested or not. Mr Thio.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I think I did mention it, but

if  I  did not, I will now say that I did mention

to a few Assemblymen on the Government side, that

if ever the Government did make restitution and I

stood to benefit by the restitution, all that was

due to me would be given to the unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Works Brigade!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, am I



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, will the Prime Minister take

his seat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will not give way, no

other Member can stand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am glad the Government has

begun  to  show a change of heart by wanting  the

Staff Side to reopen negotiations, but, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



there is an important principle involved. If  the

cut   in   the  variable  allowances   was   made

unilaterally,  on the basis of  a  wrong  premise

that there would be a huge deficit, then whatever

the  Government gained thereby should  belong  to

the  employees.  If there should be  negotiations

for  a  partial restoration of that cut, then  it

could  be  made hereafter but it could  not  have

retrospective effect. What was cut  off  was  cut

off  on  the  assumption that the Government  was

facing  a  huge  deficit. That  deficit  did  not

materialise  because,  as  a  result  of

under-expenditure,  there  was no  deficit.  Therefore,

Sir,  part  of  that  surplus  belonged  to   the

Government  employees. Sir, it is  time  for  the

Government to show by their actions that they are

a  model  employer. If an employer,  on  a  wrong

premise, retained part of his employee's pay  and

in  due  course he finds out that he had  made  a

mistake, then I am sure, Sir, that the Government

would demand that that employer should return all

the money that had been wrongly retained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Did we make a mistake?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, this is a case of

restitution and not restoration. However,  it  is

possible that in the process of negotiations, the

Government  might be able to persuade  the  Staff

Side,  out  of  loyalty to the State  or  out  of

sympathy   for   the  unemployed,   to   make   a

contribution to an unemployment fund;  but  I  am

sure that morally the civil servants are entitled

to  that sum of money which has been retained  on

wrong premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first quarter of his Budget

Statement, the Minister for Finance launched  out

on  what he described as "a dissertation on basic

principles".  There is much in that statement  of

principles with which we agree, but now and  then

he varied cleverly, interposing a sparkling claim

which  might impress foreign readers  or  passing

tourists  but  which is startling and  in  a  way

surprising to local people with local knowledge.

Such   claims   cannot   be   allowed   to   pass

unchallenged.   In  column  10  of   the   Budget

Statement,  at  paragraph  2,  the  Minister  for

Finance said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is the ultimate test. For a government is

judged  not  so much by its expressions  of  good

intentions  but  by its concrete achievements  in

the   way  of  economic  prosperity  and   public

welfare.'



<br><br>Up  to this point, we agree, Sir. Then he went on

to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By this standard the people of Singapore have

done well.'



<br><br>"Have  done  well", Sir? Ask the people  who  put

them  into power - the hawkers, the trisha-pullers,

the  taxi-drivers: has Singapore done well?  They

will  say that the people of Singapore have  done

badly - very badly! If the Government had said that

some  of the people of Singapore have done  well,

we  could  have accepted that. The  people  would

have  accepted that without any protest.  But  to

say  that the people of Singapore have done  well

throughout  last year, Sir - that is  like  asking

people to believe what they have not experienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people who have eyes to see and ears to

hear  can  see and hear for themselves  what  has

happened.  The  people who have benefited  are  a

small section of the community - the merchants  who

have  trading interests with the Federation.  The

merchants  and  companies who own tin  mines  and

rubber  estates or who own shares have benefited.

The  increases  have only been increases  through

bank  transfers, but the profits  have  not  gone

quickly  to  the  employees and then  on  to  the

consumers.   Therefore,   there   is   not   much

money - more  than  what  is usually  circulated - to

circulate. There is less spending power. With the

population  increasing, naturally there  is  less

money per head to spend. Sir, those who have made

money  and  who have really prospered  have  most

probably salted it away somewhere - [Interruption]

maybe  to  the Federation, Borneo or  Sarawak - and

they will not invest in Singapore until they  see

more   signs  to  indicate  that  they  can  have

confidence  in the Government. One way  in  which

the  Government can show that they  are  able  to

keep their promises is for them as employers, -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Who is talking?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> -to do what they expect other

employers to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What is that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think probably the

Government  Benchers  are taking  this  debate  a

little  too  frivolously. I  would  suggest  that

there should be less interruptions from them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

noticed  one regrettable thing on the  Government

side, and that is they seem to think they have  a

monopoly on human wisdom in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have not got a monopoly

on stupidity!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, when we make mistakes,

it  is  only right that we should own up to them,

because we can learn from them. And although  the

Government  have  not  said  so,  there  are  now

indications  that they want to  rectify  some  of

their  errors.  The  Prime Minister  himself  has

expressed that sentiment in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has inherited a great deal

of  prosperity from the past. They are  going  to

benefit  to  the tune of $30 million through  the

hastened repayment of the loan to the Federation.

We have no objection, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How can you?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance

is now trying to win back the confidence of local

investors  and  foreign  capital.  We  wish   him

success,  Sir.  But  can  the  Government  really

succeed if with one hand they promise to give one

thing,  and  with the other hand they  cause  the

people's  confidence to be shakened? To give  one

instance,  Sir, there is in the trade unions,  as

we  know,  a struggle for control. The Government

side  know  better than we, Sir, what forces  are

involved.  But the general workers  in  Singapore

are  not interested in the political struggle  in

the  trade  unions. They are only  interested  in

better wages and better living conditions, and if

they  could  share  in  the prosperity  of  their

employers, they would be glad to do so. They  are

not  interested in the political struggle, except

those who are interested in political power. Sir,

if  the trade unions in Singapore could be really

set   free,   like  the  trade  unions   in   the

Federation,   that  would  be  a   step   towards

industrial peace and stability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government have declared that they are

partial  to  the workers. If they want stability,

then  they will have to be partial, fair or  just

to  three sides: to the workers, to the employers

and  to  the  general  public.  Very  often,  the

general  public are left out from  that  picture.

How  can people believe that politics do not play

an  important  part  in  trade  unions  and  that

politics  do not have a final say in business  if

the  Government  still have  political  advisers?

With   political  advisers  advising   Government

Ministers  and playing a very prominent  part  in

trade  unions, it must naturally be assumed  that

should  there be any disagreement, then there  is

no chance for the business people to have justice

on  their  side.  So  if the Government  want  to

indicate  that  they are sincere  in  wanting  to

bring  over foreign capital and in getting  local

people  interested in investing  money  in  local

enterprises, then one way would be to abolish the

posts of Political Secretaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Minister for Finance

referred  to Japan and West Germany as  countries

whose economic revival has been nothing short  of

miraculous.   Sir,   these  countries   are   not

controlled  by  extreme Left-wing  groups.  I  am

glad,  Sir,  that the Government  say  that  free

enterprise  can  play a great  part  in  bringing

prosperity to the country. We believe, Sir,  that

any  industrial peace based on the ideology of  a

class  war  will never work. It is time  that  we

think  about the basis on which we want  to  have

industrial  peace and stability in this  country.

We  should not set workers against employers  nor

employers   against  workers.  We   are   against

exploitation of the workers by employers. But the

time  has  come  when  we cannot  have  political

bosses  also exploiting the workers for the  sake

of political power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of unemployment casts a shadow

over  the  future  of Singapore.  The  Government

solution  is  through  industrialisation   at   a

terrific  cost.  We have been  told  that  on  an

investment totalling $100 million there  will  be

opportunities for employment for 2,500 people. At

that rate, Sir, Government will need $800 million

to provide employment for 20,000 workers, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



may  be  the  annual intake of  labour  into  the

labour  market each year. Sir, I do not think  we

have the money for that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, he will have his chance

later on. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, local businessmen say

that with free enterprise, they can do it on less

money.  On $15,000 or $10,000 - and not on  $40,000

- they  can  provide work for one  employee.  Sir,

industrialisation will succeed provided there  is

a  market for the goods produced, and the  market

cannot  be  limited to Singapore alone.  We  have

seen how, after the Government had made a move to

protect  the local manufacturers of soap, another

move  was  made in the Federation which nullified

the result of the Singapore move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it looks as if in spite of the Government's

good intentions we are not sure of the success of

the  plans outlined by them. We believe  that  we

must basically remove the fear and distrust which

the  Federation has towards us at this time,  and

the Singapore Government can play a great part in

removing that fear and distrust.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  taxation policy of this Government has  been

calculated to tax the people of Singapore for the

benefit  of  foreign business. Since  June  1959,

this  Government has introduced 12 new taxes.  In

the  1961  Budget  these  12  new  taxes  in   my

estimation will yield approximately $45  million.

Most of these millions will be squeezed, cent  by

cent,  dollar by dollar, from the poor, from  the

wage earners, from the shopkeepers, from the

taxi-drivers   and  the  hawkers,  from  the   working

population, from the small private companies  run

by  local merchants. An estimated $100,000 out of

the  $45  million  is all the  contribution  this

Government has asked from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



big  European firms which control our economy and

make most of the profits. These European firms in

my  opinion make at least half of the profits  of

Singapore,  and  are  asked by  this  "Socialist"

Government to contribute less than 1 per cent  of

the $45 million; to be exact .002 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the facts. The 12 new taxes introduced

by  this so-called socialist Government and their

respective  revenue  in  1961  are  estimated  as

follows:



<pre>



                                              Million

                                                 $

            1  Tax on local made                8.0

               cigarettes



            2  Tax on petrol                    6.0



        On  these two taxes, when they were

        introduced in  September 1959, it was

        expected that they  would yield about

        $14 million. The revenue  in  1961

        could be less because of the fall in

        consumption due to increase in prices

        of the two commodities.



            3  Pay cuts of civil               12.0

               servants



            4  Tax on lotteries                 3.5



            5  Decrease in the rates of         4.0

               personal allowance on

               income tax and increase

               in the maximum rate of tax

               on personal income



            6  Business                         3.5

               registration tax



            7  Stamp duty on import and         0.5

               export declarations



            8  Increased assessment on          0.4

               rubber estates



            9  Increased rates on private       0.1

           12  Property tax                     1.0

              (estimated additional revenue

               from, increased assessment

               in rural areas) in my

               estimation is

                                               -----

                             Total             $45.5

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what are the incidences of

these new taxes? Who are the people affected? Are

these taxes just and equitable? Are they based on

the  principle of "ability to pay",  a  principle

recognised  and adopted even by openly  confessed

Right-wing  capitalist Governments?  And  we  ask

ourselves: is this a Government working  for  the

interests  of the people? Sir, what is  the  real

nature of these new taxes? I shall describe  them

briefly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, tax on local made cigarettes. This tax

was  introduced  on 17th September,  1959,  after

months  of disagreement between the Minister  for

Finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



and myself. This tax has two effects. It is a tax

on  the poor. The worker and the wage earner  are

those  who smoke local-made cigarettes. This  tax

also suppressed local cigarette manufacturers for

the  benefit  of  the  big American  and  British

cigarette  monopolies. A worker or a wage  earner

who smokes, say, 20 cigarettes a day will have to

pay  an  additional tax of $6  a  month.  I  have

correspondence between the Minister  for  Finance

and myself on this issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what is the impact and incidence of the

petrol  tax?  Out  of  an  estimated  $6  million

additional  revenue  a year from  petrol  tax,  I

estimated $2 million will come from taxi drivers,

pirate  taxis, lorry operators and fishermen;  $2

million from wage earners, teachers and salesmen;

$1½  million  from shopkeepers, and  less  than

$1½  million  from those who  can  afford  cars

worth  more than $12,000 each. The petrol tax  is

primarily a tax on taxi drivers, the white collar

workers and the small shopkeepers. This tax  will

be  an  intolerable burden on taxi  drivers.  The

plans  we  have finalised with the Taxi  Drivers'

Union  to  give coupons to the taxi  drivers  was

vetoed.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, at  the  end  of  the

sitting, I wish to put on record in this House  a

copy  of the plan for a Petrol Coupon Scheme  for

taxi drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we come to the lotteries tax. What is the

incidence  of  the  lotteries tax?  How  does  it

operate?  The  lotteries tax  is  a  tax  on  the

underprivileged  sections of the  population  who

hoped  to  change their fortunes, and  have  been

encouraged by this so-called socialist Government

to  do  so, especially the hawkers, taxi drivers,

wage  earners and all those in debt. Out of every

dollar "invested" in lotteries, 30 per cent  goes

to the Government as tax. 40 per cent goes to the

Singapore Turf Club and the horse owners, and  30

per cent goes back to the purchasers of lotteries

as  prizes. The lotteries tax introduced by  this

Government is to raise revenue from the poor  and

to benefit the European and Compradore controlled

Singapore  Turf  Club and the  millionaire  horse

owners,  unlike  the  Federation  Social  Welfare

lottery which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



is a tax on the poor for the benefit of the poor.

Ours  is  not so. The peculiar characteristic  of

the  lotteries  tax  is  that,  with  increasing

unemployment  and  bad  business  conditions,  an

increasing  number  of  people  who  hardly  earn

enough  to eat, the collection from the lotteries

tax  will  increase.  The  Minister  for  Finance

sounded  very  happy when he  said  this  in  his Budget Speech (col. 29):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As against an estimate of $4 million on taxes

on  totalisators and sweepstakes [in  1960],  the

actual  collections  for  the  first  ten  months

amounted  to  $4.7 million and, it is anticipated

that  the  original estimate will be exceeded  by

$1.2 million by the end of the year.'



<br><br>On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for Finance said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Stamp duty was estimated at $3.8 million but

there  is  likely  to  be  a  shortfall  of  $½

million.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a very great example of

business conditions and the state of the  economy

of our country. This decrease in collections from

stamp duty means that the volume of business  and

property transactions has decreased. More revenue

from   the  lotteries  tax  than  expected,  less

revenue from stamp duty than expected - nothing  is

a  better indication that times are bad. But, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  to  Mr Ah Q,  however,  this  is

"prosperity".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we come to the pay cuts. Ex-civil

servants hate civil servants. Ex-professional men

dislike professional men. Is it not true that the

original plan hatched by ex-civil servants to tax

former colleagues was even more severe? Not  many

days after the issue of the Hong Lim resolutions,

the   Prime  Minister  despatched  his  Political

Secretary, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, to Cairnhill where

civil servants were told that their pay cuts were

the  result  of that scapegoat, Ong Eng  Guan.  I

challenge the Minister for Finance, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  to  tell the truth about the pay  cuts  and

tell them what was his original plan. Was it  not

a  fact that were it not for the Member for  Hong

Lim,  much  more  pay would be cut,  particularly

those in the lower income groups?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Produce Cabinet documents-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Liar!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order! I think the Minister for

Finance is guilty of an unparliamentary word.  He

ought to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I withdraw it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for  Finance filed his original proposals  which,

after  some  weeks of "ding-dong", were  reduced.

Only  18 months in office, this Government, which

once the people of Singapore had returned 43  out

of  51  seats, has within such a short  space  of

time lost all popular support. The worker and the

farmer,  the  wage-earner and the intelligentsia,

the  shopkeeper and the hawker, have  lost  their

confidence.  Many of the 50-odd  P.A.P. branches

have  now closed down and most of them have  been

deserted.  For  the  benefit of  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar who does not know, what is going on

in his Branch, they are playing cards most of the

time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This Assembly Chamber is not

aware of a Member for Tanjong Pagar. If the  hon.

Member means the Prime Minister, he ought to  say

"the Prime Minister".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

wish  to repeat saying "the Tanjong Pagar Branch"

twice;  therefore, 71 mentioned "the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar".  I withdraw and substitute  "the

Prime Minister".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is now turning to the civil

servants for a last-ditch support, by promise  of

partial  restoration  of  the  pay  cuts,  to  be

carried   through   protracted  negotiations.   I

remember   in  1959  the  Minister  for   Finance

transferred  Mr  Rajendra,  who  works  in   the

Telecommunications Department, from  Hill  Street

to  Jurong  without  my  knowledge,  when  I  was

Minister  in  charge  of  the  Telecommunications

Department and was responsible for any  breakdown

in  the  service. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  never  did

that to all those members of the Staff Unions  in

City Council times.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present political strategy of the Government

is  this.  Hang a carrot in front  of  the  civil

servants,  but let them bite it some time  later,

depending  on  the period of negotiations,  which

will  be  decided by the interplay  of  political

forces.   The   Government   will   engage   more

expatriates; it is considered local engineers and

architects cannot do the job. The Government will

seek  more funds from the United Kingdom and  the

United  States - build and build, spend and  spend,

no  matter  whether  such  construction  or  such

expenditure is to the interests of the people  or

not,  for it can be left to posterity to pay  the

foreign  debts.  By  1962, anti-colonial  slogans

would   be   slowly   but  surely   reintroduced.

Eventually  it  hopes to spring a  snap  election

before  1964,  perhaps in 1963 if conditions  are

favourable.  This is considered by the  political

strategists  to  be the only chance  left  to  be

returned  a  second time, and the civil  servants

would  be given partial restoration of their  pay

cuts  to  make them play a more decisive role  to

save them. Mr Speaker, Sir, the legislation  for

snap elections was passed last year. The Press is

now  rigidly  controlled. Special articles  under

pseudonyms   supplied  by  Government   regularly

appear  in the Chinese papers whenever there  are

hot  political issues. The radio is fast becoming

a  Party  radio; television will  also  become  a

Party television. Expensive pamphlets printed  on

gloss  paper from public funds with high-sounding

titles   like   "The  Socialist  Solution",   "An

Analysis   of   Current   Political   Forces   in

Singapore", and "Towards Socialism",  Vol.  1,  a

Ministry of Culture Publication; 30,000 to 40,000

copies  had  been scattered and nobody  wants  to

read  them.  It begins with the Prime  Minister's

speech  made  in  this Assembly. These  pamphlets

with  high-sounding titles but containing nothing

concerning  socialism, more will be  printed  and

thrown around. And despite this rigid control  of

the  Press,  and  the threats of  laws  like  the

Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, in

case some people who do not toe the Lee Kuan  Yew

line still start distributing pamphlets like  the

Member for Hong Lim, the Member for Aljunied  and

the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



Punggol  once  used  to do, there  would  be  the

latest  amendment to the Undesirable Publications

Ordinance on the 17th November, 1960, which would

enable  the  Government  to  raid  premises   and

impound  such pamphlets. I knew on that day.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  but  would all these  suppressive

measures  work? Would all these gadgets ensure  a

return  to  power in 1964? The former  Government

also  tried  many  gadgets. For instance,  George

Thomson  went to New Zealand to study  compulsory

voting.  But  it did not succeed. Any  government

which   works  sincerely  and  honestly   without

resorting to electioneering and political gadgets

will be returned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the taxes I have described

just   now,  the  cigarettes  tax,  petrol   tax,

lotteries  tax  and  the  pay  cuts  which   were

introduced in 1959 and 1960, would continue to be

collected in 1961. We now come to the other eight

new taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the income tax. Among the eight

new taxes, the decrease in the rates for personal

allowances  is the most important. $4 million  is

expected  from this new tax. This is a tax  aimed

mainly  at  the lower income groups, particularly

the  wage-earners and the shopkeepers. Due to the

reduction  of  personal  allowances,  the  middle

class will also be slightly affected by having to

pay  higher  rates. The increase of  the  maximum

rate  to 55 per cent on incomes above $100,000  a

year is a propaganda eye-wash, to give people  an

impression  that  the  1961  change  in  the  tax

structure is directed not only towards the  lower

income  groups. This 5 per cent increase  on  the

over   $100,000  income  group  attracts   little

revenue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member for Hong Lim

having  difficulty in reading the speech  because

of the lighting?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That matter has been raised as a

point  of information. I think the Prime Minister

must  know that no Member is supposed to  read  a

speech in this House. The Prime Minister has  not

risen on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have spent

nearly a week computing these figures, and I have

no   George  Thomson  drawing  public  pay  doing

computation work and writing speeches for me,  as

he  is  doing for the Prime Minister. This 5  per

cent  increase  on those with more than  $100,000

attracts  little  revenue.  There  are  only  118

people  in this income group as contained in  the

Income Tax 1958 Annual Report. The Federation  is

again as usual being used as a convenient excuse.

For  several  years there have  been  differences

between our respective tax laws, the tax base and

the  tax rates in the two territories. Very  soon

there are to be two different currencies, whether

we  like it or not. People are tired and  do  not

believe  in the Federation scapegoat for all  the

acts  of  commission and omission  done  by  this

Government. The Federation had years ago repealed

the  Business  Registration Tax due  to  protests

from  the  shopkeepers. Why should Singapore  now

introduce  this tax? Why does Singapore  want  to

introduce a tax rejected by the Federation? It is

common knowledge that the shopkeepers tax,  which

is  the  real  word for the Business Registration

Tax,  was  the  main form of tax used  mainly  by

colonial  countries  like  Sarawak  and  in   the

Federation   before  Merdeka   to   benefit   the

interests of the big foreign companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by reducing the personal

allowances the Government also hopes to  draw  an

estimated 20,000 people into the Income Tax  net.

It  expects to collect $750,000 from these 20,000

new    taxpayers,   mostly   wage-earners.    The

Government  estimates  it  will  collect  on   an

average of about $36 from each new taxpayer.  Did

the  Minister  for  Finance  know  the  cost   of

collection for each taxpayer?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

just  now  was trying to hint that I do not  know

how  to calculate the tax. I have worked out  the

cost  of  collection  from the  1958  Income  Tax

Report. It works out at about $70 per collection.

$70. Please take it down.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Hong Lim

does  not  obey the directions of the  Chair  and

keep order himself, the Speaker, or whoever is in

the   Chair,  has  means  of  stopping  him  from

speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, assume that

it  takes  less time to assess these wage-earners

who, after all, have nothing much to declare, and

compute, let us say, not $70 per collection,  but

say $50. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a Minister for

Finance  who will spend $50 to collect  $30  each

from 20,000 wage-earners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also computed, Sir, - it is a pity the

Government has this year given us so little time.

Last  year  they gave the S.P.A. two weeks.  This

time  they  have given us only seven clear  days,

otherwise-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member for

Hong Lim knows the Standing Orders, which are the

Standing  Orders  made  by  this  Assembly.   The

Standing Orders only allow for seven clear  days.

Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the end

of  the sitting I will table before this House  a

table  showing  the percentage  increase  of  tax

among  the  various income groups*. If one  earns

$100,000  a year, the increase is 1½ per  cent.

These are the big-shots, (a hundred of them)  and

the  increase  is negligible. But  if  one  earns

$1,000 a month, the increase is 25 per cent; $750

a  month, it is 39 per cent; $500 a month, it  is

110  per cent; $458 a month, it is 200 per  cent;

$425 a month, it is 1,000 per cent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come to the Business

Registration  Tax. The Business Registration  Tax

is  actually the shopkeepers' tax. It is proposed

to  raise $2½ million in 1961 from this tax. If

all  shops  and  businesses are taxed  equitably,

then there is nothing so objectionable about  the

Business  Registration Tax. But this is  not  the

case.  Public limited companies, owned mostly  by

European enterprises possessing on the average  a

capital of $20 to $30 million each and earning on

the  average  millions of dollars  of  profits  a

year,  are  only asked to pay an  annual  tax  of

$1,000.  For instance, the Hongkong and  Shanghai

Bank,  with a capital of $120 million and earning

a  profit  of  $14 million a year,  pays  $1,000.

Private   companies,  owned   mostly   by   local

businessmen,  some  of  which  have  only  a  few

thousand  dollars capital, pay $750 a  year.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I do understand that not  all  the

profits  of  foreign  companies  are  earned   in

Singapore. But neither are the private companies.

Shopkeepers are asked to pay $50 or $100 for sole

ownership and partnership respectively. The  shop

could be a small coffeeshop.

understand  that you have ruled  before  that  no

of  thing could be allowed by the Speaker in this

House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think hon. Members have

perhaps  noticed that the Chair is a bit  lenient

in  these  matters, especially if there are  very

important  pronouncements to be made by Ministers

as  well  as  by Opposition Members. But  I  have

noticed that possibly the Member for Hong Lim has

been referring to his notes a bit too frequently.

Perhaps he will endeavour not to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am doing

nothing more than just debating the Minister  for

Finance's  Budget speech which was  also  printed

and read by him word for word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, in debates on economics -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

hon.  Member for Hong Lim is debating the Chair's

ruling. The Chair's ruling is very simple, that a

Member   should  not  refer  to  his  notes   too

frequently  unless, of course, there are  volumes

of  figures that he wishes to quote from. Then he

can  read those volumes of figures. Let us  leave

it at that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Shopkeepers are asked to pay

$50  or $100 for sole ownerships and partnerships

respectively.  The shop could be a  small  coffee

shop  with a few hundred dollars capital. In this

manner,  the  Business  Registration  Tax  is  an

unjust tax, throwing a heavy burden on the  small

and medium sized shopkeepers. We propose that the

$2  million expected from the business tax should

not  be  borne  mainly  by the  shopkeepers,  but

should  be  spread out proportionately among  all

businesses,  big  or  small, European  or  local,

according  to  capital. The Government  must  not

discriminate against small shopkeepers and  small

private  companies in favour of the big  European

firms.  Those shops and private companies with  a

capital of under $10,000 or so should be exempted

from  this tax. Otherwise small shops and private

companies with less than $10,000 capital might be

compelled to close down. The shopkeepers' tax  is

one form of tax favoured by colonial economists.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Hong Lim says

that  he  fears  that there may be  an  extensive

closing down of shops as a result of this tax. Is

he aware of the rates of the tax? Does he really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



expect  us  to believe that a tax of $4  a  month

will result in the closing down of businesses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister's Income Tax Department will supply  him

with  the  number of private companies and  small

shops  which are likely to close down because  of

this Business Registration Tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot understand this

onslaught  on  the  shopkeepers,  as   I   cannot

understand the exploitation of the poor  by  this

self-proclaimed  socialist  Government   by   the

introduction  of  the  cigarettes,   petrol   and

lotteries taxes. Shopkeepers are not capitalists.

The  Minister for Finance said in his  speech  at

column 44:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The reason for introducing this form of

taxation  is apparent. A large majority of  small

shopkeepers do not contribute whatsoever  to  the

Inland Revenue.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these small shopkeepers were

not paying income tax because many of them do not

earn one-tenth of the income of our Parliamentary

Secretaries.  That  is, they  do  not  even  make

$2,000  a  year. The shopkeepers are, in general,

people   who  have  started  from  the   humblest

origins,  through self denial and hard work,  and

sometimes  with the help of friends and relatives

they  manage  to open a shop either alone  or  in

partnership.  They  are  now  singled   out   for

criticism  by the Minister for Finance for  their

abstemious habits. Were it not for the fact  that

generations  of them had sweated and  toiled  and

exercised  self-denial  and  were  of  abstemious

habits,  would there have been built  the  public

institutions  and the schools and  the  Singapore

that we see today?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other new taxes, the tax on private

lotteries yields a meagre $100,000. Why look into

the  haystack for such a small needle? A few free

overseas  trips would cost that amount. The  only

conclusion  I  can  draw is  that  certain  small

organisations,  which occasionally  sell  private

lotteries  for  charities or to  boost  up  their

funds, are hurting the sales of the lotteries  of

the  Singapore  Turf Club. Lumped  together  with

this tax on private lotteries is the tax on

jackpots. And, Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



imagine  how much tax is to be raised from

jackpots.  $50,000! Just sufficient to  beautify  Sri

Temasek  with marble. The purpose of this jackpot

tax  is  to conceal the motive behind the private

lotteries  tax  by  the  familiar  technique   of

lumping together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new tax proposal is to raise the

assessment of properties in the rural areas.  Why

not  assess those beautiful Shell properties  and

bungalows  in Pulau Bukom which should  yield  at

least  a million dollars a year? The poor  Malays

in the Southern Islands have to pay assessment on

their  shabby  attap huts. The Shell  Company  in

Pulau  Bukom do not have to observe building  and

planning by-laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Bukit Merah)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Yes. The Member still seems to be

reading from his text.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have noticed that and I have

already drawn the attention of the Member to  the

fact  that  he  is referring to  his  notes  very

frequently.  In  spite of that, he  seems  to  be

referring a little more to his notes. Perhaps  he

could refrain from referring so frequently to his

notes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. The

Shell  properties in Pulau Bukom are worth  about

$125  million. They do not pay even one  cent  of

assessment.  Does the Prime Minister  know  this,

despite  the fact that this matter is  under  his

charge?   That   is   the  reason   why   certain

departments  have had to be taken over  from  his

former  Minister for National Development. Again,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, why not open negotiations with

the  British on assessment of houses on  military

properties? This will probably yield millions  of

dollars annually. After all, the British Military

and   the  Shell  Company  are  benefiting   from

services provided by the City Council in the form

of  health measures, roads, public utilities  and

so  on. We are only asking them to pay their fair

share, and nothing more. The proposed increase in

assessment on rural properties will affect mainly

the farmers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



and the rural shopkeepers. There have been little

significant  improvements  in  the  rural  areas.

Rural  poverty,  farmers  heavily  in  debt,  and

squalid  living conditions. The farmers  are  now

suffering,  due  to the reduction  of  prices  of

pigs,  eggs, chickens and vegetables. The general

poverty  of  the  farmers has also  affected  the

rural  shopkeepers. The least the Government  can

do  is  to  leave them alone. Has the  Government

really  the  heart to increase their  taxes?  The

Minister for Finance described the jackpot  as  a

one-armed bandit. It is not as oppressive as  the

two-armed  bandit,  who searches  anxiously  with

hungry looking eyes for the poor as his prey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it is expected to raise $500,000 from

imposing  a  stamp  duty  on  import  and  export

declarations.  I  agree  with  the  Minister  for

Finance that this will not impose a burden on the

importers and exporters. However, is it necessary

in the interests of Singapore's trade? The charge

is  small but it has a nuisance value. This stamp

duty  will  hinder the smooth and quick  flow  of

trade.  There will be more queues. The Department

has to stamp 3,000 forms each day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is it necessary to introduce

all  these taxes to raise $45 million? I am  sure

there are many more soak-the-poor gimmicks in the

Minister  for  Finance's bag. In my opinion,  all

these are not necessary. The Government can prune

down  its  wasteful and extravagant  expenditure,

and  the  Ministers  themselves  should  set   an

example like leaders in other countries do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Finance remembers what

he  said  on  22nd March. 1959. This  is  a  very

useful book at times [Indicating]. His speech  is

contained  in  page 26 of Part I of the  P.A.P.'s

"The Tasks Ahead".



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You still read that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Why not? When it is to find

out  the consistencies or the inconsistencies  of

the  present  Ministers. On page 26 is  a  speech

delivered by Dr Goh Keng Swee at a mass rally at

Dhoby Ghaut on 22nd March, 1959. He said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By ruthless pruning of Government expenditure,

we may be able to add $20 million annually to the

Development Board.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the excuse now is to wait for the

Commission  of Inquiry on Government  expenditure

to make its recommendations, and our Minister for

Finance will wait till 1965. A more simple method

to  prove  one's  consistency is  by  adding  $20

million   or   $25  million  to  the  Expenditure

Estimates,  and in the following  year  prune  it

down by the same amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us assume for one moment

that  the  Minister for Finance has no experience

in  Government affairs, that it is impossible  to

prune Government expenditure by $20 million, that

it is even necessary to increase expenditure, and

that $45 million should be raised from taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In framing a tax policy, considerations of

yield,   justice,   administrative   costs,   and

economic  effects must be taken into account.  No

tax law can be enforced for any reasonable length

of  time  if  it  is against the  wishes  of  the

people. The repeal of the shopkeepers' tax in the

Federation  is a clear example. The  people  must

believe  that the tax is just and that  they  are

asked  to  contribute  on a  just  basis  to  the

national effort, and the running of the State. It

is  possible to convince the people for  a  short

period   of  time  that  the  burden   from   the

imposition  of new taxes is equitable.  But  this

propaganda  cannot last for any length  of  time.

When   the   petrol   tax  was  introduced,   the

propaganda line was that car owners are

well-to-do,  so  they pay petrol tax. When the cigarettes

tax  was introduced, it was like this: cigarettes

are  a luxury; beer drinking is not. That is  why

there  is no tax on beer. The propaganda  on  the

lotteries tax was this: this tax is to deal  with

chap-ji-kee and four digits. However, the  people

are   waking  up,  when  they  find  that   their

standards of living are going down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the basic taxation policy

adopted  even  in  capitalist  economies  is  the

principle  of ability to pay. According  to  this

principle, those who have the greatest wealth  or

income  pay  most  of the tax regardless  of  any

benefits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



they  derive.  The ability-to-pay-principle  also

helps to equalise the distribution of income  and

wealth, and leads to progressive taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the new measures introduced by this

Government  are not progressive taxes,  that  is,

taxes calculated to tax the wealthy to help-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must

realise  that if he is reading a speech  he  must

read  a  little slowly, because the  interpreters

are finding a little difficulty in following him.

I have indicated that the Member may refer to his

notes, but he seems to be doing more than that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

three  types  of taxes - progressive, proportional,

or  regressive. The petrol tax is an  example  of

proportional  taxation. The taxi-driver  and  the

salesman  pay  the same tax as  the  owner  of  a

Mercedez  Benz. Most of the taxes  introduced  by

this Government are regressive taxation, that is,

the  poor  and  the  wage-earners  are  asked  to

contribute more taxes than the rich.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the marked characteristics of this

Government's taxation policy is not  that  it  is

resorting    to    regressive    taxation.    The

distinguishing feature in the taxation policy  of

this  Government is that it is dovetailed to suit

the  interests of big European concerns.  Out  of

the 12 new taxes the only contribution from these

big European concerns is $1,000. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a known fact that

British capital controls our economy. The mode of

organisation used is the public limited liability

company. May I refresh the memory of the Minister

for  Finance,  quoting from no less an  authority

than  the  Manager  of  the Industrial  Promotion

Board.  Mr J. J. Puthucheary, who wrote  a  book

called  "Ownership  and Control  in  the  Malayan

Economy"?  These quotations will serve  to  bring

home the point that our economy is dominated  and

controlled  by  European capital  through  public

limited companies. It will also show that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



wrong to tax the shopkeepers in favour of British

capital. In the preface on page xiv is written:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is a popular view, widely held, that "the Chinese" control commerce. This is false. The estimates in the study show that

European-owned  firms  controlled 65-75 per cent  of  the

export  trade in 1953 and 60-70 per cent of  the

import trade in 1955. European-owned firms  held

about 75 per cent of the import agencies against

some 10 per cent held by Chinese firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popular misconception that commerce is

controlled  by  the  Chinese  is  due   to   the

ubiquitous  activity of the  Chinese  middleman.

Certainly a very large number of Chinese traders

are  engaged in buying and selling.  But  it  is

quite  wrong to think that in their  buying  and

selling these traders in any way control  trade.

In   fact,  the  misconception  is  an  "optical

illusion"  due  to  the  very  large  number  of

traders. The control of commerce is in  fact  in

the  hands  of  the exporter-importer,  and  the

import  and  the export firms are  very  largely

European.'.



<br><br>And on page xix of the Preface:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We can, however, say with confidence that the

commonly  held  view that Chinese  dominate  the

economy is false. As yet, the Chinese are mainly

middle-men and compradores of European  capital.

Some   have  become  partners  and  a  few   are

independent. The capital that dominates Malaya's

economy is European.'



<br><br>And on page xvi of the Preface:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The most important conclusion, I think, of

this  study is that much of Malaya's economy  is

controlled  by large-scale units. Of these,  the

agency  houses and the mining agencies  are  the

most  important.  The  belief  that  small-scale

producers  and traders dominate the  economy  is

caused  by  an incomplete understanding  of  the

position of Chinese-owned capital. Another cause

of   this   mistaken  belief  is  the  lack   of

understanding of the extent of the control  that

agency   houses,  mining  agencies  and   import

agencies have over the economy of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corollary of this is the importance of

public limited companies. People who assume that

Chinese  capitalists control the economy  assume

too  that public limited companies play  a  part

subsidiary  to that played by private  companies

and  family  or clan organisations.  The  second

assumption is false because the first is false.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main finding of this study is the

over-whelming evidence that European-owned firms  are

predominant in almost all industries. Almost all

European-owned   firms   are   public    limited

companies  or  subsidiaries  of  public  limited

companies. Some of the large Chinese-owned firms

are  also  public limited companies.  I  do  not

think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



there  can  be any doubt that the most important

type  of  business organisation - though not  the

most common - is the public limited company.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me give an idea of what

this   $1,000  tax  means  to  a  public  limited

company. More than 95 per cent of public  limited

companies  are  owned  by European  capital.  The

$1,000  tax is a mere facade. In Lyall and  Evatt

"Handbook  of  Malayan Stocks and Shares",  there

are  listed 37 public limited companies known  in

Stock  Exchange language as Industrials.  I  have

ignored  the  tin  and rubber companies  for  two

reasons:   firstly,  the  operations   of   these

companies   are  mostly  carried   out   in   the

Federation  and, secondly, the private  companies

mostly  owned by local capital are more  akin  in

their     activities    to    these     so-called

"Industrials". Mr Speaker, Sir, these 37  public

limited  companies classified in  Stock  Exchange

language as Industrials have a capital of  $6,064

million  and  in one year make a  profit  of  $74

million.  I  lay upon the table a list*  of  them showing  their capital and profits computed  from

the handbook.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the $45 million additional revenue raised

by   this   self-proclaimed  Left-wing  socialist

Government,  these  37 public  limited  companies

will pay only $37,000 in other words, $37,000 out

of $45 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me dwell for a few minutes on the so-called company tax in this country. The

companies in Singapore do not pay company tax the

way  they  do in the United States, Australia  or

India.  This is a colonial device to protect  the

profits  of the big European firms. The companies

in  Singapore do not actually pay company tax the

way we know it. The present so-called company tax

is  a  misnomer.  If  I  could  explain  in

non-technical language, the 40 per cent tax paid by a

company on its profits is being paid back to  the

shareholders  when  the company  distributes  its

profits  in the form of dividends. The Government

collects 40 per cent from the company and pays it

back to the shareholders. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



theory,  the Government holds the money collected

from  the  companies as a security and not  as  a

tax.  In other countries even governed by

Right-wing  capitalists, like the United States,  there

is  a  company tax, sometimes as high as  50  per

cent  or  60 per cent, and this tax is  not  paid

back  to  the  shareholders when the profits  are

distributed in the form of dividends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the big European firms make millions of dollars annually and do not

contribute to the running of the State because of

the nature of our company tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, 40 per cent of the profits of the

companies are collected by the Government in  the

form of the so-called company tax. When a company

distributes  its  profits, the  shareholders  are

paid back this 40 per cent by the Government. Say

a  shareholder,  Mr  X, has  some  shares  in  a

company.  He  gets a cheque of $6,000  from  this

company  this year. When he declares this  income

of  $6,000 to the Government, what the Government

does  is to add up his $6,000 to the $4,000, that

is,  40 per cent of $10,000 and assess him  on  a

gross income of $10,000. If he is a married  man,

Mr  X  will  pay $350 tax and the Tax Department

will send him a cheque of $3,650. In other words,

Mr X in that particular year will receive $6,000

from  the company and $3,650 from the Government,

making  a  total of $9,650. In other  words,  the

company pays no tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is this not a Government of

the big business?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a Government of the

big  business,  a Government under  the  will  of

European capital. Have we got to search elsewhere

for  more  convincing  proof?  The  Meadows,  the

Blades  and  the Thomsons control  our  political

destinies. Mr Thomson's room was next to that of

the  Minister  for  Culture and  he  was  writing

embarks  on these little details, which I  cannot

relate  to  the general principles of  Government

policy  which he is supposed to touch on in  this

of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from now

onwards,  I  will not give way to  interjections.

Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European capital controls our economic

destinies. Why is the Minister for Finance now so

frightened of European capital?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Minister for Finance of what he

said  at a P.A.P. mass rally on 22nd March, 1959,

and which is reproduced also in page 25 of Part I

of the P.A.P. "The Tasks Ahead":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Without exception all political parties other

than  the P.A.P. have repeatedly reminded  people

in   Singapore  the  necessity  of  depending  on

foreign   capital  to  finance   our   industrial

development  programme. Without exception,  these

parties  placed  their hope for  our  ability  to

attract foreign capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. profoundly disagrees that the

survival of Singapore depends on foreign  capital

and  foreign capitalists. We say that  there  are

more  than  adequate capital resources  initially

available locally. Indeed, the position  is  that

large sums of local capital are being invested in

foreign    countries,   often   in   unprofitable

investments.   The  total  amount  of   Singapore

capital  invested by banks, insurance  companies,

central  government,  local authorities  and  the

public boards is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



known  with  certainty. It  is  probably  in  the

region  of $800,000,000. It is absolute  nonsense

to  say  that our survival depends on  foreigners

when  so  much of our own capital is invested  in

foreign countries.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, that was before the elections.

This  Government has now completely departed from

the  avowed  aims and policies of the P.A.P.  The

taxation  policy of this Government  in  general,

and  the  1961 Budget in particular,  is  another

concrete proof that what this Government seeks to

uphold  are the interests of big European capital

and colonial interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for  Finance,  whose  real  income  has

increased more than ten times since May 1959, the

people are worse off now than before.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think it is about time I

put  a stop to all these personalities which seem

to be completely irrelevant. The hon. Member must

keep away from all personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me

describe here the problems and the sufferings  of

our people during the past 18 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi drivers. Of all the classes in society, the

taxi  drivers  are  the worst  hit.  First,  they

suffer  a cigarette tax. If a taxi driver  smokes

20  cigarettes a day, he has to pay about $6  tax

per  month. We then come to the petrol tax  which

makes  him incur an additional $30 per month.  On

the other hand, the taxi fare, for instance, from

Bras  Basah Road to Upper Serangoon Circus before

the  elections  was 50 cents each passenger,  but

now it is 30 cents. In other words, very few taxi

drivers  are  charging  fares  according  to  the

meter.  And if the taxi driver is susceptible  to

the  propaganda of this Government and  tries  to

change  his  fortunes, then he will be encouraged

to  pay  lottery  tax, taking  into  account  the

increasing   number  of  summonses  and   heavier

penalties. Mr Speaker. Sir, the taxi  driver  is

actually between the devil and the deep  sea.  He

is  considered lucky if he can at present earn $4

a day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to workers and shop assistants.

Their   greatest  problem  is  the   problem   of

retrenchment.   If  he  is  unfortunate   to   be

unemployed,  he  would be  lucky  to  get  a  few

dollars from the Social Welfare at reduced  rates

of  relief. The 1961 Budget estimates to get  $27

million from the sale of lottery tickets. Out  of

$27 million, $8 million will go to Government  as

tax,  $11  million will go to the Singapore  Turf

Club  and the millionaire horse owners as profits

and  expenses,  and $8 million will  go  back  to

these poor people in the form of prizes. In other

words, as a class, the workers and all other poor

people who are estimated to buy more than 90  per

cent  of  the  lotteries will be made  poorer  in

1961, by an estimated total of $19 million.  This

$19  million on the red is a "gift" from this

so-called socialist Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not all. A worker smoking 20 local brand

cigarettes  daily  will be  made  poorer  by  the

Government by $6 per month. There have  been  few

cases of wage increases in the past 18 months. In

1958,  the  City Council worker got an  automatic

increase  of  40  cents  a  day.  And  now   with

integration  in the air, I am wondering  what  is

the  Government going to do. Would the Government

reduce  the wages of the City Council workers  by

40  cents  or  would the Government increase  the

wages of the Government workers by -



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on a point of order. Are we discussing  the

Government's   financial   policy   or   are   we

discussing  the  labour  problem  in   the   City

Council?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think what the hon. Member for

Hong  Lim is trying to get at is the Government's

general policy, which includes integration of the

City  Council. I have not as yet grasped what  he

is  aiming at, but, so far as I can see, he seems

to be in order. He is discussing general policies

with reference to details in passing. Mr Ong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come

to  the  hawkers. The 1957 census  of  population

shows   that   there  are  37,180   hawkers   and

stallholders.  Due  to the increasing  volume  of

unemployment - the Minister for Labour and Law  has

given  the  figures  of 11,186  unemployed  being

registered on 1st November, 1958, i.e. two  years

ago, and 52,963 being registered on 1st November,

1960, i.e. today - the number of hawkers must  also

have   increased  considerably  since  the   1957

census,  which was 37,180 hawkers. More  hawkers,

more  taxes  on  the poor and  the  wage  earners

imposed  by  the  Government would  mean  smaller

incomes for the hawkers. Smaller incomes, heavier

penalties,  and further economic exploitation  by

the Government in the form of these soak-the-poor

taxes  are driving many of the hawkers  to

semi-starvation.  Would the Government understand  the

problems and the sufferings of the hawkers? I  do

not   think   they  do.  The  recent  unfortunate

incident in St. Michael's Market could have  been

avoided.  There was no necessity to send  a  riot

squad  van to chop away the stalls and break  the

crockery of the hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we come to the farmers. The 1957 census

gave  the  number of fanners as 24,289.  This  is

another badly hit section of the population.  The

farmer  is  now getting less for his produce  but

has to pay more taxes. Many of the farmers are in

debt,   which   in   turn   affects   the   rural

shopkeepers, which in turn affects the  retailers

in  the towns supplying goods to the rural  shops

and so on. The farmers will be badly exploited by

the present proposal to increase assessment rates

in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we now come to the general

wage  earner.  In  my analysis,  the  classes  of

people  most  hit are the taxi drivers,  hawkers,

white  collar workers and shopkeepers.  The  wage

earner  or the teacher has to pay several dollars

a  month more for his smokes, $6 to $10 more  for

petrol, and a few dollars for lotteries. Is  that

all,  Mr Speaker, Sir? No, Sir, he is now  asked

to  pay  more income tax. Among the wage earners,

the  teachers  suffer the most - more  hours,  less

pay.  If  everybody tightens  his  belt  for  the

national effort, then well and good. But is  that

the situation? By no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



means.  The  teacher  did  not  get  a  10  times

increase  in  income. He is in a most unfortunate

position - no occupational mobility except  perhaps

running  away to the Federation - he  has  to  work

more  hours, get less pay, pay more taxes (petrol

tax, cigarettes tax and now income tax).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shopkeepers. Among the business community,

the  small shopkeepers are the hardest  hit.  The

increasing  number  of  hawkers  due  to  soaring

unemployment  share some of their  business.  But

what  else can the hawkers do? Contrary  to  what

the  Minister for Finance knows, many shopkeepers

are affected by the cigarettes tax - for themselves

and their customers - and sometimes even the petrol

tax  if  they have a second-hand car used in  the

shop,  and  other Government licences  and  fees.

Under  the recent amendment to the tax laws,  the

shopkeeper  has  to engage extra hands  to  write

receipts,  or  buy a cash register  costing  more

than  $1,000.  And when this law  is  introduced,

there is only one type of cash register and  that

is  monopolised  by  an American  firm.  The  new

Business  Registration Tax is aimed at collecting

$2  million  from  about  40,000  shopkeepers  in

Singapore. This is unjust. The change  in  income

tax   will  also  affect  the  shopkeepers.   The

cumulative effect of these taxes is that many  of

them will join the ranks of the unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a Government which

believes  in  taxing  the  people  of  Singapore,

mainly  the  poor, the workers, the wage  earners

and  the shopkeepers, for the benefit of the  big

European   companies.  This  is  not  an   honest

nationalist  Government.  It  is  a  pro-colonial

Government.  It  is  a  Government  for  the  big

businesses.   Dr   Frederick  Benham,   foremost

authority on the economics of colonies,  and  the

former  Economic Adviser to the ex-Chief Minister

could not have done better for England, and would

be  ashamed of himself if he were here today. The

taxation  and  economic policies of our  Minister

for  Finance  who succeeded to the  post  of  Dr

Benham was in the best tradition of Dr Frederick

Benham.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has also

forgotten  what  he had said. In column  1015  of

Vol. I of the Hansard, dated 21st November, 1955,

the Prime Minister said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, a Socialist Government shows

itself  in  its  taxation and its expenditure.  A

democratic  Socialist  Party  seeks   through   a

parliamentary democracy, to introduce taxation in

order  that money could be taken from  those  who

have  and  to introduce social services in  order

that money or benefits can be given to those  who

have not.'



<br><br>However, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government is not

a Socialist Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hansard (12th December, 1958, col. 1217) the

Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are surprised that the Hon. the Financial

Secretary  [i.e. under  the  former  Government]

should  have  had the audacity  to  say  in  this

Assembly  that  they  can  quite  safely  put  up

company  tax to 40 per cent. He was the same  man

who  told  us  last year that there should  be  a

safety  margin of at least ten, if not more,  per

cent.  We  were the first to advocate  that  they

should tax companies up to the hilt, according to

British  standards, because most of them  in  any

case  are  registered in Britain or the investors

are from Britain. They can easily go up to 9s, in

the  pound  [i.e. nearly 50  per  cent]  without

affecting anybody's pocket other than that of the

British Treasury.'.



<br><br>However, the best description of this 1961 Budget

is the one given by the Minister for Health in  a

debate   on   the  Labour  Front's  1957   Budget

[Hansard, Vol. 2 col. 676, 19th November,  1956].

At  that  sitting of the Assembly the

Secretary-General  of  the  P.A.P. was  absent,  and   the

Minister for Health was speaking on behalf of the

P.A.P. Mr Speaker, Sir, if, in the process of my

quoting this speech, I could substitute the words

"so-called P.A.P." for the words "Labour  Front",

and  the  word  "S.P.A." for the  words  "Liberal

Socialist",   it  would  make  very   interesting

reading:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears to me that the

Labour Front Coalition Government is slowly being

absorbed  by  the  colonialism they  set  out  to

conquer  about  a  year  and  a  half  ago.   The

Government  is ostensibly a Socialist Government.

We  heard a great deal of Socialism during  those

happy  days  when  the  gentlemen  opposite  were

wooing  the voters but that was a long time  ago,

Sir.  Since  then,  they have  been  successfully

brainwashed by their colonial backseat drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, Sir, is proof that the Labour Front

has  been purged of all Socialist deviations. Not

only  is  that  Budget purged of every  tinge  of

Socialism  but  it  is utterly shameless  in  its

concern   for   great   business   and   colonial

interests. With the Labour Front Government as  a

front, the colonial backseat drivers had tried to

soak the poor while leaving the rich untouched. I

said "tried", Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



because  since the announcements of  the  Budget,

there has been some panicky backtracking. It  may

be  because the Labour Front Coalition Government

was   particularly  impressed  by   the   Liberal

Socialists.  Even  the Liberal  Socialists,  Sir,

felt  that  the Budget was an attempt to  balance

the  budget  at the expense of the  lower  income

workers.  Surely the Government could  have  told

the  backseat  drivers to produce a Budget  which

looked  like  a Socialist Budget... Ask  yourself.

The  fact that the blunder over the lower  income

groups  has  been put right does  not  make  this

Budget any better. In fact, the protests over the

injustice  done to the low wage earner have  only

drawn attention to the fact that this is still  a

Budget  designed to aid and comfort big  business

and  colonial interests. This is certainly not  a

Budget  expected of a Party which  claims  to  be

Socialist, Nationalist or champion of the Welfare

State.  The only kind of welfare that this Budget

will  further  is  capitalist  welfare  and,   in

particular, the foreign capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget was designed to meet a specific

problem  and  that  was the $37  million  deficit

expected in 1957. This deficit was to be  met  by

the  increase in income tax by lowering the basic

personal allowance which would have hit hard  the

lower  income  group but the higher income  group

was  let off very lightly, indeed so lightly that

even   the  Liberal-Socialists  felt  happy   and

jubilant enough to take up the cudgels on  behalf

of   the   poor  wage  earner.  For  a  Socialist

Government,  Sir  - and I hope I  am  not  unduly

embarrassing the Government by assuming  that  it

still  believes  in its election pledges - taxation

is  one way of bringing about greater equality of

income  and  Malaya is a country where inequality

of   income  prevails.  This  was  the  necessary

outcome of a colonial economy. There has been  no

proper  survey of distribution of  income  but  a

survey of urban income-'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is it necessary to raise this

additional $45 million in 1961? In my opinion, it

is   not   necessary.  We  can  prune  down   all

extravagant expenditure. There is no intention to

complete  all  the  Development  Estimates.   The

Development Estimates are prepared in a haphazard

manner with hardly any plans. I remember that  in

January  1960  I  instructed  the  Public   Works

Department  to obtain details of plans  from  the

respective  Ministries, particularly  the  Health

and  Education Ministries, to submit their  plans

in   order   to   fulfil  the  1960   Development

Estimates.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I was  shocked  to

learn  that there were hardly any plans.  On  1st

February,  1960, the Public Works Department  was

taken  over  by the Prime Minister. He  formed  a

Public Works Standing Committee to run the Public

Works  Department and to be responsible  for  all

development  projects. The Ministry  of  National

Development  was  refused even  the  minutes  and

agenda of the meetings. The Public Works Standing

Committee  was  made responsible to  the  Cabinet

Budget  Sub-Committee,  its  Chairman  being  the

Prime   Minister,  and  its  members  being   the

Minister   for  Finance  and  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister.   The  Budget  Sub-Committee   is   not

responsible to the Cabinet and does not report to

the Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than a year, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Public  Works  Standing  Committee  did  nothing.

During the few meetings that they had, they spent

most  of  their time talking on the  minor  works

projects,  an item in the Development  Estimates,

from  which funds could be allocated for purposes

such   as  beautifying  Sri  Temasek.  The   best

architects  and  engineers were directed  towards

such  jobs.  Many other architects and  engineers

remained idle, having no work to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other reason for there

being no necessity to dig into the pockets of the

poor,  the  wage earners and shopkeepers  in  the 1961 Budget  is  that there is a possibility  of

reducing   millions  of  dollars  of  extravagant

expenditure,  and only our Minister  for  Finance

could set an example. In my opinion, there is  no

need  to  dig into the pockets of the  people  at

this hour when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



times  are especially bad. What the Minister  for

Finance said is not true. He said [Hansard,  29th

November, 1960, col. 10]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The year under review has been a good one for

Singapore.  There has been a marked expansion  in

trade, in industrial output, in the standards  of

personal consumption, in business confidence,  in

the  conditions of workers, and in the  level  of

public services.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is not true,  because  on

the same day the Minister for Labour and Law,  in

reply  to  an  oral question from  an  Opposition

Member  [col.  4],  said that there  were  11,186

unemployed  on  1st November,  1958,  and  52,963

unemployed  two years later, i.e.  1st  November,

1960. Mr  Speaker, Sir, these facts  speak  for

themselves. The unemployment figure is  the  best

yardstick  of  the  economic  welfare   and   the

prosperity of a people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No, Sir, If it is necessary to

find  this  money with the sincere  intention  of

carrying on with capital construction in the 1961

Budget  rather  than  just  for  the  purpose  of

propaganda,  like  in  the 1960

Budget -  window-washing - then boost the economy. Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  can  find the money from other sources.  What

are  the  alternatives  to the  present  taxation

policy of the Government - a policy to benefit  big

European   concerns?  May  I  put  forward   some

alternative    taxation   proposals    for    the

consideration of the Government?

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am surprised to see that the Member  for

Hong Lim, who has been speaking for more than  an

hour,  is  merely  reading his speech,  which  is

contrary to Standing Orders. He is merely reading

his  speech,  as though it has been  prepared  by

somebody outside this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already ruled on that point

which  has  been  raised three  times.  The  hon.

Member  for Hong Lim has been asked not to  refer

to  his notes too frequently. In fairness to him,

I  think he has tried not to refer to his  speech

too often, and I think he will probably bear that

in mind up to the end of his speech. Mr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a speech of

such  a  nature  should  be  carefully  delivered

because it involves facts and figures. It is  not

an abstract talk on political propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put forward these alternative proposals for

the consideration of Government:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Reform, the present archaic so-called company

tax  by  stages. The Tax Department  wastes  much

time computing repayments of tax to shareholders.

Levy  a  tax. Let us call it the Corporation  Tax

for   distinction,   as   practised   in   India,

Australia,  or  the  United  States   and   other

countries.  This  non-refundable corporation  tax

can  be  fixed at 10 per cent in the first stage,

while  at  the same time the 10 per cent  can  be

increased  by  stages  to a  maximum  which  will

ensure  a reasonable profit to investors. At  the

same  time  the  present  so-called  company  tax

should  be  reduced by an equivalent  percentage.

This  method  of  taxation  will  discourage  the

private  companies  from distributing  all  their

profits in dividends which they are now doing  so

as  to  claim  repayment from the Tax Department.

This is not healthy for the country at present as

it  is  not  conducive to economic and industrial

expansion. Later, when the economic situation  is

better  and things are not as gloomy as they  are

now,  an income tax on undistributed profits  can

be  levied to ensure a reasonable distribution of

profits  as  dividends in the  interests  of  the

Exchequer. The present tax of $750 and $1,000  on

private  and  public  companies  respectively  is

unnecessary. Mr Speaker, this tax proposal  will

not  impose undue hardships on those shareholders

who  are Singapore residents, due to the benefits

from big joint stock companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Open negotiations with the British

Government  and the Shell Company, for  instance,

about  paying  assessments on  their  properties.

Perhaps   negotiate   also   with   the   British

Government  for  a tax on their military  trucks;

some  of them are 18-ton trucks and they  do  not

pay even one single cent of road tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Review the death duties tax. I am sure few

people will move their residence to Johore  Bahru

just  for  the  purpose of evading heavier  death

duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these are my humble proposals.

I  have not been given time to work them out on a

more  concrete  basis for more details.  However,

the  Government does not lack experts. What  they

lack is a correct policy in the interests of  the

people.  The experts, after all, carry  out  that

policy.  The taxes introduced by this  Government

to  tax  the poor and the wage earners should  be

reconsidered really on the principle  of  ability

to pay. Some of the new taxes should be repealed.

Others can be amended or reformed. Those who  can

afford should contribute more; those who are less

well-off  should  contribute  less.  The  present

policy of opening all guns on those who are  less

well-off and on the poor must be reversed. We are

not  asking  the Government to tax  the  European

firms until they bleed and run away. No, Sir.  We

only   ask  that  the  taxation  policy  of  this

Government  should be fair and just.  After  all,

Sir, the people of Singapore have waited for long

years, and, alas, are still waiting in vain.

<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning the Government

financial policy which is being discussed  today,

I would like to emphasise, as has, been explained

just  now by the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Prime  Minister, that I do not wish to  speak  at

length  because I understand the contents of  the

Annual  Budget Statement. There is a shortage  of

doctors  and  their posts have not  been  filled.

This is one of the many points stated therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to the Government's financial policy on the whole, we know clearly

that  the question of trade with Indonesia - import

and  export - could be said to be slackening.  This

is what the Members of the Opposition have talked

about earlier. Although there is a surplus in the

Government  financial estimates, I am  completely

surprised why the Government has failed to  spend

money  in  the  public interest, with  particular

reference  to  the rural areas.  There  are  many

services which could be provided to the public if

the  expenditure  provided for is  utilised.  But

from  what  I  can see, the monies  provided  for

these services are not spent but are put into the

Estimates   so  that  the  so-called  inefficient

Government  can  balance expenditure  and  income

with  a  view  to having a surplus for  the  year

1961. Mr Speaker, I am unable to understand  the

reasons  for  the vacant posts not being  filled.

The  reason  given is that persons  from  abroad,

such as engineers, doctors and others, cannot  be

obtained. I do not know whether local officers in

Government  Departments are  given  an  allowance

when they hold



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



such  posts. Is this one of the main reasons  why

such  posts  cannot  be  filled,  so  that  these

officers  can  carry on their tasks  without  the

necessity of recruiting people from abroad?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I hope the Minister for Finance can clarify the question of revenue for the State. We

know   that  the  Government,  or  the   Minister

concerned,  has  recently issued  regulations  in

regard  to  our  National  Anthem  and  also  the

national  flag of Singapore. Those who contravene

these  regulations or who default will be  fined.

Has  the Government estimated the yield from such

fines?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I still remember the Prime Minister's reply to the Member for Cairnhill when

the  latter challenged the Government to hold

by-elections   in   Singapore   in   a   number   of

constituencies. The Prime Minister said  that  no

useful purpose would be served because there  was

no  need  to waste public funds, which  had  been

collected  from  the  people  of  Singapore,   on

holding such by-elections. Whether the Government

was  afraid of the challenge or whether it wanted

to  save  money,  it is left to all  Members  to

decide  for  themselves. But I am surprised,  Mr

Speaker,    since    it    seems    that - although

unofficially in this Chamber - the People's  Action

Party, through its official organ and through the

medium  of local newspapers has challenged  three

U.M.N.O. Members in this Assembly to contest  the

by-elections  because they say we are  no  longer

representing our Party. I am shocked that, on the

one  hand,  they  are making an  effort  to  save

money,   but,  on  the  other  hand,  they   have

challenged  U.M.N.O. Members  to  stand  for

by-elections.  It  is  clear  that  the  P.A.P. is

challenging the U.M.N.O. Members to prove to  the

Malays   whether  or  not  they  are,  in   fact,

representing  the Malays. So I am at  a  loss  to

understand  this, Mr Speaker. But our  faith  is

still firm, and God Almighty will have compassion

on  us  and  our  Organisation will  go  back  to

normal.  Although  the  challenge  has  not  been

voiced in this House, I hope, not because we want

to preserve our seats but because -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. My difficulty now is to

relate the hon. Member's speech to the provisions

of  the  Standing Order which perhaps I ought  to

read.  Standing  Order 83, paragraph  (1),  inter

alia, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... the debate ... shall stand adjourned for not

less  than  seven clear days and,  when  resumed,

shall  be  confined to the general principles  of

Government policy and administration as set forth

by  the  Minister  in moving the  motion  and  as

indicated in the Main Estimates.'



<br><br>So,  in  so far as this challenge to the U.M.N.O.

is  concerned, I have up till now failed  to  see

how  that  is  related to the provisions  of  the

Standing Order.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

merely wish to clarify the financial position  as

it  stands.  However, Mr Speaker,  the  question

which I have raised just now could be related  to

another matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Singapore Government in 1954, that is, the then Colonial Government, had loaned

money   to  the  tune  of  $30  million  to   the

Federation  of  Malaya to fight  Communism.  That

loan  is  to be paid by the latest in ten  years'

time.  Therefore, the surplus which is  indicated

here  includes  the  $30  million  paid  by   the

Federation of Malaya to the Singapore Government.

I pay tribute to the Federation Government who is

sympathising with the Government of Singapore  by

repaying  the  loan before the  time  is  due.  I

believe,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the reason  for  the

Government asking for the $30 million loan to  be

repaid  during  the  life-time  of  the  People's

Action Party is that it could be used for various

aspects  for the benefit of the State.  It  means

that  before the forthcoming elections,  the  $30

million  will  have  been  spent  by  the  P.A.P.

Government to defend its ability in the matter of

the  financial state of affairs of Singapore.  We

on  the Opposition are not surprised. If the view

of  the  present P.A.P. Government is to ask  for

the  repayment of the $30 million so that victory

could be achieved in the next elections, it  does

not matter. But it is clear that the solution  to

the  question of finance is still lagging behind,

whereas the population is on the increase and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



unemployment  is  also on the increase.  This  is

another  major  problem which has  not  yet  been

resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Ministry of Culture

there  is  also  a  surplus  to  the  amount   of

$400,000.  Good,  well  done!  The  Ministry   is

efficient in the performance of its tasks. But  I

feel  that  to  use millions of dollars  for  the

propaganda  purpose of creating  one  culture  in

Singapore on the basis of Government's concept of

a  Malayan  culture  is most unsatisfactory.  The

Minister  for Health, who has elucidated  on  the

question  of culture, is absent from the  Chamber

today.  He has accused me and has alleged that  I

am  conservative  and am afraid that  this  House

will  be  dissolved. But outside this Chamber,  a

different version was told in the newspapers.  So

I  do not know whether the Government is wrong in

giving  an answer that is motivated by sentiment.

We  from  the Opposition, however, bring  forward

the  opinion of the electorate we represent.  Mr

Speaker,  whether the Government, especially  the

Ministry  of  Culture,  in spending  millions  of

dollars,  could evolve a culture  or  whether  it

could  accept  Malay culture as the  basis  of  a

Malayan culture, it is left to it to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not a member of the P.A.P., but I have been presented with a booklet entitled

"The  Tasks Ahead" by the Hon. Minister.  But  it

may be that our Minister for Health has forgotten

that   in  "The  Tasks  Ahead"  there  have  been

mentioned  topics  dealing with  such  things  as

"Economic  Roots of Communalism", "Racialism  and

Economic Status Quo" and "Poverty Knows No  Race"

and  many  other  topics. I have gone  over  them

carefully.  I admit that the writer is efficient,

wise and smart, but I am surprised at the mention

in  the  Budget  speech that the People's  Action

Party  has been elected by the people and  is  on

the   side  of  the  workers  by  protecting  and

safeguarding their interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not my intention to speak outside the confines of this debate, but I wish

to  stress this: will the Government be  able  to

recruit personnel with such a financial policy?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



Recently it also accused communal parties without

first making investigations into the question  of

labour   relations.  I  am  sure  that  such   an

accusation  is  levelled at  the  Opposition  and

particularly at U.M.N.O. I wish to  say  that  if

there  are  among  us those who indulge  in  such

matters, I hope the Government with the power and

complete  State  machinery at its  disposal  will

take the necessary action. But it should not just

point  an  accusing finger at us. We on our  side

realise  that  before a common  identity  can  be

established, it is difficult to depart  from  the

policy of our Party. I hope, Mr Speaker, it  can

be said in this Chamber whether U.M.N.O. has ever

done such a thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to cut short my speech, I wish to say that I do not know what is going to happen to

the  Malays  as they are governed by a  socialist

Government.   There  are  Malays  who   represent

Socialist Parties. But I hope what is enunciated

in  the Singapore Constitution of 1958, which was

promulgated and tabled in the English  Parliament

and  which became effective since then,  will  be

discharged.  If the Estimates are  based  on  the

Constitution, I cannot really see what  help  the

Government will be able to give to the Malays  as

the  indigenous  people of the  island  State  of

Singapore. Mr Speaker, if it is said that I am a

communalist,  I accept that. But that  cannot  be

eradicated  until  there is positive  proof  that

monetary  help  will be given to  the  Malays  in

Singapore.  I  fail  to see in  the  Government's

plans  the  methods  by which the  Government  is

going  to help the Malays in the economic  field.

However,  if they are compared with the plans  of

the  People's  Action Party,  they  are  directed

entirely towards the Federation of Malaya. But  I

cannot see why they are not being implemented  in

Singapore today. If the Government wishes to  do

it, there is nothing to prevent it from doing so.

I   note,  Mr  Speaker,  that  there  are  Malay

settlements,   low-cost   houses,    and    their

allocation,  and so on, but I think,  aside  from

all  this,  that  the  question  of  raising  the

economic  status  of the Malays should  be  fully

encouraged.

<br><br>6.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in col. 10 of Hansard, Volume 14, No. 1  of

29th  November,  1960, the Minister  for  Finance

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... during election campaigning, irresponsible

Right-wing  Parties  worked  themselves  into   a

fright.'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is true.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would not have mattered if the hysteria they

generated  confined itself to those  parties  and

their  few  well-wishers. But  in  the  nature  of

things,  the  fright campaign must  have  further

repercussions.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember that on several occasions

Ministers  have  referred to my statement  during

the  election  that if the P.A.P.  Government  came

into  power  women would lose their jewels.  This

has  been referred to as wild rumour. Sir, it  is

not a rumour; neither is it wild because-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> They got richer?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Take the case of one couple

who are working for the Government. They have had

their  pay slashed, anything from $200  to  $400.

Now, this couple have saved up for years and have

at  last  budgeted  their pay so  that  they  can

afford  to  buy a house that they can call  their

home.  When  the  P.A.P. came  into  power,  and

dropped  the  axe  on their variable  allowances,

they could no longer pay the monthly instalments

on  their  house. What happens? Sell the  woman's

jewels, of course. When there are no more  jewels

to  sell, sell the car. When there is no more  to

sell,  sell  the house; and the amah  goes  also.

When  the  amah goes, unemployment is  increased.

Then  what happens? After the house is sold,  the

amah  sacked, the couple go back to Mum and  Dad.

These  two  old  people are very sweet,  helpful,

well-meaning and very kind. Sir, I am old myself,

so  I  know what old folks are like. Due to their

age,   they   are  inclined  to   be   a   little

interfering.    They   are    well-meaning    but

interfering, and they lack understanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



of  the  minds and the  ways  of  young

people. So the young couple have to tolerate  it,

whether  they  like  it or  not.  And  then  what

happens  to the baby? The baby can no  longer  be

brought  up  according to the mother's  ideas  of

child psychology or child upbringing. The baby is

now  grandma's  darling  and  is  brought  up  in

exactly  the  way the father and the mother  have

been  brought  up.  Sir, is this  fulfilling  the

promise that the P.A.P. made during the elections

- to  give  women  an  equal  opportunity  and  an

improved  status,  of relief  from  drudgery  and

slavery of house work?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have never promised to

reform mothers-in-law!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> They have forced young

women into the hands of mothers-in-law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing, the Finance Minister said in col.

13:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In my last budget speech, I referred to the

necessity  for establishing some form  of  common

market arrangements with the Federation.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I refer you, Sir, to something he said

earlier on? It is in col. 10. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... a government is judged not so much by its

expressions  of  good  intentions  but   by   its

concrete achievements...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what the public of Singapore

would  like  to see - that the Government  achieves

the  common  market - and not hear about  it  year

after year in the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree more with the Minister. Sir, when

he  said that "without the firm financial base of

a  sound  currency, no underdeveloped region  can

hope  to  tackle the immense problems of economic

development."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the column number?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> It is in column 14 of the

same Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have not found it. Could the

Member indicate which line?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> It is in the first

paragraph of column 14, Sir, I quote from Hansard

of  29th  November, 1960, Vol. 14, No. 1,  column

14:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But without the firm financial base of a sound

currency,  no underdeveloped region can  hope  to

tackle   the   immense   problems   of   economic

development.'



<br><br>And also, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A strong currency is something we enjoyed for

so long in the past...'.



<br><br>I  cannot  agree  more with that;  but  what  the

Opposition  is  not so happy  about  is  why  the

Minister  for  Finance has found it necessary  to

express the hope of his Government that it  would

be  possible  to retain the present  co-operative

arrangement between the five territories. Does he

have any apprehension that it might not, or is it

guilty conscience?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the depression suffered by the

construction  industry,  the  Minister  said   in

column 17 of the same Hansard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Board lost no time in getting down to work

and   pulling  itself  out  of  the  difficulties

created in the S.I.T. by the mismanagement of the

former Minister for National Development.'.



<br><br>Sir,  when  the  Opposition tried to  bring  this

"mismanagement" to the notice of  the  Government

and  the  people, the P.A.P. Ministers, including

the  Prime Minister himself, called us names  and

shielded  their  ex-comrade  and  prevented   the

public from knowing the truth. Had the Member for

Hong  Lim not annoyed the Hon, the Prime Minister

with  his 16 resolutions, the mismanagement would

have perhaps up to this date been hidden from the

public,   and   the  ex-Minister   for   National

Development might have been permitted to continue

mismanaging  and Singapore allowed to deteriorate

and  the  people would have continued  suffering.

Thanks to the 16 resolutions - whatever value  they

may  have  in other ways - the people of  Singapore

have   now   learned  about  this  mismanagement.

Although  the  Member for Hong Lim is  no  longer

able  to  mismanage the affairs  in  the  S.I.T.,

mismanagement  seems  to continue  and,  what  is

worse,  Government  seems  bent  on  leading  the

public up the wrong path. May I quote Hansard  of

16th  November, 1960, Volume 13, No.  11,  column

836:



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Hon. Minister tell us why these 91 terrace houses

have not been occupied?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Kia Gan: Mr Speaker, some delay has

resulted  because of wanton damage  done  to  the

fittings by vandals in the area, and repair  work

has had to be done.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

whether the high rent has anything to do with the

vacancy of those houses?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Kia Gan: Mr Speaker, at the moment, the

Board has arrangements in hand to offer the first

option  for  accommodation in the  Kampong  Tiong

Bahru  Fire Site to fire victim families. It  has

nothing to do with high rent.'



<br><br>I  naturally, Sir, never doubted the  correctness

of this statement, but on Tuesday, 135 housewives

came to my `meet-the-people' session -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Where?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> - with these forms. It was

a pitiful sight, Sir. Some of them were in tears.

They  are the people who have lost all that  they

possessed  in  the fire at Kampong  Tiong  Bahru.

When  that  took  place, the previous  Government

brought them in lorries to the Old Airport-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In buses.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> -and housed them. Well,

they  told me that they were brought in  lorries.

They  were  exempted from paying rent  for  three

months. After the three months were up, they paid

$25   for  a  one-room  flat  with  kitchen   and

bathroom;  $35 for a two-room flat  with  kitchen

and  bathroom. They told me, Sir, that during the

election  campaign, P.A.P. canvassers knocked  at

their  doors  and told them that  if  they  voted

P.A.P., they would be put back in houses  at  the

fire  site  at a rent much lower than  what  they

were paying.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did read the relevant

Standing  Order.  I must remind  the  Member  for

Mountbatten that this is a debate which  must  be

confined  to the general principles of Government

policy  and  administration.  I  think  the  hon.

Member  is probably going into too many  details.

It  will  take the speech away from  the  general

principles to which she is supposed to keep.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

trying to show the general policy of letting  out

S.I.T. flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people experience great hardship in having

to  send their children right down to Tiong Bahru

to schools.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not said that the

hon.  Member is out of order in just touching  on

this incident, but if she goes into details, like

travelling  in  buses  and  sending  children  to

schools,  and so on, she is inviting a debate  on

details, which I think is out of order in so  far

as  this present debate is concerned. The  debate

must be on general principles.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, these people have now

been  offered by the Government to return to  the

fire  site but at a rent of $68 per month for  a

three-room  house, $55 for a two-room  house  and

$40  for  a  one-room house with  only  a  common

kitchen and common bathroom facilities. All these

rooms  are  smaller  than  the  rooms  they   are

occupying and the partitions are made of celotex.

I  am  not  trying to go into details, but  I  am

trying  to  show that, on the whole, those  rooms

are  much inferior and smaller accommodation with

less  facilities and are rented  out  at  a  much

higher  rate for the fire victims who  have  lost

all  that  they had. When they went to  No.  332.

Alexandra  Road - the address given  in  this  form

that  they  received - they  were  told  to  go  to

Pickering Street; and when they went to Pickering

Street,  they had to go up and down to  find  the

place until they were fed up and fagged out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is what I am driving at. Is this the

way  that this Government, which claims to be the

people's  Government,  which  claims  to  be  the

Government for the poor, treats the fire  victims

of  Singapore?  Sir, I have  here  in  this  book

[Indicating]    135    names,    addresses    and

particulars,  and each of them  is  the  head  of

family of four to eight children.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Member

for  Mountbatten that this might be a very  ideal

subject  for  a  motion  in  this  House  perhaps

censuring the Government for its policy on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



fire victims? I think I must stop the hon. Member

from  going into details of this nature,  because

she is in fact inviting a debate on details. That

is what she cannot do in this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

Budget   Statement  made  by  the  Minister   for

Finance,  he  said (Hansard dated 29th  November,

1960, Vol. 14 No. 1, at column 23:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A right-wing government would view this

[increasing unemployment] not with alarm but with

delight.'



<br><br>How  irresponsible can a Government statement be?

Does  the  Minister for Finance suggest that  the

Government across the Causeway - because they  are

a    Right-wing   Government - would   view   their

increasing unemployment with delight? Moreover, I

am  sure  that the public would like to know  who

are  the  Right-wing and who form the  Left-wing!

The  Government say that the Opposition is  Right

of them and then they claim that there is a group

that  is  Left of them. Sir, relatively they  are

Right  of that group and they can still be called

a  Right-wing Government. Sir, instead of telling

the  House how the Government intend to solve the

unemployment  problem,  the  Minister   is   more

interested   in  predicting  the  reaction   that

increasing unemployment would have on a  Rightist

Government,  and  all that the  Minister  has  to

offer  is  employment  for 2,500  out  of  nearly

60,000 unemployed - and that too if the progress is

what the Minister expects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On income tax, Sir, the Minister goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A socialist Government will get the money

through taxation in such a way that those who can

afford   to   pay   taxes  share   the   greatest

responsibility.'



<br><br>Therefore, Sir, the question arises as to whether

the P.A.P. is a socialist Government. If we judge

them by their proposal of the new income tax,  we

would  say that they are not, because in the  new

proposal,  the poor and the lower middle  classes

are  the  hardest hit. The Minister  proposes  to

lower  the  personal  allowance  from  $3,000  to

$2,000,  and  from $2,000 to $1,000 so  that  the

rates between Singapore and the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



would not differ substantially. We cannot hope to

imitate  the Federation. In the Federation  where

there is a boom, it could be easily expected that

a family of three or four grown-up children would

all be working; but in Singapore where 60,000 are

unemployed  a family with three or four  grown-up

children  and a few small children may have  only

one  son working and supporting the whole family.

It  is  a  common thing in Singapore  to  find  a

bachelor  working to support his father,  mother,

brothers,  sisters,  and grandparents  sometimes,

and  because of his many dependants, he is forced

to   remain  a  bachelor  and  be  penalised   by

Government  for  being one by having  his  relief

reduced  to $2,000 with no relief whatsoever  for

his  dependants. This is not the case in England.

Worse hit than the bachelor is the married woman.

Immediately  she  gets married, her  relief  goes

down  to  $1,000 and the rate of her tax goes  up

because  her  income is pooled with that  of  her

husband's.   Sir,   this  is   the   price   that

Singapore's   young  people  pay  for   a   legal

marriage.  When a couple live in sin they  escape

all  these  penalties, because in so far  as  the

Government   are  concerned  they  are   separate

individuals.   Surely,   Government    are    not

encouraging  people to live in sin  in  view  of

their  policy  against  yellow  culture.  Or,  on

second  thoughts, could that be  the  reason  for

their delay in reintroducing the Women's Charter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of a deficit, the

Minister  for Finance had this to say in  Hansard

of  29th November, 1960, Vol. 14, No. 1 at  column

25:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It may also be noted that total expenditure

never  does  keep  up  with  the  Estimates...  For

instance,  from  1950 to 1958, total  expenditure

had  never  exceeded  total estimates  except  in

1954... it was only in 1951 and 1952 that estimates

were  nearly achieved by actual expenditure.  For

the rest, expenditure fell short of estimates...'.



<br><br>Sir,  when the Member for Tanglin tried to  point

this  outlast  year,  he  was  ridiculed  by  the

Minister  for Finance, who is now saying  exactly

the  same thing in almost the same words.  Surely

an economist who is able to change an $8



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



million deficit into a $37 million surplus  never

needs  to  panic at a threatened  deficit  of  $6

million  that  was budgeted for. It  is  commonly

believed, Sir, that this panic was whipped up for

the following purposes:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To justify the slash in pay of civil servants

who  perhaps  have been suspected of  not  having

voted for the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To scare the public and antagonise them

against the civil servants who dare object to the

slash.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To antagonise the public against the previous

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slashing of pay by Government and this

arrangement  of a Member of the Government  Bench

to   fight   against  the  Government   for   the

restitution of the pay and Government's  dramatic

gesture  of  restoring part of the  cut - Sir,  all

these  performances are signs of an immature  and

an  amateur government. However, for the sake  of

the  civil  servants  who  have  suffered  enough

hardships,  we too will join the "let's  pretend"

game  and  wish the Government Member "Good  luck

and   success!"  in  his  negotiations  with  the

Government  on behalf of the civil  servants.  We

hope  that he will succeed in getting not only  a

partial restoration, but a full restoration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to point out that when

considering  the  proposals  of  income  tax  and

assessments, it is necessary to bear in mind that

a  million  dollars  may seem  very  small  to  a

millionaire. But the last mite is very  great  to

a, widow. So when Government says. "It is only  a

few  dollars  that the poor have to  pay",  well,

those few dollars mean much more to them than the

millions  mean  to  a millionaire.  The  Minister

further promised to return all taxes garnered  by

the  Government  to the people  in  the  form  of

schools,  hospitals, etc. May I be so bold,  Sir,

as  to remind him that 18 months have gone by and

the Government has built neither a hospital nor a

school?  And  with  due  respect,  Sir,  to   the

Minister, may I again quote what he said at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



beginning  of  his speech, that "a government  is

judged  not  so much by its expressions  of  good

intentions but by its concrete achievements"?



<br><br>6.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

debate  on the Minister's Annual Budget Statement

for  the  year  1961, I take this opportunity  to

express my views because of the importance of the

Government's  financial  policy,  since  it  will

determine whether it will be good or bad for  the

State  of Singapore. From what we have been  able

to  gather from the statement of the Minister for

Finance,  it  cannot be said to be a  progressive

statement  which one can be proud of,  especially

for  its surpluses and programmes formulated  for

1961.  There is no need for me to go into  detail

on  the  surpluses, because this point  has  been

touched upon by my colleagues on this side of the

House.   But  when  we  plan  for  progress   for

Singapore  and  its people in the future,  it  is

important to consider the reasons for the present

condition   and  the  difficult  situation   that

exists.  Mr Speaker, the Party which is  now  in

office,   during   the   general   elections   in

Singapore,  hoping  to  be  returned  to   power,

formulated  a  programme to  attract  the  masses

without  going  deeply into the question  of  its

ability to fulfil its promises. Apart from  that,

Mr Speaker, the modus operandi of the Government

shocked many important sections in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch upon the speech which is

being  strongly defended in Hansard, at col.  20,

when  it  said,  "The  P.A.P.  Government  is   a

Government elected by the people and is one  that

is partial to the working class." I think that as

a government, it cannot take sides, but it should

be  impartial to all and not merely to  side  the

workers or businessmen or Government workers.  If

we  take sides, as has been mentioned, it  means,

in  effect,  that that section of  the  community

which the Government is unable to side with  will

not  receive  a guarantee that they can  live  in

peace in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  For instance, we know  that  although

imports  of  commodities  are  on  the  increase,

business  is declining. Mr Speaker, if we  study

the  lives  of  the trishaw riders and  the  taxi

drivers,  we  will find that they are  frustrated

and worried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the plan to industrialise in

the  year to come, it is indeed a good programme.

It  is a programme in which we can have faith and

in which certain sections of the unemployed could

find  employment.  But the  possibility  of  such

industrialisation being carried out still remains

a  question mark, because, Mr Speaker, we in the

State  of  Singapore are exactly like the  waiter

who,  if  he  is  unable  to  serve  his  patrons

properly,  will cause dissatisfaction  among  his

patrons,  and  so cannot expect a good  business.

Therefore, what has been achieved during the past

one   and   a   half  years  has  brought   about

dissatisfaction among the people. Can we be proud

of  our  ability to govern the people? We can  do

this;  we can do that; but all the means of doing

them should come from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I feel that the Government has somewhat slowed down in their momentum.

Previously  their hatred for the capitalists  has

been great, but today the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Prime Minister has blamed the capitalist

countries for not giving assistance to Singapore.

It looks as though we in Singapore are going down

on  our knees to the capitalists for aid. On  the

question of how to live, Mr Speaker, we could do

wonders.  Today  we say one thing,  and  tomorrow

another   thing.  This  shows  our   inconsistent

attitude,  our tendency to distort facts.  We  do

not practise what we preach. We should put a stop

to  this. On the other hand, we must rectify  our

mistakes  made  during the past one  and  a  half

years.  It  is hoped that the State of  Singapore

will  give impartial treatment to all the  people

of   Singapore  so  that  all  sections  of   the

population may benefit. That is all that  I  have

to  say  in the debate on the Government's fiscal

policy  for the year 1961.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  we are approaching the time for the moment of

interruption, I do not propose to take much  time

for  my  speech on the Finance Minister's  Budget

statement.  But there are a few important  points

in  that statement which require me to make  some

remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is obvious to us that the Budget

statement   of  the  Minister  for   Finance   is

specifically  meant for foreign consumption.  The

Minister recently went a-begging overseas, and we

are  informed that he has been told that we  must

show  what  we  are prepared to do for  ourselves

before  overseas  assistance can be  forthcoming.

With  an  eye  to  this, Sir,  the  Minister  has

therefore  injected into his Budget  statement  a

synthetic buoyancy. The Minister claims that 1960

has  been a better year than 1959 and that  there

has  been considerable improvement all round.  He

quotes  statistics, Sir, to prove his contention.

We know that figures can sometimes give the wrong

picture. Take, for instance, Sir, the figures for

bank   advances.  It  is  claimed  that   because

September bank advances were very much more  than

January  advances, therefore, the trade  position

has improved.



<br><br>6.46 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (MR G. KANDASAMY) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a totally different interpretation can also

hold  good.  The  fact  that  bank  advances   in

September were very much higher than advances  in

January  could be due to the fact that businesses

financed by bank loans were having difficulty  in

meeting  their commitments. I know  for  a  fact,

Sir,  that  many  rice and sugar  merchants  have

suffered  considerable losses, and that they  are

having difficulty in meeting their bank bills. We

know,  Sir,  that  it  is a  common  practice  in

Singapore  for  banks not to take drastic  action

against  businesses to whom they have lent  large

advances  in the hope that, if given time,  these

businesses  would  be able to pull  through  and,

therefore, cut their losses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Sir, there is a common barometer

to   gauge  the  economic  circumstances  of  the

population. I refer to coffee shops, Sir. Sir, it

has  never  happened in Singapore  before  for  a

coffee  shop to close down business. And  yet  in

the year 1960 many coffee shops have closed down,

a year which has been claimed by the Minister for

Finance  to  be a good year, a year in  which  he

says there has been considerable improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a number of goldsmiths of long

established reputation have also closed  down  in

1960.  If  there  is considerable improvement  in

1960,  why  is  it that the unemployment  figures

have increased? If 1960 has been a good year, why

is  it that hawkers, taxi-drivers and businessmen

are  groaning, and a large number of workers  are

earning much less?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If 1960 is better than 1959,

why  is  that  the T.U.C. is more concerned  with

working  out a scheme for retrenchment of workers

than  concerning itself with the placing  of  new

employees  in  employment? Sir,  there  has  been

grumbling in lots of places that business is bad.

The  Minister should not place too much  reliance

on  statistics. And I have heard just  now.  Sir,

the  Minister interjecting that what I have  been

saying  is rubbish. I would, therefore, ask  him,

and his Ministerial colleagues, just to go out to

their constituencies and ask the people there - the

people whom they represent. Ask the hawkers,  the

taxi  drivers, the shopkeepers whether  they  are

having a better time this year than they had last

year.  And if they were to tell the Minister  and

his  Ministerial  colleagues  that  they  have  a

better year this year, then I will say assure him

that these people will put up a tale of woe.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member for Cairnhill

will give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister will be able to

answer later.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Member does not give

way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Since the Minister is prepared

to  answer,  then surely he can answer  when  the

time comes. We will give him every opportunity to

answer,  and I hope that the answer will be  that

he  will go out among his people in his area, and

so  will his Ministers go out among their  people

in  their  areas; and not with bodyguards  around

them,  protecting them against  the  masses  whom

they claim to have a great love and affection for

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You have to run away from them! [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It would appear, Sir, that the

Government Front Benchers, in spite of  the  fact

that  there is a Ministry of Culture, are not  so

cultured  as  they  would  have  the  people   of

Singapore  believe. Sir, again, the Minister  had

this   to  say  about  cargoes  handled  by   the

Singapore  Harbour Board. I quote  Hansard,  Vol.

14,  No. 1, col. 15, at about the bottom of  the

column.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From January to July this year the general

cargo discharged at the Harbour Board wharves was

1.215  million  tons compared with 1.132  million

tons  last year, representing an increase of  7.3

per  cent.  Cargo loaded rose from 1.035  million

tons last year to 1.074 million tons this year.'



<br><br>Against this, Sir, let me quote the report of the

Singapore  Harbour Board which  appeared  in  the

Sunday  Mail of 23rd October, 1960, on  page  18.

This reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Cargo, excluding coal, fuel and vegetable oil,

handled  at S.H.B. wharves during the  half  year

ended  June  30,  1960, totalled 2,057,643  tons,

representing a decrease of 6,788 tons or 0.3  per

cent  compared with the previous six months.  The

tonnage  of  cargo handled, including coal,  fuel

and    vegetable   oil,   was   2,807,907   tons,

representing a decrease of 34,585 tons or 1.2 per

cent.  The  number  of vessels berthed  alongside

cargo  working wharves was 1,968, representing  a

decrease  of  61 compared with the  previous  six

months.'



<br><br>Sir,  I  leave it to hon. Members to read between

the lines.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is a simple explanation. I

will give it to you.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, a word about the

cigarette industry. I quote the same Hansard,  at

col. 16:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The cigarette industry continues to make great

strides, the quantity produced in the first  nine

months  of  the year increasing from 1.6  million

pounds  in 1959 to 2.1 million pounds this  year,

an increase of 28 per cent.'



<br><br>I  wonder, Sir, whether this increase of  28  per

cent  is on the credit side or on the debit  side

of Government's economic policy. The Minister has

stated,  Sir, that as a result of this change  in

consumer habits, there will be a shortfall of  $3

million  this year. In this connection, Sir,  let

us  see  what  the Minister said  in  his  Budget

speech last year. I quote Hansard, volume 11, No.

13, col. 805, at the bottom of the column:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There may be adjustments to the tax on tobacco,

depending  on  factors which  I  have  previously

discussed.'



<br><br>And  what are these facts, Sir? The same Hansard,

col. 791, gives the answer. What are these facts?

At the middle of the column:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The duty on tobacco goes up from $34.2 million

to  $43.1  million.  But this  item  needs  close

watching.  It  is  based on  certain  assumptions

about   consumer   preferences  between   locally

produced  cigarettes and imported cigarettes.  It

remains  to  be  seen whether  these  assumptions

will, in fact, be justified.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  Minister quotes the cigarette industry

as  an  expanding industry. And if this  industry

keeps on expanding, as it is bound to do, because

the   people   will   have   to   smoke   locally

manufactured  cigarettes which are  cheaper  than

imported  cigarettes,  then  said  the  Minister,

"there may be adjustments to the tax on tobacco".

What   do  we  want?  Do  we  want  an  expanding

cigarette  industry or do we want more money  out

of tobacco revenue?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance took great pains

to   reiterate   the  economic  policy   of   the

Government,  and  two significant  facts  emerged

from  this  dissertation. The  first  significant

fact  is  that it is the Government's  desire  to

adjust themselves in the eyes of those supporters

who  hold  the  belief that  the  Government  are

committed to pursuing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



a  more  vigorous  socialist policy.  The  second

significant fact is the Government's  anxiety  to

impress on capital that they are not so bad after

all,  that  they have done a lot of  barking  but

that there will be no biting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have all along said that Singapore

cannot survive without giving capital as well  as

labour  its  due  part to play  in  the  economic

development  of Singapore. And we  see  that  the

Government  today  are  getting  more  and   more

friendly with capital. The Minister made  mention

of  persons  in  left-wing  organisations,  trade

unions, political parties and so forth, and I  do

not  know  what  is  meant  by  this.  The  Prime

Minister  has  said  in no uncertain  terms  that

anything  left of the P.A.P. are the  Communists.

Is  the  Minister  for Finance referring  to  the

Communists? I do not think so. What I think he is

referring to is that group in the P.A.P. which is

more  left,  which is hoping for a more  vigorous

socialist policy than the group that is in  power

today. Therefore, if there is such a group in the

P.A.P. today, that group which the Minister  has

described as left, then the Party in power  today

could   justly  be  described  as  a   Right-wing

Government. After all, Sir, what is Left-wing  or

Right-wing? It is just relative. When one is less

left  than the left, one becomes right; and  when

one  is  more left than the Left-wing,  then  the

Left-wing  becomes the Right-wing. We  really  do

not  care  what the P.A.P. describes

itself-Left-wing,   Right-wing,   non-Communist,   democratic

socialist  political party. We do not  care  what

they describe themselves. But we do wish to point

out that what they claim they are going to do for

the economic development of Singapore is based on

the legislation introduced and brought into being

by  the previous so-called Right-wing Government.

It  was  the  previous Government that introduced

legislation  to enable the present Government  to

put   up  plans  for  the  industrialization   of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, now I come to the tax

proposals. I would not like to mention  it  again

after such a short interval, that there seems  to

be so little culture, in a Government that has  a

Ministry  of Culture and a Government that  wants

so many millions of dollars to spend on culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The truth hurts!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, honi soit qui mal y

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I see the Government

intends  to increase taxation rates in the  rural

areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is he allowed to speak in

some other language?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I wonder whether this is in

keeping  with the utterances of P.A.P. candidates

and supporters during the 1959 general elections.

I  heard  it  said  that  P.A.P. candidates  and

supporters had gone round to the rural areas  and

said, "Vote us in and we will see to it that with

the P.A.P. Government there shall be less tax."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is evident!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Today we are told that we have

been  informed  a  week ago by the  Minister  for

Finance that there will be increased taxation  in

the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On landlords.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The property tax?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Yes, on landlords.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, assurances were given at

the  election  campaign, and  the  P.A.P. always

means what it says-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It says what it means.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Or does it? Sir, in regard to

industrial establishments in the rural areas, the

Minister  has this to say in Hansard, volume  14,

No. 1 of 29th November, 1960, at column 43.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is, however, proposed that property tax on

industrial establishments in the rural areas will

not  be  increased beyond the present rates.  The

reason   for   providing   industry   with   this

inducement is obvious.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is it?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sure, Sir, it is obvious. The

Government is now going down on its knees telling

capital, "Boys, we ain't so bad." That is it. "We

are  no longer that bad. We are prepared to  slap

those that brought us into power, so that you can

come  back  and help us to develop this country."

That  is it. People in dwelling houses, Sir,  and

others  in the rural areas are to be called  upon

to   pay   increased  taxation,  but   industrial

establishments  in the rural  areas  may  not  be

called  upon  to  do  so because  the  reason  is

obvious.  Much, much too obvious. The  P.A.P. is

now all geared towards making its great appeal to

capital. As far as we know, Sir, industry is  not

so concerned with the payment of rates and taxes.

What  it is most concerned about is the fact that

there  should be industrial peace and that  there

should be confidence in the Government. If  these

two  factors  are  lacking,  then  no  amount  of

inducement can prevail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Business Registration Tax. In regard to this

tax,  I  find it difficult to say what is in  the

minds  of  the Government, because the Government

have not yet defined what a business is. When  is

a business not a business, we do not know yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Gone bankrupt!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Is a little business in a

building selling nuts, a business? Then again, in

the  case  of  a  person having a  stall  on  the

pavement  and  again  selling  nuts,  is  that  a

business?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It depends on the type of

nuts!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So it all depends on the type

of  nuts  [Laughter]  and  not  on  the  type  of

business that is carried



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



out.  If that is the kind of interpretation  that

the Hon. the Leader of the House is going to give

to  "business", I think maybe the other side  may

soon be getting nutty! [Laughter].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, although we do not know

what the definition of "business" is going to be,

there is one thing we can say, and that is,  that

the  tax to be paid by limited companies has  our

support. But we do say that in the case of  small

businesses, they should not be called upon to pay

this registration tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private lotteries - I had thought that the

Government's  drive against slot  machines  would

have   driven   the  one-armed  bandit   out   of

existence!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> To rob the rich!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I now find, Sir, that this

form  of  gambling is quite all  right  with  the

Government so long as they have a cut.  Now,  the

one-armed  bandit has become a two-armed  bandit,

the  other arm being provided by the Minister for

Finance  to  rake  in  30 per  cent  of  the  net

takings.  So long as Government can  cash  in  on

gambling,  they  say,  "Go ahead,  have  as  much

gambling as you want; but let us have our 30  per

cent blood money."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fees levied on the practice of certain

professions.  In  his speech, the  Minister  says

that    he   has   consulted   the   professional

associations.  But I have been  told,  Sir,  that

there  has been no such consultation.  I  do  not

know  who  is right, but if there had  been  such

consultations,  surely the  Minister  would  have

been  informed by these associations  that  there

are   objections  to  the  introduction  of  such

professional levies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Are you still hoping to be a

lawyer?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The newspapers, Sir, have

given  reports that there are associations  which

are  objecting to this. Sir, we do not worry  nor

seriously  oppose  the  levying  of  a   fee   on

professional  people, but it is  not  improbable,

Sir, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



with  the imposition of this levy the charge  may

be  passed  on  to  the public  in  the  form  of

increased charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passenger tax on embarking air travellers.

There  can be no objection to this, but  I  would

ask the Government to reconsider its proposal  to

introduce a passenger tax on internal air travel.

Travel  from Singapore to Malacca, Kuala  Lumpur,

Ipoh and Penang should, we think, Sir, be treated

as  internal travel and not travel to a different

land,  whereby  a  passenger  tax  is  necessary.

However,  Sir,  it  is  left  to  the  Government

whether  they  want to consider  Malaya  as  what

Malaya  has  been  considered  in  the  past,  or

whether  they now wish to consider  Malaya  as  a

different land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to Income tax we support the proposed

increase  in the maximum rate of tax on  personal

income,  but we will not support the decrease  in

rates  of  personal  allowances.  In  1956,   the

previous  Government,  in  conjunction  with  the

Federation Government, proposed to introduce this

reduction  in  personal  allowances  and  it  was

because  of strong opposition not only  from  the

people,  but from the T.U.C. and from members  of

the   P.A.P. that  that  proposal  had   to   be

withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You got cold feet!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And now, Sir, it is the P.A.P.

Government that proposes to introduce  this  kind

of a tax. Sir, it is the P.A.P.-controlled T.U.C.

that, to use the words of the Minister, had  "got

cold  feet"  and had not protested  against  this

increase, this incursion into the earnings of the

wage-earners who are earning less today and  who,

by  reason  of the growing unemployment,  have  a

greater  burden to bear by having to  look  after

relatives who are unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the reason given for imposing this

tax? It is that there should be no difference  in

the  rates of taxation between Singapore and  the

Federation.  But then, Sir, that is not  correct.

There  is  already  a  difference.  Singapore  is

having  a  55 per cent tax on personal income  as

against 45 per cent in the Federation. Therefore,

the argument that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



we  must  have the same rates with the Federation

does not hold good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the Minister

for Finance for doing his utmost to encourage and

promote industrial expansion. The economic

well-being of Singapore is dependent on the success of

this  plan, and it is the duty of every  citizen,

be  he rich, be he poor, be he an employer, be he

a worker, be he a Minister, be he an Assemblyman,

to do all he can to help the Government to see to

it  that  the industrial plan succeeds; otherwise

Singapore  may  perish.  But  there  are  certain

things  which the Government, and the  Government

only,  can  and should do to create an atmosphere

of  goodwill, confidence and tolerance. Singapore

is  not  a poor country. It would have got enough

capital  to finance its own developments  had  it

not  been  for  the fact that local  capital  had

flown away to Kuala Lumpur, to Hong Kong, to  the

Bornean  territories  and  elsewhere  since  last

year. The Government, Sir, cannot deny that  they

have  made  mistakes. And I do not  relish  using

this   forum  here  to  try  and  make  it   more

difficult-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> -for the Government. What we

all  hope, Sir, is that the Ministers will profit

by  their mistakes and that they will learn

fast - very,  very  fast.  In  the immediate  past,  the

Federation   has   been  very  friendly   towards

Singapore,  and  to  regain  this  very  friendly

relationship is of the utmost importance  if  our

industrialisation programme is to  succeed.  Last

year,  the Minister in his Budget speech  touched

on   the  necessity  for  establishing  a  common

commodity  market with the Federation.  One  year

has  passed, and we are told that discussions are

still  continuing. One year has  passed  and  the

Minister has not given this House even a hint  of

some  hope  that  there  may  be  good  news  for

Singapore.  One year has passed, Sir, and  during

the  course of that year, while discussions  were

progressing, the Minister had found it  necessary

to  impose, for the first time, an import duty on

soap,  which  import duty directly  hits  at  the

Federation,  because there is  no  soap  imported

into Singapore other than from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



the Federation. What do we see today? We see that

only  a  week ago, the Federation Government  has

found  it  necessary to take action to bring  the

position  back  to status quo in so  far  as  the

Federation soap manufacturers are concerned. Sir,

has  the imposition of this import duty benefited

Singapore  in  any way? Surely the Government  in

its  talks  with the Federation Government  on  a

common  commodity market could have  made  out  a

case  for  soap  to  be classified  as  a  common

commodity?  Or  surely the Minister  for  Finance

could have consulted the Minister for Finance  in

the  Federation  on  his proposal  to  impose  an

import  duty on soap and sound his views  on  it;

and if the Minister for Finance were to hear from

the  Minister for Finance in the Federation  that

any imposition of an import duty would result  in

an  increased  import duty on  the  part  of  the

Federation, then surely there would have been  no

need  for both Governments to do something  which

is  now giving the impression outside that  there

will  soon be a tariff war between Singapore  and

the  Federation.  Surely these two  things  could

have been done. What a foolish way of going about

winning friends for Singapore!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the common commodity market is of some

importance  to  the  industrialsation   plan   of

Singapore;  but  a common currency  is  of  vital

importance to Singapore and we are told that  the

Federation Bank Negara will presently be  issuing

and  managing  the Federation's own currency.  We

were  told  by  the Minister for Finance  in  his

Budget  Statement last week that it was the  hope

of  his  Government  that the currency  agreement

would continue. I would urge the Government to do

more  than hope that the currency agreement would

continue.  They  should do  everything  in  their

power  to persuade the Federation Government  not

to break away from the agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as time is getting short, I will therefore

end my speech.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>7.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  may  I, in  the  first  instance,

congratulate  the  Minister for  Finance  on  the

technical aspects of presenting a Budget of  this

nature which, for the first time, takes into  its

fold  the revenue of the local government as well

as  the government itself? I feel certain that it

was  not  an easy task. It has been handled  well

and I compliment the Minister on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Finance made his first

Budget  Statement in this Assembly one year  ago,

his tone, his speech and his demeanour were quite

different  from  his  tone, his  speech  and  his

demeanour  on  the occasion of his second  Budget

which,  of  course, is as it should  be.  On  the

first  occasion,  he was a much younger  Minister

when  presenting his first Budget. I am told that

it  was his maiden Budget. He was also a Minister

of  a young, vigorous and virile political Party.

A year has passed and, as time passes, decay sets

in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are hoping.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is so with human beings. It is so

with institutions and it is so-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> With the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - with this political Party. On this

occasion, the speech of the Minister for  Finance

was  not  the virile speech that it was the  last

time,  nor  was the delivery quite so virile.  It

was   quite  hesitant  in  many  places  and   it

explained why things had not happened in the  way

the  Minister  had hoped would  happen;  and  all

these things have made him a wiser man after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



a  year.  And  now it is a wiser Budget  on  this

second  presentation of a P.A.P. Budget  in  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the first

Budget, I ventured to suggest to the Minister for

Finance  that it did not need a wizard of finance

like  himself to be able to end up that financial

year  with a surplus. He has so ended up  with  a

surplus of $37 million. I am going to suggest  to

him  again  this  time that at the  end  of  this

Budget  year he will also end up with a  surplus,

not  because  he does not want to spend  money - he

wants  to  very much - but because the actions  and

the policies of the P.A.P. over the past year  or

so  have  been such as to curtail the functioning

powers  of the P.A.P. as a Government. It is  one

thing to vote the monies, but it is quite another

thing to carry out the schemes: to plan them, and

then  execute them. Policies may be laid down  by

the  Government  but those policies  have  to  be

implemented  by  civil servants, technicians  and

engineers.    The   failure   of    the    P.A.P.

Government - and  this  reflects  itself   in   the

economic life of Singapore - is that they have  not

been able to manage the government of the country

in  the  way they should have. The management  of

the  Government  has  been such  that  the  civil

service has fallen down on its job, the technical

side  has  fallen  down  on  its  job,  and   the

professional side has fallen down on its job; and

that  is  why, Mr Deputy Speaker, we  have  this

surplus. Had all sections of the Government,  had

all sections of the Executive been functioning as

the P.A.P. Ministers had hoped they would have, I

am  sure  that  a large portion of  this  surplus

would  have been spent; and if it had been  spent

by  the  Government, then there would  have  been

greater  prosperity in Singapore  and  a  greater

feeling of confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, governing a country is

a difficult matter. However brilliant the Cabinet

may  be - on  one occasion I did say that  we  have

perhaps  the most brilliant Cabinet in South-East

Asia - it  is not enough to be brilliant  in  one's

academic    life   or   in   one's   intellectual

attainments. One has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



to   translate  this  brilliancy  into  something

positive which will have its result felt  in  the

State   of   Singapore.  To  that   extent,   the

Government  have  failed, not, it  would  appear,

because  they do not want to succeed, but because

the  manner  of  approach to  the  problems,  and

because  the  speeches made by certain  of  their

Ministers  were such as to create a situation  in

Singapore  where the people have lost confidence.

If  the  Government are seriously  interested  in

knowing  why there is this feeling of uncertainty

in Singapore-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There was.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> -why there is this feeling of

uncertainty in Singapore - not there was but  there

is - which  is  increasing from  day  to  day,  and

unless the Ministers are prepared to do something

positive  [Laughter] about the situation  instead

of     laughing     from    their     Ministerial

Benches - laughing  from their Ministerial  Benches

might  save their egos for the moment - it  is  not

going to help Singapore one bit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put it shortly, my advice to the

Government   is  this:  create  a  situation   of

confidence  in  Singapore. If you  can  create  a

situation   of  confidence  in  Singapore,   then

prosperity  will start to come to Singapore.  But

if  you  do not, we will go from worse to  worse,

from  one  doldrum to yet another worse  doldrum.

That is what will happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has given certain figures which, on the face of it, must mean that

Singapore  is  prosperous. I was  very  impressed

with those figures. I asked my colleagues, "Could

we  be  wrong? Why are the people all  around  us

feeling so depressed? Why do they say business is

so  bad?  And  yet the Minister  for  Finance  is

quoting  figures which, on the face of it,  would

indicate  that  we  are  riding  on  a  wave   of

prosperity." Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  if  anyone

were  to walk along the streets, of Singapore - one

of  the  curses of being a Minister  is  that  he

cannot walk in the way he did when he was  not  a

Minister - he  would find out that the  people  are

depressed,  that the people are  not  earning  as

much as they did, and that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



is  a  general feeling of economic stagnation  in

Singapore. The Minister for Finance has said that

the  money in circulation is as high as,  if  not

higher than, it was before.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The same.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The same. And yet there is a feeling

of depression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There was.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Federation is enjoying a

prosperity  which  it has not  enjoyed  for  some

time,  and  yet Singapore which should  share  in

that  prosperity or in that feeling of prosperity

has  not got it. If the Minister for Finance were

to   take  the  trouble  to  go  across  to   the

Federation  some  time and spend  a  week  or  so

there,  he  would  feel that in  the  Federation,

there  is  buoyancy, there is hope, and that  the

people  are  thinking there  is  a  future  there

economically.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are not thinking of going

there, are you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> When I go over there, I will take the

Minister  for Culture with me. We might  then  be

able  to  do  some cultural work there  together.

However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are  not  on

culture  at the moment. We are on the  even  more

difficult matter of trying to keep Singapore in a

position  where  it  will be able  to  appreciate

culture  because, on an empty stomach,  one  does

not think of culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the economic policy of

the  Government, for the first time, has been set

out  in a guarded, a right-handed and left-handed

sort  of  manner,  without  going  into  it  very

carefully; what the Minister wants to say is that

he  finds  himself  in  a capitalistic  state  of

society, that he finds he cannot alter it because

of   circumstances   beyond  his   control,   and

therefore  he  has  to accept  and  to  work  the

situation as he finds it; otherwise there must be

economic  collapse and chaos. I congratulate  the

Minister   on  making  that  statement   in   the

Assembly, because it must have been a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



difficult statement for him to make, seeing  that

what  the  P.A.P. were seeking to  give  outside

before   the   elections   is   something   quite

different.  People had expected that there  would

be  a  radical  change  in the  handling  of  the

economic situation in Singapore, but, however, it

appears  that the present Government has  changed

its  policy. If that is true - and it must be  true

because the Finance Minister says it - then  it  is

up  to  the  Government to see that  capital  and

labour  work  together. And if the  Minister  for

Finance says, "I want to encourage capital",  and

his   other   Ministers  or   Backbenchers   make

statements  in the Press - sometimes the  Ministers

and  Backbenchers do this in one  day,  each  one

speaking  a different tongue and giving different

views - why,  in  one Sunday paper  there  was  the

Minister  for  Finance  side  by  side  with  the

Minister  for  Labour and one of the Backbenchers

(not  all appeared in the same page but they were all in the same paper) all saying quite different

things,  one not compatible with the other -  then

that  is  not  the  sort  of  thing,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, which would engender confidence  in

Singapore;   certainly  not  in  the   mercantile

community. If the Minister for Finance wishes  to

engender  confidence in the mercantile community,

then  I  would  suggest  to  him  that  when  the

Ministers  or Backbenchers make statements  which

are  not compatible, he would at least see to  it

that they do not appear together in the same page

of the same paper on the same day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to some of the specific proposals for

taxation  for the forthcoming year, my colleagues

on  this  side of the House have dealt  with  the

various  aspects of the taxation policy  and  the

various items on which the Government proposes to

increase taxes. There is only one item on which I

wish  to  address the House this  afternoon,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  and that  is  the  question  of

professional  taxation, "Fees levied  on  certain

professions", Hansard, Vol. 14, No. 1, col. 47.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not at the moment concerned with the

fees  which  the  Minister proposes  to  levy  on

certain  professions. I wish  to  deal  with  the

profession of advocate and solicitor, not because

I want to deal with that particularly but because

I  think  that I might be able to put  my  points

better   as   I  know  that  profession   better.

Originally the fee for admission for an  advocate

and  solicitor  in  the  Colony  of  the  Straits

Settlements was $500. That had been so  for  some

considerable  time, until I think about  1948  or

1949  when  it was reduced to $50.  The  fee  for

admission  of  a solicitor in the United  Kingdom

prior  to  1948 was, I understand, £50. When  the

first  Labour  Government or  some  other  Labour

Government - anyway it was a Labour Government - came

into  power in the United Kingdom and formed  the

government, they reduced the fee from £50 to  £5.

The  basis of the argument was that the right  to

practise a profession was the right to work,  and

no government had a right to tax a man's right to

work,  to  earn  a living. It is  a  question  of

principle - that the right to work in any system of

society  should be free and unfettered. Now,  the

Minister might well ask me, "Why then was the fee

of £50 charged in the first instance?" I think it

was because a fee of £50 was felt not to be a fee

for  admission but a fee very much higher than  a

licensing fee. And because of that, it  had  been

considered to be in the nature of a taxation, and

the fee was reduced to £5. When it was reduced to

£5,  Singapore after some time followed suit, and

reduced the fee to $50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government proposes to increase

that  $50  to  $250, and the suggestion  is  that

professional  people can afford  it.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  in all humility,  I  say  to  the

Finance Minister that not all professional people

can afford to pay it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Surely you can!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I am not speaking for myself; I

certainly can afford to pay! But I would like  to

inform the Deputy Prime Minister that there are a

number  of  my professional brothers outside  who

will find it difficult to pay, particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



when  one realises that every year we are getting

20   people   from   England  admitted   to   the

profession,   and  we  are  now  going   to   the

University of Malaya which will give us a  number

of  professional lawyers also. And when all these

people come into the legal market in Singapore, I

can  assure the Deputy Prime Minister  that  they

will  not  have  it  so  good.  And,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, young professional people have  not

developed    a   cynicism   which   Readers    in

universities have developed; not for  some  time.

They are full of life and full of hope; they  are

not  cynical yet. But when one reads too long  in

universities  on abstruse matters, one  tends  to

become  cynical. And one can understand a  Deputy

Prime  Minister  who  has  been  a  Reader  at  a

university  getting that way. But I think  it  is

not  a  good  thing. Mr Deputy Speaker,  to  get

cynical in one's young age, particularly when one

is a bachelor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I put the point to you that the sum of $250

is  in the nature of a taxation and is not a  sum

which  one  can equate to a fee. Over  and  above

that,  it has been suggested that this particular

profession should be called upon to pay a fee  of

$500  a  year, payable every quarter at $125  per

quarter.



<br><br>7.38 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that a young barrister or a young solicitor

who  gets  himself enrolled in  Singapore  as  an

advocate and solicitor pays in his first year  an

admission fee of $250; and before he can practise

he  has  to  pay a quarterly fee of  $125,  which

immediately  makes the fee in the first  instance

$375.  Over  and  above  that  he  has  to  incur

expenditure  in the way of acquisition  of  books

and  other  material,  without  which  he  cannot

practise. And this $375 is a terrible burden, Mr

Speaker,  on  young lawyers. Young  lawyers  have

already approached me and put their point to  me,

and  I  speak now in this Assembly voicing  their

views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister thinks that professional people

are  making money - yes, some are certainly  making

money,  but  not  all,  and certainly  not  young

lawyers - might I make a suggestion to the  Finance

Minister that if he feels that he must go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



through  with  his  proposal for  a  professional

levy,  might I ask him not to make this  levy  on

what we call junior advocates and solicitors;  in

other  words, anybody who has practised for  less

than  seven years should be exempted from  paying

this  fee  but should be called upon to pay  this

normal  fee. And if the Minister feels that  this

tax should be imposed, then let it be levied-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It falls on the senior

partners. The senior partners pay for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> -on the people who have had more than

seven  years'  practice. The Prime  Minister  has

been  very  fortunate  in his  practice.  He  has

always  had a boss to pay his fees for  him.  But

there  would be others not quite so fortunate  as

the  Prime  Minister has been in his professional

practice.  He  had it good because  he  got  here

first.  But  let  me assure the  Prime  Minister,

through  you,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  very  few

undergraduates  coming  out  from  Singapore  are

likely  to have it as good as he had it  when  he

came  out.  And let us not forget that the  Prime

Minister is not an ordinary man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so much for the practice of the

professions. But the main point I wish to make on

behalf  of  the professional people is that  this

socialist  Government, and a socialist government

must  encourage people to work, seems to pick  on

certain people and say to them, "You, I am  going

to  discourage. Why should you be allowed to work

without  paying the Government a tax?" Next  time

will  this Government charge the clerk a  fee  to

ply  his  work as a clerk? Where does this  stop,

Sir?  Once you break into the principle  that  in

order  to be permitted by the State to work,  you

must  before  you work pay the  State  a  tax  in

advance.  Once  that principle is forced  through

this   Legislature  by  the  present  Government,

particularly by a socialist Government,  what  is

there to prevent any other government from coming

along and saying, "Before you can be engaged as a

labourer, you must pay $3 or $5 per year."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is not private practice.

Clerks do not go into private practice!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Or if a clerk wants to work for

somebody else, is the Government going to  charge

him  a  fee? Once this principle of the right  to

work  without  being taxed by the  Government  is

abrogated,  and if that abrogation comes  from  a

socialist  Government, then I think I must  agree

with  the  Member for Hong Lim - when he  asks - what

kind  of a socialist Government is this? On  this

occasion, we are happily agreed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Friends!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, there are other aspects of this

Budget which I do not wish to touch upon at  this

time  because the time to debate it  is  limited,

but I will raise them in the Committee of Supply.



<br><br>7.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we have heard quite a great deal about what

many  Members of the Opposition have called,  and

especially  what  the Member  for  Hong  Lim  has

chosen to call, the so-called socialist P.A.P. We

have  also  heard  a  lot  of  rather  irrelevant

details, especially from the Member for Hong Lim,

all  on  nothing.  I  do not intend  to  go  into

details. I will only touch on general principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all claim that the P.A.P. Budget is not the

Budget of a socialist government. There are  many

types   of  socialist  governments  or  socialist

parties.  In  Singapore  alone  we  had   Lib-Soc

socialism, later on S.P.A. socialism, and we have

a  new addition, Hong Lim socialism. I wonder  if

they  understand what socialism really means,  or

what  a socialist economy really entails.  It  is

not my job here this evening to teach them, but I

feel obliged to enlighten people who have been so

ignorant  of  the greatest - at least  one  of  the

greatest,   if  not  the  greatest - of   political

philosophies in the modern world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me tell them how a socialist

government  goes  about the socialisation  of  an

economy that is essentially and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



basically capitalistic, especially in a  backward

and under-developed semi-independent country like

Singapore. For the benefit of the Members of  the

Opposition,  the basis of Socialist  construction

is  industrialisation. It should be plain even to

people  who  know  nothing about  economics  that

industrialisation   and   the   construction   of

factories  mean more jobs and more  opportunities

for  employment for the people, especially so  in

Singapore  which  has  limited  resources  and  a

rapidly  increasing  population  which  has  been

described  as  "explosive". You may notice,  Sir,

that  we  have recently held our family  planning

campaign  and,  of  course, the industrialisation

programme of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back, however, how do these countries

embark  on  industrialisation?  Let  us  look  at

history  a  little. Some countries  industrialise

through  plunder and the exploitation of colonies

through  decades and for ages. There  are  others

that  industrialise through the winning  of  wars

and  the  exacting of heavy reparations from  the

defeated   enemies.  Still  others  industrialise

through  leases  or  concessions  and  loans   in

enslaving terms. All this, Sir, Singapore  cannot

do.  It  leaves  only  for  us  to  go  back   to

industrialisation through our own efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how do Socialist countries industrialise

through  their own efforts? To industrialise  you

have first of all to need capital. And how do  we

get  that  capital? Let us look around again  and

find  out  how  certain Socialist  countries  get

their  capital.  The Communist countries  acquire

their  capital in various ways. First,  there  is

the   method  of  expropriation  of   lands   and

properties  and  the other means  of  production.

Then  there  is the method of nationalisation  of

key industries and other dictatorial methods that

will  provoke stubborn resistance or  even  armed

resistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the benefit of the Member for Hong Lim

(unfortunately  he  is  not  here),  the   P.A.P.

Government is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



Socialist  Government. It is not only a Socialist

Government but also a Government that believes in

constitutional   advance  through   parliamentary

democracy.  In other words, the P.A.P. Government

is  a Government that believes in and carries out

democratic  Socialism. What do we do  in  such  a

case?  Can  we go about dictatorially  and  start

nationalisation  and  expropriation  of  all  the

capitalists?  Is that what some  of  the  Members

opposite  want? Do they know what that means?  It

will  only mean armed revolution, and the P.A.P.,

as we have very often repeated, abhors violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the only alternative to the P.A.P. Socialist

Government is to go about acquiring capital in  a

democratic  and constitutional way. Some  of  the

ways   are  by  saving  and  the  husbanding   of

resources, or by ensuring that there is no  waste

and  dissipation of whatever resources there  may

be, or by channelling these resources into useful

and  purposeful  projects,  and,  of  course,  by

calling  for  local loans. So in the  context  of

Singapore whose economy is entrepot and basically

capitalistic,  and whose economy is  also  linked

with  capitalist  countries of the  Western  bloc

through   external  trade,  it   becomes   doubly

difficult for a Socialist Government to go  about

socialising such an economy. Previous Governments

never did anything in the way of making provision

for   the   employment  of  our  fast   expanding

population that come out from our schools. It has

to  be left to the P.A.P. Government to plan  for

industrialisation,  so that  all  the  people  of

Singapore   may   have  a   chance   of   gainful

employment. As has often been repeated, Sir,  the

fruits  of  toil never fall down from heaven.  We

have  to  work  hard and toil for whatever  fruit

that we can get. The P.A.P. Government is at  the

present  moment  embarking on  a  most  difficult

experiment  of democratic Socialism in Singapore.

It  should be the aim and hope of each and  every

one of us to see this experiment succeed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Opposition Members have said that

we  go for class ideology. Some of them say  that

we  are not Socialists, not left enough. Let them

all  realise  that we, as democratic  Socialists,

are  working  democratically and constitutionally

to lay a foundation for the final objective of  a

society  that  will give the maximum satisfaction

to all our cultural and material requirements. In

our  present Budget, it is absolutely untrue that

the  poor has been taxed. Anyone who is worth his

salt knows that the introduction of earned income

is a special move to help the working man. Sir, I

support the Budget unreservedly.



<br><br>7.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is  the  second  Budget presented  by  the People's  Action Party Government, and framed  in

the  light  of the last Government's  experience.

You  will remember, Sir, that the Prime Minister,

in  his speech during the debate on the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's  Speech, described  the  second

year of office of the P.A.P. Government as a year

of  construction. This fact is well reflected  in

the  Budget which was presented to this  Assembly

by the Minister for Finance last week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget makes provision for considerable

expansion  in  the field of social  services  and

industrial development. Sir, it can be seen  that

the  P.A.P.  Government  is  resolved  to  pursue

vigorously  its  policy of industrial  expansion.

Industrialisation  is  for  Singapore  the   only

available    means   of   providing    employment

opportunities  for our growing young  population.

The  economic  basis  of  Singapore  has  to   be

modified from that of a commercial entrepot to an

industrial  one. Even with the rate of  expansion

which    can    be   expected   in    Singapore's

international trade, there will not be enough  of

new   jobs   for  the  vast  numbers   of   young

Singaporeans  who  are  coming  into  the  labour

market year by year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary planning for a five-year

development plan is now going on in the  Ministry

of Finance, and we can expect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



to see a detailed plan published early in the new

year.  We  hope,  Sir, that  with  the  continued

stability   in   Singapore   under   the   P.A.P.

Government,  more and more foreign  capital  will

find  its  way into Singapore and supplement  our

own efforts at industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side with our proposals to bring about

an  industrial economy, the Government will  also

have  to  take  into  account  the  necessity  to

maintain  and  improve the  highest  standard  of

social services available for our people, and the

programme  both  in the fields of  education  and

health  is enormous. The funds available  to  the

Government,  Sir,  have to  be  well  apportioned

among the departments of Government which provide

these social services. The continued expansion of

educational  facilities,  building  schools   and

employing  teachers and the expansion  of  health

services in the rural and city areas call  for  a

high rate of capital investment. The expansion of

these facilities, Sir, also makes heavy demand on

the existing Government machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen from the Budget that the

Government  has  almost  achieved  its   aim   of

abolishing   the   cumbersome  local   government

machinery and incorporating most of the functions

of  the  former  City Council  into  the  Central

Government.  It can be expected, Sir,  that  when

this  process  of  integration is  completed,  it

would facilitate the provision of social services

to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also noticed, Mr Speaker, that during

the  last  twelve months the Government has  made

considerable   progress   in   regard   to    the

organisation   of  community  associations.   The

People's Association has now co-ordinated  social

services   and   is   also   taking   over    the

administration of community centres.  As  regards

public assistance, we hope that as more and  more

jobs  become  available to  our  population,  the

Government can bring about some reduction in  the

amount of money that is now being spent to assist

the unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is obvious that to bring about the

proposed expansion in the spheres of industry and

social services, certain adjustments will have to

be made to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



existing  tax  structure.  Every  proposal,  Sir,

which  was presented by the Minister for  Finance has  been  well received. The additional  revenue

which  is required to implement our programme  of

expansion  will have to come from  these  revenue

proposals. As the Minister has pointed out,  Sir,

we  still  remain one of the most  lightly  taxed

countries in the world. The Government has  given

consideration  to the necessity of spreading  out

the  effects  of these new taxes as equitably  as

possible.  As  a  Socialist Government,  Sir,  we

believe in the principle that the heaviest burden

must rest on the strongest shoulders. At the same

time, we should be on our guard. Will these taxes

in  any way kill the incentive without which  our

development plans cannot proceed? As  the  result

of  the  stringent economic policy of the  P.A.P.

Government during the last 12 months, we are  now

in  the  happy  position where the  Minister  for

Finance  has  indicated  the  readiness  of   the

Government to consider the question of  restoring

in  part  the variable allowances which were  cut

soon  after we took office. I have no doubt, Sir,

that  as  Singapore proceeds along  the  road  to

prosperity, our civil servants will  be  able  to

get  back as much of their variable allowance  as

the finances of the State would permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, Sir, presents yet another milestone

in   the  P.A.P.  Government's  progress  towards

achieving its long-term objective, which was made

public  in  our  election manifesto.  It  is  the

responsibility  of  the  present  Government   to

ensure that during the next 3½ years, they will

have  made some progress towards achieving a more

equal  and just society. The people of Singapore,

Sir,  I am sure, would not grudge such sacrifices

and  such  extra effort as would be  required  of

them.



<br><br>8.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I fully support the

Government's financial policy as presented by the Minister for Finance. A genuine government is one

that presents facts to the people and not put  in

something  which  is ambiguous; neither  does  it

give an estimate which is full of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



theories, because the Government side is not full

of  theoreticians  as claimed by  the  Opposition

side. They also claimed to be Socialists. But  we

do not know what kind of socialists they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have heard a lot of things, especially from those Members who have put up

many  questions asking for elucidation  from  the

Minister  for Finance. There are also  those  who

attack  us. But, unfortunately, when we start  to

give  elucidation, we find that the seats on  the

Opposition side are empty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to speak at length on this matter, because what has been expressed by

the  Minister for Finance is clear. But  I  would

like  to  touch on the subject mentioned  by  the

Member  for  Mountbatten relating to  the  things

that  were  perpetrated by  the  ex-Minister  for

National  Development regarding  the  S.I.T.  She

said  that  had  the  former  Minister  not  been

expelled  the mismanagement would have  continued

until today. This is most misleading, because the

Government is aware of it. The Singapore  Housing

and  Development Board was established in January

this  year, a few months before the expulsion  of

the  ex-Minister  for National Development.  This

indicates that the Government is always aware  of

the  interests  of the people of  Singapore,  and

that  it  will always do all it can in its  power

for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I should not mention this matter, but the Member for Kampong Kembangan has in his

review   of   the   Government   economising   on

expenditure taken the opportunity to challenge or

accuse the P.A.P. Government. He has stated  that

the  P.A.P. organ challenged U.M.N.O. Members  in

this  Assembly to resign their seats and  contest

the     by-elections    in    their    respective

constituencies.  This  is  most  confusing,   Mr

Speaker, Sir. We have never issued a challenge to

anybody, because we know that it is no use.  What

actually happened is that the U.M.N.O. Members in

this  Assembly were challenged by other  U.M.N.O.

members,  who  were faithful to the directive  of

Tunku  Abdul  Rahman, the President of  U.M.N.O.,

Malaya.   The   domestic  crisis   in   U.M.N.O.,

therefore,  should  not  be  mixed  up  with  the

affairs of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  also seized the opportunity,  when  he

touched  on the estimated budget for the Ministry

of Culture, to sing old tunes regarding what took

place between myself and the Minister for Health.

Actually, after the incident, I was approached by

a  number  of officials, especially the President

of   the  Literary  and  Language  Congress,  who

expressed their regret at the Member for  Kampong

Kembangan  touching on the question  of  culture,

because they felt that cultural matters should be

left to cultural bodies and organisations to deal

with  and should be looked after by those  people

who   are  really  in  the  know  about  cultural

matters.  Mr  Speaker, the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan said that the Government, in the course

of  carrying out cultural works, should force the

people to practise a Malayan culture based on the

concept   of  the  Government.  It  is  not   our

intention to force something on anybody. But  the

responsibility of a government is to  give  every

encouragement to the people so that they may have

self-respect for the various cultures that are to

be found in Singapore, with a view to creating  a

Malayan culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan also accused

the  Government of ignoring the special  position

of  the  Malays  as embodied in the Constitution.

Mr  Speaker,  I  feel I can ask  this  question:

During the four years of the coalition Government

led  by  Tun Lim Yew Hock and his colleagues,  to

what  extent had they gone to help the Malays  as

compared  with  the efforts carried  out  by  the

socialist P.A.P. Government towards the Malays? I

would  like  to reiterate that the memorandum  of

the  Malay  Education Council, submitted  to  the

Coalition  Government  of  U.M.N.O.,  M.C.A. and

Labour  Front in 1950, was put into cold  storage

until  1957. The P.A.P. Government never practise

that  method  with  reference to  any  particular

demand submitted by the Malays, because it is our

policy  to give all assistance to the Malays  who

have    been   ignored   by   previous   colonial

governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have observed that many

Opposition Members have moved amendments  to  the

Head, Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



Education.  I  have  no doubt that  the  Minister

concerned could explain the position. The  Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan said that the  Government

provided  low-cost houses at the expense  of  the

economy  of the Malays. Mr Speaker, the question

of  drawing up a plan for the economic uplift  of

the  Malays is not an easy task. Mr Speaker, our

help  to  the  Malays  is based  on  giving  them

education,  because it is through education  that

their  economic  and  living  standards  will  be

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that my brief elucidation will clear up

the  confusion  caused by persons in  responsible

positions who make political capital out  of  the

so-called  special  position of  the  Malays,  as

though  the present Government is neglecting  the

Constitution. We believe in deeds, and I am  sure

that  what we have done for the Malays will prove

this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier this evening the House

was  given  a  very  short entertainment  by  the

Member for Tanglin when in his speech in which he

fought  strongly for the partial  restitution  of

variable  allowances for the civil  servants  and

aided teachers, he made the statement that should

he  get  a restitution he would donate it to  the

unemployed. It is, I think, public news that  the

Member  for  Tanglin will have retired  from  the

education service in three weeks' time;  so  that

it  is  very likely that he will not receive  any

partial  restitution  of the  variable  allowance

because  it  will  only  be  effective  in  1961.

Therefore, he will be making a contribution which

would not-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Be retrospective!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> - materialise. And probably

he  would  be in need of it then should  it  come

about. Regarding his argument that if there is  a

surplus  in the Government budget for  the  year,

such a surplus should go back to those members of

the  public service who were affected by the  cut

in  the variable allowances, I am afraid that  he

fails   to   realise  that  the   Government   is

responsible to the people not on an annual  basis

but   rather  on  a  long-term  basis.   If   the

Government has not been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



able to cut down its expenditure - especially  the

annually  recurrent expenditure for a  number  of

social  services for the State - that sum of  money

which  is available should not be frittered  away

but should be set aside either to reserves or  be

ploughed  back  for the purpose  of  development,

that  is, for the future prosperity of the State.

So  if  there have been surpluses for  the  years

1959  and  1960,  these sums of  money  would  be

needed for the industrialisation programme of the

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this evening, the Member for Hong Lim

was talking loudly about company tax, and he went

even  as  far as to say that the present  company

tax  was  no tax at all. You will remember,  Sir,

that  I stood up and put a question to the Member

for  Hong  Lim - who  is not in the  House  at  the

moment -  whether  as a practising  accountant  he

seriously meant that companies, in fact,  do  not

pay tax. His answer, which is typical of him, was

a  passing insinuation that I did not know what I

was talking about. I do not profess, Sir, to be a

practising  accountant, but  I  think  I  know  a

little about accounts and income tax laws.  I  am

afraid  the Member for Hong Lim is not  quite  an

accountant and I fear for the clients who  go  to

him  for such service if he cannot interpret  the

income  tax  law for their benefit. According  to

the Laws of the State, Chapter 166 on Income Tax,

Part  XIII - Rates of Tax, Rights of Deduction  and

Allowances for Tax Charged, section 43 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of section 40 of this

Ordinance there shall be levied and paid for each

year of assessment upon the chargeable income of-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every company tax at the rate of forty per

centum  on  every dollar of  the  chargeable

income thereof.'



<br><br>What  happens  is  this. Before arriving  at  the

payment  of dividends, a company will be  charged

tax on its profits. Let us say that a company has

made a profit of a million dollars; then the  tax

would be $400,000. It is left to the company then

to  decide on the rate of dividend which it would

like to pay to its shareholders. I am afraid that

the Member for Hong Lim has somehow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



got   confused  with  the  question  of  tax   on

dividends  which  the  company  is  permitted  to

deduct  but which it will hold in trust  for  the

Government.  That is referred to in  section  44,

the  next  section  to the section  I  have  just

quoted, where it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every company which is resident in Singapore

shall  be  entitled to deduct from the amount  of

any  dividend paid to any shareholder tax at  the

rate  of forty per centum on every dollar of such

dividend.'



<br><br>Therefore, if the company should make  a  million

dollars  profit,  it  is  taxed  to  the  sum  of

$400,000.  If  the company wishes  to  declare  a

dividend  equivalent, say,  to  $100,000  to  its

shareholders, then it is entitled to pay out  the

net  sixty per cent and hold back forty per  cent

for   which  it  will  have  to  account  to  the

Government under section 44 (3) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At the end of each year of assessment every

such  company  shall render to the Comptroller  a

statement  in  such form as the  Comptroller  may

direct, showing the total amount of the tax which

has been deducted from all dividends...'.



<br><br>And  this  sum is accountable to the Comptroller.

Therefore, far from not knowing what I am talking

about,  I am afraid that the Member for Hong  Lim

who  professes to be an accountant does not  know

what he is talking about. May I now refer to page

3   of  the  Annual  Report  of  the  Income  Tax

Department,  1958,  which  was  tabled  in   this

Assembly on 30th December, 1959? It reads:



<br><br><div align="center">`Section 3. -REVENUE</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue collected and paid into the Consolidated

Fund totalled $81,428,695.'



<br><br>Lower down the page, it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(b) Allocation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax assessed for 1958 up to 31st March, 1959, amounted to approximately $85½ million.'



<br><br>Then  there  is  a sort of summary  which  states

"Companies  ... Resident and Non-resident"  which

came  up  to  68 per cent tax collected  for  the

State.  So,  far  from  there  being  no  tax  on

companies, the companies are paying 68  per  cent

of  the tax received by the State. I think I will

have  to  request my colleague the  Minister  for

Finance  to look into the accounts of the clients

of  the  Member for Hong Lim as to  whether  they

have been fiddled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the point raised by the

Member   for   Hong  Lim - who  is  absent - on   the

development plan of the Ministry of Education  as

being  a  Ministry without any plan  at  all.  He

mentioned the fact that in January 1960, when  he

was  the  Minister for National  Development,  he

asked  the  Director of Public  Works  about  the

development  plan of the Ministry  of  Education,

and  he  got an answer that there was  none.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, this gives me an opportunity to say

a   few  words  about  the  former  Minister  for

National  Development. Soon  after  I  came  into

office,  I  got wind of his tendency to  what  is

called  "a  land  grab".  As  the  Minister   for

National  Development, he was in  charge  of  the

Land Office and construction, and every available

piece  of  land was grabbed by his department  of

course   for  the  purpose  of  building  houses,

because  he  was also in charge of the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust.  Well, the  people  concerned

with  an  aided  school known as  St.  Margaret's

School came to see me. They said that acquisition

of a piece of land which was allotted to them for

the  purpose  of building a new school  had  been

turned  down  by the S.I.T. on the  pretext  that

that  land  was  to be used for the  building  of

houses. I decided not to take action then because

this  was land which was partly to be used  as  a

playing  field, and I felt that perhaps  the

ex-Minister  for  National  Development  was  really

desperately in need of land. After a few  months,

I  had another complaint from my officials that a

piece  of  land in Selegie Road/Short Street  was

being  frozen  also for the purpose  of  building

flats. This time I decided to take action, and  I

had  a reply from his junior officer. In fact,  I

wrote  a  personal letter to the ex-Minister  and

asked  him  for a discussion, and this supposedly

colleague of mine did not even have the  courtesy

to  reply to my letter but instructed his  junior

officer  to write to me to say that such a  thing

did  not  take place. A few months later,  I  had

occasion  to  tick him off over the telephone.  I

said  that  he should write a letter of  apology,

which  he did. It just shows that If there was  a

lack  of  building activity during the time  when

the  Member  for  Hong Lim was the  Minister  for

National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



Development,  it  was due to his stranglehold  on

every  Ministry except his own, that there should

be  nothing  coming  up except  what  he  thought

should  be built. For example, he had a  fanciful

idea of building $450 million worth of houses for

the  State  of Singapore. That was  all  a

pipe-dream. The statement was unauthorised and he  did

not  even have the decency and the courage to say

that  he  released  it. Instead,  he  blamed  the

pressmen  for  having got something  out  of  him

without  authority. Far from there being no  plan

for  the  development  of  schools,  there  is  a

concerted   drive,  as  stated  in   the   Budget

Statement made by the Minister for Finance,  that

the  1961 Development Plan is in accordance  with

the   Five-Year   Development  Plan   which   all

Ministries were asked to bring together before-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> No, I will not give way. We

are now building schools with the co-operation of

the  Ministry of National Development. It was not

so  in  the past. We never got that in the  past.

The  Plan envisages 19 new schools each year:  14

primary  and 5 secondary schools. We go according

to  plan  and  we work in co-operation  with  one

another - no  more  the  failure  nor  the   dismal

exhibition of the Member for Hong Lim when he was

the Minister for National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Farrer Park.

Unfortunately, he is also not here. He  spoke  on

the  new  tax  which the Government  proposes  to

introduce  for  the professional workers  and  he

said  that  the  right  to  work  should  not  be

fettered. The Budget of this Government for  1961

does take into account the socialist principle of

encouraging  every  citizen  to  work   for   his

livelihood.  That is why for this  year  we  have

introduced a 20 per cent relief for earned income

up to a maximum of $1,000. This will take care of

the  majority  of  the salaried workers  who,  as

single persons, will get the equivalent of $5,000

per annum. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



that, I think, takes into account the majority of

those  who are in the lower-middle class  outside

the net for income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, as I have said

earlier on when commenting on what the Member for

Tanglin  had  to  say, the Government  is  to  be

judged not on a year-to-year Budget alone but  at

the  same time on its development plans  for  the

future.  It will be seen that our plan  envisages

the expenditure of $876 million, vide Hansard  of

29th November, 1960, Volume 14 No. 1, column  41.

It is the intention of the Government to spend as

capital  expenditure the fantastic  sum  of  $876

million,  of which $500 million will be from  our

own  efforts, and we hope to bridge  the  gap  of

$376  million  either  from  overseas  loans   or

assistance from overseas. It is only by ploughing

back all that we have (all our surpluses) that we

will  be  able  to build a base  for  the  future

prosperity  of the State. And therefore  I  fully

support the Budget proposed by my colleague,  the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br>8.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last few hours we

have   had  different  views  expressed  by   the

Opposition  about the Budget policy  outlined  by

the Minister for Finance. For example, the Member

for  Tanglin thinks that the Budget is too  Left,

that  it  stresses too much on class  issues  and

that   it  holds  no  lolly  for  the  well-to-do

gentlemen  with  whom  obviously  he   has   been

hobnobbing  and whose views have been transmitted

to us during the course of his speech. The Member

for  Cairnhill takes a rather confused  view.  On

the  one  hand,  he thinks we are  not  socialist

enough, and on the other hand, he thinks  we  are

too  socialistic in our approach and,  therefore,

frightened off our investors. The Member for  Joo

Chiat  also  thinks that this is not a  socialist

Budget.   The  Member  for  Farrer  Park,   after

congratulating  the  Minister  for  Finance   for

producing an excellent Budget, goes on to express

doubts  about the validity of some of  the  taxes

which have been imposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can sympathise with the hon. Members

opposite over their predicament when dealing with

the  Budget  policy outlined by the Minister  for

Finance.  They have to play a role which  becomes

increasingly  awkward  and  tedious   with   each

passing  day.  Their predicament  is  this:  they

tried  very hard before the elections to convince

the  people that the P.A.P. Government must bring

terror,  chaos, strife, and economic misery,  and

that  there must be a gradual decline of business

and trade. That was what they solemnly stated  in

the newspapers. They swore to the electorate that

if they elected a P.A.P. Government, these things

must  come  about. Fortunately the  converse  has

been true. They know it, as you can judge by  the

demeanour of the Opposition Members, who  do  not

look   frightened  or  impoverished,   and   they

certainly look with confidence to the future. But

politically   they   have   to   maintain    this

pretence - that  there must be  chaos,  oppression,

and  terror. So the less true the myth that  they

propagated during the elections becomes, the more

difficult  it  is for them to try to  whip  up  a

feeling  of  pretence that there is  uncertainty,

and  oppression  and  that the  people  are  more

miserable  than they were before. So  today  they

have tried to present the Budget as an oppressive

and unfair one. But is it oppressive or unfair?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance made it quite

clear   in   his   Budget  statement   that,   in

formulating its Budget, the P.A.P. Government has

certain social and political purposes behind  it.

Briefly,  these  revolve  around  two  questions.

First,  the Budget is formulated with a  view  to

expanding  the economy, and, secondly,  to  bring

about  greater social and economic justice. These

are  the two social goals aimed at in the  Budget

policy  outlined by the Minister.  In  the  past,

there  have  been  governments  which  had   also

declared these aims, but because they were either

controlled   by   colonial   officials   or   - by

representatives of vested interests, the  Budgets

that   they   designed - though  they  might   have

proclaimed  admirable intentions - were,  in  fact,

deigned to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



protect the interests of those classes which  had

control  of the government. Nobody can  say  that

this   Government  has  either  colonial   vested

interests  or  representatives of wealth  in  its

midst,  and therefore we have no reason to defend

the  interests either of colonialism or of vested

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that not many of us like to pay

tax.  If  we could avoid paying taxes,  we  would

certainly try to do so. But the first question to

ask here is are these taxes necessary? The answer

to  that  question will depend on what  uses  the

taxes  would be put to. If we have an inefficient

government  or a government composed of  men  who

are  more interested in filling their pockets and

setting  up  enterprises in other  parts  of  the

world,  or  men who work for and in the interests

of  a  privileged minority, then all taxes become

oppressive  because  they  would  be   used   for

strengthening   an   inefficient,   corrupt   and

reactionary government. But where taxes are  used

responsibly to expand the economy, to  make  life

better for the people, to ensure a more equitable

distribution of wealth and opportunities for  the

people,  then taxes cease to be an imposition  on

the  people because the taxes will eventually  be

returned  to  the  people in  the  form  of  more

schools,  more hospitals, better social services,

an  expanding economy, and opportunities for more

jobs.  Therefore, the thing to do is not  to  ask

whether the tax is good or bad, but to judge  the

goodness or badness of the tax by asking to  what

use  would the money collected from taxes be put.

Are  they going to be spent on enriching selected

individuals,   either  inside  or   outside   the

government, or is the money going to be  used  to

enrich  the material and cultural wealth  of  the

people?  But  I  know, Sir, that  the  Opposition

cannot afford to ask these questions because,  if

they  have regard for facts, then they would know

that  these  monies are going to  be  transformed

into  services for the people. But they  have  to

keep  up this pretence of increasing misery under

a socialist government, and therefore they try to

exploit this natural disinclination of the people

not  to want to pay more taxes than is necessary.

Sir, they might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



say  that  these taxes are unnecessary  and  that

there is no need for these taxes; but during  the

course of the next year the same people will  get

up  and say, "What is the Government doing  about

building  more schools?"; "What is the Government

doing  about building more hospitals?"; "What  is

the  Government doing about providing more jobs?"

The  Government cannot produce all these by  just

introducing a Bill and saying that this Bill will

not  cost  the taxpayer any money.  To  do  these

things,  Government  needs revenue,  and  revenue

does not come out of the pockets of a government.

It has no private coffers, but it comes by way of

taxation.  And  therefore, even long  before  the

elections,  the P.A.P. has taken  the  view  that

prosperity,  expansion, and a better life  cannot

come  about  under the slogan of  "prosperity  by

shaking  legs". If you want prosperity, you  must

work  for  it. In fact, just before the elections

the  P.A.P. outlined its economic  proposals  in

which it is frankly stated: (a) that socialism is

not   possible  under  the  present  setup,   and

therefore all the doubts that have been expressed

about  this policy, that it is not 100  per  cent

socialist, are groundless. We have never  claimed

it  to be 100 per cent socialist. All we said was

that  we  shall try to do what we can to  rectify

such  injustices as may exist within the  present

framework.  And  that  is all  that  this  Budget

claims to do. And (b) that economic expansion and

reconstruction   in   Singapore   would    entail

sacrifices on the part of everyone, including the

workers. When that was published, I remember some

of  the  newspapers and Members of the Opposition

making  capital out of it. In fact, a  leader  of

one  Party who is no longer represented  in  this

Assembly  gave  a  long interview  to  the  Press

wherein  he said, "This shows that the P.A.P. is

not  fit to be a government because it enunciated

an  economic policy of what he called `policy  of

desperation'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We knew, and we frankly stated, that if we

wanted   prosperity,  everybody   had   to   make

sacrifices, from the wealthiest down to even  the

worker.  In the past, Singapore had been  built

on   the  sacrifices  of  many  people,  but  the

majority who made the sacrifices reaped only a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



small  fraction of the benefits, and  the  people

who  really benefited out of the sacrifices  made

by  the  community as a whole were the  minority.

But  under  the  P.A.P.  Government,  unlike  the

previous government, certainly this Budget  tries

to  put forward the view that if it is prosperity

that  is  wanted, then everybody has to pay;  and

the  sacrifice  will be distributed  fairly - those

who  are  better  off  will  have  to  make  more

contributions  to  the community's  coffers,  and

those  who  are not well off, less so. Therefore,

it  is  very  easy  to say,  "Why  put  up  these

taxes?",  "Why not go without taxes?".  In  fact,

Sir,  if  this  Government  were  mad,  it  could

perhaps  follow the implications or some  of  the

suggestions put forward, including those  of  the

Member  for Hong Lim who has said that taxes  are

unnecessary.  We could say that we will  dispense

with  all taxes for three or four years; that  we

can  all  make  whoopee, and perhaps  we  can  be

returned  under conditions where it will  not  be

necessary for, and perhaps there will not be,  an

Opposition.  We  could live on  our  capital;  we

could   disburse  rewards;  increase  everybody's

salaries;  free  housing,  free  schooling,  free

clothes, and even free food. That sort of  policy

is not one which the P.A.P. is willing to follow,

because we know that that will eventually end  in

misery  and  starvation. And all the things  that

would  come  about as implied by  the  Opposition

would be a situation of terror and starvation and

misery. We have always stated quite frankly  that

every advance is made through the efforts of  the

people, and these efforts include sacrifices  and

hard work. Because it is only in that way that we

can  show that the democratic system which we are

trying  to  establish can work. It is the  people

who  have  voted us in today - we have  transferred

political  power to the community as a  whole  on

the  principle of one man one vote. The  majority

of  them  are  underprivileged. They  live  in  a

society which has never given them a chance,  and

they  will be increasingly doubtful and resentful

of  the democratic system if we can offer them no

prospect and no future in the coming years.  That

is why we say we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



must  make  the  democratic system attractive  by

asking  everybody, and in particular the

better-off  classes, "You had better contribute  to  the

community's   coffers  to  ensure  that   social

justice  can  be  brought  about  peacefully  and

constitutionally. If you are not prepared to make

those sacrifices, especially you, the well-to-do,

then  the sacrifices might be imposed on  you  by

other more radical and more vigorous means."  The

contribution that everyone is making is really  a

kind  of  social and political insurance  against

the  wrath  of revolutionary violence. The  price

that  we  are asked to pay today is  not  at  all

oppressive.  Nobody has said that  the  insurance

premium,   as  it  were,  to  ensure   that   the

democratic   system   survives   is   all    that

oppressive.  So the Opposition has  to  make  the

pretence - they have lately been saying  that  they

have  carried out private Gallup polls where  the

people  said  that things had gone  from  bad  to

worse.  Let  me say this. If the P.A.P. economic

policy  succeeds, this is the consolation that  I

offer  them, though they might have  to  keep  up

this  pretence by saying that things are  getting

from  bad to worse - then the fears which they have

been  trying to inculcate remain largely a  thing

of  the imagination. But if it fails, then  I  am

afraid that this myth which they have been trying

to  propagate would become a reality, and  pursue

them  God knows to what nearest lamp-post. Social

justice can be brought about only by the well-off

classes,  so  let them be prepared  to  make  the

sacrifices.  There  is no  other  way.  In  fact,

though the Opposition Members have criticised the

Budget,   none  of  them  has  put   forward   an

alternative  to  the  policy  outlined   by   the

Minister for Finance. Therefore, I say that  this

is a small price that we have to pay for ensuring

that the democratic system survives, by making it

clear  to the majority of the people that  it  is

possible for us to get social justice under  this

society.



<br><br>8.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this is the second Budget  debate

since  the P.A.P. Government took office.  May  I

preface my remarks by the observation that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



every   Assembly,  every  Chamber,   acquires   a

character  of  its own? Politically speaking,  in

the  Singapore context, this Chamber  is  a  much

more  cynical and literate Chamber than the  last

one. We all make noises here not for the cut  and

thrust   of  debate,  but  for  the  radio,   the

newspapers,  our friends and supporters  outside.

We  put  forward  a  point of  view,  whether  we

believe in it or not; we shoot a line. Perhaps it

is  inevitable,  as  a  result  of  the  election

returns on the night of 31st May, 1959, that this

Chamber,  consisting  of  51  Members  who   were

returned on that day, will go down in the  annals

of  Singapore not as a debating Chamber but as  a

convenient  forum for declamation,  telling  lies

and,   in  some  cases,  downright  perfidy   and

untruth; all in the hope that in this vicious rat

race  for newspaper space, you can get your point

across and kill the other chap; to try and convey

an image to the public that you are a champion of

the  people when, in fact, you are no  more  than

just  a  scamp  or  a scallywag seeking  personal

power  and  glory; or to paint your  enemy  as  a

wicked, reactionary and treacherous man who  sold

out on his promises, either to win support or  to

deny  it to his opponents. All of us know in this

respect that we are more sophisticated, including

our  dear  Member  for Tanglin. His  predecessors

umpteen  years  ago  in the  Chamber  across  the

street  in  the  Victoria Memorial  Hall,  to  my

recollection,  were  of a  different  vein.  They

played  up to the gallery in the Chamber  and  to

respect,  I  think  we must face  the  fact  that

granted the system of one man one vote, then  we

are   not  interested  in  what  the  other  chap

opposite  thinks. But the effect is different  on

the  thinking  of men away from the  Chamber  who

read  two, three or four paragraphs or maybe  one

headline, or even half a caption. Therefore,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, while we are trying to maintain the

best  traditions of the parliamentary  system  of

open encounter in a debating Chamber, let us  not

delude ourselves that anybody is really seriously

interested in making an impression in this  House

as  against making an impression in the  country.

Therefore, for that reason, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



Member   for   Hong  Lim  fighting   bare-fisted,

continued reading his speech. He said he had  the

figures.  I called him many things in many  other

places, where there was no privilege, without ill

result  to myself. But Mr Speaker, Sir, when  we

develop  our traditions and the rules of  debate,

let  us remember that if we do not modify and fit

them  to  our  circumstances,  as  the  rules  of

Westminister were fitted for the circumstances of

another country, and at a different time, then we

shall  only  let  ourselves be made  use  of  for

purposes   for  which  this  Chamber   is   never

intended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those preliminary remarks, Sir, may I go on

to   say  that,  although  we  have  become  more

sophisticated and hard-boiled politically,  I  do

not  believe  that  we have thereby  become  more

adept   at  working  the  democratic  system   of

periodic mandates from the people on the basis of

one  man one vote. For the major premise  of  the

successful operation of that system postulates an

intelligent Opposition, intelligent not  only  in

their  immediate self-interest but also in  their

long-term  self-interest,  the  interest  of  not

bringing the House down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have since half-past two this afternoon

listened through a series of declamation. I would

say that it contributed nothing, not one iota, to

the  people's  understanding of what  the  Budget

meant.  The  Member  for  Joo  Chiat,  with   his

grievous concern for businessmen, his friends and

colleagues  who  keep on telling  that  they  are

losing money and that the world is getting greyer

and  greyer, had nothing to say. The  Member  for

Geylang  Serai was speaking back.  I  think  this

must have been a special occasion for him - for  he

spoke  in English today and tried to live  up  to

what he thought one of the leaders of a secondary

party  in  the Opposition should do  on  such  an

occasion.  And I congratulate him for  trying  to

make the effort and play this role, and keep  the

system  that  we  want  to  preserve  going   and

ticking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Member for Tanglin could not

help  himself. He honestly believed - I had a  word

with him outside; I did not want to interrupt him

or make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



him unhappy - and he said that Hugh Dalton's theory

supported him in the belief, that because we  cut

down  the  civil servants' allowances,  therefore

the   currency  circulation  of  Singapore,   the

Federation and Borneo was stagnating at 1,000 odd

million  dollars  and, therefore,  that  was  the

reason for the general slump. Had we not cut down

the  civil  servants' salaries, there would  have

been a boom generated here, in the Federation and

in  Borneo. I thought he had made a mistake, that

he  believed the figures given for currency  were

only  confined  to Singapore. But he  said  that,

being  a  meticulous man who carefully  read  his

facts and figures, he knew that they covered  the

whole  of Borneo and the Federation, and he  was

convinced that the chain reaction-



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I did not want to go

into  details to explain that there was  a  slump

here.  But  the prosperity in the Federation  and

Borneo  balanced it up. The circulation  was  the

same.  Otherwise,  Sir, if there  had  also  been

another   slump  in  the  Federation,  then   the

position would have been different.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We never cease to be

surprised  in  this  Chamber by  the  Member  for

Tanglin.   I  did  a  little  bit  of  elementary

economics, and I would like to show him  that  if

money  was circulating in the Federation  and  in

Borneo,    then   prices   would   have    fallen

catastrophically because there was a shortage  of

money  in  Singapore. I thought he was  bemoaning

the  fact that salaries went down without  prices

going  up. However that may be, I thought  it  is

rather  a  quixotic gesture his saying,  "I  will

give  whatever I get to charity. You  know  I  am

resigning, and retiring at the end of this year."

This  is  the  sort  of thing that  gladdens  our

hearts,   to   know  that  we  have  a   generous

bighearted   Opposition.  The   leader   of   the

Opposition has been through so many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



things in the long years since 1948, that I think

it  is  impossible for him now to take  a  simple

straight  and upright stand. He is now back  with

the  group  that he started with. He  started  by

working with capitalist firms. He was decried by

the people, so he resigned-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

Prime   Minister  was  in  the  Chamber  when   I

indicated   that  I  was  trying  to   stop   all

personalities of that nature. Let us go  straight

on to the general principles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed, Sir. What I wanted

to  convey was the tremendous ease with which  he

could  go  through the contortions of a  complete

circle   and  come  back  to  where  he   started

from - back to the Member for Farrer Park  and  the

Member  for  Tanglin who were once his  political

opponents.  They  now wind up  as  his  political

colleagues,  friends and mentors.  What  does  he

really  believe  in? He is anti the  professional

tax. Why? The Member for Farrer Park has given  a

series  of  reasons.  I am sure  the  Member  for

Cairnhill really does not know why, but he has to

be  anti  something. He is anti the  professional

tax. We have not taxed the poor, so he is against

our  taxing the professions. He says he  supports

the  income tax increase but not the decrease  in

the allowances. Then the sly lie that we are more

friendly  to  capital. Sir,  we  want  to  create

confidence. The hon. Member knows just as well as

we  do that what we have to face in Singapore all

these  years  is  not  just to  be  friends  with

capital,  because that is not going to  help  the

situation.  But  we  have to  devise  within  our

limited  situation  a  balance  whereby  we   can

convince the workers that in this situation  they

have  the  best possible deal; and  at  the  same

time,  to ensure that the best possible deal  for

the workers does not kill the goose that lays the

golden egg. The hon. Member tried, but he did not

succeed  in convincing the workers that they  got

the   best  possible  deal.  He  convinced   the

employer. Indeed I suppose the bosses in Tay  Koh

Yat and Hock Lee were convinced that that was the

way, to ensure that business went on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



But that is not our way of bringing confidence to

people with capital. My postulation is that  even

if  a  person with capital had nothing but

self-interest at heart, then he would be interested in

seeing,   not   that  he  alone  is   given   the

confidence, and that the worker is kept down, but

that  both should be, and the system, kept  going

until such time as there is a major change in the

surrounding  circumstances. We must  ensure  that

the  worker is given a fair deal to his knowledge

and  to his satisfaction, so that an armed revolt

to change the social order never takes place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Farrer Park is, I think, the

least  hard-boiled  of all  the  Members  on  the

Opposition   benches.   He   has   unloaded   his

conscience  of what he believes should  be  said,

and  he therefore feels that he has done his  job

as  leader  of  an Opposition Party  by  bringing

across  the  point  of view which  he  thinks  he

represents. May I first dispose of his one  major

point in the whole speech really relating to this

Budget, and that is the professional tax? He says

the  right to work should never be taxed.  Nobody

is  trying  to tax the right to work.  Nobody  is

trying  to  tell  the  lawyer,  doctor,  dentist,

accountant, engineer, or structural engineer that

he  should not work. But we know that in a  given

social  order  these self-employable  professions

are  lucrative ones; that if there  is  an  extra

million  and  a  bit to be paid,  they  can  well

afford  to pay it. I say, without any hesitation,

that  if we are to appreciate that amount of give

and  take  which is necessary to the  running  of

this  kind  of  social order,  then  we  must  be

prepared  not to be dogmatic but to be  practical

in   the  circumstances  obtaining.  We  are  not

talking of a socialist Britain where almost every

schoolboy  has the right to be a lawyer,  doctor,

dentist  or engineer, because he has a completely

free  education sustained by the State  from  the

primary  school  to  the university.  We  have  a

different social order here. If you want to be  a

lawyer,  doctor,  dentist or engineer,  then  the

odds  are that you are one of the very few  lucky

scholars  of the State, or you have a  father  or

mother sufficiently wealthy to pay for it.  These

are  privileged professions. You cannot  practise

as a lawyer unless you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



are   qualified  and  unless  the  Bar  Committee

empowered   by   the  Advocates  and   Solicitors

Ordinance says that you can practise. This is the

monopoly we are giving to certain professions. It

is the same with the doctors and the dentists.  I

cannot practise as a dentist by just learning how

to  drill holes in a tooth and how to pull  teeth

out.  If  I  do,  I  will be  sent  to  gaol  for

breaching the Ordinance governing who can and who

cannot  practise  as  a dentist.  In  this  given

situation, therefore, we say that these  are  the

group  of  people  fortunately  endowed  in   the

present  social order to pay the extra  bit.  The

Member  for  Farrer Park thought  that  $500  per

annum   or   $125  per  quarter - it  sounds   more

drastic - is too much. Sir, he did not say  it  was

too much for him. He was spilling a few tears for

those who would come after him. Well, if that  is

so,  then  we will wait and see what it  is  like

from  the  income  tax  returns,  including   the

returns from the young lawyers, doctors, dentists

and  so  on.  We  are quite confident  that  this

professional tax is just a flea-bite. If it comes

to  that,  they are the people who  have  special

privileges.  In  the Supreme  Court  there  is  a

special Bar room for lawyers to change. It is

air-conditioned at the expense of the State. They are

not  charged for it. And there are lots of  other

parks.   They  go  to  courts  which   are

air-conditioned  now  in order that they  can  better

discharge their duties. It is the same  with  the

doctors. They have hospitals, ambulances on  tap,

and  laboratories  to tell them  what  particular

vaccine  is  required  to  kill  what  particular

bacilli. On principle, in this situation,  I  say

this  levying of a professional tax is definitely

a  progressive move. You are getting  money  from

the  people who can pay. It would be much easier,

of  course, for the Minister for Finance to  slip

in  a  10  cent  tax on every pair  of  shoes  or

umbrella  or  frying pan. Nobody would  feel  it.

After  all,  hon. Members opposite will  buy  one

frying  pan each probably once in every three  or

four  years. Lots of other people would  want  to

buy  frying  pans. But we do not want to  collect

money  that way. If this is not socialism, it  is

at least a little bit of social conscience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park then went on to make

another point. He said a few nice things. Usually

it  is  done by any practised advocate. One  says

nice  things  in  order that one can  destroy.  A

brilliant   group  of  Ministers,  but   terribly

practical  and realistic. Sir, we are accused  of

having  failed  because we have not  managed  the

civil service. We have lost the confidence of the

people. There is uncertainty in Singapore.  There

is   economic   stagnation.  The   situation   is

generally  depressed. I could not  help  thinking

that  we  would individually have all  been  much

better off and probably leading happier and  less

burdensome  lives,  if we had  made  a  different

decision  before the elections and had  for  some

reason  or other decided not to contest  to  win.

The  only consolation I have is that it would not

have  been as it is today. They never had  it  so

good.  Not since 1955 has there been a government

which   has   established   confidence   in   the

employers.  We  are not interested  in  employers

alone, but we are interested in creating a system

which  is  just  fair,  honest,  above-board  and

likely  to  endure because it is fair, clean  and

honest.  That  makes  a  big  difference  to  our

future.   I  do  not  pretend,  Sir,  that   this

Government  exists  for the  benefit  of  keeping

employers  happy, but if it is necessary  in  the

interests of the people as a whole to ensure that

employers  are  not destroyed  or  taxed  out  of

existence, then we have the courage to  stand  up

and  see that balances are maintained, regardless

of what tortured unbalanced minds may try to make

out of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, eight new taxes were listed by the Minister

for  Finance. I would have thought that he  would

have  taxed to the limit of human ingenuity, that

he  would have tried to make out that here was  a

Government  out to tax the poor,  not  the  rich.

Property    tax    and    assessment,    business

registrations,  stamp duty, increased  assessment

on  rubber  estates, increased rates  on  private

lotteries,  fees  for  the  practice  of  certain

professions,  passenger  tax  on  embarking   air

travellers,  decrease  in the  rate  of  personal

allowances on income tax, increase in the maximum

rate  of  tax on personal income, and  a  special

allowance for earned income.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



Only  a tortured and sick mind would try and read

into  this  an  attempt to help  colonial  vested

interests,  to tax the poor to help the  European

companies which did not vote us in, and  in  whom

we  are  not interested. For what earthly ghastly

reason?   As  the  odds  become  more  and   more

difficult for those who have found themselves out

on  a lonely limb, it is not unlikely that as  we

go  on, more and more fantastic allegations  will

be  made,  but  not for the purposes  of  winning

support in this debating Chamber, because nobody,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  with no disrespect  to  your

august   position,  wants  really  to  win   your

support.  It  would be flattering to  know  that,

amongst the many thousands of people outside, Mr

Speaker, Sir, there are many who believe that the

policy  one is expounding is fair and  just.  One

has  to  be  sufficiently cynical  to  understand

that. The play of the system of one man one  vote

in  this  given  situation leads gradually  to  a

debasement  in  some  cases  where  integrity  of

political purpose and principles are lacking,  to

a  complete debasement of everything and anything

worth  valuing  in  any  society - things  such  as

truth, honesty and decency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after one past sitting, I have had

occassion  to  say in no uncertain terms  outside

this  Chamber what I thought of people  here  who

behaved in this way and we had peace and serenity

for  two sittings thereafter. Our intentions  are

quite clear. It may be quite possible that in the

next  few  days, you, Sir, will have a much  more

lively  time  than  you really  deserve.  We  all

expect lively debates. In fact, it is part of the

play  of intellect and wit; or if wit is lacking,

then  at  least some buffoonery to take away  the

tedium  and monotony of the day. But one thing  I

say:   in   any   wicked  and  deliberate   lies,

falsehoods and distortions, people play them with

their gloves on, but we play them with our gloves

off.  In  this Chamber, Sir, it is bad to  expose

knuckle-dusters, but one can use  knuckle-dusters

all  the  same, and outside this Chamber  we  can

well look after ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that Members of the House have to

waste  the  time  of other Members  who  have  to

listen to why hawkers and taxi-drivers are  being

bled to death by smoking 20 cigarettes a day, and

why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



the  people's income tax has increased to  $1,000

right  up  to  infinity in the lower range;  from

never  having  to  pay income tax  to  paying  $5

income  tax, and it goes up to infinity.  But  we

have   had  all  this:  rural  farmers,   squalid

poverty, taxing the poor for the rich, protecting

the  interests of the colonialists,  gratuitously

telling  us  also how to win the next  elections,

blueprints  for victory, hold snap  elections  in

1963, get rid of all taxes, give money away,  and

then we win again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry for this, but let me just do a

simple  A. B. C. on this business of hawkers  and

taxi-drivers. They are in the public image partly

because  we  made it so. We built  it  up  as  an

example  of  the man in the Clapton omnibus.  The

Member  for Hong Lim did not think of  it.  There

were  other brains in the Party. The man  in  the

Clapton  omnibus  was  the English  idea  of  the

common man. The common man here is your worker in

the  factory, your hawker, your taxi-driver, your

trisha-rider,  and I defy anybody, including  the

Member for Hong Lim, despite the extent to  which

he  can comport his mind, to spell out from  this

Budget  an  intention to take one cent from  them

which they should not pay. Property tax, business

tax,  stamp duty, increased assessment on  rubber

estates.  Well, if any taxi-driver has  a  rubber

estate,  he  should pay assessment on  it.  Rates

from private lotteries? He is not a member of the

clubs that run these private lotteries and I know

of no working men's club that runs this one-armed

bandit.  Those  who  run it are  usually  in  the

middle income groups. Professional tax, passenger

tax-taxi-drivers and trisha-riders going  by  air

to  Kuala Lumpur pay an extra dollar. Decrease in

rates of income tax-do they pay tax? There is  no

taxi-driver  or  trisha-rider or  hawker  in  the

income  tax books. The Member for Hong Lim  ought

to  know  these things, but he has to go back  to

the taxes which he agreed on to try and spell  it

out.  The  20  cigarettes a day one smoked  since

1959; the petrol one used was what he agreed  on.

Sir,  I  respect a good opponent. I may not  like

him but I respect him because he can give you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



as  hard as you can give it to him, but I  cannot

help despising the perfidious fools-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

must  be  aware  of  the fact that  he  has  been

skating  on  very, very thin ice. The  expression

"perfidious fools" was obviously directed against

the  Member for Hong Lim. The Prime Minister must

withdraw  an unparliamentary expression  of  that

nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if only you had given

me a chance to proceed, I would have squashed any

such  qualms in your mind. We have no  perfidious

people in this Chamber. We are all honourable men

here. It is when we get out of this Chamber  that

we  are  wicked, perfidious and downright so  and

so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Nevertheless, I am satisfied

that that expression has a direct bearing on  the

Member for Hong Lim. It ought to be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Nevertheless, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think the point I want to make has  been

made,  and that is the point. It does not  matter

really.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Prime Minister withdraw

the expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, surely, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  but not for the effect on the Speaker.  Let

us  get  this  very clear, Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I

withdraw  unreservedly but I have, with  complete

cynicism  working this system within the Standing

Orders,  said quietly to the people of  Singapore

what  a  lot  of decent and I hope right-thinking

people  believe  to  be true of  even  honourable

Members of this august Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to wear our sins round our necks,

and  the  Member for Hong Lim is one of them.  We

have  made  very  few mistakes, Sir.  There  were

difficulties we did not anticipate running  into,

and he was one of them. But the Member for Farrer

Park  is  wrong  if he believes that  here  is  a

Government  that does not know how  to  work  the

system, including the civil service. Whatever our

shortcomings - and there may be many - I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



am  proud to say that my colleagues (not just  in

the Cabinet), my supporting team of Parliamentary

Secretaries    and   Assemblymen    have    basic

dedication,  not selfishness. You  will  remember

some  Members  in  the last  Assembly,  Sir -  Mr

Lazarous, Mr Lee Choon Eng and Mr Mak Pak Shee.

Sometimes  I think we ought to cleanse our  past,

but  whatever  our  other shortcomings,  we  have

given an honest and effective government; and the

business  of  a  government is to govern  in  the

interest  of  the people. We have come  to  grips

with  our  problems  after  1½  years.  We  are

beginning to produce results. We will continue to

press on, and I hope in the coming years, or even

in  the coming months, even the Member for Farrer

Park  would find it difficult to say that his  is

the  best.  As  for the hon. the  leader  of  the

Opposition, if he were honest in not  wishing  to

make political mention of the fact that he is  in

the  Opposition, he would say that,  knowing  the

trials  and  tribulations that  the  country  was

faced  with, knowing what he had been in  for  in

the  last four years from 1955 to 1959, he  never

expected  that  there could emerge  a  government

able  to maintain the State, to give it coherence

and purpose, and to make progress.



<br><br>9.03 p m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the  first  day  of  the  debate  on   the

Government financial policy is generally regarded

as  a  field day for the Opposition. This is  the

opportunity for them to roam far and wide on  the

proposals  contained in the Budget  Statement.  I

cannot  help feeling, however, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that  the  Opposition on this occasion have  been

singularly insipid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate started off with the Member for Joo

Chiat who came out with a rollicking big piece of

jesting.  Here  is a man who wants  to  introduce

unemployment  insurance, old-age  insurance,  the

restoration of the whole of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



the  variable allowance to the civil service,  to

increase the pay of the Work Brigade, to  set  up

trade  commissions all over the world,  including

the  City of Peking; and yet he is worried  about

the tax increases that we are introducing. Having

delivered his speech, he duly departed from  this

Chamber,  never to return. And this rather  lends

credence to a report from a reliable source  that

the  Member for Joo Chiat is prepared  to  resign

his seat for a consideration of $20,000.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister for

Finance cannot make that allegation and get  away

with  it.  I  think  he ought  to  withdraw  that

allegation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not quite sure in what

way  and  under  what particular  ruling  of  the

Standing   Orders  you  consider  this  statement

reprehensible.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All I can say is that it is highly

improper  and  I  think the  Minister  ought  to

withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If you so will it, I withdraw

it.  I do not want - and time does not permit me - to

cover  in  any  detail the  points  made  by  the

Opposition.  I do want at a later stage  to  deal

with  some  of the statements made by the  Member

for  Hong Lim. But generally, the principal point

put  forward by Members of the Opposition was  to

challenge  my contention that there  has  been  a

solid and substantial economic revival this year.

I made my Statement and produced as much evidence

as  possible  by  way  of  statistics  of  trade,

production   and  finance  in   support   of   my

contention. On the other hand, the Opposition, on

the  most dubious of evidence, disputed the  fact

that  any  revival  has taken place.  They  cited

unnamed  business friends of theirs - and there  is

no  doubt  that  members of the S.P.A. are  well

related to businessmen - without specifying at  all

in what trade, in what business and in what form,

stagnation  has  taken  place.  The  Member   for

Cairnhill attempted to be more specific than  the

others,  and  cited the closing  down  of  coffee

shops as a true indication of business



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



stagnation. Now, no serious student of  economics

will  pay the slightest attention to evidence  of

this kind. Only in one respect, however, did  the

Member   for   Cairnhill  produce   evidence   in

rebuttal,  and  that  is when  he  challenged  my

figures  of cargo loaded in the Singapore Harbour

Board. There is no discrepancy at all between the

statement that he read in the newspapers  and  my

remarks in my Budget statement. What he failed to

understand was that my figures related to general

cargo  and  did  not  include  mineral  oil   and

vegetable  oil  in  bulk. And quite  rightly  so,

because  for  the last four or five years,  there

has  been a long-term decline in the quantity  of

mineral  oil,  petroleum, crude oil,  and  bunker

oil.  The  long-term decline  in  that  trade  in

Singapore  has  nothing to do with  the  internal

conditions  in  Singapore. It is just  due  to  a

general  over-supply in the oil industry, fiercer

competition,  and  installation  of  oil   supply

points  in  various ports of the world. Excluding

this  declining element of oil, my figures, as  I

said,  did indicate a fairly substantial increase

in both volume and value of trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general point made, too, that the

P.A.P. economic  policy has  differed  from  the

policies enunciated before the general elections.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, if you will recall, I went  to

great   lengths  to  explain  that  our   present

policies  are  absolutely  consistent  with   the

policies  we declared to the electorate  and  the

general  public  before  the  elections.  I  will

return to this point later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said sometime ago that I intended to spend

some  time dealing with some statements  made  by

the  Member for Hong Lim. Mr Speaker, Sir,  that

hon.  Member  has been called various  names  and

epithets  which  may  not  be  repeated  in  this

Chamber.  You  will  recall, Sir,  that  after  a

sitting  of  this  Assembly two months  ago,  the

Prime  Minister called the Member for Hong Lim  a

liar and a rogue. In the course of proceedings in

a  Press conference following that, my colleague,

the  Minister  for Labour, added in another  term

"coward". Now, Sir, in Biblical times, there  was

a  legendary character named Beelzebub,  who  was

known as the prince of liars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



And,  of  course, lying has been a human  failing

from   time  immemorial.  In  more  recent  days,

however, this has been reduced to both an art and

an exact science.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister for

Finance  is  attempting quite  skilfully  to  get

round  the  Standing Orders, but I would  suggest

that  he  now concentrate on what has  been  said

about  the  general principles of the  Government

policy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As you quite rightly say,

Sir,  I  have  to tread rather warily  over  this

ground,  but  this is by way of  introduction  to

explain just that form of prevarication contained

in the statement of the Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the word "prevarication"

used  of a statement of a Member of the House  is

not parliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I withdraw, Sir, if that is

the  rule  of the game. Speaking more broadly,  I

was about to develop the theme that there are two

types  of  lying. One is what Dr Goebbels  said,

that   is,  to  repeat  a  big  lie  and  do   it

persistently,  eventually  making   the   general

public  believe in it. The other is what we  have

seen   more  recently  in  the  case  of  Senator

McCarthy, who did not believe in hammering home a

big  lie, but in spreading a lot of little  lies,

which add up then to a big smear. The Member  for

Hong Lim, I would say, is no Dr Goebbels and the

various mis-statements of fact and distortion  of

opinion  contained  in  his  statement  make  one

believe  that  he is a supporter of the  McCarthy

school.  Now,  Sir, if we were not restricted  by

Standing  Orders, I would have come  straight  to

the  point and said that I want to talk about his

whopping downright big lies. But the rules of the

debate  being  what they are, I will  merely  say

that  I will deal with a number of terminological

inexactitudes indulged in by the Member for  Hong

Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to deal with matters of principle, but I

think it is necessary to show the Member for Hong

Lim as a man who is extremely reckless, extremely

blatant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



and  unashamed  when it comes  to  distinguishing

truth from falsehood, facts from illusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now come to the ten items? I will

have to go through them very quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Member for Hong Lim said that the big

European  firms here make at least  half  of  the

profits  earned  in  Singapore.  There   was   no

evidence whatsoever, although he assured us  that

he  had  spent a week in making his calculations.

If  he  refers to the 1958 Annual Report  of  the

Income  Tax Department, he will find that profits

made  in  Singapore amount to  $375  million.  He

produced a book of sharebrokers and gave  details

of  profits  of  the biggest European  firms.  My

recollection  is that the total  profits  do  not

exceed  $7  million. I am not here to defend  the

proposition  whether  European  firms  should  or

should not make money. The point is that he  made

that statement and that it was inaccurate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Member said that he saved the civil

servants  in  the lower grades from pay  cuts.  I

deny this most categorically. I had no assistance

and no advice at all from him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. He said that a 5 per cent increase in tax on

incomes  of $10,000 a year would yield little  by

way of additional tax. This is completely untrue.

We  expect  this increase to yield an  additional

tax of $1 million per year or more than the whole

increase from new taxpayers brought into the  tax

orbit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Inexactitude No. 4. He said that Shell Company

pays no tax on profits in Pulau Bukom. That was a

definite statement and he challenged me  to  deny

it. Sir, the Member was formerly the Minister for

National  Development,  under  whose  charge  the

assessment of properties is allotted. An ordinary

man  will  say that he knows what the facts  are.

And  the  facts are that Shell Company is  paying

tax  on  the profits in Pulau Bukom at the  rates

applicable to that section in the rural areas. It

is  true  that  when  he  was  the  Minister  for

National  Development, he tried to  increase  the

amount of assessment that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



Shell  Company  was paying - a very worthy  effort.

Unfortunately,  this  led to  no  result  at  all

because he had chased away all the officers  from

his Assessment Office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Time does not permit me, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Could I ask the Minister -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is not giving

way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. 5, Sir. He said that the

Public Works Standing Committee was an innovation

introduced  by this Government to embarrass  him.

The  Public Works Standing Committee is  a

long-standing   institution  and  allowed  for   under

General Orders. There is nothing at all -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification

again, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. Then No. 6. These are

minor - I   cannot   use   a  four-letter   English

word - inexactitudes.  He  said  that  the  Cabinet

Estimates  Committee was not responsible  to  the

Cabinet. That is absolutely untrue. He made  some

statements    regarding    the    incidence    of

taxation - that taxi drivers woud have  to  pay  so

many  million  dollars, trishaw  riders  so  many

million  dollars, and so on and so  forth.  There

was  no explanation of how the calculations  were

made.  Where were the data? None whatsoever.  The

Prime Minister has already disposed of this point

and  I  will  press on to the next  one.  In  the

opinion of the Member for Hong Lim, tax increases

were unnecessary, having regard to the amount  of

additional  tax, namely, $45 million, because  we

could have saved that amount of money by pruning

expenditure.  And he even went to the  extent  of

quoting  from  an election campaign statement  of

the Party saying that this is what we shall do. I

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



looking  forward  to  some suggestions  from  the

Member  for Hong Lim as to how we could  save  an

expenditure  of  this magnitude from  the  public

fund.  Indeed,  if he had made any proposals,  we

would  have  listened to them with interest.  But

having said that he would save $45 million in the

Expenditure  Estimates, he did not  specify  even

one item - not a single one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, he said that companies do

not  pay tax, and when my colleague, the Minister

for  Education, sought clarification on that,  he

confirmed that that was the case. It seems to  me

absolutely   appalling  that  a   person,   whose

profession is accountancy, could have  made  this

most    elementary   blunder.   Sir,   a   week's

calculation -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for   Finance   has  just  now  touched   on   my

professional   capacity,   but   he    has    not

substantiated  my  charge  that  at  present  our

company tax is not the company tax we know of  in

the United States, Australia or India, and that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of

order. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I did not elaborate on that,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  because  my  colleague,  the

Minister  for  Education, had  already  explained

that  at great length, and during his explanation

the Member for Hong Lim was probably not present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the proposal, Mr Speaker, Sir, a 10 per

cent company tax without allowing - if I understand

him  right - a set-off in respect of dividends.  At

present  the company tax is 40 per cent  and  the

money  so  paid can be used as a set-off  against

dividends  distributed. But if the  company  does

not distribute the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



whole of its profits, then the company itself, as

an  economic entity, will have to pay tax on  the

undistributed profits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Minister give way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have only ten minutes to

wind up.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Indeed, in modern business,

almost   all  public  companies  plough  back   a

substantial  part  of their  gross  profits  into

their  business. No studies have been made  here,

to  my  knowledge,  of  the exact  percentage  of

profits   that  have  been  ploughed  back.   But

obviously  under  the  present  arrangements,  if

public companies were to keep back one-quarter of

their  gross profits and not distribute  them  as

dividends, then the yield from tax would  be  the

same  as under the present tax arrangement.  That

is  a  matter of simple arithmetic. But  if  more

than a quarter of the gross profits are retained,

then  this  new tax proposal will have a  smaller

yield than the present arrangement. And if I were

to  hazard a guess as to the proportion of  gross

profits retained in businesses, I would say  that

it  would be nearer half than one-quarter, taking

all the companies as a group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the bright proposal to tax

military   vehicles.  This  has  a  rather   long

history.  The implication here seems to  be  that

the  Government does not receive any payment from

the Defence Department of the U.K. Government  in

respect  of  property, vehicles and other  things

owned and run by the War Department. This is  not

quite  true. They are paying a sum of $900,000  a

year  in  lieu of the payment of rates  on  their

property. We have not agreed that this amount  is

a  fair and equitable compensation. But the point

is  that  payment is being made. When the  Member

for  Hong  Lim  was  the  Minister  for  National

Development,  we protested strongly  against  the

inadequacy   of   this   contribution,   and   he

accordingly undertook to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



reassess  all Service properties with a  view  to

increasing   this  contribution -  a  praiseworthy

undertaking. I remember distinctly  that  I  gave

him  four  months to let me have details  of  the

revaluation  of Service properties.  But  he  was

quite unable to produce it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of information, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It was quite beyond his

means, for the same reason that he had chased out

all his technical staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I be permitted, in the short time at my

disposal,  to  bring  to perspective  the  Budget

proposals?  As  I  have  said,  this  cannot   be

considered as a one-year attempt in isolation. We

must  see  it  in  the economic setting  we  find

ourselves  today - a  tremendous population  growth

with  its  inevitable increase in the numbers  of

young  men and women looking for work every year.

With  political changes, there is a need not only

to  create  more jobs for the growing population,

but  also to bring about more social justice. All

this  means  getting  money.  Money,  first,   to

finance  development expenditure so that  we  can

make   it  easier  and  more  certain  that   new

industries will be established in Singapore, both

by local businessmen and overseas businessmen, or

by  joint participation between themselves. Then,

on  the  other  hand,  we  have  to  provide  for

improved  social  services,  more  schools,  more

assistance  to  those  who do  not  have  regular

incomes - assistance   in   the   way   of   public

assistance,  unemployment relief schemes  and  so

forth. In order to get this extra money, we  have

to  decide from which sectors of the economy  the

money  must  come from, and who are the  type  of

people to pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



for this. It is very clear from the nature of the

new  tax proposals that the general principle  is

to  spread  the  burden as  broadly  as  possible

amongst  those  who  can afford  to  pay.  Hence,

people  such  as  shopkeepers, lawyers,  doctors,

engineers, landlords, people who travel  by  air,

limited companies, and so forth have been  called

upon  to make a small extra contribution  to  the

general  welfare.  The amounts  are  well  within

their capacity to pay. To represent the Budget as

soaking  the poor to pay for the rich is  such  a

travesty of the truth that it is hardly necessary

for me to rebut it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to conclude with some observations as to

the  general problem that is facing  us  and  the

solutions that are available to us. Let us  never

assume  that the difficulties ahead are going  to

be   easily   disposed  of  without  effort   and

sacrifice  by  large numbers of  people.  I  have

referred in my Budget statement to the fact  that

all   Asian  countries  try  to  create  material

prosperity for their subjects. But few people are

aware  that this is going to be a long and  harsh

journey.  What  I  have tried to  explain  in  my

Budget  statement is that we must take  a  longer

perspective, and within the development plan, try

to  form a framework of our period 1961 to  1964.

But  even this period itself, with all the  money

and  the  resources  that we  intend  to  put  in

development, represent but the first  step  in  a

very  long  journey.  But this  I  can  say  with

confidence.  In  taking  this  step,  we  have  a

Government  that  is  in sound  condition  and  a

country in good heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1961.
