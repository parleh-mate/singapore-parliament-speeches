Speaker,  Sir,  last Tuesday this House  passed  the

Banking Bill on a Certificate of Urgency. During the

me  in  recording our thanks to the officers  of  my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

Supply [Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the

recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  before

the  Committee proceeds to consider the  Development

Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I so signify.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the Development Estimates

for  1963.  For the convenience of hon.  Members,  I

intend  taking  the  totals for each  Head  as  they

appear  in  the  fourth column  of  the  Summary  of

Expenditure  on page 7 of Paper Cmd. 1 of  1962.  We

are dealing now with Heads of Expenditure in respect

of which amendments stand on the Order Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D49 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D49 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 9.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raffles National Library - according to the

Estimates here, there is a token revote of  $10.  We

therefore  presume that extensions would practically

be completed or about to be completed in 1963. Could

the  Minister in charge please describe  to  us  the

nature of these extensions, because in the blue book

given  to us there was no description or particulars

given as regards these extensions?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, about $750,000 was provided under  the

Plan  Cost for the Raffles National Library to  meet

bills   for   final  expenditure  on  building   and

furniture.  It  is most likely that all  expenditure

would  be  paid for in 1962, but the token provision

for 1963 is entered to ensure that outstanding bills

can be paid for in 1963.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Raffles

National Library is practically a monument. Although

no  doubt we appreciate the fine building, we  would

appreciate  it more if the contents of  the  library

are  adequate. Sir, I think if there is money to  be

spared,  we  should  spend  more  on  equipping  the

Library  with  books than the $53,000 that  we  have

voted for expenditure this year. So I wonder whether

out of the amount spent on the building we could not

devote  more  money  per  year  to  increasing   the

contents thereof.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

different  proposition. That is  annually  recurrent

expenditure. As far as the Development Estimates are

concerned,  the building is finished,  and  that  is

that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that

development is finished, that means that there  will

be  more money available for increasing the contents

thereof and I am sure the Minister could do that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, you cannot do that. Money

for   development  projects  are  paid  out  of  the

Development Fund. You cannot use that to buy  books.

Books  are paid for from the O.C.A.R. items  in  the

Annual Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> What the Member for

Tanglin  wants,  I think, is an assurance  from  the

Minister responsible that when this big building has

been  completed, more monies will be voted  for  the

purchase of books annually.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Of course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Minister had already asked

for  an  increase,  and although  the  Treasury  was

unable to agree to the full sum, nevertheless, there

was a very substantial increase for last year to  be

spent this year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

assurance given, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,080,070 for Head D49 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D57 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D57 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headquarters Project - Sir, we are glad that the

Government   proposes  to  move  the   Ministry   of

Education's headquarters from Kay Siang Road because

the  site  has been found to be very unsuitable  and

very  inconvenient to members of the public, and  to

heads of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



schools  and  teachers. Since  there  are  transport

difficulties,  people  from Geylang  would  have  to

change  buses and so on. We would appreciate  it  if

the   Minister   could  tell  us   now   where   the

headquarters would be sited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I am afraid I have to disappoint  the

Member   for   Tanglin  if  he   thinks   that   the

headquarters is going to be transferred  to  Tanglin

or that it is going to be nearer to Balmoral Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will be in the same location. The

reason  for  suggesting a new  headquarters  project

arose  out  of the fact when the present  Government

took  office in the middle of 1959, the Ministry  of

Education  found  itself housed in  three  temporary

structures  believed  to  have  been  built  by  the

Japanese  some 20 years ago. With the  expansion  of

the  Inspectorate,  we found it necessary  early  in

1960  to requisition a primary school building  just

next  to  the  three temporary structures,  off  Kay

Siang  Road and Tanglin Road, to house the  enlarged

Inspectorate.  It  is  understood  that  the   three

temporary  structures are uneconomical  to  maintain

and,  therefore, we have to think a little ahead  in

view  of  the tremendous expansion which we have  to

undergo in the Ministry of Education, especially  in

respect of the Examinations Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For security reasons, it is also essential that

adequate  measures have to be taken  so  that  there

will not be any repetition of leakage of examination

papers.  If  we  refer to the Four-Year  Development

Plan  at  page  112,  Table  9.4.  the  headquarters

project  would come to a total cost of $1½  million.

It   was  envisaged  to  complete  the  headquarters

project  in three years, starting from 1962-3-4.  So

the  present provision of half a million dollars  in

1962 which was passed recently, Sir (page 41 of  the 1962  Development  Estimates, subhead  7),  shows  a

figure  of half a million dollars. For this vote  to

account   for  1963,  we  feel  that  the  estimated

expenditure  for 1962 would amount to  $100,000.  So

the 1963 figure would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



mean   a  revote  of  $300,000  plus  an  additional

$200,000.  This  is in respect of  the  Examinations

Division block which will have first priority  under

our Plan.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is an Education vote. I think, as a Member  of

this  Assembly, I require a little bit of  education

on the question of revotes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962 the vote asked for was just $200,000, and

yet for 1963 according to the "Notes" column it is a

revote for $300,000. Where does the money come from?



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote for 1962 is only $200,000 and yet it is

anticipated that in 1963 there will be a  revote  of

$300,000. I do not know how that is worked out, Sir.

Perhaps  the Minister for Education can help  me  in

trying to understand how the revote is going  to  be

more than what the actual vote is.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has indicated that the

vote  in fact was $500,000. He has referred  to  the 1962 Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In that case, may I have further

information? The work is to be started in  1962.  It

is  this year. For 1963 $500,000 is put in. But this

$500,000  includes  a revote of $300,000.  A  revote

means a revote of the project this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Perhaps I should go through this

slowly with the Member for Cairnhill. First of  all,

would  he take the 1962 Development Estimates?  Turn

to  page  41,  subhead 7. Estimated expenditure,  in

bold,  is shown as $500,000. If we now turn to  this

vote on account for 1963 Development Estimates  - also

on  page  41, sub-head 7, first column  - we see  that

the estimated expenditure for this year is $200,000.

Therefore,  there  would be a  balance  of  $300,000

which would be revoted back to the next column, plus

another $200,000 additional commitment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I take

the next item together with this one, because what I

wish  to  indicate  is  related  to  "Renovation  to

Raffles Institute."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Related?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes, because it is a question

of siting, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose the hon. Member is

entitled to indicate his points.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, from the point of view of

the   general  public,  the  present  site  is  most

unsatisfactory for the headquarters. If a parent has

to  change buses several times before he reaches his

place to see an inspector or any official, it causes

him  great inconvenience. And Government policy  has

been to bring the Ministers and their staff near the

public!  We  fully  support  it.  That  is  why  the

Immigration  Department has been brought  nearer  to

the  centre  of the town. Sir, Raffles Institute,  I

think,  is  spelt  wrongly. It  should  be  "Raffles

Institution".  It  has  been  changed   to   Raffles

Institute.  Now, Raffles Institution is occupying  a

very ancient building. It is very costly to maintain

the present building. We know that even after costly

renovations,  after a few years  the  building  will

again  look  shabby.  We cannot blame  the  building

because  it was built over a century ago.  Would  it

not  be  possible, since there was a project before,

for  the transfer of Raffles Institution to new  and

better  quarters elsewhere, to have the two projects

co-ordinated? Maybe Raffles Institution could go  to

the   present  site  of  the  Headquarters  and  the

Ministerial   headquarters  could  go   to   Raffles

Institution site. That is a matter which  I  believe

Rafflesians  would be interested in. In, any  case,

Sir,  this is a perennial thing. After a few  years,

the  Raffles  Institution building  will  look  very

shabby as compared with other new buildings that are

being built. I think Raffles Institution deserves  a

new set of buildings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, when the file for the

renovation  of  Raffles  Institution,  amounting  to

$100,000  (the  estimate given by the  Public  Works

Department) came to me late in 1959 I had  the  same

feeling  as  the Member for Tanglin  that  it  might

perhaps  be a waste of money to spend $100,000  just

to  renovate  an  old building. Of  course,  it  was

prevailed upon me that it had a historical  interest

and old Rafflesians would fight to the last ditch to

preserve  this building. But I deferred the  matter.

In  six months' time it came back again with a  plea

that  if  I  did not make a decision on the  matter,

then the building might collapse because the windows

were  coming  off  at the hinges,  the  stairs  were

getting  very  rickety and so  forth.  I  was  still

adamant  that  we  should spend $100,000  on  a  new

school  building. Then the explanation was given  to

me  that  for  $100,000, we would  be  able  to  get

Raffles  Institution into good shape  and  also  put

into  it  certain new laboratories. It is  certainly

much  cheaper  spending $100,000  carrying  on  with

Raffles  Institution, which is  centrally  situated,

for  at least 2,000 students rather than ponder over

the  possibility of erecting a new secondary  school

that would cost as much as $600,000 and to wait  for

perhaps  one  and a half years. So I had  to  agree,

after  weighing  all  the  various  advantages   and

disadvantages,  to  proceed with  this  project.  In

fact,  the  repairs  and  renovations  have  already

started and it is more or less halfway through.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no doubt after

a  few years when the time comes for the building to

be  again renovated, if the Minister should still be

occupying   his  post,  he  would  reconsider   this

question after discussing it with the Rafflesians. I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I never heard the Member for

Tanglin! Mr Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, as an old Rafflesian, I entirely

agree with the Minister when, he says that there  is

need  to  renovate  the  school.  When  I  was  more

intimately  connected  with the  Raffles  Old  Boys'

Association, when the previous Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



that is, the Lim Yew Hock Government,  made

the  decision  to move Raffles Institution  to  some

other  place  - I think it was in Dunearn Road,  if  I

remember rightly  - there was a lot of objection  from

the  Old Boys' Association and from the old boys  of

Raffles  School. The old boys felt, quite naturally,

a  sentimental attachment to the original  site  and

that  it  should  be  preserved.  I  for  one,  Sir,

speaking as an old Rafflesian, would not like to see

the   headquarters  of  the  educational  department

shifted there, not because I do not think it  is  an

appropriate  site - it is an ideal  site   - but  merely

because  I  would  not like to  see  the  historical

connection of the school with the site disturbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of siting for the headquarters,

Sir,  there is opposite to the school itself  across

the  road what the City Council preserves as an open

area. It is next to the Club. I believe the previous

Government had some ideas about erecting a  building

there   - a  civic centre and all that sort of  thing.

But  that  did not come to pass. That site is  still

available.  It  is not earmarked for any  particular

project  on the Master Plan. I was wondering whether

the  Minister could look into that aspect of  it  to

see   whether   that  site  in  front   of   Raffles

Institution  across  Beach  Road  might  not  be   a

suitable place for the Education Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think my colleague, the

Minister  for Health and Law, would be very  pleased

to  hear  this, because that was originally reserved

for   the  Health  Ministry,  before  the  Education

Ministry parked itself there. We shall give it  some

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for

myself, I think it is wholly inappropriate to remove

Raffles Institution. If there are sites available to

which  it  can  be removed, they are  in  any  event

urgently  required  for  the erection  of  secondary

schools to which we are committed. But I would  urge

that  a long-term view be taken of the school  which

has  survived for more than a century  and  that  we

should have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



some   plan   for  the  erection  of  a  substantial

secondary  school building which would  replace  the

existing building on that site for the same  purpose

and with the same aim.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was going

to  say the same thing because I feel that it  is  a

waste of money if a building is too old and we  keep

on  renovating  it as we are renovating  an  ancient

monument.  Today a modern secondary school  requires

buildings built along different lines because of the

emphasis on science. I would suggest that after this

period  when  the  renovation period  is  over,  the

Government   should   plan   to   rebuild    Raffles

Institution so that in prestige it will be equal  to

all the bigger schools in Singapore. I am sure today

the  old  boys feel unhappy passing by  to  see  the

building looking as if it is ready for demolition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not like the A.C.S.!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No, Sir. We want to be fair

because  we believe that all schools must  be  given

equal chances. It is not right that one building  is

new and another building is old. Sir, I beg leave -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member please take his

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the item here is a peculiar one: "Percussion.

Drill for School Site Investigation Works - One". Sir,

the  sum to be spent is about $60,000. We in  school

used  to remember an item in a school concert called

"percussion band" where little children  beat  drums

and  cymbals.  We like some clarification  on  this.

What does percussion drill mean in this setting?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an

item  really  put  in  by the  Economic  Development

Section  of the Ministry of Finance. For  a  clearer

explanation  for the Member for Tanglin,  perhaps  I

might  have to call upon my colleague, the  Minister

for  National  Development. There is a thing  called

positive  piling. I do not know if there is  such  a

thing  as negative piling. But this particular  item

"percussion  drill"  for school  site  investigation

works,  I understand, is a machine - and not a musical

instrument - which  is  required  for   soil   testing

purposes in connection with the structure of  school

building.   It  was  approved  last  year   by   the

Development  Planning Sub-Committee as an  essential

equipment. I suppose the Member for Tanglin is aware

that  we  hope to build as many as 17 to 19  schools

each  year. It is perhaps in the long-term  interest

of  the Government to purchase such equipment rather

than  depend  on private contractors every  time  we

want to test the soil for the building of schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D58 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural and Kampong Roads - $600,000 in 1963.

Sir,  could  we have an idea of the basis  on  which

priorities  for  improvements are  given  for  these

roads? I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Prime Minister, who has something to do with

this project, that the petitions of various people - I

sent  some  petitions on behalf of  certain  kampong

people - have been lost in view of the changes in  the

P.A.P.  The one who retired as head of the  relevant

committee  did  not leave the papers in  the  proper

places  and apparently the present officer in charge

could  not  locate them. So I was asked if  I  could

send  a  petition for certain improvements.  Sir,  I

would   like  to  know  the  basis  on  which  these

priorities are given, so that we will be able to put

forward, our cases properly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Sir, the priority and approval of requests for

improvement  or  construction  of  agricultural  and

kampong roads are fixed by the Committee called  the

Urban and Rural Services Consultative Committee.  In

view of the fact that there was some misplacement of

previous requests for construction or improvement to

these  roads, I would like to call upon the  present

Chairman of the Committee to give a clarification of

this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Kampong road

priorities are always given to those roads that  are

very  bad.  We just send an engineer to  investigate

which  road has priority and then we put it  to  the

meeting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Are we to understand that

priority depends on the degree of disrepair and  not

the  extent of the use of the road? Just  because  a

road going through a lonely swampy area is very  bad

does not mean that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



that  road  must be repaired first. I  should  think

that  where a road is in disrepair and it  serves  a

very  large kampong, that one should come first.  We

know  places where taxis dare not go in because  the

taxi-drivers say if they go in, it is not worth  the

fare  in view of the danger of the axle breaking  or

something  going wrong. Sir, perhaps that  could  be

considered by the Chairman of the Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> When a road is in disrepair and

kampong  people send in their complaints, we  always

send  a  road engineer to investigate. Then  when  a

meeting of the Committee is held we immediately  ask

the  officer  concerned to take action to  have  the

road repaired. Certainly we are not going to make  a

road  near  a  swamp, as the Member for Tanglin  has

suggested. We are not so stupid. I live in the rural

area  and  I  know  how to make a road.  The  Member

should  go and see what the kampong roads look  like

and not come here and say that we are building roads

near the swamp.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will take

up  this  matter later on whenever there  are  roads

requiring  repairs, because as I  say,  Sir,  he  is

quite  aware  of that. There are other factors  that

decide the state of disrepair of a particular  road.

Being  old  enough and mature enough,  he  would,  I

think be able to give due and careful consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would enquire, Mr Speaker, Sir,

whether  we  are to understand that the vote  sought

would be adequate to meet the requirement for repair

to all agricultural and kampong roads and that it is

merely a question of priority, so that by the end of

1963  all our agricultural and kampong roads now  in

disrepair will be fully adequate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we always look

into  this  matter. If sometimes  the  vote  is  not

adequate,  certainly we will ask the Prime  Minister

to give us some more money for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I must ask for more assistance than

that,  Mr Speaker, Sir,I would repeat my  request.

Surely he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



does know whether the vote is adequate in respect of

the  number  of  agricultural and kampong  roads  in

disrepair  in connection with which he has  received

complaints.  Is it adequate or is it  not  adequate?

Has  he had reports in respect of all the complaints

or has he not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

vote for this year to repair these kampong roads  is

adequate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (10) of  subhead

21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (10) concerns private streets. In view

of  the  fact  that the property tax  has  now  been

increased and in view of this anomaly which arose in

colonial  times  of  regarding  certain  streets  as

private  when they are no longer private, since  the

public are allowed to go through all of them,  could

we  ask  for  clarification  whether  these  private

streets will be given adequate attention, because  I

see  the  Government is going to spend  $500,000  on

private  streets? Sir, private streets were  not  in

the  care  of the City Council. Repairs  to  private

streets  have to be done by the private owners,  and

naturally  it is difficult to get co-ordination  and

co-operation among the private owners living in  one

private  street.  For instance, Sir,  if  it  is  an

estate,  even a new estate, I remember how difficult

it  was to get one road in the Siglap Estate, Siglap

Hill or Siglap Road, where several of the Ministers,

I believe, stay -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

We live in lorongs, not in public streets.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Private streets, we used to call

them,  Sir.  But  it  took a long  time  before  the

residents got the Government to agree to make up the

so-called private streets and to declare them public

roads.  I  wonder what this item is for.  If  it  is

still for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



private streets, it means the Government has adopted

new  principles  which we appreciate,  that  private

streets  needing  repair would be repaired  and  not

neglected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, under section 143 of the

Local Government Ordinance, where any private street

or  part of a private street in the opinion  of  the

local  authority  requires the execution  of  street

works,  the expenses incurred by the local authority

in executing such street works are apportioned among

the  premises  fronting that street.  This  practice

still carries on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is merely

recoverable expenditure which the Government  incurs

in  the  first instance. I understand that position.

Could   the  Minister  assure  us  that  there   are

corresponding entries in the income estimates  which

will recover these monies from frontagers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I so assure the Member for

Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are, in

fact,  at  present private streets  which  are  both

adequate  and  utilised by the  public  to  such  an

extent  that  they should be declared to  be  public

streets and taken over. Would he indicate Government

policy in that regard?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, public

streets   and  private  streets  are  two  different

things.  Government will take over a private  street

and turn it into a public street. The frontagers  of

the property have to pay for making up the roads and

also  the drains and land. In an area which is  just

developing, one acre of land may cost about  $5,000,

and  to  make up a road would cost over $20,000.  So

how could the Government take over when the place is

not fully developed? That is my answer.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary did not

understand the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate

whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



all   these  private  streets  are  exclusively   in

undeveloped rural areas? Surely not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Some of them are in the town

area  and some are in the rural area. Naturally  the

Government will take over the roads which  are  less

developed and turn them into public roads or  public

streets,   whatever  they  are   called,   and   the

frontagers have to pay for the cost of construction.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do not wish to pursue this, Mr

Speaker,  but are we to understand then that  it  is

Government's policy to take over those  roads  which

are  being extensively used by the public  and  that

this  money  is required exclusively in  respect  of

roads in undeveloped rural areas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> A private street or a private

road  is  a public street or a public road when  the

place  is  congested or the road leads  to  schools.

That is priority, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

that  many owners of property on private streets  do

not  want  the  private streets  to  be  taken  over

because  they  want  some  privacy.  But  where  the

private  streets have become really  public  streets

with  people  going through them  because  they  are

thoroughfares,   as  it  were,  then   perhaps   the

Government would consider taking over them as public

streets. If the owners have to share the cost, well,

then, the owners must share the cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> This is a matter for

consideration by the Public Works Department  (Roads

and   Engineering   Section).  When   this   Section

recommends that the private streets be taken over as

public  streets  and the frontagers co-operate  with

the  Government  to build the roads  and  pay  their

dues,  then  the  private streets  are  turned  into

public streets.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He is helpful, Sir, but could the

Minister  add, what is the policy of this  Committee

governing   the  recommendations  for  taking   over

private streets?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the policy is to leave

well alone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not a

policy. That is sheer laziness.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do not know what the policy of

the  present Government is. As I was connected  with

these private streets in the City Council, perhaps I

might state what the policy of the City Council was.

That might help the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in similar circumstances, there were votes in

the  City  Council budgets for these  amounts  which

were   recoverable  from  frontagers.  As  and  when

requests came in from frontagers that their  private

streets  should be made up by the City Council,  the

City  Council made them up to certain specifications

which  the  Council insisted upon. Once those  roads

were  made  up  to  those specifications,  then  the

Council  declared  them as public streets  and  took

them  over,  from  which time  of  declaration  they

became  public streets and thence forward they  were

repairable  at the expense of public funds.  That  I

must  assume is the position today too. As and  when

owners  require public streets to be made  up,  this

particular  Committee has them made up  and  charges

the  cost  to this particular vote and then recovers

it from the frontagers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now insofar as new development estates are

concerned,  the  policy which was prevalent  when  I

left   the  City  Council  was  that  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust insisted that  all  roads  before

development took place on a particular site be  made

up  to  City  Council standards, or to  Rural  Board

standards, as the case may be, and before any  house

could  be sold the public streets were in fact taken

over  either  by the City Council or  by  the  Rural

Board as the case may be. So I am assuming that this

$500,000  is  in respect of present private  streets

which have not as yet been taken over. That would be

so if the policy of 1957 still prevails.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (13) of  subhead

21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns slabbing over roadside drains

and  the amount for 1963 is $¼ million. Those of  us

who  go along kampong backlanes and roads find  that

some  of the drains are not along the roadside. They

are  right  across  the  roads  and  lanes,  and  if

slabbing  is  put over the roadside drains,  I  hope

that  it will also be put over the drains that cross

the  roads.  The taxis, lorries and so on experience

difficulty  because the drains go right  across  the

roads without any slabbing over them. In some of the

kampongs in Farrer Road, there are cases where right

in  the  middle of the road there is a  drain  going

across and there is no slabbing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I hope the Minister in charge will see

that  this  is  not  followed  literally,  and  that

slabbing should not be just over roadside drains but

also over drains across the roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, this item is mainly for the

slabbing  of  roadside  drains  in  the  City  area,

particularly in the Chinatown area.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In that case, Sir, what about

the kampong lanes? It is no use having lanes made up

when  people wanting to go in taxis find  that  they

cannot  do  so  because of the drains and  then  the

taxis  have to stop. That is the whole trouble  with

some of these country lanes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What sort of drains is the

Member  for Tanglin referring to? Are they  man-made

drains  - drains made by the P.W.D. - or are they  lanes

as a result of erosion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Made by the rural people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rural people? Why do they do

this sort of thing?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Well, I thought the Government

would  know  because  they are in  charge  of  these

areas.  What I saw was that the kampong people  were

compelled to make these drains



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



to  drain  away water from their homes.  Very  often

their  homes are in a higher level and they have  to

drain  away  the water from their homes.  The  water

must  cross  the  roads. So they just  build  drains

across  the  roads.  If  only the  Government,  when

making up these roads, will instruct their engineers

to  provide  some kind of cover, there will  not  be

this unnecessary division of a kampong road into two

or three sections so that people travelling in taxis

have to stop and then walk round.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have never

seen  a  drain across a kampong road at all.  It  is

only  on  the site of a house where a drain  is  not

covered. It has to be covered by the occupant of the

house. I would like to invite the Member for Tanglin

to  show me one day the place where there is a drain

across the road over which a taxi cannot go over.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view .of

the  assurance that the Parliamentary  Secretary  is

prepared  to go personally to inspect some of  these

roads -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Pirate taxis!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - I will be glad to do so.

Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be

21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (14) reads "Street Lighting - (i) Public

Streets; (ii) Agricultural and Kampong Roads"; but I

am  worried  about the omission of private  streets.

The Government has accepted the principle that there

should  be  street  lighting  for  agricultural  and

kampong  roads. There are so-called private  streets

with  no lighting at all, and when the people living

there  switch  off  their lights,  the  whole  place

becomes  totally  dark. In view  of  the  prevalence

nowadays  of people resorting to highway robbery,  I

would suggest that where these private streets  lack

street   lighting,   the  Government   extend   this

privilege to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



the  private streets in view of their acceptance  of

the  principle  of street lighting for  agricultural

and kampong roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I can assure the Member for

Tanglin that this is being considered.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D58 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 21 refers to "Improvements to Roads and

Backlanes".   Sir,  there  is   one   road   in   my

constituency,  Fernhill Road,  which  in  a  curious

manner has been divided into two parts; one part has

been  made  up  as a public road up  to  where  some

members  of  the  staff  of the Commissioner-General

reside, but the other part that goes through a Malay

kampong has been neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the kampong people there are mostly U.M.N.O.

people  and  they did not vote for me.  But  I  went

there   several  times.  I  sent  in   my   petition

requesting for the making-up of the drains  and  the

roads, but nothing has been done these few years. Of

course,  I  made certain enquiries from a Government

Back-bencher and he said that the documents had been

mislaid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the officer in charge will travel along

Fernhill Road, off Stevens Road, he will know what I

mean.  There are two portions: one is neglected  and

the other one is well laid being in a European area.

But since there is going to be no discrimination  in

the  same  area.  I  hope the  Government  will  pay

attention to this particular road and make it up  so

that  there will be no unpleasant comparison between

the two sections of Fernhill Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I remember some years ago

I  tried  to locate the residence of the Member  for

Tanglin.  He was then in Balmoral Road. We tried  to

trace  it  through telephone calls to  his  address.

Eventually we were able to locate him there. But  he

then never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



complained,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  He  was   in   the

Executive Council and he wielded considerable powers

then. He did not want any developments to take place

in this particular estate where he lived before. But

now that he is in the clear, he is asking that there

be road developments in the area where he lives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is not fair, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is surely unfair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, I was at that time

the  Member for Balestier. Therefore, I had to  look

after  my  constituency; and since today  I  am  the

look after this area.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remarks of the Minister seem to

documents  are missing. Now that we have the  Member

for  Upper  Serangoon  present - he  was  formerly  in

charge  of this Committee -  can we, have a word  from

him as to whether he is keeping these documents,  or

any  documents;  and if he still  has  any  official

documents  in his possession, when is  he  going  to

surrender  them  before legal  action  is  taken  to

dispossess him of them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as far as I understand, this  was

the   situation   relating   to   applications   for

standpipes.  When  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim   was

suspended from the P.A.P., I was appointed  Chairman

of   the   Urban  and  Rural  Services  Consultative

Committee   and  I  received  a  great   number   of

applications; but I did not take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



custody  of  the documents. Later when  I  left  the

Urban  and Rural Services Consultative committee,  I

did not take away any relevant document addressed to

this Committee. At that time, this Committee was  in

the  charge of a civil servant who had to  reply  to

letters written by members of the public. As far  as

I  know, this public servant was transferred.  So  I

think the present Chairman of the Committee will  be

able  to  answer how the letters were dealt with  by

this public servant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is completely irrelevant. Further

enquiries can be made departmentally.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, no reply has been given to

my question about Fernhill Road - not the road where I

live  in - a  road  that is a good distance  away  and

where  we  might  say people who  were  there  voted

against me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How do you know?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes, at that time. Sir, I feel

this  particular section has been neglected  and  in

order  to prevent any further discrimination, I  ask

the Government to see that the road is made up.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Surely this is a matter which the

hon. Member can refer to the Minister in charge.  It

is a particular matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is a motion to reduce by $10 the sum

in  respect  of subhead 21 which relates to  general

improvements  to  roads  and  backlanes.  Therefore,

there must be some debate on principle. If there  is

any  particular road to which the Member for Tanglin

wishes  to draw the Minister's attention, surely  he

can do it by letter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I beg leave to withdraw. I will

refer that matter to the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister wishes to make a

reply, he may do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I cannot do anything to help

the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



Tanglin  if  he cannot get the votes of  the  people

down  there. But if he really wants to do  something

for  them, I think he should see the Chairman of the

Urban  and Rural Services Consultative Committee  as

soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, I will do that,

but  I  want  to repeat here that I have written  to

that particular committee twice, I think.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, that has been mentioned three

times!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $33,550,480 for Head D58 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining Heads of Expenditure

in  respect  of  which no amendments stand, on  the

Order  Paper are as shown on page 7 of Paper Cmd.  1

of  1962,  other than the Heads we have dealt  with,

that is, Heads D49, D57, and D58.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sums stated for those Heads as

they  appear in the fourth column of the Summary  of

Expenditure on page 7 of Paper Cmd. I of 1962  stand

1962", put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution to be reported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on

Question (18th January, 1962),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House, taking cognizance of the heroic

struggle of the Indonesian people to liberate  Irian

Barat  from colonial rule, expresses admiration  for

the  determination  and courage  of  the  Indonesian

people and expresses full sympathy with their  hopes

and  aspirations,  and  calls  upon  the  people  of

Singapore to give their wholehearted support to  our

neighbours and friends, the people of Indonesia,  in

their  just and legitimate struggle against colonial

domination." -(Dr Lee Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  at the time of adjournment I  was  urging

Government Members to take this debate seriously.  I

hope  that today they will at least try and  refrain

from  making  frivolous remarks and, as  a  mark  of

respect to the Indonesian people, to take the debate

seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to show the magnitude and importance which

the Indonesian people place on the West Irian issue,

I  just  want  to  quote from a publication  of  the

Indonesian  Government  entitled  "West  Irian,   an

essential part of Indonesia". On page 21:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This West Irian dispute is likely to become an

object of the overall struggle in international

politics. West Irian is a vital problem for

Indonesia which might affect, the basic cause and

development of our national life and politics.'



<br><br>Therefore, Sir, I do not think it is proper for

anyone of us to take this debate lightly. As I said

yesterday, the Indonesians take the West Irian issue

as a very serious issue. It is an issue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



which  involves  thousands of  people,  and  if  the

present  trend  is  kept, inevitably  the  lives  of

thousands of people will be involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister for Culture was trying to

equate  the  Malaysia plan with the Indonesia  claim

over  West  Irian.  This is but an  example  of  the

hollowness of the P.A.P. logic. Briefly  I  want  to

put an end to this once and for all. I have no doubt

that one after another Government speakers are going

to  come forward with the same line. And the  sooner

the  stupidity of this logic is exposed, I think the

better  it will be for all of us. I make this  quite

clear  to the Government Members  - that if they  want

to  talk of Malaysia, let us talk of Malaysia at the

time the Malaysia motion is debated. This motion  is

not  one which involves Malaysia in any way. Neither

is  this a motion which is sought to give the P.A.P.

the opportunity to make political capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the position is this: Malaysia is a plan

which  is perhaps British initiated but nevertheless

backed by British. Whereas West Irian is not, in the

first   place,  being  freely  given  away  to   the

Indonesian  Government. The  Indonesian  claim  over

West  Irian  is  being resisted with all  the  armed

might of the Dutch colonial government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> On a point

of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I take it that the Member will

give a solemn undertaking in respect of the Malaysia

plan, that if the British were to fight us over  the

Borneo territories, then it becomes an anti-colonial

struggle which he will wholeheartedly support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As I said to the Prime Minister

yesterday,  I am not interested in arguing  out  the

Malaysia  issue  on this motion. The Prime  Minister

can raise the same question when the Malaysia motion

comes up for debate,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



and I shall be only too delighted to give a reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You mean you want consultation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Secondly, Sir, the prime movers behind

the  Malaysia  plan  have quite  definitely  certain

ulterior  motives. But there is no  ulterior  motive

behind the Indonesian claim over West Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the sort of independence through merger

that  is  being sold through this Malaysia  idea  is

farcical and is not genuine independence. It is riot

a  plan  which would genuinely enforce the principle

of  self-determination. Whereas, Sir, the Indonesian

desire  to  liberate the people  in  West  Irian  is

founded   on   the   genuine  principle   of   self-determination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on another point of

information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He can interrupt when I have finished,

Sir. I just want to get this point across. After  I

have  finished  making my points,  he  can  ask  for

whatever information he wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Malaysia is not coming about as a result

of  the  unanimous  desire of the  people  in  these

territories. Whereas the call to liberate West Irian

is  the  result of the unanimous wish and desire  of

the people of the whole of Indonesia, including West

Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fifth point is unlike what happened in

Singapore  at the time of separation.  At  the  time

when  the  Dutch decided to retain control  of  West

Irian, there was resistance from all sections of the

population  in  Indonesia.  As  we  know,  when  the

British  colonial  Government  decided  to  separate

Singapore from the mainland, there were many people,

now  in  key positions in the Federation of  Malaya,

who  endorsed  it. Whereas the Indonesians  and  the

Indonesian  Government resisted the  Dutch  plan  to

separate West Irian from Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lastly, to compare the Indonesian claim over

West  Irian to Malaysia I think is trying to  insult

the  Indonesian people. Malaysia, in my view, is  an

anti  Indonesian  plan for the  purposes  of  making

political  capital  to  try  and  equate  these  two

together -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why did you go to Jesselton and

Kuching?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - I say is an insult to the Indonesians.

Sir, I shall answer whatever questions the Ministers

have  when  we  come to the debate on Malaysia.  The

Minister  for  Culture was in Kuching together  with

the  Prime  Minister.  I can  understand  the  Prime

Minister, Sir. He was playing golf most of the time.

So perhaps he did not have the opportunity -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us get on with the motion.

I  would  suggest, as the Member has in  fact  done,

Malaysia can be mentioned in passing only,  and  the

debate on Malaysia, I take it, will be entered  upon

in detail under item 3.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we know how

jealously you guard the personal conduct of  Members

in this House. If I do not guard mine, it might well

be  that I would suffer as a result. Just a personal

explanation of my personal conduct.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on the question of golf?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must rule then that the Member for

Thomson  is out of order because he is now referring

to the personal conduct of the Prime Minister. Under

Standing  Order  46  (10) , the personal  conduct  of

Members  of  the Assembly shall not be  referred  to

except  upon  a substantive motion. The  Member  for

Thomson must refrain from mentioning any golf party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There is one point I must

make.  The Member for Thomson - I read from the Press

reports



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



- having   accused  me  of  having  manipulated   the

Federation  delegation, now accuses me of abandoning

my  duties and playing golf. He has to make  up  his

mind which of the two things he accuses me of having

done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> A number of other things also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> A point of clarification, if the

Member will extend me the courtesy, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged. I am very

interested to hear him say that the Malaysia motion

is an insult to Indonesia. I would appreciate a

clarification of that statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Anti Indonesia plan.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I beg your pardon. An anti Indonesia

plan. I would appreciate clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I did say that I do not want to

start  a  debate  on  Malaysia.  But,  nevertheless,

briefly  I  would  say this, Just  now  when  I  was

talking  about  the personal conduct  of  the  Prime

Minister in Kuching, what I was about to say is that

if  they  had  spent  their time reading  the  local

papers,  then they must have known what I  did  say.

Sir, we have been accused of being anti Malaysia. We

have  been  accused  of  all sorts  of  things.  Our

attitude  is  quite simple. We say  we  support  the

concept   of   Malaysia.  It   was   the   Left-wing

progressive leaders in Indonesia and in  Malaya  who

first  mooted the idea of Malaysia, in this original

concept,  Indonesia was supposed to  have  been  the

heart-land  of Malaysia. But whereas in the  Tunku's

plan, Indonesia is excluded altogether.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You support the original

plan - Malaysia plus Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We are prepared to state our stand on

Malaysia when the time comes. But since the Member

for Anson



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



has asked for clarification, Sir, I just want to say

that  much. Sir, perhaps it would be better for  the

Minister for Culture and the Prime Minister to  read

the Sarawak Times -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would be much obliged -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - and then, when we come to the debate on

Malaysia,  we  would  be saved  a  lot  of  time  in

interruptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I was saying how the Dutch had retained

control  of  West  Irian by  the  use  of  force.  I

explained how today the Indonesian people are forced

to  use force to liberate West Irian, just like  the

Indians were forced to use force to liberate Goa. If

West Irian can be liberated without the use of force

and loss of lives, none will be happier than we, who

wish to see a definite end to colonialism. But, Sir,

it  is  mischievous for the Minister for Culture  to

imply  that  the Barisan Sosialis is  in  favour  of

strife and open conflict between the Indonesians and

the  Dutch. We invite the P.A.P. to state its  stand

clearly and unequivocally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have done so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The statement that they issued was wishy-washy. It was not sufficient. To say that they agree

that  Irian  Barat belongs to the Indonesians,  that

the P.A.P. stand by all those who volunteer to serve

in Indonesia, is not enough. It is not enough to say

that  the P.A.P. will pay the passages of volunteers

from the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We will train them first!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What the people are interested to know

are  not  nice sounding phrases like, "We  are  anti

colonial."  What  the people are  interested  in  is

whether the P.A.P. agrees with the Indonesian policy

of  open confrontation, of open conflict and,  as  a

last  resort, of force (whether used or not) as  the

only language the colonialists can understand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member allowed in this

Chamber to suggest by implication that we should  in

a   similar  way  prepare  for  the  ultimate   open

confrontation by the use of force with our  colonial

authority?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Let him say so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister knows that it is

not  a  point  of  order. It  is  just  a  point  of

argument.  It is not a point of order  which  I  can

take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

seek clarification on this point because I think  it

is  very  important.  In this  Chamber  we  are  all

supposed   to   act   within  the   ambit   of   the

Constitution. If we start in this Chamber to espouse

the  philosophy underlying the pronouncement of  the

Member   for   Thomson,  and  what   we,   as   anti

colonialists, must really do to equip ourselves  for

ultimate   confrontation,  then  he  is,  in   fact,

inciting revolution by violence.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And ultimate revolt!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot see how an exhortation in

this  Chamber offends our Standing Orders,  even  an

exhortation  to use force. It is left  to  the  good

sense  of  this Assembly to see that exhortation  is

not adhered to, not even given any weight to. It  is

not a point of order for me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Will the Member clarify as a

point of information?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would ask the Prime Minister

to  try,  if  he  can,  to obey Standing  Order  48,

paragraph (e) , which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`While a Member is speaking all other Members shall

be silent and shall not make interruptions except as

permitted under the provisions of Standing Order No.

47...'.



<br><br>That  is,  on a point of order or elucidation.  That

does not arise. I have mentioned in the past that  I

do  allow  interjections, and if  they  are  in  the

nature of pleasantries, then I think the Speaker



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



could listen to the debate without any boredom.  But

if  these  interjections be, come  frequent,  become

running  commentaries, then I  think  they  must  be

stopped under the Standing Orders. I am only  trying

to  enforce the standing Orders which have been made

by this Assembly. Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, in his last desperate moments, the

Prime Minister chooses to behave like a thug.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Thomson

endeavours  to make pronouncements on which  I  have

ruled,  then  I might have to ask him  to  stop  his

speech.  I am trying to enforce the rules of  order.

It  is up to the Member for Thomson to continue  his

speech in the light of my ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I have no intention of not following the

rules  of  the  debate. I did preface my  speech  by

saying  that  at least today the Government  Members

will show a sense of seriousness. The Prime Minister

was  not  here just now. Before he came in,  Sir,  I

thought  today at least we could debate this  motion

with  all seriousness; if not for anything, then  at

least  as  a  mark  of  respect for  the  Indonesian

people.  As  soon  as  the Prime  Minister  came  in

[Interruption] -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I want to say this in reply to what

the  Prime  Minister raised just now as a matter  of

clarification. I am not advocating armed revolution,

and the Prime Minister knows this very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not. I am worried about

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Nobody in Singapore is advocating armed

revolution against our colonial power. All that I am

saying is today the Indonesian people are forced  to

take  up  arms  against the Dutch to  liberate  West

Irian,  just as the Indians were forced to  take  up

arms to liberate Goa. It is no use for the P.A.P. to

say,  "We  sympathise  with the Indonesian  people."

This   is   the   position.  Do  they  support   the

Indonesians in their desire to liberate  West  Irian

by peaceful means or otherwise? That is the stand  I

am anxious to see the P.A.P. explain. Does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



the P.A.P. Government condemn Nehru's Government for

its  use of force in Goa? What I would like to  know

is,   will   the  P.A.P.  Government   condemn   the

Indonesian Government should force become necessary?

Sir,  to  say that they are for a peaceful solution,

as  the  Minister  for Culture indicated  yesterday,

without the recognition of the open use of force  by

the  colonialists, is to join the chorus of all  the

protagonists of colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard the hue and cry by the N.A.T.O. powers

when  India was forced to use armed might to  regain

her territory. Sir, if we were to follow in the same

train as the N.A.T.O. powers, we would also have  to

condemn  the  Algerians  for their  heroic  struggle

against French colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Minister for Culture in his speech

ridiculed some of the people who have volunteered to

go to West Irian. He, in fact, Sir -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of correction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I did not ridicule the people

who  volunteered.  I ridiculed the Barisan  Sosialis

who stayed behind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Let the girls volunteer!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if only the Minister had been

patient for a few more minutes, he would have  saved

himself the energy of having to walk up to the Table

and say two uncalled for sentences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by implication, quite definitely he was

ridiculing.   He   said  these   three   women   who

volunteered are Barisan Sosialis members. I did  say

yesterday  I would check up because I did  not  know

whether they were members of the Barisan Sosialis or

not.  I  say this, Sir: they are not members of  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  and we are sorry  they  are  not

members  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  If  they  were

members  of the Barisan Sosialis, we would  be  very

proud indeed. But -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They are too involved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why do you not go there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - it shows, Sir, the sort of things the

P.A.P. is prepared to do to make political capital.

I  would like to use an unparliamentary word and say

what  I  think  of  the Ministers  for  making  this

inaccurate statement, but for parliamentary reasons,

I shall not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister was also trying to show that we in the Barisan Sosialis are not genuine anti- colonialists -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Dutchmen of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - the Dutchmen of Malaysia, and trying to

say  that  we were not courageous people because  we

were  sending our women. In fact, the three of them,

as  I  have said, are not our members. I hate indeed

to   measure  the  extent  of  anti-colonialism   in

individual human beings. But since the Minister  has

ventured  to  say this, and since I  have  no  doubt

other  speakers, including our great Prime Minister,

the great one-time anti-colonialist, would be taking

the same line, I might as well say one or two things

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody in Singapore knows how anti-colonial our

Prime  Minister was at one time, to  the  extent  of

saying, "Cut out the Harry Lee Kuan Yew."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, the P.A.P. organised a rally

for  Dr Ferhat Abbas. There is a story behind this.

It  was not the P.A.P. who made the first move. Some

students in the University of Malaya Socialist  Club

contacted Dr Ferhat Abbas when he was in Indonesia,

got  him  to agree to address the people  here,  and

then  applied for a permit. The permit went  to  the

Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  and  then  the   Prime

Minister  came to know about it. The P.A.P. thought

it  would be very embarrassing for them if they (led

by the Prime Minister), who were supposed to be anti-colonial, did not do anything about it. The students

wanted  to hold a mass rally. Therefore, the  P.A.P.

refused permission for the rally requested by me -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. In my subsequent speech I

will want to elaborate on that in reply. Would I  be

in order, Mr Speaker, Sir? It is very important.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just about to say that this

seems  to be completely away from the motion. I  was

wondering whether the Member for Thomson can  relate

that to the West Irian issue. When the Minister  for

Culture spoke about Malaysia, he was always  on  the

borderline.  He  was skimming on the borderline  and

relating  his  references to Malaysia  to  the  West

Irian  problem. If the Member for Thomson can relate

this  to the West Irian problem, then perhaps I will

allow him to continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, this one particular incident, of

course,  is in no way related to West Irian,  but  I

was  saying  this  as a reply to  the  Minister  for

Culture.  It  is  no use coming to  this  House  and

trying to measure how anti-colonial one human  being

is. We did not start this thing. But we say that  if

they  want  to  start it, we are quite  prepared  to

carry it through to its logical conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> But if -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - your political grave. Sir, there were

many such examples. We say this. If it were not  for

the  fact  that the P.A.P. leadership,  particularly

the  Prime  Minister,  had  lost  the  anti-colonial

fervour, there would have been a different situation

today. Sir, we -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of information. I told -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister must not

speak  if  the  Member has not given way.  Will  the

Member give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your pardon. Having lost

such a valuable thing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



called the anti-colonial fervour which I value  very

much, I would like to know when and where I lost it,

in order that I can go and find it again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I will tell him that. Sir. Go to the

Colonial Office in London and search for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> When?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Eden Hall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He has money. Sir, I do not have. He can

just  fly  to London. He can go and search where  he

has left it and he can find it quite easily.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir. It is very -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No. I am prepared to give way to the

Prime   Minister  if  he  will  stop  making   these

frivolous  remarks. I am not going to let him  waste

the  time of the House and reduce the debate on this

motion to frivolity. He can have his say at the  end

of my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to say that the P.A.P. are for only a

peaceful solution to the West Irian dispute  without

recognition  of the fact that the colonialists  want

to  use  force, is not proper. Sir, we  say  if  the

P.A.P. are truly anti-colonial and believe in  what

they  say, then invite them unreservedly to  support

the   Indonesian   people  in  their   anti-colonial

struggle. Have no qualifications. Also, we tell them

to stop hindering others in their campaign to gather

support  for the Indonesian cause. Let them  not  on

the pretext of a few Municipal laws and regulations,

allow  the  police to intimidate those  who  put  up

posters calling for support -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is an allegation that

the police intimidate. I take it that the Member for

Thomson has evidence that the police intimidated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We understand that some people who went

around  putting  up posters were called  up  by  the

police and interrogated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Did they have permits?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But we tell them this, Sir, let them not

use the pretext of these Municipal laws. If they are

anti-colonial, let them give unqualified support  to

the  Indonesian people. Why must you prevent  people

from putting up posters -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Do you like one poster on your

front door?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - and use other regulations to try to

hinder  other people from organising this  campaign?

Sir,  I  am not particularly interested in having  a

poster pasted in my house, but if the Prime Minister

himself  takes  a poster and comes to  my  house  to

paste  it  with  an Indonesian slogan,  I  shall  be

indeed -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Honoured.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - honoured, because I would then think

that at least [Interruption] he has one tiny drop of

anti-colonial sentiment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What is the sense of the talk?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what the Prime

Minister  is up to. I do not know whether he  wishes

to  reduce this Assembly to a House where  a  debate

could be conducted without order. I only ask him  to

try  to contain himself  - he will have an opportunity

of  speaking - and let the Member for Thomson carry on

without interruption. Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

information - this is the last time. In  view  of  the

request the Member for Thomson has made for my anti-colonial fervour to be evinced, can he inform me  of

the  size  of his front door so that I can take  the

necessary  steps  to demonstrate to  him  the  anti-colonial fervour?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think Members should not ask such

frivolous questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I agree with you, Sir. We saw posters

being put up with total disregard for Municipal laws

in  the  case of the reception for Dr Ferhat  Abbas

and in the case of the Lumumba rally. Sir, it is not

that we in the Barisan Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



think  we  are  above the law. It is not  only  that

precedents have been set but that Municipal laws are

made for definite purposes - an objective which I  see

bears no relation to the West Irian dispute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the P.A.P. believes in what it says and if

it  is not to appear as merely paying lip service to

the  slogan of anti-colonialism, let it not  try  to

dampen  the  enthusiasm of our people's support  for

the Indonesian people's struggle by resorting to the

use of petty Municipal regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan Sosialis can quite understand

that the P.A.P. leadership cannot afford to show too

much  enthusiasm in supporting the Indonesian people

and  their  anti-colonial  movement.  In  the  first

place, that will lead to a strengthening of our  own

ant-colonial  fervour in Singapore  which  will,  of

course,  be  extremely embarrassing  to  the  P.A.P.

leaders who have chosen to abandon their former anti-colonial  sprit.  In  the  second  place,  it   will

embarrass  the Tunku who has preferred to remain  on

the sidelines on this issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

getting out of order if he criticises the conduct of

the  Prime  Minister of a nation with which  we  are

very friendly. I would suggest that he should not in

his speech embark on criticism of the Tunku.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I did not do that. This is not a

criticism  of the conduct of the Prime  Minister  of

the  Federation of Malaya. All that I am  saying  is

the  fact  that  the Prime Minister  of  Malaya  has

stated  that he is neutral on the West Irian  issue.

We  then  think  that if the P.A.P. shows  too  much

enthusiasm,   it  could  be  embarrassing   to   the

Federation Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a very important point

of order. May I ask you for your ruling on it first?

A very important statement has been made with regard

to the freedom of action of the Singapore Government

in  this  matter.  It  has been suggested  that  the

Federation  Government can either  conscribe  the  freedom  of  action or the stand  of  the  Singapore

Government. On a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



point  of order, may I ask you when it would  be  an

appropriate  time  to  make a categorical  statement

utterly  and  completely rejecting  this  falsehood,

because  it not only affects technically our foreign

relations with the Federation of Malaya but  it  is,

in  fact,  an insult to the conduct of the Singapore

Government in these circumstances?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Since the comment was made by the

Member for Thomson, I think the Prime Minister  will

be  perfectly in order when he speaks to  make  some

reference to that aspect. Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we appeal to the P.A.P., if they

themselves   do   not   want  to   be   enthusiastic

participants in the anti-colonial movement of  Afro-Asia,  let  them  not  try to dissuade  others  from

participating. Let them not say, in  the  open,  "Go

ahead,"  and on the quiet say, "You cannot do  this.

You  cannot do that." Let them not indulge in double

talk  and  double dealing. Sir, let us all  in  this

House be consistent in our anti-colonial stand.  The

struggle against colonialism is the struggle of  all

self-respecting men who have the courage to be free.

Sir,  we  admire  the  Indonesian  people  who   are

prepared  to sacrifice their sons and daughters  for

freedom.  Let us in Singapore all derive inspiration

and courage from the determination of the Indonesian

people.  Let those in the P.A.P. especially rekindle

their  former  anti-colonial fervour  and  join  the

people  of  Afro-Asia  in the struggle  against  the

degradation and suffocation of colonial domination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, colonialism is the sourge of our times. It is

an  abominable ingredient of imperialism - an economic

system  that thrives on the exploitation of  man  by

fellowman.   Sir,  it  is  a  system   that   brings

degradation  and  demoralisation, not  only  to  the

victims  but  also to the colonial powers.  We  have

seen  the French who fought so courageously Hitler's

Fascism but who are now applying the Fascist  method

of  aggression on the Algerian people to  keep  them

suffocated. The utterly inhuman atrocities inflicted

on the people of Angola and Algeria have shocked the

conscience



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



of  mankind.  This makes utter nonsense  of  Western

propaganda  that colonialism is a benevolent  system

and that it is prepared to die a willing death.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What about Budapest?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I can understand how any strong attack on

the colonialists hurts the P.A.P. Front-benches, so

much so that -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No. The greed of colonial masters has

reduced them to sub-human characters with no human

conscience.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The

Member  referred  to  sub-human characters.  Was  he

referring to Members of this House?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether the Member for

Thomson was referring to Members of this Assembly as

sub-human  characters. I do not really know  whether

that  is offensive or not. Perhaps the Member  would

like to inform the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was not using the term with reference

to  Members  of  this House but if Members  of  this

House   - [Interruption] but I  shall  abide  by  your

ruling  because, as I have said, I have no intention

of indulging in frivolous arguments on this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that, as a mark of respect, we

should  be serious on the West Irian issue.  If  the

Government  wants  to carry out a political  battle,

there  is the question of Malaysia and there are  so

many   other   matters  on  the  Order  Paper.   The

Government  always has the right  and  privilege  to

move more motions. We can then have - if you will bear

with  us,  Sir - days and days of debate so  that  the

Prime  Minister will be satisfied that parliamentary

democracy is in operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I wish to say that Irian Barat

is  an  ugly symbol of colonial domination in  Asia.

The  struggle of the Indonesian people  to  liberate

Irian  Barat is the struggle of all oppressed people

throughout the world. We in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



who are still living under the yoke of colonial rule

cannot  remain  neutral on this burning  issue.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, there is no neutralism in the struggle

for  freedom. Let us declare our stand unequivocally

on the side of the Indonesian people.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that no one,

with  national  spirit and undivided loyally,  could

oppose  any effort of the Indonesian people  to  get

back  West  Irian  from the Dutch.  The  P.A.P. has

clearly  shown  its  support  for  the  Republic  of

Indonesia in its demand for West Irian. Mr Speaker,

as  explained by the Minister for Culture yesterday,

an agreement has been signed when the Prime Minister

went  on a goodwill visit to Indonesia. But on  this

motion  moved by the Barisan Sosialis: Is  it  moved

with  honest intentions, Mr Speaker, Sir?  For  the

reasons  given,  if  we follow the  tactics  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis, it is clear that this  motion  is

not  honest. We can afford to look further. We  only

have  to look at the symbol of the Barisan Sosialis,

which  is a circle and a star. It is like a crescent

and  a star. That is the symbol of the Muslims. This

is confusing to the Muslim religion. The Chairman of

the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, has

also  said  that this motion is the  decision  of  a

rally  held in Geylang Serai two weeks ago. Why  has

the  Barisan  Sosialis selected  Geylang  Serai  for

holding  this  rally in order to get a  solution  on

Irian  Barat? Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis  has

quite  a  number of times held rallies at  Choa  Chu

Kang,  Hong  Lim,  and  Paya Lebar,  but  has  never

mentioned  anything  about Irian  Barat.  They  have

mentioned   only  phoney  merger  and   second-class

citizenship. West Irian and the resolution  made  at

the rally in Geylang Serai have been talked about in

the  coffee-shops. What the P.A.P. has said,  is  it

not  enough? And the resolution taken at the  rally,

is it not enough?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government of Indonesia through their representatives here require volunteers from here. Has any member of the Barisan Sosialis registered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



his name as a volunteer? This is a  motion

which  only tries to confuse two issues. First,  the

Malaysia issue, and second, West Irian. From this it

is  clear  that  the motion brought forward  by  the

Barisan Sosialis is clearly dishonest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter mentioned is that the Government

has taken steps in regard to posters. If the Barisan

Sosialis  is  really sincere in holding  rallies  in

support  of the Republic of Indonesia in its demand,

why then should those who stick posters work late at

night?  Have  they no other time to  stick  posters?

Even if the Barisan Sosialis can work about 16 hours

one day, it does not reach up to 2 a.m. If they work

16  hours or 2 hours a day, why must it take them up

to 2 a.m. to stick up posters? Is this an honest and

sincere way of doing things? So it is clear that the

question  brought  up in this Assembly  is  only  an

attempt to confuse the two issues. As I have clearly

stated, the Barisan symbol itself is confusing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the debate on the Commission of Inquiry

into the educational policy -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member

should  touch on that. That has been completed.  Let

us continue with the motion on West Irian.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I only

wish  to  mention  the  dishonesty  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  The  Commission  of  Inquiry   into   the

educational -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have asked the hon. Member

not to harp on that. He has made his point, I think.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

motion which has been moved in this Assembly by  the

Barisan  Sosialis is merely to confuse  the  people.

The  situation confronting us is Malaysia  and  West

Irian.  I hope that tomorrow or the day after  there

will  be members of the Barisan Sosialis registering

themselves  voluntarily for West Irian to  join  the

Indonesians  to get back West Irian. As  the  Member

for Thomson has said, only to express support is not

enough.  So  have  members of the  Barisan  Sosialis

welcomed   the  appeal  made  by  the  Republic   of

Indonesia?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  the motion before this House  is  not

going  to  help the Indonesians one iota. When  this

motion  is passed, as I know it will be, it  is  not

going to make any difference to the position of  the

Indonesians  in the eyes of the world, nor  will  it

help   Indonesia   physically   to   overcome    the

stubbornness of the Dutch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we in this Assembly have said all that we

have  to  say,  the  position  both  militarily  and

politically  will  be the same  in  so  far  as  the

Indonesians are concerned. They are not going to get

more  guns, nor are they going to get more manpower.

They have this in abundance. In fact, this motion is

more  of  an embarrassment to the Indonesian  people

and  the  Indonesian Government.  For  once  in  the

history  of  the  struggle for party  domination  in

Singapore,   the  Government  and  the   people   of

Indonesia are going to be led deliberately into  the

quagmire of local politics, as indeed they have been

when  the  Consul-General  of  Indonesia  wisely  or

unwisely  instructed a representative of his  to  be

present at the mass meeting held in Geylang Serai by

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know with what motive the mass meeting

was  held,  and  why it was held in a  predominantly

Malay   constituency.  The  organisers  hoped   that

because  of  the  sentiments of the Malays  for  the

Indonesians,  the  Malay masses from  Geylang  Serai

would come out in their thousands to hear the famous

orators of the great anti-colonialists. But,  as  it

turned  out, no such thing happened. Very few Malays

appeared on the scene.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> How many?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> UMNO's estimate was less than

200. Some came out of curiosity, and a few were sent

by  my  Party to assess the support for the meeting.

This  all goes to prove that the Malays of Singapore

have  enough sense in their heads to be able to draw

a  line  between political propaganda and  political

convictions.  I do agree there were a  few  thousand

people  at  the meeting, not 10.000 as suggested  by

the leader of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He went up to more than 10,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I know my Geylang Serai

very well. That is my constituency and I live around

there. The field in which the meeting was held could

at  one  time accommodate 10,000 people. We had  our

mass  meetings there during the elections. In  fact,

we  had  a few thousand more. But now with half  the

field  occupied  by permanent stalls  and  itinerant

hawkers,  a  car park, four to five thousand  people

were, in my opinion, a fair estimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the point I am making is that those who

went  to the meeting did not come from the vicinity.

They  came from various parts of the island in lorry

loads, no doubt organised by the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Buses.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> There were some buses. Sir, that

was the best the Barisan could produce, and I do not

think I need say anything more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the motion, I have no doubt that

the  general sentiments of this House will  see  the

motion through, even though we are not blind to  the

intent   behind  it.  I,  Sir,  have  followed   the

Indonesian struggle for independence from  the  very

beginning,  and  I can proudly say that  in  my  own

small way I have contributed my share, not by making

speeches,  but  by getting myself  involved  in  the

struggle. When many Members in this House, including

the Member for Thomson, were still in school in 1946

and  1947, I was smuggling guns for the Indonesians.

I  was  smuggling  guns  into  Pekan  Bahru - not  for

profit, Sir, but because of my firm conviction  that

the  Indonesian fight against the Dutch colonialists

was my fight too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today what do we have? We have a motion in

the name of the Barisan Sosialis calling upon us  to

take  cognizance  of  the  heroic  struggle  of  the

Indonesian  people,  to express full  sympathy  with

their  hopes and aspirations, and to call  upon  the

people   of  Singapore  to  give  their  fullhearted

support. Sir, what does this amount to? Simply this.

It means that no one is going to shed any blood over

West Irian. Let us pay a bit of lip



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



service and embarrass all political opponents!  That

is  the  theme of this motion. Those of us who  have

followed  the  recent political trends in  Singapore

will  understand what I mean. Indeed, Sir,  politics

in  Singapore can be very dirty. There  is  a  Malay

saying which goes: "Kuman di-seberang lautan nampak;

gajah di-bibir mata ta' kelihatan", which means,  in

English,  germs that cross the sea are visible,  but

invisible  to  you  with the elephants  before  your

eyes.  That  sums  up the attitude  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. They can see colonialism at work in  Irian

Barat  but  colonialism in Singapore and the  Borneo

territories does not exist to them.



<br><br>4.47 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in this august Assembly, we spent weeks debating the eradication of colonialism in our part of the world. Now, did the Barisan Sosialis Members contribute anything constructive towards it? An hon. Member: Nothing.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> The answer is no. Right through

the  debate  both inside and outside  this  Chamber,

their  line  has  been  the  same.  Let  colonialism

flourish  in Singapore. If you cannot get merger  on

their  terms, then let Singapore remain as  a  self-governing  colony  without  the  Internal   Security

Council. At least the Member for Anson, much  though

I dislike his politics, has an alternative. He wants

an independent Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Under the United Nations!



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, as I have said earlier,

this motion and the way the debate is going on is an

embarrassment to the Indonesian Government.  I  hone

the  people or the Government of Indonesia will  not

take  to  heart what is being said in the  Assembly.

We, and I particularly, who have lived with them and

who  have close relations with Indonesia, would like

it  to be recorded that our, and my, sympathies  are

with   Indonesia   in   its  fight   against   Dutch

colonialism. To the Barisan Sosialis, let me say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



this. Let us first of all put our own house in order

before we help to put other people's house in order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that and having recorded my

Party's  views, we from the Alliance are  abstaining

from voting. We do not want to be a party to what is

obviously  an  attempt to introduce  party  politics

into  the  affairs of a foreign country.  Sir,  what

else  can we, or can I and my Party, do when only  a

moment ago there stood up the prophet from Thomson -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> False prophet!



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> - who made clear his Party's

stand on this issue? Malaysia, he said, was an anti-Indonesian  plan. This is the type of respect  which

the  Barisan  Sosialis leaders have for our  leader,

Yang Teramat Mulia, Tunku Abdul Rahman. This is  the

stupid  attitude  his  Party  has  adopted  for  the

greatest  anti-colonialist of Malaya. Sir,  we  from

the Alliance will not forget it.



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen):</b> No speakers? Dr

Lee Siew Choh, in reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I am going to speak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why do you not stand up

earlier?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think I asked hon. Members

and  nobody responded to my question. There was even

no sign that anybody wanted to speak.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was

just  trying  to  pass a message to the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  to consult the Member for Geylang  Serai

whether   he  would  ask  the  Member  for   Kampong

Kembangan to speak.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Toh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Sneaker, we all know

that  in  this  world today, a very important  force

which  is  driving the people of Asia and Africa  is

the force of nationalism. Asia and Africa, including

South-East Asia, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



for  the  past century been dominated by the Western

imperial  powers.  The  Western  powers  have   made

inroads into these large tracts of land, firstly, in

the   form   of  commerce  and  trade,  subsequently

followed   by  preaching  missionaries,   and   then

ultimately followed by the gunboat. The time is past

when  a  gunboat alone can subdue the  nationalistic

spirit of the people in Asia and Africa. Once upon a

time Africa was represented to us as the white man's

grave.  Indeed, Africa was the white  man's  burden.

But today we find that the whole of Africa has found

that  it  is the white man who is a burden upon  the

Africans.  It is because of this that we  find  that

Africa  has  been  torn today  into  several  States

fighting against colonialism. The House will  recall

that  in  the  last Session, I had  the  honour  and

privilege  to move a motion supporting the  struggle

of  the  Algerian people against French colonialism.

The  House will still recall how we received the pro

tem Prime Minister of the provisional Government  of

Algeria,  and  that we in this House at  that  time,

together   with  the  people  of  Singapore,   fully

supported the cause of the Algerian struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a similar motion with similar

sentiments,  that  this  House  should  endorse  its

confidence  in  the  confidence  of  the  Afro-Asian

people to fight external domination. It is true that

today  we  see  in Africa a bitter struggle  against

colonialism in which violence has been employed.  It

is  true  that  Goa has been retaken by  the  Indian

Government by the use of force. But, Sir,  while  we

are  in full support of all colonial peonies against

their masters, at the same time, we cannot but  feel

sorry  that this anti-colonial struggle  has  to  be

conducted  by  violence. Now, it is not  because  we

fear  bloodshed ourselves. It is not because we fear

that  peace and tranquillity will be disturbed  that

we  regret indeed that force should ever be used  at

any  time  to solve political problems. It  must  be

quite  clear  to  us, as we have  mentioned  in  our

statement to the Press last month, that any  violent

struggle  in  any part of the world is bound,  under

modern  conditions,  to draw in  the  major  powers.

Whilst we fully sympathise with the Indonesian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



Government in their aspirations to  recover

their  sovereignty in West Irian, a sympathy  which,

in  fact the Prime Minister has expressed during his

state visit to Jakarta, we must at the same time try

to   look  at  the  problem  objectively  and   with

farsightedness. If it should come to pass that  over

the  issue of West Irian, a violent struggle erupts,

it  is  not  impossible that other powers  would  be

drawn into the struggle. Members have been aware  of

the  statements which have been issued in the  Press

by the Prime Minister of Australia and by the leader

of  the  Opposition in the Australian Parliament  of

their   own   fears   of  the  consequences   of   a

conflagration  in West Irian. Sir, Members  in  this

House must still remember -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think this is a

convenient time for tea. I suspend the sitting until

half-past five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>5.00 until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, when we broke up for tea

just  now, I was making an allusion to the Bukit  Ho

Swee  Fire. The fire could have started from  a  few

sparks in a solitary attap house. But when the  fire

broke out in that little attap house, the people who

were  living in the neighbourhood did not, or  could

not  control or isolate that little fire. The result

was  that  what would have been only a  little  fire

very  rapidly became a conflagration until it became

a  disaster for a very large part of Singapore.  Try

to  project the course of events that may happen  if

in  any  part  of  this world we have  also  such  a

political fire. Members of this House who  claim  to

be  well read surely should be aware that one of the

difficulties  which  the  modern  world   faces   is

containment  of  political fires. We  have  seen  it

happen  in Laos, we have seen it happen in  Vietnam,

we  have  seen it happening in Africa, and  all  the

while it is the task of all those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



who  subscribe  to the ideals of the United  Nations

Charter to try and contain these little fires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not pretend to be a fierce speaker;

neither  do I pretend that I can agitate anybody  to

go  into a fight. The last thing I will do is to try

and  make  fierce speeches or speak very loudly  and

push  other  people to the front  line  without  due

consideration of consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sufficiently old when the war broke out in

Malaya  in 1941 to understand, to know and  to  feel

what  war  is. I would never want that we  who  have

lived  through one war should, by our own stupidity,

get  involved  into another war, or implicate  those

who  are innocent in the sufferings of another  war.

My  allusion  to the Bukit Ho Swee fire as  starting

from  a  little spark which reached the roof  of  an

attap  house  can  be  applied very  easily  to  the

situation in South-East Asia. As I have said at  the

beginning,  we  are in sympathy with all  those  who

fight  against  colonialism.  The  question  of  New

Guinea  or  Irian  Barat has  been  a  long-standing

question, but until lately, no real fighting has yet

broken out between Indonesia and Holland over  Irian

Barat. As long as there are possibilities that  this

question  of  the  control of the Administration  of

Irian  Barat can be discussed objectively in a  calm

atmosphere  to  which the United Nations  subscribe,

then  I  say  we  ought to encourage both  sides  to

proceed  along these lines. There is indeed  genuine

tension which is developing in South-East Asia  over

Irian  Barat. It is happening not only in Indonesia.

There   is   not  only  excitement  in  Malaya   and

Singapore,  but also in the continent of  Australia.

In  the  Straits Times of 1st January, there  was  a

Reuter report saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Australian Prime Minister, Mr Robert Menzies,

warned   Indonesia  yesterday  that  any  Indonesian

attack  on  Dutch  New  Guinea  could  turn  into  a

conflict  between the white and coloured peoples  in

this part of the world.'



<br><br>To  which the President of the Republic of Indonesia

has  replied, if I may quote the Free Press  of  3rd

January:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any nation lays charges against us it must be

acting on the Dutch plan to set up a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



puppet Papuan state. We must stand up and fight it.'



<br><br>Following  those  statements,  there  has  been   an

atmosphere  of  some  excitement amongst  well-known

leaders in Australia. A Reuter report carried by the

Straits Times of 5th January said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The wartime-commander of Australia's 8th Division

in Malaya, Lieut.-General Gordon Bennett, said today

a  national  service training scheme should  be  re-introduced immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that Australia "would not last 10 minutes"

if attacked from the North by an Asian power.



<div align="center"><h4>* * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are in no danger from Indonesia at the moment,

but  when  she gets a little more uppish  she  could

flirt with Russia."'



<br><br>To follow up the line of excitement that is going on

in South-East Asia, another Reuter report carried by

the Straits Times of 12th January, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A survey taken in the light of the developing West

New  Guinea  crisis showed that Australia  had  more

than  83,000  men virtually on call for  service  if

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canberra correspondent of the Melbourne Herald

said  yesterday  that  of these  about  47,000  were

regular  army, navy or air force personnel  on  full

time service.



<div align="center"><h4>* * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 200,000 men have completed basic national

service training, mainly in the army.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this rattling of the sabre rather alarms

me,  because the question of West Irian is no longer

an  isolated  problem.  It is  no  longer  a  tussle

between the Republic of Indonesia and the Government

of  Holland. There is every possibility that if real

war  breaks out in the Pacific then we, in this part

of the world, may very well become engulfed -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Member for Anson was a

prisoner  of war in the last war. He knew  what  the

sufferings of war were like. Sir, I do not  pre  end

to  be a brave hero although I did my little bit  in

the  Medical Auxiliary Service during the war. I had

attended  enough wounded people and  carried  enough

corpses  and  washed enough lavatories to  know  the

miseries  of war. We in the P A.P. are not going  to

make fierce speeches or shout empty slogans inciting

people to volunteer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



for something which they cannot understand. Take for

instance  our  three  young  lady  vo1unteers  whose

picture appeared in the Straits Times. Sir, they are

in their 20s: one of them has just graduated from  a

middle  school.  They were little  babies  when  the

Japanese invaded Malaya. They have no idea  of  what

war  is.  Yet  we have stupid people,  evil  people,

behind  them who are making use of them as political

propaganda. A mother of four, a seamstress, a recent

graduate   of  a  high  school,  wanting  to   fight

colonialism  by signing up to fight in  West  Irian!

Sir, if they wish to do it, we will not stop them. I

can   understand   their   fervour   against   anti-colonialism. But, at the same time, I say that  they

are too young to know what it is all about. It is  a

problem  that  is  not going to involve  just  three

girls; it is a problem that is going to involve  the

whole of South and South-East Asia and the whole  of

the Pacific region. Therefore, I plead to Members of

this  House to try and look at this problem  with  a

little  more  foresightedness and to  think  of  the

consequences  that will come in the train  of  their

speeches.  Rash  people  make  rash  speeches,   but

unfortunately people who make rash speeches  do  not

pay the penalty. It is others who pay the penalty.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And that is what I strongly

object to, the fierce slogans shouted by the Barisan

Sosialis.  We ask the 13 of them who shouted  fierce

slogans   at   Geylang  Serai - are  they   going   to

volunteer? The Member for Choa Chu Kang was  a  baby

when  the  war broke out. The Member for Bras  Basah

was sucking her mother's paps at that time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I can appreciate that the

Deputy Prime Minister is in a serious mood. But even

in  his  serious  mood,  perhaps  he  could  try  and

modulate his language.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> She was a suckling baby in

swaddling clothes when the Japanese over-ran Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take a stand - I express my

sympathy to the Indonesian Government in their claim

for  sovereignty over West Irian. I  would,  at  the

same  time,  appeal to both the Indonesian  and  the

Dutch Governments to use to the utmost all available

means for a peaceful settlement.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And in this sense, I must also

support  the  plea of .he Secretary-General  of  the

United Nations, U Thant, that a peaceful solution of

the  Western  New  Guinea dispute should  be  sought

within the chambers of the United Nations. I do  not

say  that  Goa is necessarily a precedent for  other

future  violent  attacks  against  territories.   It

should  not  be. In fact, it was with a  feeling  of

regret and sorrow when I read in the Press that  Goa

had  been  recovered by force of arms. It  was  with

regret indeed and for a very simple reason. In 1959,

I  was  asked  to  make a speech to commemorate  the

birthday  anniversary  of Mahatma  Gandhi  before  a

society  in  Singapore, and when I made  the  speech

quoting passages of Mahatma Gandhi's life and of Mr

Nehru's life, I believe in all my fervour that India

stood for peace -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Which it does.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - and neutralism. We must always

face an important decision sometime or other, but in

carrying  out the decision it is important  that  we

must  also consider the means. I do not believe that

any action taken should only be the means to an end.

If  every  State were to subscribe to the idea  that

action  is only a means to an end. I am afraid  that

very few of us are going to survive in the next  few

years.   Therefore,  I  repeat,  while  the   P.A.P.

supports and is in sympathy with the claims  of  the

Indonesian    Government    that    the     internal

administration  in  Western  New  Guinea  should  be

settled, we also say that we hope it will be settled

not  by  a  conflagration or by a war,  but  through

peaceful  mediation  in the highest  ideals  of  the

United  Nations to which the Republic  of  Indonesia

itself is a member State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the issue of Irian

Barat raises emotional reactions throughout Asia  in

a manner which completely baffles Western observers.

I  have  been repeatedly asked, "How can you support

Indonesia  and her stand on Irian Barat? Surely  the

Dutch  have  been reasonable. Why do you  lend  your

support  to the specious propaganda agitation?"  Mr

Speaker,  I  have had some experience  in  answering

this  type of question. I think it might be  helpful

to  this  Assembly if we do consider dispassionately

the  `basic  issues  so  as to  understand  our  own

feelings which are so deeply sympathetic towards the

people of Irian Barat and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister speaks truly when he says there is a great deal of ignorance on the basic issues. But there is a curious phenomenon in ths. In most human conduct, many human beings seem to achieve the right approach without ever being able to tell you of the logical means or even of an understanding of the issues which could help to a

logical  solution of the issues. I do say  that  our

people have reached the right result, although I  am

bound  to  admit that due to an inadequate Press  we

are  gravely  inadequately  informed  on  the  basic

issues, and I would ask the indulgence of this House

if  I  seek to go back a little to the things which

motivate  our feelings and the facts - some  of  which

are  quite  favourable  to  the  Dutch - which  should

affect our judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Asia had for two centuries been politically,

economically,  and  militarily  enslaved  by   white

domination. For these two centuries, the  people  of

Asia had been prostrate, wallowing in the tragedy of

helplessness, whilst others robbed us of our wealth,

our  energy and even of our manhood. Then  a  little

more   than  half  a  century  ago,  the  liberation

movement  found sparks in India, and that spread  to

China,  to  Indonesia and elsewhere, and the  little

rivulet  of  more than half a century  ago  grew  in

strength and became a surge so strong against while



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



domination  that  the  British  were  compelled   to

withdraw from vast areas. And with their traditional

wisdom, they withdrew gracefully. The Dutch withdrew

from  considerable areas of what  is  now  known  as

Indonesia under military and political pressure. The

Portuguese have been kicked out. The French lost  on

the battlefield. This surge against white domination

has  become of the very marrow of our bones.  It  is

part  of us. All Asia today consciously resents  any

white domination anywhere in this continent. I would

like it to be clearly understood and recognised that

this is not an anti-white movement. We are happy  to

welcome the white men as any other human beings,  as

colleagues   and  partners.  It  is  an   anti-white

domination  movement.  It  is  a  movement   against

foreign  domination of our people. Let us  recognise

that   even  today  there  are  pockets   of   white

domination   and   white   imperialism   in    Asian

territories,  and it is this which  the  decent  and

peace-loving  people of Singapore  resent  from  the

depths  of  their  being. It is  this  that  is  the

explanation  of  the emotional speeches  which  have

been  made  and are being made and will probably  be

made. The Deputy Prime Minister deplores -  and I  can

understand  his point of view  - slogans  which  could

inflame  feelings to the point of sparking violence.

But let us recognise that to the people of Singapore

Irian Barat is an island in Asia and its people  are

Asians. Irian Barat is under the control of a  white

people  and  under the domination of a  white  race.

That  is enough. This is the first and main fact  of

life  that Western observers must recognise and must

understand, that Asia will not tolerate -  and I  mean

all Asian nations  -  that any Asian territory be longer

dominated by a European power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fact of life which has been little

understood  even in the United Nations - and  frankly,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in all otherwise admirable speech

by the Deputy Prime Minister, even little understood

by   the   Deputy  Prime  Minster  himself - are   the

circumstances  in  which it  is  legitimate  to  use

force. Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



I   say   to   you - and  it  is  not  for  propaganda

purposes - that I sincerely believe that the  Workers'

Party  and  I  are  as genuinely  dedicated  to  the

principle of peace amongst nations and international

goodwill as any other group of human beings. Perhaps

it  is in our own interest. We recognise that we are

a  small  people and we could not survive except  in

peace. But I believe that we go further than that. I

say,  Sir,  that  Mr  Adlai Stevenson,  the  United

States   representative  in  the   United   Nations,

erred - and erred grievously - when he laid down in  the

debate  on  Goa that force can only be  legitimately

used  to  meet immediate aggression. We  accept  the

principle  of  self-defence, but we say  it  is  not

exclusive. We would add that in the case of colonies

there  are two other sets of circumstances in  which

force  is legitimate. The first is nationally, where

a  people seeks to free itself from imperialist  and

foreign  domination  within its  territory,  as  the

Indonesian struggle for its own independence against

the  Dutch.  The  second  set  of  circumstances  is

internationally, where a nation seeks to  free  part

of   its  territory  and  its  people  from  foreign

imperial domination, such as the action of India  in

Goa. The only proviso - and a vital proviso - that we of

the  Workers' Party recognise in these two  sets  of

circumstances  is  that every  reasonable  means  of

peaceful   settlement   should   first   have   been

attempted -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about Hungary?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - and no means is left but force.

That,  Sir, I feel sure muse be recognised.  Members

are  aware that when this issue was debated  in  the

United   Nations  a  short  while  ago,  Mr   Adlai

Stevenson sought to censure India for aggression  in

liberating Goa by force, although he was aware  that

Goa  was  geographically and  historically  part  of

Indian  territory.  Mr  Speaker,  let  it  not   be

misunderstood: I am not anti-American and I have the

deepest  respect  for the intellectual  stature  and

exquisite phraseology of that gentleman.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



It  is with regret that I noticed his incapacity  to

recognise the legitimate right of a nation  to  free

part   of  its  territory  from  continued  imperial

rule - an incapacity, if I might suggest, Mr Speaker,

due to partial amnesia in respect of the h story  of

his own nation. Mr Adlai Stevenson forgot that some

two centuries ago in that part of the world where we

now  have  the  United  States there  were  American

colonies, and that these American colonies  rebelled

against  British imperial rule, and the  big-hearted

French  came to their support militarily with  naval

and  armed  forces  to  assist these  very  American

colonies  in  throwing off the British yoke  and  to

assist  them  in  gaining  their  independence.  Was

France  guilty  of  aggression in giving  her  armed

assistance  to these colonies? Was LaFayette  to  be

condemned? Is Mr Adlai Stevenson prepared to  state

on  the next 4.h of July that he condemns the French

for having assisted militarily the American colonies

in gaining their freedom - that he condemns: LaFayette

for  his magnificent contribution to the achievement

of  American independence? If not, let him recognise

that  in  his  ignorance of his own history  he  has

wrongly condemned India and her great Prime Minister

of aggression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our Deputy Prime Minister says he learned of India's action with regret. No human

being can view other than with regret any resort  to

international force: and in that I ant with him. But

if  he  implied there a censure of India's  conduct,

then  I  would ask of him, is he not aware that  for

more  than  ten  years India has  striven  in  every

possible  way, by every possible peaceful means,  to

achieve  a  solution  to end the  imperial  rule  of

Portugal in part of her territory? Could India  have

done  anything more in the line of peaceful  effort?

If  she  could,  then, Mr Speaker, I  am  with  the

Deputy Prime Minister in condemning India. But I say - You wish to rise?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To answer the Member for Anson

on a point of elucidation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I would just like to remind the

Member  for  Anson that India chased out a  mightier

power  - Great Britain - by means of satyagraha, whereas

Portugal and Goa are becoming extinct, as extinct as

the  dodo. Therefore, in trying to achieve the  prob

lem  of  Goa by force, it was like using  a  sledge-hammer to crack a little nut.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, autre temps, autre

moeurs   - in  different  circumstances,  a  different

effort.  I  think  the  Deputy Prime  Minister  will

recognize  as  much as I do, and  I  recognize  this

without  seeking to be patronising, that the British

over  the  centuries  of their  colonial  rule  have

shown,  apart  from their selfishness, a  remarkable

breadth of common sense. There was balance in  their

approach. They never pushed their luck too far,  nor

a  logical argument too far: "This is my property. I

have  a legal right to it. I am going to retain it."

They  showed good sense. With people like that,  you

can - how  shall I say it?  - struggle constitutionally.

That is why the problem posed by the Prime Minister,

"Are  we  here  to recommend then a violent  end  to

colonialism?" is academic. The answer is "Yes, it is

academic  because it will not happen."  The  British

would   be  willing  to  hand  us  our  independence

whenever, I say, we are near being strong enough  to

take over. That is the whole point. With the British

you  could  use satyagraha. But with the  Portuguese

and  their  intransigeant  arrogance,  I  say,  with

respect,  that  I  believe they  would  qualify  for

P.A.P. membership; and with them, what would you do?

Mr  Speaker, the position is reached that over  the

years,  in  every  field in and out  of  the  United

Nations,  India  did  what she  could.  There  is  a

reasonable  limit  even to the utmost  humble  human

patience.  They were her people, this was her  land,

and  the  damage was done. It is true, I  regret  it

too.  But  let  us  face  it: she  was  legitimately

entitled to do what she ultimately did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is material to our own argument, because

it  is  in this context that we must see Indonesia's

efforts  to  achieve the liberation of Irian  Barat.

Mr Speaker, what is Irian Barat? It is a part of  a

vast island. In itself, Irian Barat,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



which  is the subject matter in dispute, is a  piece

of  land of several islands which total in area some

700  times the area of Singapore. The population  is

less than half the population of Singapore, and  the

people  are primitive to a considerable degree.  The

Dutch first established their administration in that

area  for  trading purposes, I think some  63  years

ago, Mr Speaker, although in fairness they have had

an  interest in that area for almost one and a  half

centuries.  But  the  very  first  time  that   they

officially established administration was, I  think,

in 1898.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the administration of Irian Barat was integrated by the Dutch with their administration over some 3,000 islands. The mainland was what was then known as Java and Sumatra, under the administration known as the Netherlands East Indies administration. After the war - and here we must admire them - almost with no arms but with the vigour

and the passion and the sincerity of a proud people,

the Indonesia's put up an armed struggle against the

Dutch.  And  partly through that armed struggle  and

partly, Sir, let us admit frankly, through political

pressures, they achieved their independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their independence was achieved officially by

an  agreement  known as the Charter of  Transfer  of

Sovereignty  executed by Holland and the  Indonesian

Government.  If I might - it is very brief   - read  the

first Article. Article 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the Kingdom of the Netherlands

unconditionally  and irrevocably transfers  complete

sovereignty  over Indonesia to the Republic  of  the

United States of Indonesia.'



<br><br>Sir,  that  is  quite obviously  to  cover  all  the

territories  that were then known as the Netherlands

East  Indies.  But  in fairness, Sir,  let  us  read

Article 2 which specifically refers to Irian  Barat.

Article 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it is decided that the status quo of the

residency of New Guinea ...',



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  if I may pause for a moment - that  was

the  name in pre-independence days of what  we  call

Irian Barat:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it is decided that the status quo of the

residency of New Guinea shall be maintained with the

stipulation  that  within a yea  from  the  date  of

transfer  of  sovereignty to  the  Republic  of  the

United  States  of  Indonesia the  question  of  the

political status of New Guinea



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



is to be determined through negotiations between the

Republic of the United States of Indonesia  and  the

Kingdom of the Netherlands."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Indonesians claim that by virtue of this

agreement, they are lawfully entitled to  that  area

then  known  as  New Guinea and not known  as  Irian

Barat; or, alternatively, that no question affecting

the  Constitution of Irian Barat could be considered

without their concurrence. They say, "We have tried,

and  tried with patience, to deliberate with you for

two  or  three years on the subject of the transfer,

not  only for one year, which is provided in Article

2,  and  all  you  do is dig your toes  in."  It  is

correct  that  at  that period the Dutch  vigorously

maintained  their  imperial  approach,  and  in  the

frustrating   circumstances   then   ensuing,    the

Indonesians broke off diplomatic relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in fairness to the Dutch, let me add this.

They stated that by virtue of an exchange of letters

between  the  Indonesian Government  and  the  Dutch

Government arising Out of the Charter of Transfer of

Sovereignty, Article 2, the Indonesians agreed  that

Irian Barat should remain under the Dutch Government

until the Dutch agreed to its transfer. In fact, the

Dutch said the Indonesians never really wanted Irian

Barat  until after the execution of the  Charter  of

Transfer of Sovereignty. And, Mr Speaker, they made

capital of the fact that Dr Hatta (I think in  July

1945)  stated  during the conference  of  Indonesian

leaders    leading    to   the    proclamation    of

independence - these  are the  words  Dr  Hatta,  who

later became Vice-President of Indonesia, is alleged

to have said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the territory of Papua ...',



<br><br>again,  Mr  Speaker, Papua is the  pre-independence

name of Irian Barat:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the territory of Papua could be exchanged for

North  Borneo, I would be rather grateful Personally

I  am quite willing to state that I do not bother at

all about Papua.'



<br><br>That  is  the Vice-President saying that. Yes.  But,

Mr  Speaker,  curiously  I  managed  to  unearth  a

document  where  I  have  the  historic  speech   of

President  Soekarno  during the proceedings  in  the

Investigation Committee in preparation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



for  Independence  when he enunciated  the  historic

principles  of  Panchsheela. Sir,  the  document  is

known   as  The  Birth  of  Panchsheela,  the   five

principles   of  the  Indonesian  State.   President

Soekarno's speech - the quotation is this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Indonesian leaders should aim at the

establishment  of one national State  based  on  the

entity  of  one  Indonesia from the tip  of  Sumatra

right up to Papua.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  again  in fairness,  the  Dutch  say,

"Well, you claim you are entitled to Irian Barat and

that it is lawfully your possession. We are prepared

to  go  to  the  International Court of  Justice  to

submit this claim to arbitration." Mr Speaker, that

impresses me. I say to you frankly, if a man says to

me,  "I  am  prepared to go to  court  to  prove  my

claim,"  then  that satisfies me that  he  genuinely

believes he is right. And I accept the fact that the

Dutch   genuinely  believe  that  they  are  legally

entitled to possession of Irian Bar it. Whether such

belief  is  right or wrong, let us leave that  aside

for the moment, sir, because the issue never went to

the International Court of Justice. But how far does

that  take  them? Let us assume that  they  are,  in

fact,   just  for  the  sake  of  argument,  legally

entitled to the territory of Irian Barat. Where does

it  take them? The British were legally entitled  to -

Penang and to



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister:</b> Singapore!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And to Singapore, it is true. We

will  leave  Singapore out. Everybody has  forgotten

Singapore.  Thank  you.  I  beg  your  pardon.   Mr

Sneaker,  I  thank  the Deputy  Prime  Minister  for

reminding  me  that  they are  legally  entitled  to

Malacca  and many other possessions. But  they  have

the  good sense to realise that - how shall I say  it,

Mr  Speaker? - laws are made for the  convenience  of

human  beings  and  not for their constriction,  and

that  legal rights cannot stand in the way of  human

needs. The British recognise that and we expect  the

Dutch  to  have the good sense to recognise  it.  So

whether they are legally entitled to Irian Barat  or

not, let us leave aside the issue of law which is in

the context of human needs an irrelevancy. And again

let us recognise this. The Dutch do, not in so many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



words  but by their actions, admit that the position

of  hanging on to Irian Barat because of some  legal

justification  is untenable. It is somewhat  a  late

change  in  their policy, but in fairness  to  them,

they  do now recognise it, because, fortunately only

two  months  ago  in the United Nations,  the  Dutch

offered publicly to have a United Nations Commission

administer  Irian Barat until such time  as  it  was

satisfied  that the population of Irian Barat  could

have  a  plebiscite to be held under United  Nations

supervision to decide what the people of Irian Barat

wish for their constitutional future. I believe  the

Dutch added that if the people of Irian Barat wanted

to  join  Indonesia they would gladly  concur.  They

would raise no objection. Belated though it is,  let

us  at least give appreciation of a brave act and  a

radical change on the part of the Dutch, an act  and

a  change which recognise that White imperialism  in

Asia  is  no  longer appropriate,  and  furthermore,

official   recognition  of  the   right   of   self-determination of the people in these colonies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this was a radical departure from the imperial approach to the problem through their negotiations with Indonesia in the early years of Indonesia's independence. Sir, unfortunately for many years now, there have been no diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Holland, and the two

have not been on talking terms. But let us ourselves

look  at this offer, magnanimous as it seems on  the

part  of the Dutch, in the United Nations two months

ago.  What  is  the sum total of this offer?  To  my

mind,  it  constitutes a retreat, and  a  courageous

retreat,  from  their imperialist  approach  and  an

effort  to  concede  the claim of Indonesia  without

doing so publicly, providing - how shall I say it, Mr

Speaker? - a  face-saving  machinery.  Now,  the   end

result  of the United Nations Commission plebiscite,

would  be  reunion with Indonesia through a somewhat

circuitous and tortuous route.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Workers' Party have a great deal of

respect  for  the value, in human relations  of  the

face-saving principle. We accept and admit  that  if

an opponent recognises his mistake and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



is  prepared  to  change his  stand,  we  should  be

generous and help him to save his face, for it  does

no one good to take away a man's self-respect unless

it is absolutely necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the Indonesian answer to this

seemingly generous gesture on the part of the Dutch?

They  look right through the face-saving device  and

say,  "But look, you are being obstructive. You  are

trying  to  achieve, after many years and through  a

very   circuitous  route,  what  in  fact  we  claim

rightfully now. You are admitting it. You only  want

to  delay it." Sir, that is true. For myself I think

it  is  valid  that the procedure suggested  by  the

Dutch really seeks to delay, not for the purposes of

delaying, in fairness to them, but to my mind, seeks

to  delay for the purposes of political face-saving.

And  the Indonesians say, "We have been patient long

enough.  We  are  not prepared  to  enter  into  any

discussions with you on the subject, except on  your

recognition  of  the principle that  the  discussion

will   be   for   the  purposes   of   transfer   of

sovereignty." I do not know whether I  have  carried

you  so  far, Mr Speaker, as to recognise  that  we

have reached the point where the differences between

Indonesia  and  the  Dutch have  been  reduced  very

considerably,  to the point where they  have  almost

disappeared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the earnest hope of the Workers' Party that

the Dutch, who have shown both wisdom and courage in

their   proposal,  however  belated  in  the  United

Nations  two  months ago, should now  recognise  the

value  of  one  final gesture. Sir, the  Dutch  must

recognise that the whole of Asia would appreciate  a

frank  admission that they have, in fact, reached  a

point   where   they   agree  that   the   political

sovereignty   over   Irian   Barat   is   Indonesian

territory, and that the Indonesians have  been  very

patient in seeking the return of their own. You see,

Sir,  I  have a great deal of respect for the Dutch.

They  are a very practical people. Mr Speaker, most

people  said of the Dutch after they lost Indonesia:

"Pooh! They will be worth nothing now. They will  go

back   to   being   a   penurious,  poverty-stricken

country."  But  what  is  the  truth?  Despite  that

grievous loss, they are one of the most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



prosperous countries in the world by virtue of  hard

work,  ability and good government. Let us recognise

the  virtues of our opponents. I do not  believe  in

running down a person unfairly -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Except the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Except the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I had to look twice, because

that  is  the  Prime Minister's seat  on  which  the

Minister  for  Finance is sitting. The Minister  for

Finance has been there for some time. I have allowed

him   to  be  near  the  Minister  for  Health   for

consultation. But certainly consultation cannot take

as long as that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Prime Minister will be

coming in shortly to make a speech. Meanwhile I  was

just  giving points to the Minister for  Finance  so

that he could hold the fort until the Prime Minister

comes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The best way to do that is for the

Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for  Finance

to  take seats just beyond the bar. That can be done

without any breach of the Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is an admission of political

vacuity on the part of one Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order or

elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I know that nature abhors a

vacuum. Everybody knows that nature abhors a vacuum.

And  if there is any vacuity, it is not on this side

of the Bench but it is over there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The point of order is that the

Member  for  Anson  said that  the  Minister  had  a

vacuum -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister possibly is

using  the  advantage  of  his  being  a  University

graduate - I think it is  - to try and puzzle the Chair.

I myself cannot see anything offensive about it. The

expression was used of the Minister for Finance, but

he seems to be quite happy about it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am quite happy because I did

not quite catch what the Member for Anson said.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May we resume, Sir? I know that we

must have a little buffoonery now and then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was saying that we do respect the Dutch as a practical people, and we believe that they will recognise, we are satisfied that they will recognise, that they will earn considerable goodwill in Asia and in Indonesia if they make this final gesture. We know they are a peaceful people. They have to be a peaceful people because they are a

small  nation  and they have shown  their  practical

good  sense  in many ways since the war.  Friendship

with Indonesia would mean a great deal to the people

of   Holland.  We  cannot  believe  that  they  will

sacrifice the goodwill of Indonesia and of all  Asia

in order to persist in what has become a barren face-saving approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesians, who are a proud and sensitive

people,  believe  that  they  have  exhausted  every

peaceful  means of solving the issue of the transfer

of Irian Barat. Mr Speaker, Sir, is this remnant of

Dutch  pride to spark a war to their cost and  ours?

Despite the Deputy Prime Minister's levity and  much

that I disagree with him in what he does, I do agree

with  him  that  that  spark  could  bring  about  a

conflagration which would certainly engulf  us.  Let

us recognise that if a war were to break out between

Indonesia and Holland, would Russia not come in just

to  prove how anti-colonial she is where non-Russian

colonies are involved? And if Russia comes  in,  are

we not certain that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



America  will find it necessary to come  in  on  the

other  side?  We  will then have a  dress  rehearsal

between  these  two .great military forces,  not  in

Europe or in America, but here in our own -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Or in Russia.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Or in Russia. Thank you. Or in

Russia,  where I wish they would have it - but  here,

Sir, not merely on our doorsteps, but involving  us.

Let  us  remember  that we are  part  of  S.E.A.T.O.

Singapore is S.E.A.T.O. Wherever they may have their

Headquarters,  in Bangkok or in Timbuctoo,  this  is

S.E.A.T.O.,  our  base. Who is  S.E.A.T.O. but  the

United States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, can the Dutch in all conscience contemplate

permitting  themselves to be  made  the  excuse  for

triggering off the outbreak of a major war in South-East Asia between the major powers? Do they believe,

in  fact, Sir, that if it is triggered off, if there

is  a criminal conspiracy to which they are parties,

that  they can confine such a war to this  area,  so

that  they  can play their war games with our  blood

and our assets? Are they really such fools that they

do not recognise that such a war would involve their

own  lovely  cities  and neat farms?  They  are  not

fools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I say this. The difference that is now

left between the Dutch and the Indonesians is not  a

difference for which any people can legitimately  go

to  war.  I  think it is time that the Dutch  should

recognise  that if they are prepared  to  hand  over

Irian  Barat to the United Nations Commission,  then

why  not  to Indonesia? If they are saying, "We  are

not imperialists anymore. We are humanitarian," then

save humanity from this potential holocaust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we support this motion, but we dissociate ourselves from any suggestion of supporting what may be in moments of emotional fervour legitimate, but in cold print frightening remarks inciting our people to violence. I say to the people of Singapore, "If you want an anti-colonial struggle, you have got it here. Let us have an independent Singapore, if that is what you want -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson started

off by saying he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



against any incitement. That tone of voice, I  would

suggest  to him, makes me think that he is  inciting

Members to do something rather violent.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Well, Mr Speaker, perhaps we do not

view  it  the same way, because if we show the  same

fervour in our struggle against colonialism in  this

area  that is being shown in certain quarters for  a

territory which few people in Singapore really  know

where  it is, then we will get an end to imperialism

without   the   shedding   of   any   blood.   That,

fortunately, is not necessary in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we of the Workers' Party believe that good sense and sanity will prevail and that within the next few weeks the Dutch and the Indonesians will be sitting round the conference table and achieving an amicable settlement for the peace of this area and for the greater prosperity of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, one word in the direction of the

noble  Earl  of Eden Hall; that lean  leopard  on  a

leash, poised -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know who is being

referred to in this extravagant language. Would  the

Member just indicate?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I did not get the

question.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question the Chair has asked is,

who has been referred to in the extravagant language

which has been used?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> None other than Her Britannic

Majesty's  representative  in  South-East  Asia  and

Singapore, the Earl of Selkirk.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest to the Member

for Anson that there should be some respect at least

shown  to Her Britannic Majesty's representative  in

South-East Asia. After all, we are not at  war  with

Britain.  Therefore, let us have  some  respect  for

accredited representatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, with respect, I could

not  have  more respect for the noble Earl  and  the

remarkable talent he wears so gracefully; nor can  I

understand  how  my  remarks could  be  in  any  way

indicative   of  being  derogatory   of   the   hon.

gentleman.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Anson

knows  what  the  Chair is against.  One  might  use

flowery  language in praise of a person which  would

he acceptable, but the same flowery language used in

a different tone of voice might not he acceptable. I

think  the  thing  to do is just  to  refer  to  the

gentleman as the United Kingdom Commissioner and  he

done with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  was  going  to say, and I trust it is acceptable,

that  it  is not for me to seek to advise the  noble

Earl.  He has his retinue of advisers, and  his  own

personal knowledge and abilities whereby he must  be

adequately  informed of our basic  feelings.  But  I

want  to  emphasise in this Chamber: do not use  the

Singapore base against Indonesia. We are a  peaceful

people and a gentle people, Mr Speaker. There is  a

Chinese proverb you push the tiger to the wall,  and

he  will turn. Maybe we are not tigers. We have  not

got  the leadership. But it is not inappropriate  to

remember  a  name  which I  hope  will  one  day  be

prophetic,  i.e. the name of Singapore  which  means

the  House of Lions. Whether we are lions or not,  I

do  repeat:  do not use the Singapore  base  against

Indonesia, for if such were to happen, then we might

well  find  a  leader and there  might  well  be  no

Singapore base.



<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a pity

that the hon, gentleman who moved and supported this

motion  in the Barisan Opposition, instead of trying

to seek the unanimous support of the House, tried to

make this issue an inter-party affair. For instance,

we  have a remark made by the Member for Queenstown

in  his opening address when, in sneering tones,  he

referred to the P.A.P. He said that even the  P.A.P.

will support Indonesia's struggle for West Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I remind the Member for Queenstown that

the  P.A.P. had supported Indonesia's claim to  West

Irian  years before the Barisan Sosialis was formed?

Our stand on this issue was not made just to whip up

popular enthusiasm on an anti-colonial issue. It was

made very early when the Party came to office, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



on  that  nobody  in his senses would  question  the

sincerity of our position. But this does not prevent

the  Member  for Thomson from making  all  kinds  of

disparaging remarks against the P.A.P. I do not want

to  waste  the time of the House in going into  each

and  every one of them. Yesterday, for instance,  he

saw  fit  to refer to myself as a Fascist. Today  he

referred  to  the  Prime Minister  as  a  thug.  His

general  attitude is that the P.A.P. has  lost  its

anti-colonial fervour; not merely that, Sir, we  are

openly in support of the Western imperialist policy.

That is quite clear  - the charge was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no evidence at all has been produced to

substantiate  his  allegations.  We  can  meet   his

charges quite simply, not by Barisan Sosialis  anti-colonial  expressions. It is quite a  simple  matter

for  any  Party,  for anybody,  to  mount  a  public

platform and shout his head off and claim  to  be  a

great  anti-colonial hero in a matter which concerns

another country in their fight against their  former

colonial masters. That is a simple thing to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us examine the Barisan record in respect

of  their anti-colonial policy. Everybody knows that

when  Singapore began seriously to discuss the  next

stage in our constitutional development, that is, to

merge with the Federation of Malaya or form part  of

Malaysia, immediately the great anti-colonial heroes

of  the  Barisan Sosialis, the six trade  unionists,

publicly   proclaimed  that  the   next   stage   of

Singapore's political evolution must be an  internal

self-governing Singapore. They are not  prepared  to

fight  colonialism  in their own country.  Just  how

contemptible can people be when they are prepared to

accept   the   continuation  of  British   rule   in

Singapore!  Not  merely that  - their  representatives

have gone to see none other than the highest British

representative  in  South-East  Asia,  the  Earl  of

Selkirk  - to make a deal with him. This is now public

knowledge.  The Barisan Sosialis have  never  denied

that.  They tried to explain it away by saying  that

they  just  wanted a clarification. But  every  time

they  attempted to explain away this foolish act  of

theirs,  they only let the door open to greater  and

more  damaging exposures. And so these  great  anti-colonial heroes want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



see  other  people  wage war to liberate  their  own

territories;  but  in their own  country  our  great

Barisan anti-colonial heroes quietly try to  make  a

deal  with  the colonial powers and openly  proclaim

that  they  prefer  a  semi-colonial  Singapore   to

Singapore  as a part of a wider, bigger, independent

nation.  For such people to say that they are  anti-colonial  whereas  we are pro-colonial  is  absolute

nonsense.  Only  the puerile and immature  minds  of

half-baked  revolutionaries  would  be  deceived  by

their propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue before the House is not whether we

support  Indonesia  over West Irian  or  we  do  not

support  Indonesia  over  West  Irian.  Support  and

sympathy  surely will be accorded to the  Government

and to the people of Indonesia by all right-thinking

men  who  understand that in the age  of  the  Asian

revolution,  the time for Western empires  is  gone;

and  the  sooner, the quicker and the more  painless

Western  imperialism is wound up the better for  all

concerned. That is not the issue. The issue  is  how

West  Irian is to be returned to Indonesia, whether

it  should  be  by war or whether it  should  be  by

peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson went to great lengths to

explain  how narrow the differences are now  between

the  Dutch and the Indonesian Governments. I  cannot

help feeling that he is a shade too optimistic.  But

be  that  as it may, I would agree with him that  as

compared with some months ago the prospects now  for

a  peaceful settlement through negotiations  between

the  two Governments are much greater than they were

at any time in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, West Irian is part of a very large

island - perhaps  the  second largest  island  in  the

world.  It is mostly undeveloped jungle, swamps  and

mountains with a very small population. It may  have

tremendous natural resources - nobody knows. The whole

of  the  area  has  not been prospected,  let  alone

developed.  The  benefit that  the  Dutch  get  from

retaining authority over West Irian is negligible. I

do  not  agree with the Member for Thomson that  the

Dutch  are  making  money  from  the  population  by

exploiting  the  natural resources  of  West  Irian.

However,  if the Barisan Sosialis believe  that  the

Dutch are making a fortune out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



of  West Irian, please produce facts and figures and

I  am prepared to reconsider this as a statement  of

fact.  The Dutch are not getting any benefit out  of

it.  On  the  contrary,  they  have  to  maintain  a

substantial garrison and station fairly large  naval

forces there to meet any possible Indonesian assault

on  West Irian. At the same time, in order to get  a

good reputation among members of the United Nations,

the  Dutch say - and I have no reason to doubt it - that

they  are  spending substantial  sums  of  money  on

developing the area by building schools, roads,  and

so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the people of Holland surely have no desire to

hang on to a colonial territory from which they  not

only get no benefit but for which they have to incur

a   substantial  expenditure  by  way  of   military

expenditure  and  other development  expenditure  in

West  Irian. Experts on foreign affairs  claim  that

members  of  the Dutch Cabinet are divided  on  this

issue,   with  the  majority  of  Cabinet  Ministers

against  holding  on  to  West.  Irian.  Under  such

conditions and with such considerations, I think the

prospects  for a peaceful settlement of  this  issue

are  not unreasonable and should be explored to  the

utmost before war is waged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have not tried to examine the position of

West  Irian  from the legalistic point of  view.  We

have  heard  a  long discourse from the  Member  for

Anson, and the only conclusion one can draw is  that

both sides are right. I do not agree that both sides

are right on that issue. To my mind, if one side  is

right, the other must be wrong. In this case,  there

is  doubt  that West Irian is part of Indonesia  and

must be returned forthwith to the Government and  to

the people of Indonesia. It is as simple as that. My

colleague,  the  Minister  for  Culture,   explained

yesterday the principle of successor States and  the

definition of "national boundaries" when the  former

colonies obtained their independence either  through

the  violent  overthrow of the  imperial  powers  or

through negotiations. One of the most amazing things

in  this business is the attitude of the Dutch.  The

people  do not want it; most of the members  of  the

Cabinet  do not want it; it is of no value to  them;

it brings them no benefit. On



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



the  other  hand,  it exposes them to  a  tremendous

amount  of  world criticism not only from the  Afro-Asian   States  but  also  from  all  right-thinking

countries.  Now  why  they  continue  to  do  so  is

something which I cannot understand, but it  may  be

that  there  is a pecular philosophy that  underlies

the persistence of imperialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the common factor of imperialism

is  that  there is a personal gain to those who  set

out  to  conquer countries, acquire concessions  and

line  their  pockets.  There is  also  the  gain  in

prestige to the metropolitan power. When the Western

European  powers  set  out on  their  vast  imperial

conquest   in  the  19th  century,  they  tried   to

rationalise  their  action and give  it  an  air  of

respectability. For instance, the British  developed

the theme of the white man's burden. They were there

not  to  loot India, although Clive, Warren Hastings

and   others   plundered  India  very   nicely   for

themselves.  Nevertheless, the philosophy  developed

in the 19th century by Western imperialists and each

of  the major imperial countries - Britain, France and

Holland - had  different  ways  of  justifying  their

conquests  to  their  own  people  and  perhaps   to

themselves. The British developed the theme  of  the

white  man's burden. They said that they went  there

really  to help the black man or the brown man,  and

in that way they solved their own conscience. On the

other hand, the French held the view that they  were

there  to  bring  a higher form of  civilization  to

their  colonial  territories:  hence  they  had  the

expression  "mission  civilatrice" - the  ideological

justification of French imperialism. The  Dutch,  as

far  as  I  know,  developed what  they  called  the

ethical principle, but it is not very clear in  what

way  they  have been ethical in their dealings  with

Indonesia.  It may be - I think it is rather  doubtful -  that  they think the people who stay in West  Irian

arc ethnically and linguistically different from the

rest  of  Indonesia  and,  therefore,  to  surrender

sovereignty  over  West  Irian  to  the   Indonesian

Government would be to place the people in a form of

colonial servitude. Surely this is nonsense, because

that  could  be applied in practically  any  of  the

3,000 islands comprising the Republic of Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



There   is   a  tremendous  diversity  of  language,

religion  and even culture in this vast archipelago.

For  the  Dutch to say. "This is where  the  ethical

principle would apply and not, say, to the island of

Amboina  or  Bali,  or Sumatra or Sulewasi,"  is,  I

think, an untenable position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever it is, the position of the P.A.P. is

quite  simple. West Irian belongs to Indonesia,  and

the  sooner it is returned the better. We prefer  it

to  be done in a peaceful way. We see that with  the

pressure of world opinion this could be done and  we

hope  it  would be done. On the other hand, if  West

Irian  were to be an issue over which war  is  waged

between the Republic of Indonesia and Holland,  then

the  danger  of war spreading has to be taken  quite

seriously.  The  Deputy Prime Minister  has  already

elaborated on this point and I do not think  I  need

say much more. For myself, I would say that not only

are  the international consequences to be taken into

account  but  also  the  internal  effects  on   the

Republic   of  Indonesia  itself  should   also   be

considered.  This, of course, is a  matter  for  the

Indonesian Government and the Indonesian  people  to

decide upon. It is not for us to tell them what they

should  do  or  to draw their attention  to  certain

possible Consequences. Nevertheless, I think we  are

within  our  rights  to make an  estimation  of  the

possible consequences of war in West Irian, on, say,

the  internal  economic and political  situation  in

Indonesia.  If  war  breaks out and  the  Indonesian

armed forces gain a swift and decisive victory. Then

I say that will be all to their good. But if, on the

other hand, the Indonesian armed forces somehow  get

involved  in a protracted war, then it is  a  matter

for  some  concern whether the economy of  Indonesia

can  stand up to the strain of supporting  a  modern

war  in  which  highly  developed  and  very  costly

weapons  are to be used and have to be paid for.  We

are  assuming,  of course, that in  this  event  war

would  be  confined to just between the two parties.

But if, say, other powers move in, then the question

of  maintaining the cost of the burden of the war on

the Indonesian economy does not arise. Other parties

would just move in and provide armies, and certainly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



would  provide  weapons, and possibly  even  provide

armed forces. Now, if we rule out the possibility of

direct  international intervention on both sides  of

the struggle, and the war over West Irian becomes  a

protracted   affair,   then  the   consequences   of

supporting this costly war - and any modern  war  must

be extremely costly to wage - will be very damaging to

the Indonesian economy when they are now engaged  in

changing the whole basis of their economic system to

a completely different one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that the emphasis which the

P.A.P. laid down on the West Irian issue differs  so

radically from that of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>7.04 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stand of the Barisan Sosialis is tins, and it

is  quite  simple: they are out for a war, and  they

say  that  there  is  no point in  negotiating;  the

patience   of   the  Indonesian  people   has   been

exhausted. There must be recourse to arms  and  they

call  for everyone to support the liberation of West

Irian  by  force of arms. They are absolutely  cleat

about  this. Although the Member for Queenstown  was

rather  guarded  in his opinion and threat,  be  for

some  reason or other was equivocating. He  did  not

say  that  he supported a peaceful solution  of  the

issue. On the other hand, he refrained from going to

the  extreme  that  his colleague,  the  Member  for

Thomson, did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, these are matters on which I think we must go straight to the oracle - what the Barisan stands for, what the Secretary-General, Mr Lim Ching Siong, stands for. I am going to read to the House an extract from a speech made by Mr Lim Ching Siong at a mass rally on 7th January. There is absolutely no attempt here to take an ambiguous

position. Mr Lint Ching Siong is quite frank  about

this.  He said the patience of the Indonesian people

has  been exhausted. They now want to liberate  West

Irian by force of arms. They have every right to  do

so,   and   everyone   should  support   the   armed

liberation. Not only did he say this, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



he  said that the issue over Goa clearly shows  that

constitutional methods cannot bring about the end of

colonialism. May I, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  quote

the  exact  words in Chinese, and I am reading  from

the  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh of Monday, 8th  January.  He

said, and I quote the actual words in Chinese;  Chih

min chu-i shih pu-neng kou ren ho chih husan he hsia

te  hsien  tse an pai he chi hsu. It means that  you

cannot   depend   on  any  level  of  constitutional

arrangement  to bring about the end of  colonialism.

In  another instance he said this: Chi-tu kao  hsieh

hua shih mei yin yung te. It means (if I can give  a

free  translation) it is no use fiddling about  with

constitutional processes; it just gets you nowhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is in black and

white  in  the Sin Chew Jit Poh, Mr Lim Chin  Siong

went  further  and asked the people of Singapore  to

take  special note of this point. It is  clear  that

the  Barisan Sosialis stand for the use of force not

only  in  West  Irian but anywhere where  the  anti-colonial  struggle  is waged  because,  in  his  own

words,  "constitutional processes get you  nowhere".

Now,  the Member for Queenstown was not prepared  to

go  that  far either at his mass rally  or  in  this

Assembly.  This  cannot be sad for  the  Member  for

Thomson. We have heard with our own ears that he was

upbraiding  the  P.A.P: for being unwilling  to  say

unequivocally and clearly, to use his own words, "to

support  the  use  of  force  in  the  anti-colonial

struggle in this context". He said it is no  use  to

pay  ho  service  to  the claim  by  the  Indonesian

Government  to West Irian. You must be  prepared  to

say that they arc justified in using force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has never said that force, as a

weapon of the political struggle, must be ruled  out

at  all costs, tinder all conditions. We have  never

said  that.  If force must be used, when  all  other

means   have  failed,  then  force  must  be   used.

Otherwise, do not call yourself a revolutionary. Can

he elaborate on this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the time when I was a student in

London.  A  very  venerable  gentleman,  who  was  a

retired Inspector of Schools, saw me and said, "What

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



all  this?  I  hear you are sympathetic towards  the

P.A.P.   Don't   you   know   they   are   dangerous

characters?"  I said, "No, I thought they  are  very

decent  people.  They  want independence  for  their

country."   And   he  said,  "Yes,   I   also   want

independence.  But how far are you prepared  to  go?

Are  you prepared to use force? Are you prepared  to

use arms to get independence?" And I said, "Look, if

every  other  form  of  constitutional  process  has

failed  and  if you cannot get your independence  by

peaceful   struggle,   by  peaceful   constitutional

methods, then if you have to use force and resort to

an  armed  rebellion, I say, I will  support  it  in

principle."  And  if I were asked I were  courageous

enough, I would say, "I don't know. I would say that

if I say that I support an armed struggle, then when

the time comes for you to take up arms, you must  do

it." It is as simple as that. Then the man said, "Do

you mean that you are that sort of chap who wants to

murder  Englishmen if they will not get out  of  the

country?" I said, "Yes, if that is the only  way  to

get them out, I would." He was really aghast, and  I

quickly assured him that that proposition was purely

academic  and that I had no doubt the British  could

be got rid of by constitutional processes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Barisan and Mr Lim Ching Siong do not

think  in  this  way. Neither does  the  Member  for

Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we say that there should still be

effort   to  solve  this  problem  of  transfer   of

authority  over  West Irian from the  Dutch  to  the

Indonesian  Government, there is  still  opportunity

for  negotiation,  the  Barisan  has  ruled  it  out

completely. Even the Member for Queenstown takes  it

for  granted  that  war must be waged.  In  his  own

words,  he  says, "It will not be an  easy  struggle

against  the  superior military might of  the  Dutch

armed   forces  in  West  Irian,  with  a   possible

intervention by Australian forces." And he  says  he

admires  the Indonesian people for their courage  in

the face of superior arms, and the tougher they have

to fight, which means they would have to suffer more

casualties, the greater is his admiration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest to the House that this sort of

sentiment  is  completely spurious and contemptible?

If they believe that West Irian must be liberated by

force  of arms, then I say it is their duty  not  to

instigate  other  people to fight on  their  behalf.

They  should themselves volunteer for the West Irian

campaign. And I am putting this proposition to them,

not  as a joke but as a serious, proposition.  There

have  been  cases i the past where people  from  all

countries volunteer to fight on behalf of  a  single

country. The Spanish civil war is a supreme example,

where  people  with strong anti-Fascist  convictions

went  in tens of thousands to Spain to fight against

the Fascist forces of Franco.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember that on Wednesday the

Member  for Farrer Park brought up his motion  about

the  anti-quated colonial law which says that nobody

can recruit Singaporeans to send them abroad. In the

course of the debate on the motion, I made the  same

point,  that  the  Barisan Sosialis  should  set  an

example  and  register for combat  service  in  West

Irian.  What  sort of reply did I get, Mr  Speaker,

Sir?  I  got a very angry reply from the Member  for

Queenstown. He said that he would go if I went  with

him. Sir, this is an utterly ridiculous proposition.

We  of  the P.A.P. say, "Let us explore all peaceful

methods  first  and resort to arms  when  all  other

methods have failed." The Barisan Sosialis wants  to

support  the armed struggle straightaway. Therefore,

it  is nonsense for them to say that they will  only

go  to  West Irian to volunteer for military service

if we are prepared to do the same thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present age is the age of great

revolutions.  In  an age of great  revolutions,  you

will  find  that revolutionaries of all descriptions

suddenly    come   into   being.   We    have    our

revolutionaries in Singapore  - many types of them.  I

propose   to  divide  them  into  three   types   of

revolutionaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First the armchair revolutionaries. These are the

chaps who talk fierce, go back and do nothing.  They

lead  a  perfectly comfortable life  and  hope  that

others  will carry out the revolution. We are  quite

familiar with this type of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



revolutionaries. At best they are pests,  nuisances.

At  the worst, they provide great amusement. I  have

nothing to quarrel with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type we find in abundance in Singapore.

I  will  call  them revolutionaries by  instigation.

They believe in a revolution by instigation. They do

not  want to fight themselves. They instigate others

to  fight for them. This type of revolutionaries  is

found in abundance in the Barisan Sosialis and other

Communist front organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will remember that I have recounted to

the  House in the past that the P.A.P., on  the  one

hand,  and  the  Communists, their  stooges  in  the

Barisan Sosialis, and their open-front organisations

in  the  trade  unions  on the  other  hand - the  two

sides - have come to a collision four times. Round one

was  over  the  People's  Association,  where  these

pseudo  revolutionaries made use of some 300 workers

in  the  People's Association to cause trouble.  The

result  is  that 140 of them lost their  jobs.  They

lost  a  good  career. Round two was over  the  City

Council strike when they tried to move in, but  were

eventually  discredited and denounced  by  the  very

workers whom they tried to exploit and instigate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen):</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What has this got to do with

the motion before us?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am just saying that this

motion  proposed by these pseudo revolutionaries  is

in  keeping with their past conduct. I am recounting

one  by one all the three rounds, how they have made

use  of other people to fight their own battle.  Now

they are trying to make use of innocent Singaporeans

to  fight their battle for them over West Irian.  It

is so relevant. However unpalatable it may be to the

Member  for  Queenstown and the other  pro-Communist

stooges  in  his  Party, I insist  on  my  right  to

recount each and every incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, where were we - round two -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Hon. Minister is in order

in  making a passing remark. But not if he is  going

into  details on the first round, the second  round,

the  third round and the fourth round, which he  has

dealt  with  quite  at length in  this  Assembly.  I

think,  as  a passing remark, it will be within  the

ambit of the question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will go through very quickly

the  other  rounds. Now, round three was  when  they

tried  to  make use of school boys and school  girls

for  their own sinister purposes. The pro-Communists

in   the   Barisan  Sosialis,  in  the   Old   Boys'

Associations,  and in certain student  organisations

in  Nanyang University, tried to make use of  school

boys  and  school girls for their own  interest.  In

round  three, they were resoundingly defeated. Round

four  was the Work Brigade, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.

And  they  were all scattered. Round five  has  been

fought  and ended in a victory for the P.A.P.  Round

five  was  the Chinese Chamber of Commerce forum  in

which  the  Communists  and  their  stooges  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis, their open-front leaders  in  the

trade  unions  and in certain student  societies  in

Nanyang   University,  tried  to  manipulate   trade

organisations and the Chinese guilds to  attack  the

Government.  Their plan was simple. They  wanted  to

send representatives at the meeting to heckle us, to

ask for the right of debate -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Cannot the Minister finish the

subject,  so  that we can really  get  on  with  the

motion in hand?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have made my ruling on that.

I  have told the Minister in this House that  he  is

well within the ambit of this motion to touch on  it

as a passing remark.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This round five not having been

mentioned  in  public, I think I  could  perhaps  be

excused for going through -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Minister is going into

the details of the debate in the Chinese Chamber of

Commerce, he is completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We will take it up on the

Malaysia motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. We will take it up at the

appropriate  time. The Member for Queenstown  cannot

hope  to  escape from the consequences  of  his  ill

deeds.   Now,   these  are  the   three   types   of

revolutionaries.  I have given sufficient  instances

to show that the Communists and their stooges in the

Barisan  Sosialis  and in the trade  unions  do  not

fight  the battle themselves. They instigate  others

to  do  it  : the stall of the People's Association;

school  boys and school girls; Work Brigade members.

They  even  had  the audacity to try  to  manipulate

businessmen   to  serve  and  advance   their   evil

purposes.  And over West Irian, if they believe  and

they   are  really  genuine  anti-colonialists   - the

Member for Thomson says we are not - let them register

for  military  service.  If they  have  no  military

training the Government is quite prepared to provide

instructors for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With the approval of the

Assembly!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> One Member has received

military  training,  that is the  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon, before we sent him for a training  course

in Israel. They had to go for weapon training there.

So  we  thought  we  had  better  not  disgrace  the

Singapore representative and, on the quiet, we  gave

him  some weapon training. Of course, when  he  went

there,  he  wrote me a personal letter  saying,  "My

God, life is really hard here. The food is had"  and

so on.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The Hon. Minister is going

into details. To refer to the personal conduct of  a

Member of the Assembly is completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the last

thing we want is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



send  13 Barisan Assemblymen to West Irian who could

not  handle their weapons and are likely to get mown

down  like sitting ducks. If that is what is holding

them  back,  that  they have  not  been  trained  as

soldiers, we will give them the training. But I have

no  doubt  that none of them will have the  guts  to

volunteer.  In the true tradition of the  Communists

and  their  stooges, they will try to  make  use  of

others and try to get the glory for themselves. They

are  only  interested in fanning public feelings  on

this  issue  and  to make use of it  for  their  own

political advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, there is one point to

which  I  want to draw the attention of  the  House.

That  is the rather curious statement by the  Member

for  Thomson  when he said that he  was  opposed  to

Malaysia.  He  was all for the concept of  Malaysia,

and  the concept of Malaysia, he reminded the House,

was  created  by what he called certain  progressive

Left-wing  persons in the past. He was,  of  course,

referring to certain Communists. I think two of them

had to lice the country to avoid arrest. It is their

concept  of  Malaysia which the Member  for  Thomson

approves,  and,  therefore,  I  assume  the  Barisan

Sosialis  accepts  this concept of  Malaysia.  Under

this  plan, the Federation of Malaya, Singapore  and

the  Borneo  territories are to be merged  into  the

Republic  of Indonesia. Nothing more than  that  and

nothing  less than that. The Member for Thomson  was

therefore  advocating  on  behalf  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis that the proper form of Malaysia is for  it

to be part of the Republic of Indonesia. He made the

statement  to  explain  why  he  said  the   present

Malaysia  plan  was anti, Indonesia.  I  await  with

great  interest  a  statement from  the  Member  for

Queenstown  to  explain this  away.  This  is  more

important, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong  - Mr Lim Ching Siong is the  oracle  of

the   Barisan  Sosialis,  because  he  is  the  most

important    Communist   open   front   leader    in

Singapore - in  an  article in the Indonesian  journal

Bintang Timor - an Indonesian Communist Party journal -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



said  that  he opposed the merger proposals  of  the

P.A.P. because,  in his opinion,  Singapore  should

merge  with Indonesia. We have therefore two of  the

most important leaders of the Barisan Sosialis,  the

Secretary-General and the Member for Thomson -



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A delegate to Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> A delegate to Malaysia too - who

have  said  in public that, in their view,  Malaysia

should  be  part  of the Republic of  Indonesia  and

Singapore should be merged with Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the P.A.P. have steadfastly maintained the

principle  of  Malayan nationalism,  that  Singapore

merges  with the Federation of Malaya and  with  the

Borneo territories.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Minister for

Finance could reserve all these remarks when we come

to debate Malaysia. I think he has made his point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Thomson has

accused me of being a Fascist and I think it is only

fair, Mr Speaker, Sir, that you should allow me  to

say  something in defence. I could say  in  defence

that  I  think I am a gentleman, honest, forbearing,

generous to a fault. I could say all that, but it is

not  going  to  get  me  anywhere.  I  feel  a  more

effective  line would be this. I want to explain  to

the  House  how it comes about that the  Member  for

Thomson believes I am a Fascist. I have no doubt  he

sincerely believes I am a Fascist. Perhaps  he  does

not  quite  believe that, but he certainly  believes

that   I  have  Fascist  tendencies.  I  think   the

explanation is quite simple. I have been speaking to

various  members  of the Barisan Sosialis,  now  and

then  pointing out the folly of their ways -  breaking

away  from the P.A.P., openly associating  with  the

Communists  and  as stooges in the Barisan  Sosialis

itself   and   in   the   other   Communist    front

organisations -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



and I have told them this is utterly foolish because

history must take its course. There is nothing  that

can  stop merger or Malaysia, after which they  have

to  account  for  themselves, not to  the  Singapore

Government, not to the Singapore Special Branch, but

to  the  Federation Government and to the Federation

Special Branch. That is not the funny business  that

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang thinks it is,  because

the Federation Government and the Federation Special

Branch   have   waged  war   - not  a   constitutional

struggle,  but an open war - on the Malayan  Communist

Party.  Ten  thousand people have died  70,000  have

been  banished;  more than 20,000  detained.  I  can

assure  and I have assured these very foolish  young

men and women on the other side - "For God's sake,  do

not  do these foolish things because retribution  is

going  to overtake you. It is inevitable; you cannot

escape  it." Sir, far from being grateful to me  for

giving them good advice, they say, "Well, you  know,

the  man  is a Fascist. He wants us locked up".  But

that  is  the very thing I do not want to happen.  I

told them, "Repent in time -"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And confess.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> "- and maybe you may get away

with it." But the way they are going or, I see there

is  absolutely  no hope. They are a  bunch  of  dead

ducks -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister has made

his paint. Let us carry on with the mot ion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually, apart from that, there

is  only  one minor point I want to deal  with,  and

that  is this. You will recollect. Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  the Member for Thomson spoke at length on  the

atrocities  perpetrated  in  French  and  Portuguese

colonial  territories  in  Algeria  and  Angola.  He

thought that deserves the strongest condemnation. No

one  will dispute that. But I am merely asking  - what

about   Budapest?   Surely  the  Hungarian   workers

themselves  were  in  open armed  revolt,  with  the

Hungarian army fighting on the side of the Hungarian

workers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



fighting against the imposition of a Communist rule,

backed by the Russian Army. Did he not condemn  that

as  brutal oppression of a small country by  a  very

large  and  powerful power? All that the Member  for

Thomson  then  said was, well, that shows  that  any

reference  to Angola and Algeria hurts us.  It  does

not  hurt  us.  Any reference to the crimes  of  the

Communist powers hurts him, as we already know.  Why

dispute this fact which is known to everybody?  That

the  Russians  in their own national self  interests

suppress  the  armed revolt of the Hungarian  people

against their rule. That is the point which  I  want

to make. The Member for Thomson did not reply to it,

and  I hope the Member for Queenstown, when it comes

to  his  turn, will duly give a proper and  adequate

explanation.



<br><br>7.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am surprised

that  this  motion  has been moved  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  and, following the debate in this  Rouse,

more  harm  than  good  has been  derived  from  the

speeches.  From  the  content of  this  motion,  the

intention  of the mover is sincere and  honest,  but

taking  into  account our position in Singapore  and

viewing  the  political developments  in  Singapore,

this   has  given  the  picture  of  an  undesirable

atmosphere.  I  am really sorry for  this  state  of

affairs, but I believe, on the part of the mover  of

this motion, this is the objective, this is the true

aim;  in  the  proverbial Malay saying - there  is  a

nefarious motive behind the moving of this motion by

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are of the opinion that when two people are engaged in a struggle, for another party to take sides and thus create an even more dangerous situation is a bad thing to do. When a man comes across two men engaged in a struggle, that man should try to find a settlement between the two parties. The question I am trying to bring to this

House  is, who is right and who is wrong? It is  the

question of our attitude or stand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



towards  the  people  of  Singapore.  I  hope   that

atrocities  towards  human beings  will  be  avoided

throughout the world because we have experienced the

dire  consequences of war which bring  in  its  wake

sufferings and hardships to the children who  became

orphans, wives who become widows as a result of war.

I do not wish to elaborate on this point. If we take

this  from the point of view of our ability,  we  do

not  wish  to take sides. I think the difference  is

great.  We are adopting tile attitude of the  mouse-deer  which is trying to follow in the footsteps  of

the   elephant.  Firstly,  Singapore   is   not   an

independent  country yet. We are  still  confronting

colonialism, as has been expressed by my  colleague,

the Member for Geylang Serai. We can see colonialism

across the ocean, hut we are blind to the fact  that

colonialism  is  before  our  very  nose.  This   is

something  really astonishing and it clearly  shows,

as  I  have said earlier, an attempt with a sinister

motive. We must cut our coat according to our cloth.

If  we  shout at the top of our voice, it will bring

no gainful results whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if my memory serves me right, the Member for Queenstown did say that he would indeed be concerned if war should break out in Irian Barat. He was concerned that if war broke out there, it would engulf us in Singapore too. Therefore, he urged us to give wholehearted support to the Indonesian struggle. I fail to understand what he

means  by wholehearted support. West Irian is  miles

away  from us. But would he care to look around  and

see  Vietnam or Laos? Is he not concerned about  the

situation   in  those  two  countries?  The   recent

developments  in  West  Irian  give  him  cause  for

concern. We have categorically stated our stand. Our

problem  in  Singapore is such  that  we  must  save

ourselves  first.  We must first put  our  house  in

order  before  we can help others. It is  just  like

putting  the cart before the horse. I say that  this

is  a  very  illogical reason. The  object  of  this

motion contains an ulterior motive. If we follow the

tactics  of the Barisan Sosialis since the issue  of

Malaysia  came  to the forefront, we can  see  their

efforts  to bring about disunity between the  people

of Indonesia and Malaya. Firstly, on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



issue  of  Malaysia, as has been  explained  by  the

Minister for Finance just now, the Secretary-General

of  the  Barisan Sosialis has stated his stand  that

Singapore  should not merge with the Federation  but

with  Indonesia. Secondly, just now the  Member  for

Thomson  has uttered shocking remarks in this  House

by  alleging  that  the Malaysia Plan  is  an  anti-Indonesia plan. It is as clear as daylight that  the

Barisan  Sosialis are keen to see chaotic conditions

happening  in Malaya and in Indonesia. We  will  not

entertain that idea. On the contrary, we will  march

forward.  We  will not be carried away  by  emotions

because  this  will ultimately lead  us   - especially

hon. Members of this Assembly who are responsible to

the people  - towards disaster. It is our duty to lead

the  people of Singapore to the best path, the  path

of  peace,  and  not lead them for  the  purpose  of

achieving  our political ideology or our  own  self-interest.  I describe those politicians who  indulge

in  tactics  to use mankind for their  own  ends  as

people  whose  hands  are covered  with  blood.  Mr

Speaker, we oppose such tactics. We must oppose such

politicians in Singapore who try to lead us  towards

the  path  of  disaster and chaos. We  have  set  an

example  of  how to struggle to achieve freedom  for

our State from the colonial powers without resorting

to  the use of arms we have achieved freedom for our

country  by  a stroke of the pen. Take  for  example

Malaya:  and we hope too Singapore. We will continue

with  our legitimate struggle to free our motherland

from colonial rule. There is no other way. There  is

no  solution in Indonesia so that Irian Barat can be

returned  to  Indonesia which cannot be  solved.  We

sympathise  with the aspirations and  hopes  of  the

Indonesian people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said just now that we

have  set an example of how we struggle here without

the  use  of  arms, nor do we indulge in superfluous

fiery  speeches. Those who take pleasure in shouting

empty  slogans  to whip up spirit  and  fervour,  in

order  to  create  disorder, we know  they  want  to

overwhelm us in Malaya. But despite their efforts to

bring  about disunity so that we may follow in their

footsteps, we are not that stupid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



Through  the  experience and lessons  that  we  have

learnt, I say they have made a grave mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion moved by the Member of the Barisan

Sosialis has no significance at all. It is just like

adding  fuel to fire. What we should do is to  offer

constructive  solutions in  order  to  arrive  at  a

peaceful settlement. But as I have said earlier  on,

I  hope  the people will not be misled by the motion

before  the House. The Alliance stand on this motion

has been clearly stated. There is no need for me  to

repeat it. We know the people will be asking why  we

have  taken such a stand, but we feel that it  is  a

righteous  one which will lead to goodwill  and  the

well-being of all the people in the world. We do not

wish to instigate anything which will be detrimental

to any people. We have shown that the problems which

we face in Singapore, for instance, the multi-racial

problem, can be resolved by negotiations. From  time

to  time, agreements are reached and accepted by all

sections.  But  those who are not pleased  with  the

success  or the progress which we have made  have  a

different aim. As an example to the world and to the

United  Nations, we shall continue to  proceed  with

our  efforts  until  we have  achieved  the  aim  of

building a single nation.



<br><br>7.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the motion moved by the Member for Queenstown,

who  is  better known as the leader of  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  is  merely a reaffirmation  of  what  was

enunciated by the Prime Minister of Singapore in his

joint   communique  with  Dr  Djuanda,  the   First

Minister  of  Indonesia, early in 1960.  This  joint

statement  made by the representatives  of  the  two

Governments  clearly  states  the  stand   and   the

aspirations  of  the people of both territories  who

are  fighting  to  eradicate  colonialism  in  their

respective countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When putting forward his arguments, the Member for

Queenstown  boastfully mentioned  that  no  one  who

fights  for peace and independence will oppose  this

motion. This is in order to get support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



for  this  motion. But when he ended his speech,  he

appealed  to  all  Members of the  House,  including

those   on  the  Government  side,  to  give   their

wholehearted support to it. It is now clear that the

motive  behind this motion is clear, because we  the

Government have earlier declared our positive  stand

along  with  the  Government of Indonesia  in  their

struggle  for  the transfer of sovereignty  of  West

Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, opened his speech, he proudly said that a mass rally on the issue of Irian Barat had been held. Yes, everybody knows that this mass rally was sponsored by the Barisan Sosialis. When he moved his motion and made his speech, it would appear that he was challenging

the political Parties who did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



not  hold mass rallies to support Indonesia for  the

transfer of Irian Barat. Such Parties which did  not

hold  mass rallies are considered to be pro-colonial

Parties - this is his logic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we support the struggle of

the  Indonesian  people, we support  wholeheartedly,

with  all  our  sentiments and feelings,  with  deep

sincerity and honesty -
