<br><br>10.23 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the provisions of Standing

Order No. 7, at its rising today this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



Assembly  do  stand adjourned  to

Thursday, the 16th of July, 1959,

at 2.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under existing Standing

Orders  the  House  sits  at   10

o'clock  a.m. and  adjourns   at 12.30  p.m.  It

resumes  sitting

from  2.30  p.m. and adjourns  at 4.30    p.m.   The

total   time

available  for  business  in  the

House  is altogether 4½  hours.

It is proposed now that the House

should  sit from 2.30 p.m. to  8

p.m.  This will give the House  a

total  time  of  5½  hours   to

attend to our business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new Government and with

the  new  Constitution,  we  have

entered    a   new    era.    The

lackadaisical,    slipshod    and

inefficient methods of  the  past

must  give way to efficiency  and

earnestness  in  the  conduct  of

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the purpose of this motion

to enable the Government benchers

to attend to routine departmental

work   in  the  mornings.   Under

existing     Standing     Orders,

Ministers,          Parliamentary

Secretaries  and our  Assemblymen

will  not have time to attend  to

Governmental  duties,  nor   will

they  have the time to  meet  the

large  numbers of public who  are

constantly interviewing us at the

Ministries. This, Mr Speaker, is

the  main reason why I move  this

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee</b>

<b>Khoon Choy):</b> I rise to second the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the

provisions of Standing Order  No.

7,   at  its  rising  today  this

Assembly  do  stand adjourned  to

Thursday, the 16th of July, 1959,

at 2.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sections 95

to  100  in Part XI of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order   in  Council,  1958,  establish  a   general

framework for the control of public finances by the

Legislative Assembly. It leaves the detailed  forms

of  financial control, however, to be  provided  by

law.  The provisions of these sections of the Order

in  Council  come into operation on  the  appointed

day.  It  is  therefore necessary that  the  former

financial   procedure  for  accounting   based   on

Colonial Regulations and General Orders, which  are

now obsolete, should be replaced by new provisions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Constitution will effect certain changes

in  procedures and introduce new ones. For example,

the terms of the Order in Council are such that  it

will  not  be possible to continue the practice  of

Below-the-Line Advance Accounts, financed from cash

balances  without a vote. These have hitherto  been

extensively  used for trading and working  accounts

involving suspense payments. Again, section  99  of

the  Order in Council creates a Contingencies  Fund

which  will be a new and useful method for  meeting

urgent  and  unforeseen  needs.  These  and   other

changes  in  procedures will  be  effected  by  the

Financial Procedure Bill now before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the Preamble, the Bill will

provide  for  the  control and  management  of  the

public finances of the State of Singapore, and  for

financial   and  accounting  procedure,   including

procedure  for the collection, custody and  payment

of the public moneys of the State of Singapore, and

the   purchase,  custody  and  disposal  of  public

property,  other  than  land,  of  the   State   of

Singapore and for matters connected therewith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanatory statement sets out in simple form

the effect of the various clauses of this Bill, and

I therefore do not propose to enlarge at this stage

upon this explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is complementary to the Audit Bill,

which has had its First. Reading today, and to  the

Development  Fund  Bill  which  will   shortly   be

introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before we proceed with the Second

Reading, I think the recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is required.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have the recommendation,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.

I rise to speak on the general merits of the Bill,

and in doing so, I would like to touch particularly

upon clauses 17 and 19 of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 17 refers to the Audit

Ordinance, 1959, and the provisions of clause 17 of

this  Bill seem to hinge on section 9 of the  Audit

Ordinance,  1959.  As  the  House  is  aware,   the

Government  proposes to take this Bill through  all

its  stages  this  morning, this day.  Perhaps  the

Minister  for Law might indicate whether  there  is

such  an  Ordinance known as the  Audit  Ordinance,

1959, on the statute book because, if there is not,

it seems to me that clause 17 is quite meaningless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, clause 19, Mr Speaker, Sir, proposes a new

method  of  dealing  with  defalcations  of  public

servants   or  negligences  committed   by   public

servants  with regard to public property or  public

finance.   I  have  nothing  to  say  against   the

principle of surcharging public servants,  but  Mr

Speaker,  the  manner in which it  is  proposed  to

bring home the surcharges to public servants as set

out in this Bill is, to say the least, very drastic

and  most unfair. The Bill proposes that if certain

events  do occur, then the Treasury calls upon  the

offending  public  servant to give  a  satisfactory

explanation.  The  "Treasury", as  defined  in  the

defining clause, is the Minister himself,  so  that

the  position is - and the Minister here, I take  it,

is the Finance Minister - that when a public servant

has  infringed the provisions of clause 19 (a),  19

(b)  or 19 (c), the Minister for Finance calls upon

the  public  servant  to give  him  a  satisfactory

explanation  within  a  period  specified  by   the

Treasury - which again is the Minister himself - and if

such a satisfactory explanation is not furnished to

the Minister - who is again the Finance Minister - then

the  Minister may advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

to surcharge the said person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution being what it is today, any

advice  tendered  by the Finance Minister  must  be

accepted by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and he  must

act  on it. So we reach the position, if clause  19

is  accepted  by the House, that the  Minister  for

Finance is both the policeman, the prosecutor,  the

judge and the jury - a state of affairs which I think

the House will agree is undesirable if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



desire  to  maintain  a public  service  which  has

confidence and faith in the Government.  And  I  do

not  think  any  Government which bases  itself  on

parliamentary democracy would wish to  destroy  the

morale  of  its  public  servants.  Therefore,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, at the appropriate time I shall  move

an  amendment to seek to rectify what I consider an

undesirable position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, on which I wish to

address the House, appears in line 22 of clause 19,

which  says  "the  original value of  the  property

destroyed".  I think it should not be the  original

value.  It  should  be the value  of  the  property

destroyed at the time of destruction, and therefore

I shall, at the appropriate time, move an amendment

to seek to rectify this rather difficult position.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply? If the

Minister  who  has moved the Bill rises  in  reply,

then, of course, no other Member will be allowed to

speak.  But  if any other Member wishes  to  speak,

perhaps the Minister will wait.



<br><br>10.43 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have heard the

comments  by  the  Member for Farrer  Park  on  the

Financial  Procedure Bill in respect of clauses  17

and 19. In my experience, the most important  thing

is  to see that the public finance of the State  is

being properly audited, to have a proper system  of

accounts   instituted   by   Government,   and    a

strengthening of the Audit Department.  Clause  17,

as   far  as  the  law  is  concerned,  gives   the

Legislature  enough power to check  on  the  public

accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Member for Farrer Park has

exaggerated what is laid down in clause 19 of  this

Bill. The purpose of clause 19, as I see it, is  to

protect   the   funds  of  the  people   from   any

misappropriation or any loss due to the  negligence

of  certain  members of the public  service.  Those

members of the public service who have done a  good

job  need  have no fear. I remember  in  the  Local

Government  Ordinance,  which  was  passed  in  the

previous Legislative Assembly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



that there is also a clause which entitles

the  City Council - and I think the Member for Farrer

Park  has much experience there - to deduct from  the

provident  fund of any member of the staff  of  the

City Council who has misappropriated funds, or  who

has  caused  a  loss of public  money  due  to  his

negligence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the Minister for

Finance  shall be the jury, the prosecutor and  the

judge,  because, as it stands, there will be checks

inside  a  democratic framework which Will  prevent

the  Civil  Service,  or any member  of  the  Civil

Service, from being unduly brought to bear  on  any

loss of public money. I am sure that the Member for

Farrer  Park  will know that if any member  of  the

Civil  Service  is  to  pay  up  money  which   the

Government has decided that he should pay  back  to

the  public  funds, there is always the  resort  of

going  to  the  courts of law; and in a  democratic

system,  so  long  as  the  independence   of   the

judiciary  is being protected, I see  there  is  no

undue  encroachment  on a responsible,  honest  and

efficient civil servant.



<br><br>10.47 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, within my experience of

Government  which has extended over many  years,  I

can  assure  the  House that it is  not  the  usual

practice  to  institute, say, judicial  proceedings

against officials when it is established that funds

properly  belonging  to the  State  have  not  been

carefully accounted for by the officials concerned.

Whenever  it  is  found  that  there  has  been   a

misappropriation    or   misapplication    or    an

unaccountable  loss  of public property  or  public

funds,  the  usual  practice is  for  the  head  of

department concerned to make a report to the  Audit

Department,  and the Audit Department then  in  its

executive function proceeds to make a full enquiry.

After  that, the matter is reported to the head  of

department and it is then up to him, after  getting

an explanation from the person concerned, to decide

whether  that person is to be surcharged with  that

loss.  There  is  no  question  of  there  being  a

judicial  inquiry into such matters. In  this,  Mr

Speaker,  we are not in any way departing from  the

usual procedure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the procedure indicated in clause 19, it is

quite  clear  that  it  is the  Minister  who  will

initiate action when it is brought home to him that

there  are  defalcations and  misappropriations  or

misapplications of public funds or public property.

An inquiry is made if a satisfactory explanation is

not  given. Then he takes the matter up. He advises

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara to surcharge the person

with the whole or such proportion of the amount  as

is unaccounted for. That is the usual procedure. So

I do ask the House to disregard what the Member for

Farrer  Park  has said. He has suggested  that  the

Government   is   trying  to  introduce   a   novel

procedure - a  procedure that is  not  in  accordance

with  democratic  practices. I would  suggest,  Mr

Speaker,  that there is no substance  in  what  the

hon. Member said.



<br><br>10.50 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Farrer Park made two points in his  speech  on

the  Bill.  The first is a technical  one,  namely,

that  clause  17 of this Bill refers  to  an  Audit

Ordinance which does not exist and, to that extent,

this  clause  of the Financial Procedure  Bill  may

appear  somewhat  nonsensical.  May  I  refer   the

learned Member for Farrer Park to clause 1  (2)  of

the  Bill  which  provides that "The  Minister  may

appoint   different  dates  for  the  coming   into

operation   of   different   provisions   of   this

Ordinance."?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, it is clearly an

elementary  matter  to hold up the  enforcement  of

clause 17 until the Audit Bill has become law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point is that clause 19 concentrates

too  much  powers  on  the Minister  in  charge  of

finance  in  the civil service. Sir, the  power  to

surcharge   civil   servants   found   guilty    of

carelessness or defalcation of funds is not, as  my

colleague  the  Minister for  Labour  and  Law  has

pointed   out,  a  new  introduction  in  financial

procedure in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the Member for Farrer Park

raised objections to the granting of such powers to

an elected Minister of the country, while he had no

such objections in regard to powers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



formerly   held  by  the  Financial  Secretary   to

surcharge  negligent public servants. My  colleague

the  Minister  for Labour and Law has explained  in

detail the procedures for disciplinary action  when

negligence  is  discovered  in  respect  of  public

servants, and I have nothing more to add to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. [Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

would  like a repetition of what is proposed to  be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 9, lines 15 and 16, to leave out "a

satisfactory  explanation is not, within  a  period

specified  by  the  Treasury,  furnished   to   the

Minister" and there to insert "after due and proper

inquiry,   the   Public  Services   Commission   is

satisfied  that the said person has been guilty  of

misconduct or negligence".



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

National  Development, when speaking on the  Second

Reading of this Bill, seemed to indicate that I was

averse to the position where public servants can be

surcharged for their misdeeds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the truth of the matter, Mr Speaker, is

that when the Municipal Ordinance was in force  for

some  considerable period since  1946,  from  which

time  I was a Member of the Commission. I felt that

one  of the defects of the Municipal Ordinance  was

that  it  did not have provision in that  Ordinance

whereby the neglect of Municipal servants could  be

surcharged.   When  the  Municipal  Ordinance   was

amended  and the Local Government Ordinance,  1957,

was  brought  into force and for some  considerable

time  prior to that while the Ordinance  was  being

considered by the City Council, I was in charge  of

that  Bill  on the City Council and I might  inform

the  Minister for National Development that it  was

on  my  suggestion that that provision was inserted

in the Local Government Ordinance, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make my position quite clear - that I am

not  quarrelling with the principle that  a  public

servant  should be surcharged for his misdeeds.  It

is  only  right  and proper that it  should  be  so

because  he  is dealing with public funds.  But  my

quarrel  with this clause of the Bill  is  not  the

surcharging of the public servant but the manner in

which the surcharge is sought to be brought about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, public servants, Mr Speaker, are an

important  category of persons  in  our  system  of

government and they should be given every  possible

protection. I do not say that they should be molly-coddled  and pampered like some of the  past  civil

servants  were, but they should be made to  realise

their proper position in society as we now know it,

and  they should be given proper protection in  the

discharge  of  their functions. That is  the  first

point I would like to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is I think the Minister for

Finance  is  the head of the civil service,  or  at

least  he  is  in control of the civil service, it

would  place  the Minister himself, I beg  to  tell

him,  in the most invidious position where  he  has

got   to   investigate  the  defalcation   or   the

misappropriation  of public funds,  call  for  the

individual  servant for a satisfactory explanation,

sit in judgment over it and then advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



who  merely is the constitutional hand that imposes

the   surcharge,  but  the  real  hand  behind  the

surcharge  is  the Minister himself.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  if I were the Minister for Finance, I  should

hate  to  be  placed in that position.  It  is  not

merely  a  question  of giving the  public  servant

adequate  protection  but it  is  also  giving  the

Minister   himself   adequate  protection   against

placing himself in such an untenable position where

he calls for an explanation from the public servant

concerned and proceeds to take action himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If hon. Members of the House will turn to the

Explanatory  Statement  on page  12,  paragraph  16

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clauses 19 to 22 provide for the levy and

enforcement  of  surcharges  against   any   public

servant  who  has  been  guilty  of  misconduct  or

negligence...".



<br><br>Might I repeat the phrase again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...who has been guilty of misconduct or

negligence which has occasioned the loss of  moneys

or stores, or overpayments of moneys, or failure to

collect  moneys  duly  payable  to  the  State   of

Singapore."



<br><br>Quite a proper explanation: quite the proper thing.

But  the  Bill itself, I regret. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

does  not  bring  out  the  intention  set  out  in

paragraph  16  which appears  on  page  12  of  the

Explanatory Statement. It is the misconduct or  the

negligence of the public servant that must occasion

the  loss of the moneys. Now, does clause 19  bring

that  out, Mr Speaker, Sir? I beg to suggest  that

it does not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Public Service Commission here, the

Members  of whom have been recently appointed.  The

function of the Public Service Commission  is  two-fold.  First  of  all, to appoint  public  servants

without  fear or favour, and those public  servants

having  been so appointed should hold their offices

without  fear or favour and without any  danger  of

being  victimised  by  a  particular  Minister   or

somebody  over  him.  It was for  that  intent  and

purpose  that  the  Public Service  Commission  was

created. We have that body. Why do we not make  use

of  that body? It costs the Government nothing.  If

the  Minister  for  Finance or a departmental  head

finds that there has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



defalcation,  he merely reports the matter  to  the

Minister  concerned.  The Minister  concerned  then

reports it to the Public Service Commission  which,

I  take  it,  has its own machinery to  make  these

inquiries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I ask this House is to accept this, not that

surcharges  should  be  dispensed  with  but   that

surcharges  should be strictly adhered to.  But  in

surcharging the officer, because the matter  is  so

serious  to  the officer concerned, I think  it  is

necessary  that  not  only  the  officer  but   the

Minister  for  Finance should himself be  satisfied

that perhaps he has not made a mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Hon. Members are of course at

liberty to range over the whole of the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, my hon. Friend the Member

for  Farrer Park is still trying to make  a  gentle

smear  against the Government, that the  Government

is either lending its hand to or giving its support

to   undemocratic  practices  whereby  good   civil

servants  can  easily  be  punished,  say,  by   an

irresponsible  and  a  very  bloody  Minister   for

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I think my hon. Friend has not

taken the trouble to read the Order in Council for,

if  he  had  done so, he would then understand  the

true functions of the Public Service Commission  as

laid  down. I would refer my hon. Friend to section

81  (1)  of the Singapore (Constitution)  Order  in

Council where it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to the provisions of this Order, the

appointment (other than an appointment to act in an

office for two months or less), promotion, transfer

from  one Division or Service or from one class  or

grade   to  another,  termination  of  appointment,

dismissal and disciplinary control of every  public

officer  is  hereby vested in the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara acting in accordance with the advice of  the

Commission."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the question of a surcharge against any public officer for any misappropriation or

defalcation of public funds or public properties is

not a matter which concerns the discipline of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



an   officer.   It  is  just  ordinary   accounting

practice: if it is found that the officer concerned

is  accountable for that loss, I would submit, with

respect,  that it is the duty of the  Minister  for

Finance to see that that loss is properly accounted

for.  The  question of discipline  is  an  entirely

different  matter.  Should  it  be  found  that  an

officer,  through his negligence, merits dismissal,

then  the  procedure  will be  through  the  Public

Service  Commission.  I  have  no  doubt  that   my

colleague the Minister for Finance, who has been in

the   civil   service  with  me  for  many   years,

understands that practice. If it is found  that  an

officer  should be surcharged and if  it  is  found

that  although he has been negligent he has been  a

good  officer and that the Government does not wish

to  take  any disciplinary proceedings against  him

for  that loss, then he will be only surcharged for

that  loss.  But  if it is found that  his  conduct

merits more than a surcharge, then I have no  doubt

that  the  Minister for Finance will see  that  the

necessary  disciplinary proceedings are  instituted

against that officer. I have no doubt that he  will

then   have   recourse   to  the   Public   Service

Commission,  because it will be the Public  Service

Commission  that will be the proper organ  to  deal

with cases of indiscipline in the service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I again refer

the  Minister for Labour and Law to the  clause  in

the Objects and Reasons on page 12?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Objects and Reasons are out of

date. We now have Explanatory Statements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am sorry, Sir - the Explanatory

Statement. Well, apparently the object of clause 19

would  appear  to be to surcharge a public  servant

who  has  been  guilty of misconduct or  negligence

which has occasioned the loss. The loss should stem

from  negligence or misconduct. If  there  was  any

loss   which  did  not  stem  from  negligence   or

misconduct, clause 19 does not apply, according  to

the Explanatory Note.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, negligence and misconduct are matters of

discipline  in  any  system of government.  If  the

Public  Service  Commission is  an  instrument  for

discipline,  what is the object of  preventing  the

Public  Service  Commission  from  going  into  the

question   of   misconduct  or  negligence   before

surcharging   the   officer?   According   to   the

Explanatory  Statement, it is not the intention  of

Government to surcharge a public servant every time

loss  occurs  but  only when such loss  stems  from

negligence  or  misconduct, which  are  matters  of

discipline or could be matters of discipline.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I think the proposal

before the House now is that the words,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"if a satisfactory explanation is not, within a

period specified by the Treasury, furnished to  the

Minister"



<br><br>be  left out, and that they be substituted with the

words  indicated  by  my  hon.  Friend.  Now,   the

explanations  given  in  the Explanatory  Statement

will  never form part of the Ordinance. I  am  only

concerned with that proposal, and it is quite clear

that  it is very necessary that those words  should

be included in the text of Clause 19, because it is

the Minister who will have to satisfy himself as to

the reasons for the loss.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated just now, Mr Speaker,

that  it  would be quite improper for the  Minister

for  Finance to abdicate those functions of enquiry

to  an  extraneous  body like  the  Public  Service

Commission, when the question at issue is a loss of

public funds and public property. Those are not the

functions of the Public Service Commission,  and  I

do recommend, Mr Speaker, that those words be left

in the text of Clause 19.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, I oppose the

amendment  proposed by the hon. Member  for  Farrer

Park.   The   hon.  Member,  when   proposing   the

amendment,  said  that  it was  moved  in  part  by

feelings   of  compassion  for  the  Minister   for

Finance,   who  would  be  faced  with  very   hard

decisions  as  to whether or not a  public  servant

alleged to be negligent had provided a satisfactory

explanation within a specified period. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



said  that  the  Minister would  be  placed  in  an

untenable and invidious position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance is responsible to

this  Assembly  and to the country for  the  proper

collection,  custody  and  expenditure  of   public

funds.  In  order to discharge these functions,  he

must  have  at his disposal certain powers  to  act

against  negligent public officers.  I  can  assure

you,  Mr Speaker, that the Ministers of the P.A.P.

Government  are  of a more robust disposition  than

the  Member  for  Farrer Park would  credit  us.  I

myself  find no difficulty when confronted  with  a

particular  case to decide whether the  explanation

is satisfactory or not. There are certain rules and

regulations which financial officers have to follow

in  the discharge of their duties, and if they have

failed to observe these regulations, as a result of

which the Government suffers financial loss, then I

say it is quite an easy matter in a particular case

to  decide  whether a surcharge  should  be  levied

against the offender.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I take objection to this amendment on

principle.  If  Ministers abdicate their  functions

and  hand them over to impersonal bodies,  be  they

statutory or otherwise, then the whole business  of

this  Government will slow down. We have seen  what

has  happened in surrounding countries where, after

they  attained independence, the framework  of  the

Government  was based on the theories of democracy,

and  how  by hard, practical experience, they  went

back  to forms of guided democracy, or controls  by

Generals - in  Burma and Pakistan - and by a  Governor-General in Ceylon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make it quite clear, at the opening of the

five years of the P.A.P., that this is a Government

prepared  to govern. We are not going to "pass  the

buck"  to  anybody else. We need no Public  Service

Commission to be our executioner. We can carry  the

burdens  of  office, and I would be ashamed  of  my

Minister  for Finance if I believed that  he  could

not  discharge  his  duties as  well  as  a  former

British official. And the activities of many former

British officials, who had powers similar to these,

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



not,  at  any  rate according to  the  opinions  of

Members  of  the  Opposition,  brought  about   the

ruination of the Civil Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure them that when we take action, the

paramount  consideration is  the  interest  of  the

country  as  a  whole.  We are  not  out  on  petty

vendettas. If we were, some of the Members opposite

would be having a much more unhappy time than  they

are having at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Chairman, I am glad of the

assurance of the Hon. the Prime Minister  that  the

P.A.P.  Government are not engaged on any vendetta.

All they are concerned with is the preservation  of

parliamentary  democracy. I am very  glad  to  have

this  assurance  from no other a  person  than  the

Prime Minister himself. I should hate to agree with

anybody  outside  that  is  not  so.  However,  Mr

Chairman,  the point and purpose of this discussion

today  is  not  on  the mechanics of  parliamentary

democracy,  or  what  is going  on  in  surrounding

territories, or that guided democracy has come into

force, but a system of-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Check and counter-check.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No. If you will let me finish, Mr-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member should

address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> What we are trying to do here today is

to  find a suitable financial procedure within  the

context of our own conception of what parliamentary

democracy should be. We in the Opposition feel that

there  are others also besides Ministers  who  have

their  places  in a parliamentary democracy.  Those

sitting behind the Hon. the Prime Minister too have

their place in a parliamentary democracy, and I and

my colleagues sitting beside me too have a place in

a  parliamentary democracy. So let us therefore not

talk about our various allotted and destined places

in  the  system of government on which we  are  now

embarked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I am concerned about, Mr Chairman, is

this: if the point and purpose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



of this clause is to see that the public does

not  lose  its funds, then let us create  a  system

which  will  ensure  that  without  causing  untold

damage  or  harm.  Let us not get  too  dictatorial

because we think we have the power at our disposal.

Let  us find a system under which we will meet  the

needs  of  the situation without causing  too  much

hardship,  and  giving the impression  to  everyone

that the thing has been done properly. That is  the

purpose  of  this amendment, and if the  Government

feel  that they cannot accede to it, they have  got

43 votes and they can use them against me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, imagine ourselves,

the  people of Singapore, as shareholders of a firm

and  entrusting  the money of  the  public  to  the

Manager,  the  Minister for Finance.  In  order  to

carry  on  business, the Minister for  Finance,  as

Manager,   will   engage   many   accountants   and

storekeepers. One of these storekeepers  was  found

out -  that instead of 10 cases of beer, there  were

only  five cases in stock. I am sure, Mr  Speaker,

that  it is the duty of the Manager, and not  of  a

judge,  to  go and claim the 5 cases of beer  lost.

Why has this to be done? Why have clause 19 and the

whole  idea of the Financial Procedure Bill, to  be

pushed  through? It is because we  have  found  out

that  the whole state of affairs of public  finance

in this country is most unsatisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the City Council, we found out that many bills

were  paid without proper vouchers. Money had  been

wasted. The auditors had passed very pertinent  remarks on the accounts of the City Council for  1956

and previous years, and even 1958. When we were  in

the City Council, we managed to put the whole thing

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now moved into the Government, and we

find  that the same state of affairs exists in  the

Government  as  existed in the  City  Council.  The

Public  Works Department, which spends hundreds  of

millions  of  dollars a year, has only a  qualified

accountant,  working part-time, and  I  can  assure

hon. Members that certain regulations will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



enforced. The Telecommunications Department,  where

millions  of  dollars a year are involved,  has  no

qualified  accountant; neither has the Post  Office

any  qualified accountant in the past few years.  I

am  not  in  a  position to  make  mention  of  the

departments  in other Ministries. In  my  Ministry,

where  these three departments are, the most  money

is  spent on them, and in the Ministry we have only

the services of a part-time qualified accountant to

look  into the question of how hundreds of millions

of dollars which the people pay in taxes are spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, clause 19 is to see that the public funds of the people of this country are properly

spent, and that every cent which our people have to

contribute  to  the  State Treasury  through  their

sweat  and  toil is properly looked  after  by  our

Minister of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, it appears

that  the Member for Farrer Park is against  clause

19 of the Financial Procedure Bill just because, in

his  interpretation,  the  absolute  authority   is

vested  in  the elected Minister. The Member  quite

obviously is prepared to accept an inefficient  and

inadequate management of public finance, as it  has

been  in  the  past,  but  not  the  integrity  and

judgment of an elected Minister.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the past 130 years of colonial rule,

there  have  been many stages in our history  where

colonial  masters were in absolute  authority  over

many  affairs of the country. It was so even a  few

years ago when the hon. Member for Farrer Park  and

his colleagues were in reign. It appears to me that

the  hon.  Member for Farrer Park is confusing  the

mechanics  of democracy with the functions  of  the

civil  service. The duty of this Government  is  to

make  sure  that  the civil service implements  the

policy  which we want implemented. We  have  stated

very clearly that we do not intend to victimise the

civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elected Minister of this Government has a duty

to  the Party, and the Party as a whole has a  duty

to the country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



Our  paramount  duty  is  to  implement   our

policies  in general, and in this particular  event

to  make sure that the finances of the country  are

in  order and that there is no misappropriation and

mishandling  of public finances, it is  proper  and

morally  right that that duty should be  vested  in

the elected Minister and not in any public body.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Chairman, regarding the Financial Bill

which  is under discussion in this House,  on  this

the   first  day  we  are  carrying  out  our  duty

together,  I, on the Opposition side, do not  wish,

at all times, to oppose or criticise the Government

on  any matter to be carried out for the people and

for  the country. But, at first, today, it did  not

occur  to  me, nor do I see, anything in clause  19

which  could be said to be a matter that can  cause

fear to those who are in or who are serving in  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really truly love our responsibilities,

then  there  is not a thing, I find, in  clause  19

which  gives  the Minister power whereby  he  could

threaten or victimise people who, as I said, truly

wish to serve loyally for the benefit of the people

and of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to emphasize that we, on the

Opposition,  particularly speaking, for  myself,  I

would  like to state that whatever is good we  will

surely  support.  But we are not  happy  because  a

while ago, I myself was surprised to see that  when

the  Prime  Minister rose to speak, it appeared  as

though  the Prime Minister wanted to pounce on  the

Opposition Members - not all perhaps - but it certainly

appeared  as  though the Prime Minister  wanted  to

pounce  on  and to devour the eight of us including

me myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we the Opposition will always co-operate and

give  due  consideration to  whatever  is  for  the

benefit of the country, but not with the object  of

benefiting  a political party or those in  sympathy

with any political party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we wish to emphasize, because our

duty  is  to develop the country; and for  national

development we need money and it is our duty to see

that every officer to whom we have entrusted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



power,  should safeguard the property of the public

and  of  the country, so that we would be  able  to

carry  out whatever is deemed appropriate  for  our

count.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, clearly, I do not wish to say that I do not

completely agree with what is in this clause. But I

wish to emphasize that whoever among the government

staff will really serve and sincerely carry out his

duty,  will not have anything to fear in this Bill,

if it is passed - for it seems, passed indeed it will

be;  for if it is not, and if it takes two or three

days, we are surely going to be steam-rollered; but

even if we are steam-rollered, we still say that if

whatever the Government proposes to do is  for  the

good,  we  will surely support it, but  if,  and  I

stress, if it is for the selfish interest of only a

handful of people, my fellow citizens, then we will

surely  voice  our regret and sorrow, for,  perhaps

this Government is not based on such an outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> My second amendment concerns clause 19

again,   line  22,  Sir. It  is  quite  a   simple

amendment,  by striking out the word "original"  in

that  line  and substituting nothing  for  it.  The

purpose  of the clause, Mr Chairman, is to  charge

the  officer concerned with the original  value  of

the property destroyed. I take it that the original

value  of the property destroyed would be the value

of  the property at the time of the purchase.  Now,

if  the  property destroyed is, in fact,  destroyed

three  or  four years after purchase, the value  of

the   property  would  have  gone  down.  In  these

circumstances,  would  it be  fair  to  charge  the

officer  with  the original value? I take  it  that

there is no intention on the part of the Government

to  make a profit on this surcharge, but merely  to

recover whatever actual loss Government might  have

suffered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose the

amendment. The Member for Farrer Park seems to have

in  mind  the fact that the Government  intends  to

surcharge  the  offending officer  with  the  whole

value of the property destroyed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



But  it  is clear that the wording of this  clause,

which   I   will  now  read,  gives  the   Minister

discretion to reduce the amount of surcharge.  Now,

may I refer him to line 19 onwards:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Minister may advise the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  to  surcharge against the said  person  the

whole,  or  such proportion of any such amount  not

collected,  payment, deficiency,  or  loss  or  the

original  value  of the property destroyed  as  the

case may be,".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presumption which moved the amendment seems

to  be  that this Government has in mind the  worst

possible penalty to inflict upon the civil service.

I  see  no  reason whatsoever for  the  Member  for

Farrer Park to have this frame of mind against  the

present Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, when a statute gets on to the

statute  book,  it remains in force  for  a  longer

period than five years. Surely, Mr Chairman,  when

we  do  get a statute on to the statute book we  do

not think of the particular Government in power  at

the  time  when  that legislation is  enacted.  One

thinks of the enactment as an enactment which  will

remain in force for a longer period than the P.A.P.

government  itself. So why the P.A.P. should  align

itself  and identify itself with all the provisions

of  the  Bill I am at a loss to understand. We  are

legislating  for  the country and  not  for  P.A.P.

Ministers.

<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for

the suspension of the City Council and transfer  of

its  functions to myself as Minister  for  National

Development. Mr Speaker, we have gone down to  the

people,  to  absorb the Local Government operatives

of  Singapore within the framework of  the  central

government.  It  was  one  of  the  planks  in  our

election platform. We come today in order to  carry

out  that plank. During the first week of June, the

by-elections  of  the City Council  were  suspended

and,  at  the same time, the functions of the  City

Council  which were not taken over by the  previous

Minister  for Local Government were transferred  to

myself  as  Minister for National  Development,  by

order,   namely  the  City  Council  (Transfer   of

Functions)  Order,  1959. The present  position  is

that we have 16 Councillors, who exist in name  but

who have no functions to play. We have decided that

they  shall  not get any allowance since  the  City

Council  (Transfer of Functions) Order,  1959,  was

promulgated.  By this Bill, the City Council  shall

cease   to   have  responsibility  for  the   local

government  of  the City and the Council  shall  be

deemed  to  have retired on the date of the  coming

into  operation of this Bill. Clause 6 of the  Bill

will  enable  myself, as the Minister for  National

Development,  to  exercise the  functions,  duties,

discretions  and authorities normally exercised  by

the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.50 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on

the principle involved in this Bill. It is this: Is

the  present  Government  interested  in  fostering

democracy in this country and therefore supporting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



and fostering democratic institutions which

build  up  to the apex of parliamentary government,

or  is the present Government merely interested  in

concentrating all the powers of Government into the

hands  of  seven  or nine individuals  and  thereby

making  it easy for the time to be reached  in  our

history  when  the  power  in  the  nine  could  be

concentrated  into  one to merge  into  a  national

dictatorship?  It seems to me that  the  signs  are

that  the present Government is only interested  in

centering  unto itself all the powers of Government

which  previously  had been distributed  into  this

group, that group and the other in order that these

groups   themselves   would   understand   what   a

parliamentary   government   is    and    what    a

parliamentary institution is and what a  democratic

system  is.  In  no  country,  Mr  Speaker,  where

parliamentary democracy prevails, has  the  central

government  abolished a system of local government.

The   lifeblood  of  a  parliamentary   system   of

government  comes from the local people  themselves

who  govern  their own affairs in their  own  small

way. A licence for a hawker, a licence for a market

stall, might be a very small matter to the Minister

for  National  Development  when  he  has  so  many

departments under his control - half of Singapore  is

under  the  control  of the Minister  for  National

Development.  In  these  circumstances,  who  could

blame  him  if he is not bothered about a  hawker's

licence  or  a  stallholder's licence,  which,  Mr

Speaker,  are  important matters  in  the  life  of

certain people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, is it not fair and proper that some time

should be spent over people like them, rather  than

that they be brushed aside by bureaucratic methods?

Is  the Minister for National Development trying to

tell this House that he can adjudicate on all these

claims  himself, or will he be completely dependent

on  his  civil servants? If not his civil servants,

then  those sitting near him beside him and  behind

him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Mr Speaker, if we are interested in

fostering  a parliamentary democracy, it  is  vital

that   the   country  should  also   foster   local

institutions which govern in a democratic  way.  It

is no use telling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



this House that all the Government is interested in

is  efficiency.  Efficiency is  not  everything  in

one's  life. If you want efficiency there are other

systems of government which we could go to. In  any

event,  what  does this Bill mean? It merely  means

that  the  Minister for National Development  takes

over  all  the  functions of the City Council.  The

City Council as a statutory corporation, I take it,

still remains intact. That is not tampered with.  I

think the more logical thing, Mr Speaker, would be

to have the whole of the Local Government Ordinance

repealed and whatever functions the City Council or

other  local authorities have under that  Ordinance

be  transferred to the Government. Let us get  back

to  the original state of Singapore when Government

was the apex and point of all Government functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what we are getting back to? Are we

getting  back  to 120 years ago instead  of  moving

forward  and trying to decentralise? Are we  trying

to   centralise  everything  in  that  seven-storey

building  at  Upper Pickering Street?  Many  people

have  fallen to death from that place. I  hope  the

Minister for National Development has not taken too

much on his plate. I hope he will still be with  us

at the end of his five years.



<br><br>11.57 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I think I may remind the

Member  for  Farrer Park that we are  springing  no

surprise on the people of Singapore. We have in our

publication   "The   Tasks  Ahead",   even   before

Nomination Day explained to the people of Singapore

what were the policies we intended to implement  if

with their support we became the government of this

territory. We have explained, Mr Speaker, that  it

was quite impossible, in a territory which measures

only  about  220 square miles, to have  in  it  two

governments, two administrations competing side  by

side  in  a  territory which is  so  small  in  its

extent, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We traced the history of municipal governments in

Singapore in our publication



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



"The Tasks Ahead". There were, Mr Speaker,

in  the  past,  two rival administrations  in  this

territory.  One  was  the  Colony  of  the  Straits

Settlements  and the other was the Federated  Malay

States.   You   will  find  that   in   these   two

administrations  at one time in our  history  there

were  a Governor of the Straits Settlements  and  a

High  Commissioner of the Federated  Malay  States.

Those  were Colonial administrations no doubt,  and

they  were  unified by the Head of State.  At  that

time,  Mr Speaker, I think you will remember,  and

many  of  us  here will remember, that  there  were

separate settlements in Penang, in Malacca  and  in

Singapore. The Colonial Secretary was in charge  of

the Settlement of Singapore and there were resident

counsellors  in  Penang and in  Malacca.  The  same

pattern  of  Government obtained in the territories

of  the  Federated Malay States. There were British

residents in those territories, and above all these

at   the  apex  were  the  Governor  and  the  High

Commissioner.  Now in that set-up, it  was  natural

that  you  did  foster local government.  In  fact,

there  was a time in the history of Singapore where

you did have, say, an elected City Council, and for

some  reason  or  other, way back in  1879  to  the

1880's,  the Singapore Municipal Council ceased  to

be an elected body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the liberation after the Japanese

occupation   of  this  country,  the   pattern   of

Government  has  changed. You had  then  a  Malayan

Union which was, in fact, a British Crown Colony of

what  was  the  Federated  Malay  States  and   the

Unfederated  Malay  States. And  then  you  have  a

separate  Colony of Singapore. I will not  go  into

the  details of recent history. It is known to  you

all, that the idea of a Malayan Union, the idea  of

a  Crown  Colony of the Federated Malay States  and

the Unfederated Malay States was not acceptable  to

Malay  opinion  upcountry.  For  that  reason,  the

Administration  there  was  transformed  into   the

Federation of Malaya, which has since given way  to

the present situation in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, we also have marched on the road to

self-government and eventually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



to the road of merger with the Federation in

one sovereign independent State of Malaya. Now,  in

that situation, Mr Speaker, you have seen what had

happened in the City Council in the past two  years

before   the   P.A.P. became  the  Government   of

Singapore.   You  could  see,  Mr  Speaker,   that

parliamentary  forms were completely abused.  There

was  no  government  in  the  City  Council  as  we

understand it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the colonial system it was possible for

matters to be managed and for some semblance  of  a

government to be in the City Council, but that  was

not  a  situation  which obtained when  the  P.A.P.

became  a majority party in the City Council.  Then

again we have asserted in our manifesto, "The Tasks

Ahead", that we as a Government, we the P.A.P. as a

Government of Singapore, believe in efficiency, and

we  want  the cost of administration to be reduced.

It is well known to everybody in Singapore that the

functions of Government are distributed between the

central  Government, the City Council,  the  S.I.T.

and other quasi-Government bodies and agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that leads to a tremendous duplication of

effort. It leads to a considerable waste of  public

funds  and waste of public time if you want to  get

on  with the work you have in mind. We are no  more

in  the  period  when we can afford  waste  in  the

system  of Government. There is no reason why  they

should  vie  with one another. There is  no  reason

why,  for  instance, there should be a Ministry  of

Health and also a Department of Health in the  City

Council duplicating all the functions all the  way.

There   is  no  reason  why  there  should  be   an

Engineers'  Department in the City  Council  and  a

separate P.W.D. for the central Government. It  has

been  known  that  each department  tended  not  to

regard  the interests of the community of Singapore

but  to  regard its own interests as paramount.  We

have  known  cases where there were idle  engineers

and idle architects in the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no means by which we could call upon

their services to reinforce, say, the architectural

department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



or  the  engineers' department in the  P.W.D. when

they  were hard pressed. Now, that is a very simple

illustration  of the things we have  in  mind.  All

that  leads  to  extra  cost.  All  that  leads  to

frustration  amongst  the  public  and  a  complete

hatred of the present scheme of things. During  our

election  campaign, we had only to tell the  public

of Singapore to just look at the situation that had

been  produced by the energetic sense of  duty  and

the  excellent performance of our former  Mayor  in

the  City  Council. He could get things  done,  and

that  was  what  the members of the public  wanted.

They wanted things to be done. It was quite easy to

get  their support. We had only to tell them, "Look

at  the situation before Ong Eng Guan was the Mayor

of  Singapore. You queued outside the office of the

Registrar  of Vehicles." You and I have  seen  them

queuing  up  day  after  day,  night  after  night,

whenever  they wanted to renew their  licences  and

registrations. All that ceased with  the  energetic

work  of  our former Mayor, Ong Eng Guan.  That  is

what  the  public  of  Singapore  want.  They  want

efficiency and they want government. What  did  our

colleagues seated opposite me say? They were  going

to give everything away to the people of Singapore:

free  this, free that. We had only to mention  that

on  our  platform and they just laughed in complete

scorn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, that is what we stand for. We

stand  for  an  efficient, honest and incorruptible

administration.   We  do  not   believe   in   mere

performance. That is what our opponents believe in.

It  is  only under that scheme of things that  they

are able to perform. We can perform because we have

the  support of the masses and because we know that

we  have  the will and the determination to  govern

for them in their interest and to do everything  we

can for them.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Member for Farrer Park

when  debating  this  Bill  always  mentioned   the

question  of  parliamentary democracy.  We  sitting

here got



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



our  seats  through democracy. If  it  was  through

dictatorship,  there would have been no  opposition

in  front of us here. We consider that our victory,

that  we  can  form this Government,  is  based  on

parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have obtained a mandate from the people in

submitting  this  Bill. We are not submitting  this

Bill   without  having  proposed  in  the   general

elections  that if we were elected we  would  carry

out  this and that. What we are submitting  now  is

what  we  promised to the people, if we formed  the

Government, which means that what we are doing  now

has  the support of the voters in Singapore. It  is

not  through  unparliamentary  democracy.  If  this

Government  centralise its work at Upper  Pickering

Street,  which is said to be the venue  of  many  a

death,   I   think   the   deaths   were   due   to

disappointments at the previous Government. I think

the  administration will be easier  if  it  is  not

through  so  many steps, which delays the  work  of

Government. This is especially needed by people who

are  lazy. In fact, the people of Singapore require

a quick change to improve their life.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  it is the second time  this  morning

that  the  Member for Farrer Park  stood  up  as  a

defender of parliamentary democracy. All of us have

heard  this before during the election campaign - the

great Alliance of defenders of democracy. And  here

we see in the Assembly on the opposite side of this

House the remnants of that "rabble" army.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did not, of course, think

that so early in the proceedings I had to rise on a

point of order. I think that possibly "rabble army"

with  reference to Members of this Assembly  is  an

unparliamentary   expression  and   ought   to   be

withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, I meant `r-a-b-b-l-e".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. "Rabble" is unparliamentary

and I ask the Minister to withdraw it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I withdraw it. Mr Speaker,

perhaps the Member for Farrer Park fails to realise

that  this Assembly has come into being as a result

of  compulsory voting, and if anyone is to  be  the

defender  of  parliamentary democracy,  it  is  the

Government that is in power today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seem to have been fears that, in the name

of  efficiency, certain local authorities are to be

scrapped.  Evidently, certain people  would  prefer

inefficient  government, but this  Government  will

not  stand for it. We have made it quite  clear  in

our  election  campaign that  we  shall  scrap  the

duplication - perhaps the triplication - of work  in  a

small island of 1½ million people. If we think of

the  island  of  Singapore in the  context  of  the

world,  those  who  have  been  around  would  have

laughed  that a puny little island of 1½  million

people  has  got  so many bodies trying  to  govern

within  themselves and ignoring the others.  So  in

the  interest  of efficient administration  and  of

producing   the  goods  to  the  people,   we   the

Government  wish to centralise. Centralism  can  be

dangerous but with he overwhelming majority of  the

people behind this Government and the fact that  we

are  grounded with the people and not away from the

people,   we   shall  maintain  true  parliamentary

democracy.



<br><br>12.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the debate

regarding the City Council (Suspension and Transfer

of Functions) Bill, it seems that among the reasons

given  by  Government  is the allegation  that  the

previous  power  was  a  colonial  power  and   was

corrupted: but what the Opposition side would  like

to emphasise in this Bill is the true fact given by

the   Minister   for  Education   who   said   that

centralised power can bring disadvantages  to  this

country.  In  this way, we would  like  to  make  a

suggestion   regarding  this  plan  so   that   the

Government will not spoil the fate of the people of

Singapore.  There  are  reasons  to  say  that  the

Government cannot properly administer the State  of

Singapore  in an orderly manner. We all  understand

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



the  previous  period was a period in  our  history

which aimed at high ideals in administering our own

country.  Now  we have just come to  the  stage  of

holding  the  reins  of  government  fully  in  all

matters of administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be careful in a plan such as this. I am

afraid  that this Government is trying to establish

a government - or, the democracy to be carried out in

Singapore,  is  a  democracy in  the  form  of  the

suppression or the prevention of opinions which are

contrary to those of the government, because I have

observed the things which have been carried out  by

the    Ministry   of   National   Development    in

investigating the conditions in places  which  they

thought should be given every facility; they did so

without  discussing  the matter  with  the  elected

representatives for those areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I am the representative elected by

the  people of the Southern Islands, but  when  the

Ministry   of   National  Development   wanted   to

investigate the conditions or the weaknesses of the

islanders,   the  Ministry  never   contacted   the

representative   of   that  area.   Is   this   the

parliamentary democracy which is uppermost  in  the

minds of the Government? If it is our intention  to

work  together  to  build the State  of  Singapore,

mutual  respect should exist in this Assembly.  The

Opposition  should  not  be  looked  upon  as   the

remnants of colonialism. We are the representatives

of  the people. We are supposed to work together to

build an independent Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think this is an appropriate time

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning

the Member for Farrer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



Park  has expressed his concern for the welfare  of

taxi  drivers,  hawkers and other  members  of  the

proletariat.  His concern, I must say,  warmed  the

cockles of our hearts, at least even if it does not

raise the temperature of this chilly Chamber a bit.

However,  I  would like to assure  the  Member  for

Farrer Park that to express concern for the welfare

of the proletariat in the Assembly, or be it in the

City  Council, is not enough. What the  proletariat

is  more concerned is that action be taken on their

behalf, and my Party has never missed our work  and

neither  have we been content to lead on our  words

alone.  I  would assure the Member for Farrer  Park

that  our  taxi drivers, and our hawkers today  are

happier,  now that the P.A.P. is in the  Government

than  at  any time when the Member for Farrer  Park

was a Member of the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go into the technical details

and reasons why we are proposing to absorb the City

Council   into   the  functions  of   the   Central

Government. We have had several weeks of debate  on

this problem during the General Elections campaign,

and the electorate was fully aware that this scheme

of ours to absorb the City Council into the Central

Government was part of our five-year plan. The fact

that  the  P.A.P. today has been returned  by  the

people  with an absolute majority would  show  that

they fully support this scheme of ours which we now

formally propose in this Assembly to be regularised

by an Ordinance. It will be tiring and wearisome if

we were to go again into the details of speeches we

made during the five weeks of electioneering, and I

do not propose to do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the Member for Farrer Park showed a

considerable    degree   of   preoccupation    with

dictatorship. I am sorry that he has  an  obsession

on  dictatorships, but I would say that  there  are

two  possible  solutions to this obsession - one,  to

flee  the  country;  two, to  jump  down  from  the

seventh  floor of the S.I.T. offices  in  Pickering

Street, as advocated by the Member for Farrer Park.

However, I would say that this latter action  would

be, to say the least, most embarrassing because, on

the  one  hand,  someone on the Opposition  benches

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



have  to make an obituary speech and, on the  other

hand, for us altogether we shall have to face a by-election.  I can assure the House that  we  on  the

Government  benches  do not  have  people  who  are

megalomaniacs, nor manic-depressives.  I  must  say

that we should thank our lucky stars that there are

not  enough paranoids in this Chamber to  make  the

public   conclude  that  we  are  like   Woodbridge

Hospital inmates.



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, this morning we heard

speeches  relating  to  the  Bill  tabled  by   the

Government.  I  am  surprised  when   I   see   the

Government's  stand, because I know when  I  was  a

Minister  in the previous Government, we  formed  a

Committee on Local Government, on which the  P.A.P.

were   represented.   This  Committee   made   many

proposals  which  were tabled in the  Assembly  and

were  accepted unanimously by the P.A.P. and  their

representatives.  Besides,  in   1957,   the   then

Government tabled a Bill on local government on the

number  of assemblies - the City Council and District

Councils - which    were    agreed    to    by    the

representatives of the P.A.P. In addition to  that,

the  P.A.P. also took a major part in the  general

elections  in  1957  when  the  P.A.P. put  up  14

candidates.  Mr Speaker, I am surprised  that  the

P.A.P. took a decision about a month or two before

the   general  elections  to  abolish  the   policy

concerning the legislation or the policy  regarding

local government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the Government gave three reasons

for abolishing local government. The first concerns

finance;   the  second,  to  lessen  administrative

problems;    and    the   third,   to    centralise

administration. I would like to debate them one  by

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding finance, I do not know how we can

reduce  it. If we want to consider the expenses  of

the representatives - $200 each per month, the Mayor,

$1,000  per  month -  I estimate that  approximately

$90,000  will be scent every year. In  my  opinion,

the $90,000 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



annum  spent is not $90,000 thrown into the  ocean;

rather  with  it we can train representatives  from

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Mr Speaker, that today the P.A.P.

naturally represents the majority of the people. On

the  other  hand, we on the Opposition  side,  also

represent  the  people of Singapore.  Although  the

number  is small, it is the responsibility  of  the

Opposition  to  give  advice  and  views   to   the

Government to facilitate government administration.

Therefore,  Mr Speaker, if the aim  is  to  lessen

expenses,  and  if we take that  as  a  basis,  the

Opposition  in  this  Assembly  might  as  well  be

abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to minimise the work. Mr Speaker, it

was   to  streamline  the  workings  of  the  local

government that Government appointed a Committee on

Local    Government   in   1955   which    included

representatives of the P.A.P. That Committee put up

a  number of suggestions, among others, to separate

public utilities from the City Council. It was also

suggested that Government should unite a number  of

departments in the City Council with those  of  the

Government.  When the present Government  say  that

they  want  to  lessen  work,  it  is  not  a   new

suggestion.  It  is  really  an  old  proposal,   a

proposal  which was submitted by the  Committee  on

Local  Government and was accepted by the  previous

Assembly.  The  matter of lessening the  work,  Mr

Speaker, is a matter which has been accepted by the

previous Government, including the Opposition side,

that is to say, the representatives of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason which has been put up by the

Government is to centralise administration. It is a

good  thing to centralise administration  and  that

was  also  suggested  by  the  Committee.  But   if

centralisation means putting into the  hands  of  a

few  the  power of life and death then we might  as

well have no elected representatives. Just now,  if

I  am  not  mistaken,  one of the  Members  of  the

Government said that in Singapore the population is

only 1,500,000. He also said that in a small island

such  as  this, where the population is one  and  a

half million, it is not wise to have a number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



of  layers of administration. This I think  is  not

reason  enough. There are a number of countries  in

the world which have a population of less than 1½

million which have an administration as we do  have

in Singapore - central and local governments. If this

is  one  of  the reasons, it is not right.  Another

said  that  numerous layers of administration  will

give  rise  to  unnecessary arguments  between  the

Government and various bodies. But, Mr Speaker,  I

am of the opinion that because this Assembly is the

highest  authority in Singapore, it  has  power  to

amend  laws  and  to take action if  there  is  any

maladministration - whether in the City  Council  or

District Council - which contradicts the position  of

Government.  So the power is with  us.  It  is  not

necessary   to   abolish  a  body   which   in   my

opinion - whether administered by Government or  not - should  always work not for self interest  but  for

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we decide today to abolish local government it would mean that we will be taking

action with an iron hand. Although I know that  the

Government has a majority, I am of the opinion that

the  decision to abolish local government will only

give rise to bad blood which is not good. What will

the  people  say? The Government must realise  that

not all the people of Singapore voted for them, but

only 54 per cent, and there are the 46 per cent who

did not vote for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, as far as I know, from my

experience,  it  is  only countries  which  do  not

practise democracy which can and indeed had carried

out a measure such as this.



<br><br>2.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the Bill before us and under

discussion  today, in my opinion, is a  Bill  which

should  not be debated upon at great length because

the  question of absorbing the departments  of  the

City  Council  into Government service,  especially

into  the  Ministry  of National  Development,  has

already  received the support of the people because

the P.A.P. has made it a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



major  point  on its platform during  the  election

campaign.  For  the information of  the  Opposition

Members,  our Party has been successful in  getting

the  reins  of Government in Singapore  today.  The

basic question which should be discussed concerning

the  question  of  absorption of these  departments

into Government service is the question of finance.

The  financial  stringency faced by the  Government

today  is  a real one. We have asked the people  to

take  steps to do their bit to shoulder this urgent

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the Member for Geylang Serai say

that  this Government is taking action with an iron

hand, and the Member for Southern Islands has  said

that  the  Government is not practising  democracy.

But this, surely, is absolutely untrue, because the

factors  which we should consider are varied.  What

has  been  said by the Member for Geylang Serai  is

only a figment of his clouded and erratic thoughts.

He  stated that the previous Government had  formed

committees,  etc.  But  the ex-Minister  for  Local

Government,  Lands and Housing should realise  that

whatever departments are functioning in the Central

Government, for example, the departments of health,

architecture and engineering are also to  be  found

in  the  City Council. And all these factors should

be  seriously  considered;  we  have  a  number  of

departments  in  the Government  and  in  the  City

Council  where the nature of the jobs done  is  the

same.  The best example I can cite is the  question

of  building houses. The plans for these houses are

given  to the City Council, then they are given  to

the  Department of Lands and then to the S.I.T.  If

they are concerned with rural areas, the plans  are

sent to the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is indeed a time-waster. Some plans

take  months to be finally approved and  some  have

been  known to take two to three years. This  would

not  only  cause loss in revenue to the  Government

but this is also a loss of considerable time to the

applicant.  This  is  a  matter  which  should   be

rectified in the administration of this country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main aim regarding administration is to make

it function smoothly and and efficiently and we can

achieve  this if we absorb these extra  departments

into the central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to say something to the Member for

Southern Islands about his reference to the  P.A.P.

as  not  being democratic, by mentioning the recent

visit  to the Southern Islands by the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for National Development.

I  suspect  that  certain  people  are  jealous  or

envious  and  feel  that  they  should  have   been

informed about this visit. I feel that this kind of

feeling should be erased from the mind of everyone

who  is  a  democrat, and who is conscious  of  his

responsibilities   and  the   responsibilities   of

others.  The new Government of Singapore  does  not

only look into the interests of Members but rather,

and  more, into the interest of people as a  whole.

Therefore,  whoever has a task to  be  carried  out

should be able to do so without having to refer  to

the  Member of the constituency concerned. Whatever

job   that  is  done  is  not  done  for  the  self

glorification of any particular Member but for  the

Government and the people at large. I do not intend

to  say anything adverse about the character of the

Member of the constituency concerned. I want him to

know  what the new Government is attempting to  do.

As  for  the remarks made by the Member for Geylang

Serai,  I just have to say that we should work  for

the  benefit of all. Therefore let us work together

not  for any particular section of the people,  but

for all the people in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  today  we  are  facing  the   local

government Bill. We must face it on two reasons.  I

wish to give the two reasons to our friends on  the

opposite side. We told our Opposition Members  what

we  wanted to do, but if they can be more wise, the

creation of this Assembly is by means of democratic

election. In the election the P.A.P. had a  certain

and correct manifesto with a five-year Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



policy  put  before the people for them to  decide.

Today  we must do the duties which are given to  us

by  the  will  of  the people. Sir,  talking  about

democracy, we must respect the will of the  people,

to  put it more correctly. Therefore, this question

we can answer Members on the opposite bench.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point. If a government is elected by

the  people, then we must think whether we can make

full  use of our strength to put our effort  to  do

the  things and duties which are given to us by the

people.  If  we  can ask ourselves that,  then  our

answer must be yes. We must keep our promises  made

during  the  elections. If the previous  Government

dared  to see the people, then they would know  how

the  people  suffered. My colleague just  now  said

that  in  the  previous  colonial  society,  in  an

application for building an attap house,  they  had

to  run to three departments to get a licence. When

they  are hawking, they are suffering two  ways  of

oppression - arrests and prosecutions.  There  is  an

arrest  issued by the central government.  Then  we

must  make  the  people  of Singapore  continue  to

suffer without any change in the society to improve

their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can amend this Bill then we can make full

use  and  save  a lot of effort by  the  people  of

Singapore  and  we  can lessen a  great  amount  of

inconvenience  that  has been  put  on  the  common

people  of Singapore. During this period of change,

we must get rid of the bureaucracy that was left to

us by the previous Government. We must establish an

efficient administration. All this work depends  on

the  joint  effort of the Members of this Assembly.

This  refers  to the livelihood of  the  people  of

Singapore  and we must try our best to  meet  their

needs.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Honourable Minister in charge of the Bill in moving

the  Second Reading of this Bill gave, in  fact,  a

very  short  speech. I had hoped that he  would  at

least  have given us some cogent reasons  why  this

Bill should have been introduced. I know, Sir,  why

this Bill has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



been  introduced. Of course, Members on  the  other

side  will rise and deny that it is so. Because  it

is  not to their credit if they were to admit  that

what I am going to say is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there had been no talk of winding up the

City  Council  until the P.A.P.  City  Councillors,

including the P.A.P. Mayor, resigned from the  City

Council.  They had to find a reasonable excuse  why

these  City  Councillors deserted  their  posts  in

spite  of  what  their chairman  said  at  a  Press

Conference  when  my colleague,  the  Minister  for

Local Government, Lands and Housing in the previous

Government,  took over certain powers of  the  City

Council.  What did their chairman say? "The  P.A.P.

City   Councillors  will  remain   in   office   to

serve" - this  is  what  he  said -  "to   serve   the

interests  of the hawkers, the taxi drivers  and  a

lot  of other things, the proletariat." This,  Sir,

is  the Party that claims that it always stands  on

what  it  says.  And  yet  the  P.A.P.  Councillors

deserted their posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> "We always stand" - that is what

they  say,  I never said it - "we stand  by  what  we

publicly  proclaim!  We  proclaim  that  our   City

Councillors  shall remain in office  to  serve  the

poor people". And yet they ran away. Ran away!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

perhaps getting a little excited. Perhaps he should

modulate  his  voice because it rather  intimidates

the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry, Sir. One tends to

lose  one's sense of balance when one comes  across

such hypocrisy, and I must admit-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has forgotten

that I have in the past over-ruled the word

"hypocrite" in relation to Members of this

Assembly. There are certain Members of this

Assembly to which that word is, I think,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



being  applied  by the hon. Member.  Therefore,  he

must be rather careful of what he says.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Not hypocrite, Sir. All I can

say  is there is a claim to honesty which is a most

dishonest claim.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid the hon. Member

is  still being a little disorderly. The expression

`claim  to  dishonesty' - I  forget  now  the   exact

wording-but    the   expression   itself    implies

dishonesty  in so far as Members of the  Government

benches  are concerned and, therefore,  again  that

expression is unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Members on the

Government   benches   are  honourable   men   and,

therefore, they cannot be dishonest at all  because

they are honourable.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the hon. Member withdrawn that

expression?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I have, Sir. They have to find

a reasonable excuse for it. There was this sudden - I

will not call it running away - this sudden desire to

better serve the people of Singapore, and they  had

to  find  a  reasonable excuse.  And  what  is  the

reasonable  excuse?  "Oh, the City  Council  is  no

good!  We  scrap  it!" Sure,  it  is  a  reasonable

excuse. It had never been in their minds before. In

fact,  if  it had been, the Chairman of the  P.A.P.

would  not  have  said, "Our City Councillors  will

remain   in   office   to  serve   the   people - the

proletariat."  Yes,  nice  word - the  "proletariat".

Then  they  say,  "This is for better  efficiency."

Wonderful, Sir, It means that during the time  when

the  P.A.P. was in power in the City Council,  they

were not efficient. Therefore, they must scrap  the

City Council for better efficiency. Wonderful!  For

economies?   Yes.  And  yet  during  the   election

campaign  what  assurance was  given  to  the  City

Council employees? "We will scrap the City Council,

but  the City Council employees need not be  unduly

alarmed.  They  shall  not be affected."  Sir,  how

could  you  practise economy if you  do  not  cause

hardship  or affect the livelihood of City  Council

employees?  I  do  not know. Perhaps  the  economic

experts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



can  produce  a  plan  whereby  they  can  practise

economy without saving money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Deputy Prime Minister said that the

drivers and hawkers are happier today now that  the

P.A.P. is in the Government. I would ask him to  go

and  ask the hawkers and the taxi drivers, who  now

curse the day that they ever voted P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> At any time, when you were-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, it is all right. Taxi

drivers  have  now  reduced  their  fares  just  to

attract  the  people.  "Mari-lah,  dua  puloh  sen!

Twenty  cents is all right. I do not want 30  cents

because  times  are  hard!  You  know,  we  have  a

Government now that does everything and  times  are

hard.  Twenty cents will be enough. We do not  want

30  cents.  Never  mind."  Sir,  they  are  happier

because  they  earn  less money;  the  hawkers  are

happier  because they cannot sell all their  goods.

Naturally  they are happier because they can  bring

their goods home to eat themselves. Therefore, they

are happier. Indeed they are happier!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now. Sir, why scrap the City Council? We say that

it  is  good that there shall be a City Council  so

that  there  shall be a training ground for  future

legislators.  If there had not been a City  Council

during  our  time, I do not think the P.A.P. would

have  become so, shall we say - I will not  use  the

word  "notorious" - so well-known for its  activities

to  help the proletariat. It is because of the City

Council  that  the P.A.P. was able to  capture  the

City  Council  with 13 seats. That was  because  of

drive and ingenuity. That I must give credit to the

P.A.P.  Mayor.  They brought to the  forefront  the

meaning  of an elected Government. It served  their

purpose and now they want to scrap the City Council

because perhaps they now feel that if there were to

be further elections today to fill the vacant seats

in the City Council, the P.A.P. would be nowhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



It  is  because  they fear that  that  is  so  that

therefore they should scrap the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is what you say.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What I say and what the others

might  say  can  never be proved until  and  unless

there be by-elections or there is a by-election  to

the City Council. It is useless for us to argue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we feel that you cannot scrap the City

Council.  As I have said, it is going to provide  a

step  for, shall we say, local politicians to climb

to  this  Assembly. They say they want merger  with

the   Federation.  We  all  want  merger  with  the

Federation,   and  yet  in  every  state   in   the

Federation, there are municipalities. Now,  suppose

Singapore  were to become a state of the Federation

of Malaya and, by becoming a part of the Federation

of  Malaya,  we  accept  the  Constitution  of  the

Federation  of Malaya. Therefore, there would  have

to be municipalities. Perhaps they will say, "Never

mind,  we  in Singapore do not want a municipality.

The City Council is not good enough because we have

done enough damage. We do not want other people  to

correct  the damage that we have done,  nor  do  we

want  to be exposed. The damage we have done should

not be exposed." That is why they want to scrap the

City Council now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about the public utilities? They have

said.  Sir,  I think during the election  campaign,

that  the public utilities will be taken away  from

the  City Council and be handed over to Boards. Not

a  word  have they uttered about this. Do they  now

mean that they did not mean what they said? Perhaps

sometimes they try to say what they mean and end up

by saying they do not mean what they say!



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a politician

like  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  deserves  to  be

congratulated on one special attribute of his,  and

that  is his capacity to survive. When the military

administration   was  dissolved   and   the   civil

government  was proclaimed by the British  colonial

government, he was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



nominated a Member of the then Legislative Council.

Since then, there have been various changes in  the

constitution of our country. There have  even  been

elections.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill  has  shown

considerable  intrepidity  in  surviving  and  even

prospering   for   a  while  throughout   all   the

vicissitudes  of  our constitutional  changes.  One

would  have thought, Sir, that as a result  of  his

wide   experience   he  would  have   learned   one

principle, and it is this: that what is  right  and

proper  under  one  set  of  circumstances  is  not

necessarily right and proper under another  set  of

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. contested the City Council

elections, the main purpose was to use this vehicle

of  local government to serve the people, and  more

particularly  to  bring about the contrast  between

what  a vigorous and dynamic Party can provide  for

the  benefit of the people and what a feeble, inept

and  decadent Party can perform. During the  period

of the Rendel Constitution, it was absolutely vital

that this lesson be brought home to the electorate.

Now,  Sir,  we  have  a new Constitution,  and  the

functions  which certain organs of local government

perform  must be reviewed in the light of  the  new

political situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has had the temerity to

suggest that the P.A.P. runs away. The P.A.P., Sir,

does  not  run  away.  When  the  City  Councillors

resigned, they did not retire to Ipoh with a bagful

of  money. They faced the people again, put forward

new  policies  for the approval of the  electorate.

That is not running away, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has further suggested

that  the  City Council may be useful or should  be

retained because it provides a training ground  for

future legislators. Now, the City Council has  been

in  existence for quite a number of years and if we

were  to study the records of the majority of  City

Councillors, we can see no evidence whatsoever that

their  terms of service had done them any  good  at

all. If they have received any training, it is such

as  to  make more certain that they will meet  with

disaster  in  a fair contest before the  electorate

with  a  Party that has contact with the masses  at

the grass roots.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the hon. Members of the Opposition have

delivered  a  number of homilies on the  democratic

system. I have no doubt that they will continue  to

deliver further homilies in the future, but  may  I

suggest that in their future efforts, they  try  to

distinguish between the form of a democratic  state

and  its substance? The form of a democratic  state

finds  expression in various organs of  Government,

in  institutions  such as the  judiciary,  the  law

courts,  the  Public  Service  Commission,  and  so

forth.  Indeed,  in  this  very  House  itself,  we

observe certain - may I put it - rituals with which the

business of this House can be conducted with  order

and  expedition. For instance, Sir, when you  enter

this  building, it is the convention - it is  perhaps

even  the duty - of every Member in this Assembly  to

stand up as a token of respect and as an expression

of  acceptance  of  the need for order  and  proper

procedures  in  debate. But  no  one  is  going  to

suggest, Sir, that these forms are the essence of a

democratic  system. You will find  rituals  equally

elaborate observed perhaps in the Reichstag of  the

late  lamented  Herr Hitler. In the  Roman  Senate,

similar  elaborate  rituals were  observed  by  the

senators  and equal respect was paid - perhaps  in  a

more elaborate way - to victorious generals returning

from  campaigns  to Rome. These are  the  forms  by

which  the state carries out its functions and  one

must be careful to distinguish between the forms of

a democratic system and the substance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the situation that we find ourselves today,

the  substance  of  a  democratic  system  can   be

expressed in a few simple words. Today, we have  an

energetic  electorate  mostly  brought  up  in  the

Chinese  cultural tradition. They do  not  have  as

part of their culture any love and respect for  the

parliamentary  traditions  and  procedures  of  the

British  system. So far as they are concerned,  the

position  is  this. They have elected a  Government

which  has certain powers and which has to  operate

under certain limitations, and they demand of  this

Government  that,  within the  five  years  of  its

office, it must produce tangible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



and  concrete results in the way of the improvement

in the standard of living of the humble people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the substance of the democratic system

here.  Can  your  elected  Government  produce  the

results  which the people demand? It  may  have  to

modify the institutions which it has inherited from

the  colonial powers, and indeed my Government will

not  hesitate to scrap any institution  we  inherit

from the past which we find unsuitable and unfitted

for  the present. Our supreme purpose is to deliver

the  goods for the people and that is the real test

of  the  democratic system, not the frills and  the

froth about which Opposition Members have waxed  so

long and, to my mind, to so little purpose.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

and  hon.  Members,  in our debate  today  for  the

purpose  of  the suspension of the local government

authorities  of the past, I am of the opinion  that

my  view may differ from that of others. But I wish

to   say  what  I  think  is  reasonable  for  all,

particularly for our society and our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this debate, we wish to suspend the

legislation  concerning local government.  I  admit

the victory achieved by the P.A.P. is resounding so

that  they are now holding the reins of government,

which we cannot say is the case with us although we

can give opposition that is acceptable. However for

our part, I often hear in the course of debate that

our debate is based on discussions, that is to say,

on  negotiations between one side and another,  and

on   compromise  in  order  to  bring   about   the

betterment of our society which, it could be  said.

is    meeting   with   various   difficulties   and

shortcomings, in our struggle to achieve  the  type

of independence which we all long for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I am not surprised at all to see that the

Government has already introduced a Bill for us  to

debate  upon. Perhaps there will be people who,  on

reading this paper tomorrow, would say that we  are

debating  in the manner of people who  are  in  the

wrong places.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I know and understand that old clothes will be

refused  by those who are recently victorious,  and

therefore the old clothes must be changed  to  meet

the change of time on the basis of one's struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us ponder together about the future

consequences and the benefits that will be  enjoyed

by our society and our country in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, as one who at all times wishes to

safeguard  the  position  of  the  Government,   to

criticise it in a manner wherein it could  be  said

we   are  upholding  the  struggle,  this  Bill  is

premature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government finds that my view is

unacceptable, it can say that it is the duty of the

Opposition to oppose; the Bill is too premature and

hasty. It is too hasty for the Government to  carry

out  such  a policy. I believe it is our  good  and

pure   intention;  as  clarified  by  one  of   the

Opposition Members earlier, it is our objective  to

safeguard the welfare of the citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a Bill for the suspension of past

local government authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my view that our brothers in the Federation

of  Malaya  will take notice of this, in regard  to

the  question of a merger which, I feel in the long

run, is of prime importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if a matter of policy such as this could be

mutually discussed in a spirit of compromise rather

than in a spirit of showing how plucky we are, then

it  is  the main question of merger that should  be

considered, for in many States in the Federation of

Malaya, local governments are still functioning  in

the  small areas, perhaps to afford the opportunity

of  training  those  who  are  keen  to  serve  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I have no doubt that local government is like

normal  clothing. As I have said earlier, I  myself

would refuse clothes which are handed down and left

by those who have gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other important thing which I wish

to  stress  on and which I hope will be  heeded.  I

have seen it happen in the City Council in the past

when the P.A.P. was in power. I hope,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



if  possible, let nothing be done which perhaps  is

unacceptable to a section of the people of which we

are the representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding students who have passed Standard Seven

in  Malay  Schools, I congratulate the Ministry  of

Health  which has announced that the Ministry  will

accept  these  students for employment  in  various

capacities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if this Government will continue with this

policy  as  regards the students  who  have  passed

Standard Seven in Malay Schools, I believe  perhaps

it will get good support from the people; but if it

is only to make fun of our struggle, then I believe

we will not enjoy what we set out to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is the matter to which I wish to draw the

attention  of the Ministry which moved  this  Bill.

For  if  it wants to carry out the policy  let  the

Ministry  do it with full discretion and  not  with

discrimination against that section of  the  people

which, it can be said, wants to co-operate with the

others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one example which I hope would be carried

out by the Ministry concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I wish to clarify further:

although I am from the Opposition side, as one  who

is  upholding the policy of his Party,  it  is  the

basic  principle  for the Opposition,  particularly

for myself, to continue with what other Members  of

the  Opposition have said earlier; if possible,  as

it  must be, in our struggle, let it be seen by our

brothers  in the Federation with whom we are  proud

to  reunite, and let it be observed by our brothers

who  are not far distant in Indonesia, that  we  in

our  struggle today are not taking the  opportunity

of using any public facilities or utilities such as

water,  the  civil service, gas or  electricity  as

political weapons; for with the existence  of  this

Bill - or   it   could  be  said  it  is  unanimously

agreed - all responsibilities for public service  are

suspended; I fear if that is the case, the question

of  understanding and goodwill between one  another

will not be anywhere near.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is the main point - this question of water,

light, etc. - the time has come for the Government to

set it aside



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



so  that this matter will not flare up as it had in

the   past   City  Council,  particularly   between

U.M.N.O. and the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Government who has the majority

vote  today  will act with justice for all  without

favour to any particular group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, hon. Members, is our stand today regarding

the Bill before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to this, I admit the P.A.P. is the

victorious Party which is now holding the reins  of

Government;  I  need  not  inform  the  hon.  Inche

Baharuddin  that  I  am not  trying  to  defend  my

colleague  Inche Ahmad Jabri, but what  I  wish  to

clarify is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must remember

that  in addressing or in referring to a Member  of

the  House,  he ought not to use the  name  of  the

Member.   He   ought  to  use  the  name   of   his

constituency.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I beg your

pardon,  Sir, I wish to draw the attention  of  the

Member  for  Anson, the hon. Inche Baharuddin,  for

the  remarks made by him also affect the Member now

speaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge that the P.A.P. and its Ministers

have officially acted along proper channels. But as

I said earlier, I hope, if possible there is nobody

among the unsuccessful members of the P.A.P. taking

the  opportunity to use or to decry or who does not

realise that the successful representatives who sit

on  the Opposition side are given an allowance, the

sum of which we all know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wish to do that, I believe, surely we will

not  be  well understood in the country, to achieve

our cherished objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that those concerned should, in all

matters,   remember  the  various  communities   in

Singapore. For I wish to stress, the action of  the

Government in trying to amend or suspend the  local

government  authorities cannot be forestalled,  but

on  behalf  of the Opposition I wish to  warn  them

against  it  and  do my duty to the Government,  if

indeed  that is so; and I hope the Government  will

not, at a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



future date, allow a new Bill to be enacted,  which

cannot  be  accepted  by various  sections  of  the

people of this Island. That is all.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  we  have agreed to  debate  in  this

Assembly a matter connected with the administration

of  the  City  Council and the  District  Councils

which  is  to be handed over to the Government.  We

have  heard  a  number of people of the  Opposition

remarking  about  the past City Council  and  about

members of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to mention that no matter what kind of accusation comes from the

Opposition,  we have witnessed that the  people  as

judges have given their verdict and that the P.A.P.

Party   has  won  43  seats  and  has  formed   the

Government.  As  stated by the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan,  he  objected to the City Council  being

handed  over to the Government. He mentioned  about

the unification with the Federation - I think he does

not  see  far enough, because in future we  do  not

know  what  the  condition or the  changes  in  the

Federation will be. Therefore, on the part  of  the

P.A.P. as the Government today, we should use  our

initiative  as quickly as possible to  improve  the

livelihood of the people of Singapore. Furthermore,

I  should like to state that people who do not like

improvement, or those who do not like to improve-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

got  a  microphone before him, and if he  modulates

his voice, I think we could hear him just as well.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, once more I

reiterate  this - in connection with the  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan who mentioned about  unification

with  the  Federation of Malaya and criticised  our

plan - I  think the Member does not observe  or  does

not look forward into the political resolutions  in

the  Federation and Singapore. Once again, I repeat

to  the people or to a section of those who do  not

like  improvement or who do not like to defend  the

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



and  who  like to oppose or criticise our plan:  no

matter from what quarter the allegations come,  Mr

Speaker,  for  our part, Government will  certainly

carry  out  its duties and it will be left  to  the

people  to judge, when the P.A.P. carries  out  the

duties  of the Government, whether it is true  that

the P.A.P. is popular with the people or not. As we

all  know, the S.P.A., the Liberal Socialist  Party

and  their  other colleagues, on the 30th  of  last

month,  were wound up, because the people  have  no

confidence and did not vote for them. I  may  state

that one is afraid because of one's wrong, and  one

is  brave  because  one is right,  and  because  we

protect the interest of the people.



<br><br>3.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, it seems that on this

first  day  the new Government has debated  on  the

work  of  Government. Today we have  heard  various

criticisms  from  the side which was  formerly  the

Government but now the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I know the Member for

Cairnhill;   as  has  already  been  said   by   my

colleagues,  we know him to be a smooth politician,

adept  at  the  game of politics,  and  so  is  his

friend, the Member for Geylang Serai - the Dato, who,

unfortunately, is not here. He does not feel  happy

about his position today, though not so long ago he

was  a  very  proud person and claimed  to  be  the

leader  of his community in Singapore. But after  I

have  heard him and seen him for four years  he  is

now   a   different  man,  completely  altered   in

character and behaviour. That is what surprises me.

The  reason I say so, Mr Speaker, about the Member

for  Geylang  Serai is that if he  had  a  definite

policy  or  a firm stand, I believe he  would  have

spoken differently from what he did just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai stated the

Government   led  by  the  P.A.P. is   maintaining

policies and making decisions that are not  in  the

interests of the people of Singapore. Today is  the

first   time  I  heard  him  talk  of  the   people

generally. Outside this Assembly, he does not  talk

about  the people as a whole, irrespective of race,

creed and religion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



But   here,   everyone   claims   himself   as    a

representative of the people, defending the people,

for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Government and

Members  of  this  side, I say that  we  are  brave

enough to face facts; whatever we say to the people

we  intend carrying out; we are not scared to  meet

them  and  face criticisms, or whether our  actions

are  unsatisfactory  to  a small  minority  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we have been hearing since this morning

is  just talk about democracy. Everyone is fond  of

talking about democracy. Outside this House we  see

many  of  those who in the past knew nothing  about

the  Labour  movement appear in various  guises  as

Labour  leaders.  Why is this so?  I  believe,  Mr

Speaker, it is because they do not agree with  the

P.A.P. in particular and with the government of the

people in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question under discussion in

this  Assembly  concerning the  suspension  of  the

local  government  and  the  transferring  of   its

functions    into   the   Ministry   of    National

Development, we have heard the Member for Cairnhill

saying  that the Members of the P.A.P. in the  City

Council  ran  from their posts. But I fee  that  if

those P.A.P. Members were really irresponsible  and

did  not dare face facts, they would not have  come

out  to contest the last elections. The reason  why

they  walked  out of the City Council  was  because

they  believed  it was their duty to  do  so.  They

believed  the reason why it was necessary for  them

to leave the City Council was the responsibility of

the  past  Government. It had  carried  out  secret

means  to stain the good name of the P.A.P. members

who  had  a  majority in the City  Council.  But  I

believe,  on  the part of the Member for  Cairnhill

and  the Minister then responsible - the Minister for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing - they had taken

various measures to confuse the people of Singapore

that the P.A.P. and its members in the City Council

were carrying out polices which were unsuitable and

against the wishes of the people. But, Mr Speaker,

I  feel,  on that matter, the people today  are  no

longer the same in their outlook as in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



the  past  several years. They are awake  and  they

know how to choose between the good and the bad. If

Members  of the P.A.P. in the City Council  carried

out  their  duties  for their own selfish  purpose,

then the affairs of the City Council would not have

been  as  satisfactory as they actually were  while

the  P.A.P. was in control of the City Council  for

14 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what I heard just now was correct - I hope if

it was wrong, the Member for Cairnhill would please

correct me - he too congratulated the ex-Mayor who is

now  the Minister for National Development  in  our

government today, for the able manner in  which  he

carried out the administration of the City Council.

But I am surprised and perplexed here, Mr Speaker,

that  there are Members of the Opposition  who  say

that  the  People's Action Party is always  priding

itself  on  the fact that whatever it promises  and

says, it fulfils - it does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill made reference to what

the  Chairman of our Party had stated at the  Press

conference.   Our  Chairman  had  said  before   the

elections  that whatever the actions  of  the  past

Government against the P.A.P. in the City  Council,

our  Party would continue to serve the people. What

our  Chairman said was true, and we carried it out.

But   when   we  faced  the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly  elections, we felt that it  was  time  we

told  the  people  of  the  actions  taken  by  the

previous  Government, actions which were  incorrect

and  detrimental to the interests  of  the  people,

especially the poor people and those of  the  lower

income  brackets. That was why we asked our Members

to  walk  out of the City Council. We brought  them

out so that we could better ascertain if we had the

confidence  of  the people. We have  all  seen  for

ourselves  how happy the people of Singapore  were,

and we know the sort of confidence they have in the

P.A.P. That is why we have 43 Members of the P.A.P.

as  representatives, representatives of the  people

of  Singapore and the new Government - the Government

of the people and for the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised to watch the antics of the Member

for Cairnhill. Why, here today, his acrobatics were

very like those of a tiger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

been  guilty of using a certain expression - "animal"

expression,  shall  we say - with  reference  to  the

Member for Cairnhill. I do not think it is right to

call  any  Member of this House an  animal  of  any

nature.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> (In Malay): Mr Speaker,

I  did  not say that he was a tiger. I merely  said

that  he  behaved  like  one,  and  if  it  was  an

unparliamentary remark, I would gladly withdraw it.

I merely likened him to a tiger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to come back to my point. The

Opposition  have  not  much ground  to  oppose  the

Government.  However much they try to say  that  we

are behaving like dictators, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



feel  that the Government today will carry out  its

duties  justly  and  to the best  interest  of  the

people  of Singapore without distinction  of  race,

creed   and   colour.  If  we  wish   to   practise

parliamentary democracy, we cannot agree  with  the

point  that  we are representatives of a particular

group  of people, because this Assembly is a  forum

for  us to discuss affairs affecting the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

Further consideration, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, tomorrow at 2.30 p.m.
