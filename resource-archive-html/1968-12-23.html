Sir,  I  beg  to move, "That the Bill be now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for

the  financial year 1st January, 1969, to 31st March,

1970,  have been considered and approved by the House

as  Cmd.  Paper 27 of 1968. Under section 85  of  the

Constitution of Singapore, heads of expenditure other

than  statutory  expenditure  to  be  met  from   the

Consolidated Fund have to be included in a Bill to be

known as the Supply Bill. The purpose of such a  Bill

is  to  provide  for the issue from the  Consolidated

Fund  of  the  sums necessary to meet the expenditure

and  the appropriation of these sums for the purposes

specified therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supply Bill before Members is to give

legislative approval for the issue of funds from  the

Consolidated Fund to meet the sums of expenditure for

the  financial year 1st January, 1969, to 31st March,

1970.  In  the  Schedule to the Bill  are  shown  the

various heads of expenditure and the sums that may be

incurred  in  respect of each head. These  have  been

approved by the House in the Estimates of Expenditure

for  the  financial year 1st January, 1969,  to  31st

March,  1970, and appear in pages 53 and 54  of  Cmd.

Paper 27 of 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Supply Bill is approved, the Minister for

Finance   will   be  empowered  to   issue   warrants

authorising expenditure up to the amount  under  each

head  as  shown in the Bill to be paid out  from  the

Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recollect that in the Budget Speech the

Minister  for  Finance mentioned that  the  rates  of

stamp duty for a number of items, most of which  have

not been revised since the 1930s, would be revised to

bring  them in line with the present value  of  money

and  to suit present day conditions. From the revenue

angle,  the most important item of stamp duty  is  on

conveyances on property, accounting for 40  per  cent

of  the stamp revenue during 1966. The existing  rate

is  $2 for every $100 or part thereof. It is proposed

to  base the duty on a sliding scale. Where the value

of  the property is up to $30,000, there will  be  no

change  in the existing rate and, as such, purchasers

of  Housing and Development Board flats or other low-cost  houses will not have to pay higher stamp  fees.

Where  the  value of the property is above  $30,000,

and not more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



than  $50,000, there will be an increase of 50  cents

for  every $100 or part thereof on the value  of  the

property  exceeding $30,000. In respect  of  property

exceeding  $50,000, there will be an increase  of  $1

for  every  $100  or part thereof  on  the  value  of

property  exceeding $50,000. It is  quite  reasonable

that purchasers of property of higher value pay more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the rate of duty on the transfer of

shares and stocks is 15 cents for every $100 or  part

thereof  where the name of the transferee  is  filled

prior  to  the  execution of the transfer, in  other

cases,  the rate is 20 cents for every $100  or  part

thereof. It is proposed to increase the stamp duty to

20 cents and 30 cents respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present fee of 10 cents per share certificate

will  be  increased to $1 for every  $1,000  or  part

thereof  of  the par value in respect  of  new  share

certificates.  This revised rate will also  apply  to

certificates  issued in respect of bonus  and  rights

issues.  The  higher  fee is  justified  because,  in

subsequent  transactions, very  often  shares  change

hands  without registration, resulting in a  loss  of

revenue. At the same time, the existing flat rate  of

50 cents on a contract note will be replaced by an ad

valorem duty. A duty of $1  for every $1,000  of  the

value of the shares and stocks will be payable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stamp duty on cheques will be raised from 10

cents  to 15 cents and on receipts from six cents  to

10 cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these, there are small increases in the

rate of stamp duties on mortgages, leases, insurance,

appraisements, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, no increase in the duties on 15

items. These consist of the following five items  for

which  there has been no increase in the rates  since

1935.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) bonds on superannuation annuity - the rate is

25 cents for every $100;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) bonds of any other kind whatsoever - the rate

is $5;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) apprenticeship deed - the rate is $1;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) policy of sea insurance, where the premium

does not exceed $1 - the rate is five cents; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) life insurance policy for every $1,000 insured

- the rate is 10 cents per $1,000 or part

thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two items affect people in the lower

income group and item (iii) affects students who wish

to  learn  a  trade. In the case of item (iv) ,  if  a

higher  duty  is charged, it may divert  business  to

other  countries as the policy of sea insurance  could

be  taken  elsewhere. In the case of  life  insurance

policy, the rate is not increased because there is an

automatic  increase  in  the  amount  of  stamp  duty

payable with the larger value of life policies  being

taken now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten items for which the rates have not been

increased since 1952 are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) affidavits and statutory declarations - $2;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) bonds on letters of administration where the

estate does not exceed $10,000 - $2;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) power or letter of attorney for appointing a

proxy or where the value of a property is

below $1,000 - $1;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) any instrument certified or endorsed by a

public notary - $2;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) reconveyancing of mortgaged properties and

securities:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) where the amount of monies secured does

not exceed $1,000 - $1;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) where the amount of monies secured is

between $1,000 and $10,000 - $3;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any other case, the rate is $10;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) declaration of any trust or instrument

chargeable with duty on a settlement - $10;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) appointment of a trustee - $10;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) duplicate of any instrument chargeable with

duty - $2;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) protest of bill or note made by a public notary

attesting  the dishonour of a bill of  exchange

or promissory note - $1; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x) revocation of any trust of any property other

than a will - $10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific rates of duties affect generally people

in  the  lower income group. Affidavits and statutory

declarations are required by people for  purposes  of

identity  cards, birth certificates and for admission

of  children to schools, etc. In the case of bonds on

letters of administration, the specific duty is  only

applicable  for  release  of  estates  of  less  than

$10,000. This will affect families with small  means.

Power  or  letter of attorney appointing a  proxy  to

vote at a meeting is a very small item of revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the other items, the present rates

are reasonable, considering that the parties affected

would  have  to  pay duties on the other  instruments

connected with the transactions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that where the items affect people

in  the  lower income group, the duties  will  remain

unaltered and, at such, the revision of stamp  duties

will  only  affect  people who can afford  the  small

increases in the rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 36 (1)

of the Stamp Ordinance by increasing the flat fee for

adjudication  from  $1 to $25 to cover  the  cost  of

services performed by the Commissioner of Stamps.  In

addition, it is proposed to introduce a fee where the

value  of  the  property has to be  certified  by  .1

Government  valuer. This fee will  be  based  on  the

difference  between  the  amount  declared   by   the

applicant  and the amount certified by the Government

valuer as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a fee of one per cent will be charged on the

first difference of $10,000;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a fee of half per cent will be charged on the

next difference of $90,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the difference is in excess of $100,000, the

rate  of  duty  will be one-quarter  per  cent.  This

measure  is  necessary to circumvent  and  discourage

under-valuation by applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I deal with the Bill which covers two of

the  four  new  taxes announced by the  Minister  for

Finance  in  his Budget Speech, I would like  to  say

that the response of the public to the additional tax

measures is heartening. These tax measures have  been

described  as mild and fair because the new  taxation

has  been  kept  to  the minimum and  the  additional

burden  is  spread  thinly over  a  large  number  of

persons  who  are  able  to pay  without  being  over

burdened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed fears that the levy on

Public  Utilities Board bills will cause hardship  to

the  poor  households. In fact, the levy is based  on

the ability to pay and the burden on the lower income

group  is minimal. This has been achieved by avoiding

any  additional tax on cheaper cooking fuels  and  by

exempting households whose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



P.U.B. bills do not exceed $10 a month.

There is a rough relationship between

the amount of the P.U.B. bill and the

economic status of the household. The

very poor are not on the P.U.B. billing

list or have bills between $1 and $5.

Such households use only little electricity

for lighting and consume little water.

The next group with P.U.B. bills

between $6 and $10 consumes more electricity

and water. There are some

58,000 households, or roughly 25 per

cent, whose monthly P.U.B. bills are

less than $10. These people do not have

to pay tax on their bills. As the income

rises, households purchase refrigerators,

radios, television sets and install fans,

water-heaters and air-conditioners. The

average monthly cost of power for each

of these appliances is as follows:

          Article                   cost of power

                                      per month



          Fan                         $3 to  $4

          Refrigerator                $3 to  $4

          Television                  $3 to  $4

          Water-heater                $5 to  $6

          Air-conditioner

            (one horse-power unit)   $27 to $30

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible to isolate the really

poor  households y the type of cooking

fuel used, suhc as kerosene, charcoal

and wood. Sir, may I rfer to teh

Singapore Sample Household Survey,

1966, which was conducted by the

Ministry of National Development and

the Economic Research Centre,

University of Singapore? It is entitled

Singapore Sample Household Survey, 1966, No 1,

and printed by the Government Printer in

September 1967. The table I refer to,

Sir, is H.54 at page 234 of the Report.

According to this survey, of the total 331,952

households; kerosene was used by 104,399 households; charcoal was used by 32,675 households; and wood was used by 58,231 households;

collectively accounting for 59 per cent of

the households. There are about 73,000

P.U.B. consumers whose monthly bills

range from $10 to $20. They will be

liable to pay a levy of five per cent.

Nearly half of these households will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



have to pay between 50 cents and 70

cents per month and the other half will

have to pay between 75 cents and $1

more per month. The small levy will not

cause any hardship as these households

are in the better financial position, or

otherwise they would not be in a

position to have fans, radios and

refrigerators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next category of households,

numbering 32,000, have P.U.B. bills of

between $21 and $30. They will be required

to pay a levy of 10 per cent.

These households will have to pay

between $2 an $3 a month. Such households will normally have fans, television sets and refrigerators and the extra $2 to $3 a month is not likely to

involve any sacrifice on their part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 50,000 households

with P.U.B. bills above $30. These

households are the more affluent and

they have refrigerators, television sets,

water-heaters and even air-conditioners.

These households also have two or three

water closets. I am sure that these

people can afford to pay a levy varying

from $3 to $12 per month. Members

will agree that the tax which rises from

a few cents to a few dollars in line with

the economic status of the households

is not unreasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy on Singapore Telephone

Board - for short, I shall just say

S.T.B. - bills will only affect people

with means, as the less well-to-do are

unlikely to have a telephone. There are

45,104 residential lines and 35,552

business lines for our population of two

million people. This is the first time for

more than a decade that telephone subscribers

will have to pay an additional

amount, as the telephone charges have

not been revised since 1958. Resisdential

subscribers who do not make trunk calls

frequently will, on the average, pay about

$3.50 per line per month. I am sure the

amount of tax is far from being

exorbitant and can be borne easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although new administrative machinery

is not requried for the collection

of taxes on P.U.B. and S.T.B. bills, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



necessary to provide by enactment of this Bill, legal

authority for the imposition and collection of  these

taxes.  The  definition  of "services"  and  "taxable

services" in clause 2 of the Bill includes letting of

apparatus or appliances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill empowers the Minister to

specify  by  publishing an order in the  Gazette  the

statutory  boards and the services which will  become

taxable as well as the rates of tax to be charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 gives the power to the statutory board for

the  collection  and recovery of  this  tax  in  such

manner as approved by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 stipulates that the tax collected under

this Bill shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 gives the power to the Minister to exempt

any  person from the payment of this tax. Under  this

provision, the Minister for Finance intends to exempt

subscribers of the P.U.B, whose bills are  below  $10

per  month  and  industrial consumers of  electricity

using more than 400,000 units of electricity a month.

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before Parliament seeks to amend the

Customs   Ordinance,  1960  (No.  44  of   1960)   to

streamline  customs procedures  with  a   view   to

improving the efficiency of the Customs  Department

and reducing inconvenience to traders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the important, amendments.

Section  14  of  the  Ordinance  is  amended  by  the

addition  of a new section - section 14A -  to  allow

for  goods  manufactured, assembled  or  produced  in

Singapore which are not subject to excise duties  and

which  have  been exported to be re-imported  without

payment  of import duty. The importers will, however,

have  to satisfy the Comptroller of Customs that such

goods  have  not  undergone  any  processing   or

manipulation  outside  Singapore.  At  present,  such

exemptions  are  given on an  ad  hoc  basis  by  the

Minister.  This  causes some delay  in  clearance  of

goods and unnecessary correspondence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Ordinance, drawback of duty is

allowed on goods, subject to import duty, but not  on

goods, subject to excise duty. Clause 18 of the  Bill

extends  drawback  facilities to locally-manufactured

products which may be subject to excise duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the power to levy or vary the special

tax  on diesel-engined vehicles lies with Parliament.

Clause  6  is intended to transfer the power  to  the

Minister.  This will enable any changes  to  be  made

speedily by a Ministerial order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill simplifies the procedure for

the   duty-free  importation  of  bona  fide   trade

samples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill dispenses with the need for

customs   permits   for   dutiable   imports   except

intoxicating  liquors or tobacco where  the  duty  is

less  than  $100.  This  will expedite  clearance  of

passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments are to raise the minimum amount

from  $10 to $100 for drawback claims and to  reduce

the  period during which claims can be made  from  12

months to six months, to give discretionary power  to

the Comptroller,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



to  waive collection of duty of less than $5, and  to

increase  the  maximum composition fee from  $600  to

$1,000 which is the level prevailing in Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before Parliament proposes two

amendments to the Cinematograph Film Hire  Duty  Act,

1966.  An amendment to section 10 to limit the amount

of  gross  receipts which may be deducted by  a  film

renter for the purposes of film hire duty assessment,

and the other is an amendment to section 16 to enable

senior officers of Customs to compound offences under

the  Act  where the amount involved does  not  exceed

$100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film hire duty is assessed at 60 per cent of the

gross  receipts of a renter derived from the  renting

of  films. For the purpose of duty assessment, a film

renter  is allowed to deduct from the gross receipts,

proceeds derived from the sale or hire of advertising

materials or accessories used in connection with  the

distribution  or  hire  of  films.  There  have  been

instances  of  renters deducting  unreasonably  large

amounts  in  this respect, thus reducing  the  amount

assessable  for duty. As a remedy to such abuse,  the

amendment to section 10



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



of  the Act limits such deductible amounts to 10  per

cent  of the gross receipts or $50, whichever is  the

lesser.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, senior officers of Customs are empowered

to  conduct  court  prosecutions  on  behalf  of  the

Comptroller of Customs and Excise for offences  under

the Act. Experience has shown that it is desirable to

provide powers for such officers to compound offences

involving  sums  of less than $100  to  avoid  taking

cases  to the court. This is effected by the proposed

amendment to section 16 of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's international trading character, coupled

with  the fact that many of our citizens often travel

to  different parts of the world, makes it  necessary

that  officers  of  our Diplomatic  Corps  should  be

enabled  to  administer oaths or  affirmations,  take

affidavits and do notarial acts which notary  publics

in Singapore are normally empowered to undertake, and

for these to be valid in law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the copies of the Bill which have been

provided,  Members will have seen  that  the  primary

purpose of this Bill, as set out in clause 3, is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



empower diplomatic and consular officers of Singapore

missions abroad, as well as those consular agents who

may be acting for Singapore in countries where we are

unrepresented,  to perform these functions  and  levy

appropriate fees for such services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will appreciate that the process of

consolidating   the   friendly  relations   we   have

established  with foreign countries will  take  time,

money and personnel. Much as we would wish to do  so,

it  will  not  be feasible to establish  missions  in

every   friendly  country.  As  of  today,  we   have

diplomatic  missions in 11 countries. In alphabetical

order,  our  missions are located in Bangkok,  Cairo,

Canberra,  Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, London, New  Delhi,

Phnom Penh, Tokyo, Washington and Wellington. Besides

these, we also have a Commissioner in Hong Kong and a

permanent  mission  to the United Nations.  With  our

citizens  travelling  and doing  business  with  more

countries  than  those in which we  are  represented,

Singapore  has  to  depend upon friendly  governments

with  missions  in  those  countries  where  we   are

unrepresented  for the performance of  the  functions

envisaged in the Bill as and when the need arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of today, Members will be interested to know, and

note   with  appreciation  the  fact,  that  we  have

hitherto  been  assisted  in  this  respect  by   the

Governments  of  Malaysia,  the  United  Kingdom  and

Thailand  in  different parts of the world  where  we

have no missions of our own. Provision is, therefore,

made  in  the  Bill for such situations  where  these

friendly   governments  can  perform  the   functions

envisaged in the Bill on our behalf and for these  to

be valid in law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been, in recent years, an increasing

demand for Singapore seamen as a result of which  the

reserve  pooi  of seamen registered in  the  Seamen's

Registry Board has fallen below the accepted  minimum

of  20  per cent. As at 31st October, 1968, the total

number  of  seamen on the register was 8,264,  and  a

reserve  pool at 20 per cent would be 1,653, but  the

actual availability was only 1,258 or 15 per cent  of

the  total  number of registered seamen in Singapore.

The   demand  has  arisen,  firstly  because  of  the

cessation   of   confrontation  by   Indonesia   with

consequent  new job opportunities, and the preference

for  Singapore  seamen  in relation  to  other  Asian

seamen,  and,  secondly, because of our  Government's

promotional  activities for more  jobs  at  sea.  Our

training ship "Singapore", which was started in 1964,

has  so  far  creditably produced over 1,600  trained

seamen.  This training ship scheme, however,  is  not

capable  of  significantly increasing the  output  of

trainees   to  meet  the  urgent  demands  at   hand.

Consequently,  a  crash  programme  to  increase  the

supply  of  seamen has been drawn up by our  Seamen's

Registry Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the new scheme will supplement what our

training   ship  is  able  to  produce,  by  allowing

shipowners to take on a flexible number of  Singapore

citizens to acquire the skills of seamanship  through

on-the-job training on board ship. Such men  will  be

expected to do the jobs in the category in which they

are employed under the guidance of experienced hands,

and  they  will he required to serve for a period  of

six



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



months    before   being   discharged.   Those    who

satisfactorily complete the six months'  period  will

be given provisional registration as ordinary ratings

for  a  further  period  of  six  months.  Those  who

satisfactorily   complete   both   their   on-the-job

training  period  and  their  period  of  provisional

service, that is, after one year's service made up of

two periods of six months each, will be registered as

regular  seamen and they will then be free to  select

employment  on  home-trade, local-trade  or  foreign-trade ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shipowners who participate in the new scheme are

free  to  select and sign-on Singapore citizens  whom

they  consider  suitable for on-the-job  training  on

their  ships,  without  having  to  go  through   the

Seamen's  Registry  Board. As  an  encouragement  and

incentive, owners of foreign-going ships are entitled

to  seek  reimbursement  from the  Seamen's  Registry

Board  at  the  rate of $35 per month per  person  in

respect  of trainees who have successfully  completed

their six months' on-the-job training, on board their

ships.  I am pleased to state here that the Singapore

shipping community have responded favourably to  this

scheme  and  have  indicated  their  willingness   to

participate as and when the new scheme is introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will, therefore, be necessary to amend the

Seamen's Registry Board Ordinance, 1957, so that  the

men   selected   for  the  on-the-job   training   by

shipowners  will not be required to  go  through  the

process  of selection by the Board, as stipulated  in

the  present  Ordinance. The Seamen's Registry  Board

(Amendment)  Bill seeks to achieve this by  excluding

probationer deck-hands, probationer engine-room hands

and  probationer  catering  hands  signed  on  ship's

articles  under  the scheme from  the  definition  of

"seamen"   in  section  2  of  the  Ordinance.   This

amendment  will allow shipowners to take on untrained

men for training on their ships.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed to discuss the contents of this

Bill,   allow  me  to  elaborate  a  little  on   the

background of the subject. Prior to the formation  of

Malaysia,  Singapore was a Port of British  Registry.

With  Malaysia, Singapore became a Port of  Malaysian

Registry.  Soon  after  the separation  in  1965,  we

decided  to establish our own Registry of Ships,  and

the  Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act  of  1966  was

accordingly   promulgated.  Under   this   piece   of

legislation,   ownership  of  Singapore   ships   was

confined   to   Singapore  citizens   and   companies

incorporated in Singapore and having their  principal

place  of  business  in Singapore. Indeed,  Singapore

citizens and companies were compelled under  the  law

to register their ships as Singapore ships. While, on

the   one  hand,  an  obligation  was  imposed   upon

Singapore  citizens and companies to  register  their

ships  with  us, on the other hand, no  corresponding

incentives  were  offered.  It  was  not  surprising,

therefore,  to  find  that  after  one  year  of  the

establishment  of our Registry, as at  31st  October,

1967,  there  were  only 298 ships  on  the  Register

totalling some 123,000 gross tons. Of the 298  ships,

244  or  82 per cent were tugs, barges, dumb lighters

and other small harbour craft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, a review was made and we decided that

we  should  remove the restriction  on  ownership  of

Singapore ships and offer attractive incentives so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



that, by making it worth while, ship-owners would  be

induced  to  fly  the  Singapore  flag.  Members  may

recollect  that the then Deputy Prime  Minister,  now

the  Minister for Science and Technology,  stated  in

Parliament during the course of the Budget debate  in

December   last  year  that  legislation   would   be

introduced this year to encourage more ships  to  fly

the Singapore flag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House seeks to amend the

Merchant Shipping Ordinance to enable Singapore to be

a  party  to  the  International Convention  for  the

Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, and to establish an open

Registry of Ships. At present, Singapore is  a  party

to   the  1948  Safety  Convention.  This  Convention

prescribes  certain  requirements  relating  to   the

construction and survey of ships, provision of  life-saving  appliances  and radio  equipment,  safety  of

navigation, carriage of grain and of dangerous goods.

Signatory  governments  are obliged  to  apply  these

prescribed  standards  to  their  ships.   The   1960

Convention  is  in  scope and content  essentially  a

revision  and extension of the 1948 Convention  which

it  replaces. Being a major port and having  a  vital

interest in the development of merchant shipping,  it

is   necessary  for  Singapore  to  accept  the  1960

Convention.  The first part of this Bill,  therefore,

contains  provisions  whkh will enable  Singapore  to

give effect to the provisions of the 1960 Convention.

This is achieved by deleting Part III of the existing

Ordinance which deals with passenger ships  only  and

whith  contains outdated provisions, and substituting

therefor  a  new Part III. Under this new  Part  III,

ships   are   required  to  hold  Safety   Convention

certificates, and provision is made for the issue  of

the appropriate certificates for both passenger ships

as  well  as  cargo  ships. Power  is  given  to  the

Minister   to  make  the  necessary  regulations   to

implement the provisions of the 1960 Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of this Bill seeks to amend the existing

Ordinance to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



provide for an open Registry of Ships in Singapore.

This  is  achieved by deleting the existing Part  XIV

and  substituting  a new Part XIV. The  ownership  of

Singapore   ships  is  not  restricted  to  Singapore

citizens  or  companies  incorporated  in  Singapore.

Under   section   504,   any   person   or   company,

irrespective    of   nationality   and    place    of

incorporation,  is eligible to register  ships  under

the  Singapore  flag. Where previously ownership  was

confined  to  Singapore citizens and companies,  this

clause   now  provides  an  opportunity  for  foreign

shipowners  to place their ships under the  Singapore

Register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would not be sufficient merely to open

the  Register  to foreign shipowners  and  companies.

Incentives have to be provided for to make  it  worth

while  for shipowners to fly the Singapore flag,  and

I,  therefore, draw Members' attention to section 512

which provides for very low fees for the registration

of  ships.  An initial registration fee of $2.50  per

net  ton,  and an annual tonnage tax of 20 cents  per

net  ton  only  shall be payable for every  Singapore

ship. It is provided that this fee and annual tonnage

tax  shall not be increased for a period of 20  years

from  the  date of initial registration of the  ship.

Shipowners will note that these rates are very  much

lower than those charged by other flags.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this incentive of low fees, we will

provide   another   extremely  attractive   financial

incentive, which is that no Singapore income tax  is

payable  on profits derived from ships registered  in

Singapore.  Financially, therefore, a shipowner  need

only  pay  very  low  fees,  the  rate  of  which  is

guaranteed  for  20 years, and profits  derived  from

Singapore ships are exempt from Singapore income tax.

I  should  like  to assure shipowners  that  although

income  tax exemption provisions are not specifically

stated  in this Bill, appropriate amendments  to  our

Income  Tax  laws  are expected to be  introduced  in

Parliament in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these financial incentives, we will

also   be   providing   other   advantages   of   an

administrative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



and technical nature. Shipowners who wish to transfer

their  ships  to  the  Singapore  flag  will  not  be

required  to  have  them  re-surveyed  if  the  ships

possess  valid  certificates. As a matter  of  fact,

this policy of not requiring ships to be re-surveyed

has  been in force since early last year and will  be

continued. Further, provision is made in section  509

(4)  to  accept  foreign tonnage  certificates.  This

means   that  a  ship  holding  a  foreign   tonnage

certificate need not be re-measured for tonnage  when

transferring  to  the  Singapore  flag.  Again,  this

practice  has already been in force and will continue

to  be  so. The acceptance of valid certificates  and

foreign   tonnage  certificates  will   obviate   the

necessity to have the ship drydocked and re-measured,

and consequently will save the shipowner considerable

expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an added facility, international classification

societies will be appointed to survey Singapore ships

and  issue  certificates on behalf of  the  Singapore

Government. At present, four classification societies

have  been appointed, namely, the American Bureau  of

Shipping,  the  French  Bureau Veritas,  the  British

Lloyds Register of Shipping, and the Norwegian Norske

Veritas.   Two   other  international  classification

societies  are also being considered for  appointment

and,   when  appointed,  shipowners  will  have   six

classification  societies for the purpose  of  survey

and  issue  of  certificates. In addition  to  these,

there  is,  of  course,  our  own  Government  Survey

Division  whose services are available to shipowners.

So  altogether there will be seven survey authorities

fully  empowered to survey Singapore 'ships and issue

certificates on behalf of Government and,  with  the

six  classification  societies  giving  international

coverage,  shipowners  will  be  assured  of  maximum

survey facilities wherever their ships may be.  Power

to  appoint  classification  societies  is  given  in

section 160.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of all this, our registration procedures will

be  kept  simple  so that the whole  process  can  be

expeditiously completed. We will do everything



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



possible  to facilitate the transfer and registration

of ships to the Singapore Registry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may want to know what we hope to gain out of

this exercise. With income tax exemption and very low

fees,  we  could  not hope to gain  much  by  way  of

revenue  although the acquisition of a large  tonnage

would  bring  in  some useful revenue.  We  hope,  by

encouraging  foreign  shipowners  to  register  their

ships  under  our  flag,  to create  more  employment

opportunities for our citizens. Under section 527,

Singapore  ships  engaged in  home  and  local  trade

voyages shall be obliged to carry such percentage  of

Singapore  seamen as may be prescribed from  time  to

time. This may seem onerous at first sight, but it is

really  not  so, because these home and  local  trade

ships  are  already  carrying  Singapore  seamen.  To

encourage  more  foreign-going  ships  to   take   on

Singapore seamen, we would refund 50 per cent of  the

annual  tonnage tax if the foreign-going ship carries

at  least  25  per  cent Singapore  seamen.  This  is

provided for in section 527 (2). In this way,  owners

of  foreign-going ships can reduce  costs  simply  by

engaging Singapore seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to officers, the existing Ordinance

requires  Singapore  ships to be manned  by  officers

holding  Singapore  certificates  of  competency   or

Commonwealth certificated officers. Since  we  are

very  short  of  local  deck  officers,  we  will  be

prepared   to  grant  liberal  exemptions   so   that

Singapore  ships  may be manned by  officers  holding

valid foreign certificates. As a matter of fact, this

policy of granting exemptions was implemented about a

year  ago,  and  during the period  January  1967  to

November  1968, 53 exemptions were granted  to  allow

foreign   certificated  deck  officers  to  sail   on

Singapore ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill provides the

Minister with powers to make such regulations as  are

necessary or expedient. There is no need for  me  to

go  into the details of the various' regulations that

we  will promulgate in the near future, but I should

like to deal with an important set of regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



relating to the construction, survey and equipment of

ships.  This set of regulations, which will be  known

as  the  Safety  Convention  Regulations,  will  give

effect to the International Convention for the Safety

of  Life  at Sea, which I mentioned earlier. I  would

like  to  say that we expect all Singapore  ships  to

come up to international standards. We will not allow

sub-standards in matters of construction, surveys and

equipment. But, on the other hand, we will not insist

on  excessive  standards. All  that  we  ask  of  the

shipowner is to maintain his ship in accordance  with

international standards as prescribed under the  1960

Safety    Convention.   Consequently,   our    Safety

Regulations  will be derived substantially  from  the

regulations  annexed  to  the  1960  Convention.  The

Safety Regulations are already in draft form and  can

be expected to come into force in the not too distant

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to say that since

the  mention  of  new legislation  in  Parliament  in

December  last year, we have had many inquiries  from

ship-owners  all over the world on the new  Registry.

Members  may  wish to know that as at 30th  November,

1968,  there  were 349 ships exceeding 242,000  gross

tons  on  our Register. Although it is gratifying  to

note  that the registered tonnage has almost  doubled

since  October  last year, the figure  is  still  not

commensurate  with  our status as  a  major  shipping

centre. I am confident that with the passing of  this

Bill  and  with  all the incentives enumerated,  more

shipowners will fly our Singapore flag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

know  that there are many advantages in having  ships

registered in Singapore. But what worries me is  what

will happen in case of accidents, say leakage of  oil

from  a  tanker  registered  in  Singapore?  Is   the

Government   of   Singapore  responsible   for   such

incidents?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>

obstacles and problems so that you do nothing. First,

I  think we should get more ships registered with us

and then think of the consequences, if any, later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which is now before the House seeks to

amend   the  law  relating  to  legitimacy  of  one's

children.  Although  it  is a  general  principle  of

English  law  that children born out of wedlock  may,

nevertheless,  become legitimate  children  of  their

parents if and when their parents subsequently  marry

after  the birth of such children, this has not  been

the case in Singapore in regard to all members of our

several communities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anomaly in the law has resulted from the fact

that  our society seeks to accord the respect due  to

such personal laws of the various sects and religions

that form part of our multi-racial population. And so

it  is  that those members of our society that belong

to  the  Muslim  faith  are  governed  by  their  own

personal  laws in respect of such matters as  marital

laws,  family laws and laws of succession.  Those  of

the Muslim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



faith,  therefore, are governed by those precepts  of

the   Muslim  law  as  would  be  applicable  to  the

respective  schools  of  Muslim  law  to  which  they

belong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the general precepts of Muslim law were

consolidated in the very comprehensive Administration

of Muslim Law Act which was passed in  1966. That Act

specifically provides that members of our society who

belong  to  the Muslim faith are obliged to  register

their  marriages at the Shariah Court. Unfortunately,

although  it  is so provided in that  Act  that  such

registration of marriages must take place, it was not

provided  in  regard to children that  were  born  of

legal  marriages, should they be born out of wedlock,

that they would receive the consequential benefits of

having  their status altered and becoming  legitimate

children  of their parents. In other words, Sir,  the

principle  of legitimatio per subsequens matrimonium

was  not  afforded  to  them. This  obvious  omission

should,  in fact, have been taken care of in the  Act

of  1966 itself. It is therefore to provide for  this

hiatus  in  the law, i.e., legitimation  of  children

born  of  such marriages, that the present Legitimacy

(Amendment) Bill is being introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the

exception  of those people of the Muslim faith,  what

will  happen to our citizens born out of wedlock  and

whose  parents do not subsequently get  married?  Are

they going to be labelled for the rest of their lives

as  bastards?  Or will they be ordinary  citizens  of

ours and not have the stigma of bastards?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if the parents refuse to marry,

then,  of  course, the children will he illegitimate.

The  Legitimacy  (Amendment) Bill covers  only  cases

where  parents  marry after a child or  children  are

born. So until the date of the marriage, the children

are illegitimate. But when they marry, that act



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



of marrying makes the children legitimate. But unless

the  parents  are married, I am afraid  the  children

will still be illegitimate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point I am

getting at is, what will happen to our citizens whose

parents  were never married? Will they carry  on  for

the  rest of their lives as illegitimate citizens  of

this country in the eyes of the law, and what happens

when they hold passports, and so on?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps they are not illegitimate

citizens of the country but are illegitimate children

of their parents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, legitimacy has nothing to do with

citizenship.  Whether the children are  born  out  of

wedlock  or whether or not their parents are  married

does  not  affect  their  citizenship.  But  if   the

children are illegitimate and if the father or mother

dies intestate, they do not share in the distribution

of the estate unless, of course, there is a will. But

illegitimate children can still be citizens - if that

is what has been worrying the Member for Joo Chiat.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think what is in the mind of the Member  for

Joo  Chiat  is the status of the child  who  is  born

illegitimate  and whose parents subsequently  do  not

marry,  and  whose status as citizens  has  not  been

disclosed, because the issue becomes a citizen of the

state  only  if at the time of his birth his  parents

are citizens of the state.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I believe there is a provision in the

Constitution  which says "one of whose parents  is  a

Singapore citizen". So if one parent is a citizen  it

is  immaterial if they are not married at the time of

the child's birth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, if the status is not disclosed at

the  time  of the birth of the child, then the  issue

cannot be said to be a citizen of the state. I  think

that  is  what is in the mind of the Member  for  Joo

Chiat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Yeoh, I take it that you are

seeking  a  further  point of clarification  and  not

making another speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, another point which I have

in  mind  is  this.  Can  illegitimate  children  who

subsequently  grow up become Ministers  of  State  or

Ministers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Do you have anybody in mind?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  ask  the  Minister   one

question.  When an illegitimate child  grows  up  and

marries, will he still be illegitimate?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  the  question  of children who are  born  out  of

wedlock, I do not think there is any difficulty in so

far  as  citizenship is concerned, because the  child

will  follow the citizenship of the mother. There  is

no  need for the child to have a parent or father who

is a citizen of Singapore for the purpose of becoming

a citizen of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The debate on the Second Reading cannot

be  used  as an excuse for seeking legal advice  from

the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, first, if I may deal with the

Member for Sembawang who asked whether the subsequent

marriage  of the child, when he is of age, will  make

him legitimate. It can never make him legitimate.  If

he marries, his children will be legitimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the queries by the Member for Joo

Chiat  and the Member for Serangoon Gardens, I  think

they  have  been  answered by the  Member  for  Bukit

Panjang. But there are difficulties when children are

born out of wedlock, because sometimes the father  is

disclosed  in the birth certificate or a notification

of  birth. Sometimes, of course, the father's name is

not  disclosed. But if the children are illegitimate,

then  the  father, whoever he may be,  has  no  right

whatsoever over the child. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



the  mother  who  has the sole right  to  the  child.

Therefore,  the citizenship of the child will  follow

that of the mother.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Barker].

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Public Utilities (Amendment) Bill proposes

a  number  of amendments which, it is considered,  in

the  light of experience gained in the administration

of  the  Public  Utilities  Ordinance  since  it  was

brought  into force in 1963, will make administration

more effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes provision for the transfer of powers

vested  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  (now   the

President)  under the Ordinance to the Minister.  The

amendments provided for this, under clauses 2  and  3

of  the  Bill, will bring the Ordinance in line  with

the  Port of Singapore Authority Ordinance, 1963, the

Housing  and  Development Ordinance,  1959,  and  the

Telephone  Board  Ordinance (Cap. 107),  wherein  the

appointments to the Board thereunder are made by  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of the Public Utilities Board's

functions and activities and the tremendous  increase

in  the  work  which  members of the  Board  have  to

undertake,  it  has become necessary  to  expand  the

membership of the Board. It is, therefore,  proposed,

under  clause 2 of the Bill, to increase  the  member

ship of the Board from nine to 12. Consequent on this

increase, the quorum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



at  meetings of the Board will also be increased from

five to seven, which is in clause 4 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made under clause 5 of the Bill for the

Public  Utilities Board to collect fees for  services

rendered  by the Government or any of its departments

or  any  statutory  body.  The  amendment  will  also

empower the Board to grant or guarantee loans to  its

employees to enable them to purchase houses for their

use  or  for any other purposes specifically approved

by   the  Board  as  being  likely  to  increase  the

efficiency of the employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new subsection (1) introduced by clause 6 of the

Bill gives the Board power to appoint committees from

among its members. The new subsection (2) under  this

clause  will  enable  the Board to  delegate  to  its

committees  certain  of  its  powers,  functions  and

duties.  At  present  the Board  is  empowered  under

section  22  (1)  of the Ordinance to  delegate  such

powers, functions and duties only to its employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enlargement of the membership of the Board, and

the  power  to  appoint committees to  which  certain

powers,  functions and duties can be  delegated  will

not  only  relieve the Board of some of  its  onerous

duties but will also enable the Board to conduct  its

affairs more expeditiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  it  is  obvious that there is a necessity  for

enlarging  the  composition of the  Board.  From  the

reports of the Board, the electricity generation  has

doubled  from the time the Board took over,  and  the

consumption  of water and gas has increased  by  more

than 50 per cent. However, I do not consider that  by

increasing  the membership of the Board  it  will  be

able  to cope with such expansion. The United Kingdom

Central  Electricity Generation Board,  for  example,

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



more  full-time  members than  the  Public  Utilities

Board  has.  If we can align the composition  of  the

Public  Utilities  Board  with  that  of  the  United

Kingdom Central Electricity Generation Board,  it  is

likely  that  the  efficiency of  the  Board  can  be

further improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that with the resignation of the

previous  Deputy Chairman of the Board, the  loss  of

whose  services we have greatly felt, there  are,  at

present, no technical personnel sitting on the  Board

whose   functions  are  mainly  concerned  with   the

installation and supply of public utilities  such  as

power,  water  and  gas. Can  the  Minister  give  an

assurance that at least some technical personnel will

be appointed on the Board so that they may be able to

give  competent  advice? Sir, I am not  doubting  the

ability of the present members of the Board. But I am

sure  that  with technical men sitting on the  Board,

they will be of great assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have gone through the reports of the Public

Utilities  Board since its inception in 1963,  and  1

have  found  that  it has gone to  great  lengths  to

publicise  the  activities and  achievements  of  the

Board.  If  I am not mistaken, sometime  in  1964  or

1965,  the  Board appointed some American consultants

to  look into the administration and organisation  of

the  Board.  But  since 1963, and up  to  the  latest

report  which we have, that is 1966, no  mention  has

been made about this whatsoever.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, I find it difficult to see how

the  line of argument you are now pursuing arises out

of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Sir, I just want to show why an

expansion of the membership of the Board is necessary



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please proceed, Mr Low



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Under the provisions of the new

clause  in  the  amendment Bill, there  should  be  a

standing committee comprising Board members  to  look

into  the question of administration or organisation,

because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



there  is an apparent drop in the efficiency  of  the

staff  of  the  Board. I will quote one example.  Not

long  ago, a member of the public paid a deposit  for

the  supply  of gas. But after repeat, ed  inquiries,

nothing happened. It was only when I rang up that the

whole  matter  was  solved in two days  and  the  gas

supply was turned on. This shows that there is a drop

in  the general efficiency of the Board. I think  the

setting  up of a standing committee to look into  the

organisation  and daily functions  of  the  Board  is

urgent. That is why I have said that there may  be  a

necessity  for more full-time members to sit  on  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also feel that a standing committee should be

set up to look into the de-salinisation of water with

the  co-operation  of  the Ministry  of  Science  and

Technology.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Low, I am afraid I have to

rule that you are in breach of the Standing Orders as

the  subjects you have raised are not relevant to the

provisions  of the Bill. If you have any comments  on

the  increase  in  the  size of  the  Board,  or  the

additional  powers  of the Board,  or  the  power  to

appoint sub-committees under clause 6, please address

your remarks to those points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

stress  the necessity for standing committees because

of the increase in the Board membership. In any case,

I accept your ruling. I have concluded my speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Bill seeks to increase the

membership  of the Board from nine to 12. The  Member

for  Crawford  wants to go further.  I  do  not  know

whether he is right, but I would appeal to him to let

this go for some time, and if we find that 12 are not

sufficient,  we  will come back  here  and  get  more

members  on  the Board. But a dozen is  quite  a  big

number  and any Board beyond that number might become

too big and unwieldy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is correct when he says that with the

retirement  of  the previous Deputy Chairman  of  the

Board, there are hardly any others left with engineer

ing experience. But new members of the Board will  be

appointed soon and I assure the Member that at  least

one  will  be  an  engineer  who  will  be  of  great

assistance in the Board. Of course, I must remind the

Member   that  there  are  engineers  in  the  Public

Utilities Board and, if not in the Board, at least in

the Electricity Department or the Water Department or

the Gas Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for standing committees, there are standing

committees  but  they  have no blessing  of  the  law

behind  them. Hence this Bill, one of the clauses  of

which  empowers the Board to delegate its powers  and

duties to smaller subcommittees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for some of the other points raised by the

Member,  I  will  not  reply to him  since  you,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, have ruled him out of order. But I  can

make  one  suggestion. Perhaps on some other occasion

if  he  will file questions in Parliament on previous

commissions  and what the Public Utilities  Board  is

doing  about de-salinisation, I will do  my  best  to

answer him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><h4>RECORDS AND GOVERNMENT BROADCASTING) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law enforced in Singapore relating to copyright

is the Copyright Act, 1911, of the United Kingdom, as

modified  by  the Copyright Ordinance (Chapter  176).

The   Copyright  Act,  1911,  was  repealed  by   the

Copyright Act, 1956, of the United Kingdom.  However,

the  repeal did not apply to Singapore and  the  1956

Act was never extended to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not the intention of this Bill to make

comprehensive changes to the present law as was  done

by  the 1956 Act of the United Kingdom. The Bill,  as

Members  will  note, is quite limited  in  scope  and

deals  with  two immediate problems - to prevent  the

piracy  of  gramophone  records  and  to  exempt  the

Government from infringement of copyright in respect

of radio and television broadcasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first problem, there has been over

the   past  year  or  so  a  large  increase  in  the

importation  and sale of pirated records  of  musical

works with subsisting copyright. Many of such pirated

records are of sound recordings made in Singapore and

the  royalties  which are due to local  artistes  and

composers  and the employment of local musicians  are

somewhat in jeopardy.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly established industries -there are three of

them  - for the manufacture of phonograph records  in

Singapore are also seriously threatened.  For  these

reasons,  penalties for the infringement of copyright

in  gramophone  records are urgently required.  Thus

clause  3  of the Bill provides that any  person  who

makes,  reproduces,  imports  for  sale,  exposes  or

offers for sale or has in his possession for sale any

pirated  copies  of any gramophone record,  shall  be

guilty   of  an  offence  and  shall  be  liable   on

conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000, and in the

case  of  a  second  or  a subsequent  conviction  to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year  or  a

fine not exceeding $2,000 or to both such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



imprisonment or fine. However, it shall be a  defence

if  such  person  proves that he  had  no  reason  to

suspect  that he was dealing with pirated  copies  of

gramophone records, that he had given all information

in  his  power  to the police or the prosecutor,  and

that  he had acted innocently in the matter. A police

officer  is also empowered to arrest without  warrant

any  person who sells or exposes for sale any pirated

copies  of  any gramophone record in a public  place.

Any  person  who has in his possession five  or  more

pirated  copies  of any gramophone  record  shall  be

deemed to be in possession of such copies for sale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made under clause 4 of the Bill to

empower  a  Magistrate  to  grant  a  search  warrant

authorising any police officer to enter the  premises

named  therein to search for and seize any copies  of

any  gramophone  record which appear  to  be  pirated

copies.  All copies of a gramophone record so  seized

shall  be  brought before a court and,  if  they  are

proved  to  be pirated copies, shall be delivered  to

the  owner of the copyright of such record  or  dealt

with as the court thinks fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the prosecution of such offences,

clause 5 of the Bill provides that an affidavit  made

before  a notary public by or on behalf of the  owner

of  the  copyright in any gramophone  record  may  be

admitted  in  evidence  and  shall  be  prima   facie

evidence of the matters stated therein.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second problem, the Broadcasting

Department  of the Ministry of Culture is  paying  to

account  a  fixed  sum each year  to  the  Performing

Rights  Society, London, for the performing right  in

sound  recordings broadcast over Radio and Television

Singapura.  Claims  for  royalties  have  also   been

received  by  the  Broadcasting Department  from  the

International Federation of Phonographic Industry and

the  Mechanical Copyright Protection Society.  It  is

estimated that if all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



these   claims  have  to  be  met,  the  Broadcasting

Department  will have to pay quite a substantial  sum

each  year  in respect of its use of sound recordings

made  abroad. In addition, expenditure will also have

to be incurred by the Broadcasting Department to keep

a record or records of the number of times each sound

recording is broadcast for the purpose of determining

the  royalties  payable  to these  organisations.  As

Radio  and  Television Singapura provide an essential

service, it is in the interest of the public that the

cost  of  this  service be kept as low  as  possible.

Hence  the  Bill  provides that the  copyright  in  a

musical work or gramophone record is not infringed by

the  Government  when it causes the musical  work  or

gramophone record to be heard in public by means of a

radio  or television broadcast. Clause 6 of the  Bill

further provides that the copyright in a musical work

is  not  infringed by the Government when it makes  a

record, tape or other device in respect of that  work

solely  for  the purpose of being used  in  radio  or

television broadcast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  raising my query not  to  seek  a  legal

opinion  from  the Minister but to seek clarification

in  respect  of  clause 6 (2) of the Bill.  The  Bill

contains   provisions   which   empower   Radio   and

Television  Singapura to make records  or  tape  from

gramophone  records and telecast  and  broadcast  the

taped  records. Am I right in assuming that  one  can

make a record or tape the broadcast which has already

been  taped by Radio and Television Singapura without

infringing  the  provisions  of  the  Bill?   If   my

interpretation  is correct, will the  Bill  not  open

itself to abuse by pirates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> May I know if it is the usual

custom  for other countries to have a clause  similar

to clause 6 of the Bill?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I would

welcome  this  Bill,  clause 6  is  a  bit  difficult

because  it tends to expropriate property rights.  In

order  to justify this clause, I would like  to  know

how  much  Government proposes to save by validating

its action in recording these materials.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If I may deal with the Member for Telok

Blangah  first.  If  anyone  tapes  from  Radio   and

Television Singapura and uses it outside, it will  be

piracy.  If the Member for Telok Blangah has  a  tape

recorder  at  home,  tapes  and  records  from   T.V.

Singapura and uses it in public, he will be liable to

the penalties provided for under this Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat wants to know whether

there  is  similar  legislation to that  provided  in

clause 6 elsewhere. The answer is - if there is, I am

not aware of such legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang talks of expropriation

and  he wants to know what is the amount involved.  I

am afraid I cannot give him the details. I am not the

Minister for Culture. Unfortunately, he is not  here.

But  I am sure he will be happy to provide the Member

with  figures. But I would like to assure the  Member

that  we  have  no  intention  of  making  this  Bill

retrospective.  What  is  past  is  past.  This  Bill

provides for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.41 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 6 stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, I crave your

indulgence  in taking this opportunity to answer  the

query  raised  by the Member for Bukit  Panjang.  The

Broadcasting Department has been paying royalty  fees

to  some  international bodies.  In  fact,  they  are

United  Kingdom  based  organisations.  One  is   the

Performing Rights Society, London. We pay the Society

a fixed sum of about $25,000 a year. The other is the

International Federation of Phonographic Industry, to

which  a  sum  of  $15,000 is paid. In  the  past,  a

directive came from the then Governor that  we  would

have  to pay royalties, and we did pay. There was  no

reason  given why we should pay. But in the  colonial

days the directive came from the Governor, and it was

complied with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Performing Rights Society, London, claims to

represent  international  authors  and  composers  in

respect  of royalties to be paid. This body  and  the

International  Federation  of  Phonographic  Industry

have  claimed in recent years an increase in the  sum

payable  to them on the grounds that we have extended

the  hours  of radio broadcasts and that recently  we

have  introduced television. We have considered  this

problem.  Let  me  put it this way.  Broadcasting  in

Singapore is a Government institution. The motivation

is, therefore, not profit. Whatever entertainment and

information we provide through this medium is a  kind

of  education  for  our people. It  is  unlike  other

commercial stations in the world, if it were, I would

have  supported  the  payment of royalties.  Although

Radio   and   Television   Singapura   is   partially

commercialised, as I said earlier, the  entertainment

and other programmes provided through this medium are

not  profit  motivated. As such, we feel that  it  is

imperative   that  we  should  keep   the   cost   of

broadcasting  as low as possible for the  benefit  of

the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> May I have your indulgence, Sir? Members

may be interested to know, whilst we are on clause 6,

that though Singapore has attended many international

conferences



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



on  protection of copyrights, designs and patents, we

are  not  a signatory to any international convention

on  copyrights. We have not signed because it is  the

developed  countries  that  have  the  know-how   and

knowledge  of these matters. They have  in  the  past

refused  or  have  been  rather  reluctant  to   help

developing countries increase their knowledge of this

subject.   This   Act  provides  for  protection   of

copyrights   and,  in  fact,  it   is   welcomed   by

international  bodies  like  the  Performing   Rights

Society  of  London, it provides  them  considerable

protection   from   piracy.  The  amounts   paid   by

Government,   as   mentioned  by  the   Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture, are small when

compared  to  the  extent of protection  afforded  to

copyright  owners.  I think I had better  state  here

openly  that  we  have received representations  from

these societies. They welcome the Bill, but they have

asked us to reconsider the provisions of clause 6. We

have considered their representations and decided  to

proceed with clause 6.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> May I crave your indulgence, Mr

Speaker,  Sir? The consequence of what  the  Minister

said  just  now  is  that  we  should  not  sign  the

International Convention on Copyrights  and  Patents.

If  we  do, then, of course, we might have  to  amend

clause 6, which might otherwise become illegal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we have

clause 6, I am afraid one day the result will be such

that  even the poorest type of films or musical shows

of any kind will not be obtainable for Radio and T.V.

Singapura.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I am not quite clear about

what  the  Member for Joo Chiat has said. Perhaps  he

might care to repeat it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, I am thinking in terms of

musical films of any kind for T.V.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> That is quite simple, Sir. When

we hire the films, we pay for the hiring of the films

and we are not liable. It is the film distributors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



who  will be liable. I am sure they have already made

arrangements with the international body concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I would like to assure the Member

for  Bukit Panjang that we are not a member of  inter

national  conventions  and we have  no  intention  of

becoming  a  signatory  to  these  conventions.   The

reason,  I repeat, is that these conventions are  for

the benefit of the developed countries who refuse  to

share  their knowledge with us. It is for this reason

that  a Bill of this nature was not passed before.  I

have mentioned that three industries have been set up

in Jurong producing musical records and it is for the

protection  of  these industries that  this  Bill  is

introduced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat is a little worried about

not  getting  films.  I think  the  answer  is  quite

simple.  Unless  we  pay  for  our  films,  the  film

distributors will not let us have them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time

and passed.
