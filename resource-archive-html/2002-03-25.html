<div align="center"><b>ELECTION OF SPEAKER</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Tribute)</b></div>

<br>3.57 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on behalf of all Members of this House, it is my honour

and  privilege  to  congratulate  you  on  your  election  as

Speaker.  With your extensive experience as a Member of  this

House  since  1984, and as a Deputy Speaker for 4  1/2  years

from  January 1989 to June 1993 and as a Minister thereafter,

Members   have   no  doubt  that  Parliamentary   proceedings

conducted  in  this  Chamber, with you  in  the  Chair,  will

continue  to  be  in accordance with the best  traditions  of

fairness, decorum and propriety.  All of us, Members of  this

House,  pledge to support you and cooperate with you  in  the

discharge of your heavy responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the Ministers and the Members, past

and  present  during his tenure as Speaker, I would  like  to

take  this  opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Tan  Soo  Khoon,

your  distinguished  predecessor.  [Applause.]   Mr  Tan  had

served as Deputy Speaker for nearly 4 years, from March 1985,

before  he was elected Speaker in the Seventh Parliament,  in

January 1989.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my congratulatory speech at that time, I said that

Members had every confidence that Mr Tan would discharge  his

responsibilities with great distinction.  He indeed lived  up

to  our expectations and we were delighted to re-elect him as

Speaker for two more terms in the 8th and 9th Parliaments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, on his election as Speaker, Mr Tan had said

that  "he hoped to maintain the high standards and traditions

set by his predecessor (Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng)..

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>

I found myself at times trying to unravel myself from some of

the  complexities  of the rules of procedure."   Mr  Tan  has

amply fulfilled his pledge.  He indeed upheld the dignity  of

this House by ensuring that order and decorum were  observed.

Although  not  legally trained, I believe he has  managed  to

"unravel  himself from some of the complexities of the  rules

of procedure".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his charge as Speaker, our parliamentary debates

and  all other business of Parliament, including those of the

Select  Committees and the Committee of Privileges, proceeded

most  smoothly, efficiently and effectively.  As  some  would

put   it,  it  is  "like  clock-work".   He  has  guided  the

proceedings in this Chamber most fairly, always giving  every

opportunity for Members to speak.  Despite some long rambling

speeches made from time to time, Mr Tan was always patient in

hearing them out.  He was also indulgent on some Members  who

pressed   on  with  repetitive  questions  even  though   the

questions were already answered.  He only interrupted when he

thought that enough was enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key achievements during Mr Tan Soo Khoon's

tenure  as  Speaker  is the building of this  new  Parliament

House  which was officially opened on 4th October  1999.   He

chaired  the Parliament Building Committee, formed  in  1993,

which planned and built this New Parliament House.   He  made

many study visits to other parliaments and learned from them.

As  a  result,  this  House  has incorporated  many  upgraded

features  which  will serve Parliamentarians  well  into  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his Speakership, Mr Tan also strengthened

relations   with  and  enhanced  our  status   among   ASEAN,

Commonwealth  and  other  Parliaments,  through  the  various

parliamentary delegations he led and conferences he attended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring Parliament closer to the people, Mr Tan

initiated  the  Parliament Internet  Homepage  in  May  1996.

Internet-savvy readers, local and overseas, can now know more

about  our  Parliament.   In 1998, Mr  Tan  also  set  up  an

Education Department to educate Singaporeans about the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>

Parliament.   Thousands of Singaporeans, including  students,

have  learned  more  about Parliament as a  result  of  their

educational visits to this Parliament complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us here deeply appreciate Mr Tan Soo Khoon's

distinguished  service and achievements in  this  House.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, Mr Tan once lamented that someone had asked him

why,  as the Speaker, he could not speak.  Now that he is  no

longer  in the Chair, there would be no such constraint.   We

certainly  look  forward to his active participation  in  the

debates of this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Parliament now has 84 elected Members and one

new  Non-Constituency Member.  Among the 84 elected  Members,

25  of them are new PAP Members of Parliament.  May I welcome

all  of  them warmly.  My advice to all the new MPs  is  that

they  should  make the best use of their time in  Parliament,

speak their minds freely on issues which are important and of

concern to Singapore and our people.  Let conscience be their

guide  and contribute actively to the debates in this  House.

We  certainly  look  forward to their participation  in  this

Chamber.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join the Leader of

the  House  in extending to you our congratulations  on  this

occasion of your election as Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you and I were amongst the then new Members elected

to  Parliament in the 1984 General Elections.  There are  not

too many of us left.  Soon thereafter, you were inducted into

Cabinet  and, since then, you have played a pivotal  role  in

policy  making as well as providing leadership to our nation.

As we get to know you better, we have developed a high regard

for  your  character and integrity.  Your  contributions  all

these  years  as  Minister  have earned  our  respect.   Your

election  to this high office today signifies our  confidence

in  you.  And for those of us who are involved in sports,  we

are aware that you were a rugby player during your school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



years.  You have developed a reputation as someone with broad

shoulders, who is dependable and reliable, someone who  knows

when  to block, when to pass and when to run.  You have  also

developed  a  strong sense of team work and fair play,  which

you  have  retained to this day.  I am sure  you  will  bring

these  same  attributes to your new capacity as  Speaker.   I

would  like  to  affirm that we will all give  you  our  full

support and cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, may I take some time at this

juncture  to  pay  tribute to your predecessor,  Mr  Tan  Soo

Khoon,  who  had presided over the proceedings in this  House

for  the past 13 years.  When I first entered Parliament,  Mr

Tan  had  already earned a reputation for wit and clarity  in

giving  speeches, a reputation well earned as we listened  to

his  speeches  as  new MPs.  His election  to  the  Chair  in

January 1989 was a loss to the subsequent batches of Members,

as  they had one less master to learn from.  Nonetheless, for

those  of  us who travelled with him on official  visits,  we

could  attest that he is a speech maker par excellence.   His

discourse  always puts Singapore in good light  in  front  of

Parliamentarians from all over the world.  It  is  also  well

known  that Mr Tan has a great singing voice when he let  his

hair, or whatever is left of it, down.  In fact, at this very

moment, the tune of Blue Suede Shoes is ringing right  in  my

ears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Speaker, Mr Tan had presided over the proceedings

during  his  tenure  exceedingly  well.   His  grasp  of  the

Standing  Orders  is  complete  and  thorough.   Members  who

stepped  out  of  line  would  invariably  feel  his   wrath.

Furthermore,  his  handling of Mr J B  Jeyaretnam,  the  Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, who adopted a  belligerent

stance  in this House, earned our great admiration.  When  it

came to Members trying to catch his eye, Mr Tan had been most

fair,  giving  equal opportunity to everyone,  new  and  old.

This  is  very important to us Backbenchers as  a  point,  no

matter  how substantial, made a second time, would have  lost

its  impact.  We had all, at one time or another, experienced

the  sharp edge of the knife when he applied the "guillotine"

when we rambled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



on  past our allotted time.  However, one could not complain,

as   Mr  Tan  applied  the  knife  even-handedly,  be  it   a

Backbencher or an office holder.  All in all, I think I  have

the  support of this House when I say, "Mr Tan, we will  miss

you in the Chair."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be amiss for me if I do not touch on Mr Tan's

crowning achievement, and it is the construction of this  new

Parliament  Complex.   The Leader of the  House  has  already

touched  on this.  New Members should bear in mind when  they

enjoy  the  convenience and the comfort of this new  complex.

As  I  recall,  when  the new Parliament Building  was  first

contemplated by the Government, it was indeed a  very  modest

concept.  It was Mr Tan who planted the seed that we not only

should  have one that embodies the principles of freedom  and

democracy that Singaporeans hold dear but one that is  worthy

of  the  achievements  of   Singapore  as  a  modern  nation.

Therefore,  we were all pleasantly surprised that this  piece

of  prime  land  was  allocated to Parliament  for  this  new

complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that we had the best building possible, Mr Tan

led  several study trips to overseas parliament buildings  to

learn  about  their  features as well as their  shortcomings.

During  the  construction of the building, Mr  Tan  was  also

instrumental  in  setting  the requirements  upon  which  the

architect  would flesh out the design.  He was also  tireless

in  chairing  the many meetings of the building committee  to

ensure  that future generations of Singaporeans have a  great

building  that we could be proud of.  Even though it  is  the

Government  that  built  this  complex,  we  are  nonetheless

indebted to Mr Tan for the role he played.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would take some time to get used to the fact that Mr

Tan  is  no longer in the Chair, Sir.  Looking at the  bright

side, he is now back on the Backbench and we look forward  to

hearing from him once again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this

opportunity  to  extend my congratulations  to  the  two  new

Deputy Speakers, Mr Chew Heng Ching and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You cannot say that, as they have not

been elected.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I understand that they have not been

elected yet.  They are two very able Members who have  earned

our admiration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as reported in the papers, the Leader of the House

is  prepared  to lift the  Whip more often in  future.   With

this  change, we would expect that the debate in  this  House

will become more vigorous and robust.  We all look forward to

lively sessions of the 10th Parliament with you in the Chair.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

put  on  record  that over the years, Mr Tan  Soo  Khoon,  as

Speaker of the House, has won my respect for being fair  most

of  the  time,  if not all the time.  I have served  in  some

Parliamentary   Committees  and  also  a   Member   of   some

delegations to overseas visits, in which Mr Tan Soo Khoon was

the  leader.   Being  a  non-PAP  Member,  I  have  not  felt

discriminated, and I think this is important as  he  was  the

Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not the least, I did sometimes flout the

parliamentary  proceedings rules and,  of  course,  I  got  a

public  lecture from Mr Tan Soo Khoon.  I think sometimes  he

got  pek  chet with me  -  he was irritated  -  but I realise

that  he  did not take these things personally unto  himself.

For  that,  I wish to congratulate him for being professional

in his conduct as the Speaker of Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first

of  all, let me take the opportunity to congratulate  you  on

your  appointment  as the seventh Speaker  of  the  Singapore

Parliament.   I have known you for the past 18  years,  since

1984,  when  I served as a grassroots leader in  Siglap,  the

constituency  where  you first got elected  as  a  Member  of

Parliament.  In fact, it is you who inducted me into politics

and subsequently convinced me to stand for election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known you to be a fair person willing to

listen to all views.  Your track



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



record  as  an  MP  and Minister for the  past  18  years  is

testimony of your ability and of what you can achieve, and  I

am  confident that you will once again excel in your new role

as Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we are seeing a changeover of a very key

position  and  that  is of the Speaker of Parliament.   Since

1989,  for a span of  13 years, our outgoing Speaker, Mr  Tan

Soo  Khoon, had been at the helm and, today, the hon. Mr  Tan

is  handing over the baton, or should I say the Mace, to you.

I  have  known Mr Tan since 1991 when Siglap became  part  of

Bedok GRC.  Having interacted with his grassroots leaders,  I

have heard many good things about Mr Tan.  His grassroots and

community leaders hold him in very high regard, and they have

always  spoken  of  him  as a very friendly,  people-oriented

person.   The residents have also considered him a friend  to

everyone in the constituency he was elected in.  And since  I

got  elected  into Parliament in 1997, I got to know  Mr  Tan

personally and know him much better, having the privilege  of

interacting  with  him in the House and  outside  the  House,

especially   when   we   went  for  a  number   of   overseas

parliamentary  trips.  Although we, Members  of  this  House,

seldom  had  the chance to listen to him because the  Speaker

seldom has the chance to speak,  the few times when he spoke,

he did so with very clear and thought-provoking words and, at

appropriate times, adding a tinge of humour and wit  to  keep

everyone in good spirits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always wondered whether the Speaker really

listened  to our speeches, especially to some of us who  have

the tendency of making long speeches.  I am sure he must have

heard  the same arguments repeated many times over  the  many

years.   While I confirm that he was indeed listening to  the

speeches that we made when I read the Sunday Times' interview

two  Sundays ago, in the interview, Mr Tan analysed a  number

of  MPs' speeches and the style of arguments, and I must  say

that  he  was  right.  Now we know that he was listening  all

along and not sleeping with his eyes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



open.   But,  seriously,  many times after  each  sitting  of

Parliament,  Mr  Tan made it a point to  stay  back  and  sit

around  the  table  in the Members' Room  with  a  number  of

Members  each time to discuss issues.  During those sessions,

Mr  Tan  used to discuss the contents of debates and speeches

with  the  Members present and always giving his  views  and,

more  importantly, giving pointers to Members, especially  to

new  Members, on how we should handle debates and discussions

in  the  House.  His many years of listening to and analysing

many  arguments have always been a great source of  knowledge

which I found useful for my future speeches.

Talking about pointers, one of the more significant things  I

remember  and  cherish of Mr Tan's role  as  Speaker  is  his

reaching  out to the new Members of Parliament.  As a  first-time  MP  during  the  last term, I  really  appreciated  his

friendly approach with the new Members, helping us to quickly

learn  the ropes of being a Member of Parliament, both inside

and  outside  the  House.   He readily  helped,  coached  and

mentored  many  of us so that we could in a short  period  of

time  start  making  contributions towards the  parliamentary

process.  With his proactive approach of connecting with  the

new MPs, it made all of us feel very much at home and allowed

us  to  quickly become more effective in doing  our  jobs  as

Members  of  Parliament.  Especially for us Backbenchers,  we

also  picked up skills on how to handle a debate and  how  to

make  Question Time more effective in getting the answers  we

were looking for from the Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that I also cherish about Mr Tan, as Speaker,

is  how lively he is outside the House, especially when we go

for  overseas  trips.   One can understand  the  need  to  be

lively,  especially after many hours of sitting and listening

to  speeches.  I can safely say that Mr Tan is the  liveliest

of  all the Speakers in the ASEAN Parliaments, and I am  sure

this  is  also the opinion of all the ASEAN MPs who  attended

our  yearly  AIPO Conference.  As Dr Wang mentioned  earlier,

entertaining everyone with his songs of the 1960s and 70s, we

always enjoyed the functions held



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



after  each  of  his  conferences.  You  have  to  know  your

rock-and-roll when you are with Mr Tan on one of  his  trips.

If  not, then you have to dance, maybe a Bhangra dance, which

I  had to do in one of those trips with him.  Perhaps singing

was  the  way  Mr  Tan let off his stress  accumulated  after

listening to many speeches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am sure that we are all looking forward

to  the  former  Speaker finally speaking  up  in  Parliament

during this current term.  Now is your chance, Mr Tan, to get

back  at some of us for the long speeches that we made  while

you  were  in the Chair.  You have earned the right  to  make

long speeches this time round, although I hope you do not.  I

personally look forward to seeing you in action to contribute

towards  the making of a lively Parliament during this  term.

Now, whenever you have itch to speak, you do not have to hold

back, as you did when you were sitting on the Chair.  Mr  Tan

should know all the tricks of how to catch the Speaker's eye,

and  I  am  sure he is going to get quite a lot of  attention

from the new Speaker of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all the former and current Members of this

House, I would like to thank Mr Tan for all that he has  done

for  the  Singapore Parliament and for Singapore.  I am  sure

all  Members  will join me in wishing him all  the  best  and

success in whatever he chooses to do in the future.  Mr  Tan,

a  big  thank  you  for your excellent contributions  to  the

country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I would like to

join  the  Leader  of  the House and the  other  speakers  in

congratulating  you on your election as the Speaker  of  this

august  House.  You have been a sportsman, and we  have  also

read  and known you as the Minister for Sports, and I am sure

the  Opposition will be very confident that you  shall  be  a

very  fair  person  in dealing with the proceedings  in  this

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have read in the papers that your advice to

Members is to be "short and sweet" in their speeches,  and  I

can assure you that the Opposition shall do that, no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



more  six-hour speeches as in the past.  So far, anyway,  the

Opposition has always made their speeches short and sweet.  I

know  you shall be a very efficient and fair Speaker  and  we

shall look forward to more fair debates in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also take this opportunity to thank Mr Tan Soo Khoon

for his job as Speaker.  I had complained once or twice to Mr

Tan Soo Khoon that I failed to catch his eye when I put up my

hand.   But  I  think  he  was too  busy  looking  elsewhere.

Nevertheless,  I  have  known Mr Tan very  well  through  our

official visits to the ASEAN areas, in AIPO conferences, and,

as  other speakers have said, before we go to these meetings,

we  have to brush up on our singing, because this is  one  of

the  things that he loves to do.  I was once caught  unawares

when he was announcing the Singapore delegates' programme  in

one of the ASEAN conferences - I believe it was in Bali - and

he  suddenly  called  my  name to represent  Singapore  in  a

singing event.  Can you imagine, I have to stand up and  sing

in  front  of  an  international crowd  without  preparation?

Well,  this is Mr Tan.  But, anyway, we have lots of fun  and

we come to know each other very well.  And I must say that he

is  not  only respected in this House but he is respected  in

the  region  as  well.  Everywhere he went,  I  noticed  that

Members  of the other Parliaments in the region all respected

him.  I have got to thank Mr Tan for a job well done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> May I join the other

Members in congratulating you on your election as Speaker  of

the  House.  Sir, I have known you for a long time and  I  am

confident that you will carry out the duties of Speaker  with

distinction and bring honour to the Chair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been the Speaker for the past 13 years and

it has been a privilege and an honour to serve.  Sir, this is

your  election, the moment is rightly yours.  And although  I

have  expected  some words of thanks, I did not  foresee  the

kind of tributes that Members have paid to me a while ago and

I  am  indeed very humbled by what they have said.   I  think

that I would not have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



been  able to carry out my duties as Speaker for the past  13

years  the way I had done if I had not enjoyed the confidence

and  their trust.  It is the Members of this House  who  have

made  my  job  easy  by  upholding the finest  traditions  of

Parliamentary   practices,  by  upholding  decorum   and   by

respecting  the rules of the House and the authority  of  the

Chair.  For that, I am really grateful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am the first Speaker in our Parliament to return

to  the  Backbench, but this is not new in other Parliaments.

And  I hope that in the years ahead, I will be able to humbly

demonstrate  that  there is life after  Speakership  in  this

House.   I would therefore like to assure the Leader  of  the

House,  and most certainly the Frontbench, that I, with  your

kind permission, Sir, will be around to make more than a  few

speeches and certainly to ask more than a few questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may just take a few more moments

to  say something about the Speakership, particularly for the

benefit  of  the newer Members of the House.  The Speakership

is  unique  in every country.  It is found in all Parliaments

in  the Commonwealth that have adopted the Westminster system

of parliamentary democracy.  The Speakership is as old as the

history of Parliament.  In England where it all started,  the

first designated Speaker was in the year 1377, although  long

before that there were others who held the position but  they

went by other titles.  The Speaker in those early days had  a

different   role  to  play.   He  was  not  the  arbiter   of

proceedings as we know him to be now.  The Speaker  in  those

days,  his  primary  duty, was to  convey  to  the  King  the

resolutions  of the commons.  And you can well  imagine  that

during  those times, when the ruler was the absolute  monarch

of  the land, he was usually not too pleased to receive  news

from  the  Speaker, especially when what the Speaker  had  to

convey  impinged on the rights and privileges  of  the  King,

particularly  his royal purse.  Quite often, the  King  would

know  how  to  show his displeasure, and it was  recorded  in

history that his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



displeasure was often manifested through a very simple act  - the  beheading of the Speaker.  And between the 15th and 16th

century,  as many as up to 10 Speakers lost their poor  heads

because  they delivered news that the ruler did not  want  to

hear.   The  situation got so bad that in the year 1510,  two

Speakers lost their heads on the same day!  Hence, today,  in

the  English Parliament, we have this faint reluctance on the

part  of  the aspirant to the post of Speaker.  Because  they

are afraid of what will happen to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, today, times have changed. We do not have

kings  and  queens,  not  in  the  other  countries  of   the

Commonwealth,  but in their place we have a government,  duly

elected  by  the  people.  The role of the Speaker  has  also

changed.   He is now the one who conducts the proceedings  of

the  House  and he ensures its orderly conduct.  The  Speaker

has  also  become known as the guardian and the protector  of

the privileges of the Members of the House.  In this respect,

Sir,  I  would like to recall again another event in  English

history   which  has  a  bearing  on  how  Speakers   conduct

themselves everywhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this took place in the year 1642. The King of the

day was Charles I.  The Speaker of the English Parliament was

a  gentleman by the name of William Lenthall.  Charles I  had

more  than  his fair share of bad days with Parliament.   And

the  occasion  came  when he decided to  teach  Parliament  a

lesson.   He  wanted  to  arrest himself  five  parliamentary

leaders.   So  he marched to Parliament and he  demanded  the

identification  of  the  five members  that  he  wanted.   Of

course, in those days, they had no photographs.  So he  asked

everyone, and he was met with stony silence.  Then turning to

William  Lenthall, he asked the Speaker to identify the  five

Members.  And this was Lenthall's reply:  "May it please Your

Majesty,  I have neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak  in

this  place, except as the House, whose servant I am  directs

of  me, and I beg Your Majesty's pardon that I have no  other

answer  to  give except this to what Your Majesty demands  of

me".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those few well chosen but historic words,

William Lenthall expressed unequivocally where his first duty

and  obligation  as Speaker lay.  He told  everyone,  and  he

established  the principle, that his allegiance  was  to  the

cause  of  parliamentary  liberty.   And  with  parliamentary

liberty lies the privilege for all of us in the House to make

our  speeches, to express freely our views and our  opinions,

subject  to  the  rules of the Standing  Orders  and  to  the

unwritten   rules  that  govern  our  conduct  as  honourable

gentlemen  and honourable ladies.  And that, Sir, is  what  I

hope to see in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, William Lenthall's words have become a kind of

creed for Speakers of the Commonwealth.  These are words that

we  recall  whenever Speakers meet.  I hope,  Sir,  that  the

principle which he has established will also guide you in the

conduct of the proceedings here.  During the course of  time,

as  I  have experienced, you will no doubt get many  requests

from  Members.  You will also get advice from both  sides  of

the  House, some are well-intended; some perhaps with  agenda

of their own.  But I am hopeful, Sir, knowing you so well, as

you  were my Deputy for some years, that you will be able  to

be fair in your judgement and be very balanced in the way you

conduct the proceedings of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that, if you do so, you too will earn the

respect  of  all of us here and of Singaporeans  in  general.

And  I  am hopeful that when the time comes when you have  to

leave the Chair, you too will be able to leave with your head

held  up  high  and, of course, still firmly  fixed  on  your

shoulders.  Much obliged, Sir.  [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members, I would first like to

thank  the Leader of the House and Dr Wang, Mr Low, Mr  Chiam

and   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  for  their  very  kind  words  and

congratulatory messages.  I also like to thank Mr Tan for his

discourse  on the history of the Speakership and I am  indeed

glad that times have changed because I do intend to retain my

head on my shoulders!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members, I wish to thank you for electing me

to this high office.  This is my 18th year as a Member of the

House,  and  in those years I have been privileged  to  serve

first as a member of the Backbench, then on to the Frontbench

and  now,  with this election, on to the Chair of the  House.

Honourable Members have indeed done me a great honour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall do my utmost to fulfil the trust and confidence

that  Members have put in me to preside over the  proceedings

of  this  House and to preserve the dignity and role of  this

august  institution.  I shall be impartial as Members  expect

me to be.  In these, I have the fortune of having learnt from

previous  Honourable Speakers, particularly from  Mr  Speaker

Tan  Soo  Khoon, when I was one of his Deputies from 1989  to

1993.  He had served with distinction indeed.  And this House

owes  him  a  great debt of gratitude for his leadership  and

guidance when he was in the Chair for the past 13 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to warmly welcome the new Members of this

House.   With 26 new Members representing a wide  variety  of

professions,  experiences and interests and  coupled  with  a

greater  willingness to articulate differing  views,  we  can

expect  a livelier and more vibrant Parliament from  now  on.

As  new Members, I would urge you to acquaint yourselves with

the  rules  of  debate  and conduct  in  this  House.   Speak

honestly,  speak  sincerely and without  fear  and  let  your

conscience be your guide.  But be as concise as you  can  and

try  hard  to avoid repetition.  Long and rambling  speeches,

especially  when short on substance, tend to  receive  little

attention from the benches and may even evoke a subtle  frown

from  this  Chair.  As in economics, such speeches  are  also

subject  to  the  laws of diminishing  returns!   So  let  us

conduct  ourselves as befits the status and dignity  of  this

Parliament.   But  this does not mean that  I  am  averse  to

Members including wit and good humour in your speeches, where

they are appropriate.  Not only will they add sparkle to what

you  say,  but  also  help to lift our  spirits  and  eyelids

particularly on long drowsy afternoons!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of new Members, I remember Mr Speaker the late

Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng lamenting that he had only the shape of the

spectacle frames of Members to help him recognise them by.  I

am  afraid  that this method will help me little,  given  the

proliferation of rimless spectacles now among Members in this

House.   So,  if  I  have trouble matching  names  to  faces,

initially, please bear with me as I grapple and struggle with

the whims of fashions in eyewear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this possibly small difficulty and with

Members'  help  and cooperation, I expect our proceedings  to

run smoothly and our debates to be robust and meaningful.   I

look  forward  to  a fruitful session and I  wish  Honourable

Members  all the best in the performance of their duties  and

responsibilities as Members of Parliament of the Republic  of

Singapore.  [Applause.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform Members that the President will be

present  in this Chamber at 8.30 pm to deliver his Speech  at

the  Opening of Parliament.  I therefore suspend the  sitting

until 8.30 pm this evening.

<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President: Honourable Members, the last five years

have been momentous times for Singapore.  The Asian Financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



Crisis  overwhelmed many economies in the region.   Singapore

was   not   spared.   Our  economy  slowed  down   as   well.

Fortunately we pulled through and recovered quickly.  Then in

2001  the  US economy slowed, the global electronics industry

slumped,  and we experienced our most severe recession  since

independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now emerging from this recession. But we are not

back  to  the  pre-crisis days of steady, high  growth.   The

world  has changed.  The next few years will present us  with

the most severe challenges in our nation's history.



<br><br><b>EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT</b>



<br><br><i>Tougher Global Competition</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we face much tougher competition, because of

globalisation.   Despite  problems  in  the  world   economy,

globalisation  has  not  let up.   In  many  industries,  for

example electronics and finance, competition is global.  This

trend is driven by technology, which is advancing faster than

ever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Asian economies like Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong

Kong,  are pursuing the same opportunities as we are, growing

their  IT  sectors, investing in life sciences and  competing

for global talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New players are emerging in the world economy. As they

strengthen   their  capabilities,  they  will  attract   more

investments,  and export more sophisticated  products.   They

will  increasingly  compete with  countries  ahead  of  them,

including Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important new player is China. China's low

costs,   abundant  talent,  and  huge  domestic  market   are

attracting  MNCs to relocate plants to China.   Good  quality

but  cheaper  Chinese  products are flooding  world  markets.

Adapting  to  China's  emergence and economic  transformation

will  pose  a  major  challenge  for  many  Asian  countries,

including Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>South East Asia</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our own region has been fundamentally altered.

For  three decades, Southeast Asia was stable, with countries

focussing  on  economic development and peaceful competition.

Singapore benefited greatly from this benign environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Financial Crisis changed this. It uncovered

serious  flaws  in  the economies which  will  take  time  to

remedy.   Meanwhile,  growth will be slower,  and  investment

opportunities will be fewer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Indonesia, a country key to the stability of the

region,  the crisis did not just cause economic  damage.   It

precipitated a collapse of the old order, unleashed  tectonic

forces  in Indonesian society, and set off political  changes

which are still being worked out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the spread of narrow, radical interpretations of

Islam in the countries around us, influenced by the worldwide

tide  of Islamic fundamentalism, will have its effect on  our

multi-racial, multi-religious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A troubled region, and an ASEAN preoccupied with

internal  problems,  mean  fewer  growth  opportunities   for

Singapore in the region.  And security problems that arise in

the region will inevitably spill over to Singapore.



<br><br><i>Global Terrorism</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third significant external development is the war

against  terrorism.  The Taleban and Al Qaeda may  have  been

routed  in  Afghanistan, but global  terrorism  is  far  from

defeated.  Terrorist cells, linked to global networks,  exist

in  many countries, including in Southeast Asia.  The  Jemaah

Islamiyah terrorist group is a stark reminder that these  are

not  faraway problems, but immediate threats to us  here  and

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger to us is two-fold. Firstly, we are directly

at risk of terrorist attacks, especially by Islamic extremist

groups



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



originating elsewhere in the region.  Such attacks will cause

suspicion and arouse enmity between our races.  Secondly,  US

action  against  global terrorism may cause repercussions  in

Muslim  countries, and complicate the situation in  Southeast

Asia.



<br><br><b>CHALLENGES FOR SINGAPORE</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the new environment that we are now in. Our

future  depends  on how we respond to these economic,  social

and political changes.



<br><br><i>Economic Restructuring</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make basic changes to our economy, to stay

competitive in an economically changed world, and continue to

prosper.   Hence we set up the Economic Review  Committee  to

examine  fundamentally all our economic policies, and propose

fresh strategies to sustain growth and prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee is in the midst of its work. But it is

clear  already that one key priority is to maintain a  highly

conducive  overall business environment.   For  example,  our

infrastructure  must  be first-class  but  their  costs  kept

competitive, to anchor businesses here and keep  Singapore  a

regional  hub.  And we must encourage effort and  enterprise,

as   the  best  way  of  creating  jobs  and  improving   the

livelihoods of Singaporeans.  Our taxes must be kept as light

as  possible,  to maximise the incentive for  businesses  and

individuals  to venture and work hard in the  hope  of  doing

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another priority is to strengthen the spirit of

entrepreneurship  and risk taking among Singaporeans  as  the

basis  for  Singapore's  future competitiveness.   We  should

inculcate  in  the  young  a more inquiring  and  adventurous

spirit,  and encourage them to think up new ideas and  create

new  opportunities.  Developing arts, sports and  a  stronger

civic society are part of the process to bring this about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs not only create jobs and wealth. They

make our whole economy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



more  dynamic  and  vibrant, and help  us  adapt  to  changed

conditions  and  exploit  new  opportunities.   Strong  local

enterprises,  both start-ups and established companies,  will

complement the MNCs and add depth to our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also identify new areas of growth, especially in

services.  We have already started liberalising the  services

industry,   notably  the  telecommunications  and   financial

sectors.   We  must  also  upgrade sectors  like  retail  and

construction,  whose  productivity  is  lagging  behind.   We

cannot  afford to shelter inefficient, protected  sectors  in

our   economy.   All  parts  of  our  economy   must   become

competitive and efficient, for that is the only way to create

productive, well-paying jobs for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will enable us to sustain growth over the

next  decade.   But the competition is now much tougher,  and

our  income levels are much higher than before.   We  can  no

longer expect to grow by 8 to 10%, year after year, as we did

before the Asian Financial Crisis, even if we were to work as

hard  as  or harder than before.  That phase of our  economic

development is over.  Going forward, if we can make 4  to  6%

growth  per  year, we will be doing well.  We must understand

and accept this reality.



<br><br><i>Social Cohesion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we upgrade our economy, we must maintain and

strengthen our social cohesion.  Economic restructuring means

adjustments  and  dislocation.   It  will  not  be  easy  for

Singaporeans to cope with the faster pace of change, and  the

demands for new skills.  But we must press on, or risk  being

overtaken by our competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our income distribution will stretch out. In the

globalised  economy, the rewards are greatest for those  with

the  knowledge, skills and enterprise.  Those at the top will

do  very  well.   But at the lower end, those without  skills

will  have difficulty raising their incomes, or even  finding

jobs.  This is already happening.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should celebrate Singaporeans who do well. By their

success,  they will create more jobs, build up  our  economy,

and  provide role models for others.  But to uplift the whole

population,  we must redouble our emphasis on  education  and

training.   Workers must stay employable, and find  new  jobs

when  their  old jobs become obsolete.  They  must  make  the

effort, to undergo retraining and to adapt to the changed job

market.  We must never allow an underclass to form, left  out

from  growth,  deprived  of opportunities,  and  perpetuating

poverty and despair from generation to generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will help Singaporeans to make the

changes,  especially  those groups who will  have  difficulty

adapting, such as older citizens.  We have the programmes and

the resources to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have spread the fruits of Singapore's progress

widely,  through HDB home ownership, excellent schools,  good

health care, and asset enhancement schemes.  We will continue

to  do  this,  to  make  sure that in the  next  phase,  life

improves for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must attract and integrate international talent

into  our society.  Talent is the critical success factor  in

the  knowledge  economy.   We will continue  to  develop  the

abilities  and  skills  of young Singaporeans  to  the  full.

Without  capable and enterprising Singaporeans, we  will  not

make  it  in the knowledge economy.  But we are too small  to

produce, by ourselves, all the talent that we need.  Even the

developed   countries   are   now   actively   sourcing   for

international talent, including from our part of  the  world.

We  must  supplement our own talent with talent from  abroad.

Only  then  can  we  sustain exceptional  performance  as  an

economy and a country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our success in attracting talent, a

significant  proportion of Singaporeans are first  generation

immigrants.  These people bring with them skills,  experience

and  drive  which will enrich and strengthen us.   They  are,

however, different from Singaporeans who have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



grown  up,  studied  and worked here  for  many  years.   Our

society  must  be open and welcoming to newcomers.   We  must

make them feel at home and in time absorb them as one of  us.

We must not allow resentment and tensions to build up against

newcomers.    In  the  globalised  economy,  a   closed   and

xenophobic society will not prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and most critical aspect of social cohesion is

reinforcing our racial and religious harmony.  We  have  made

steady   progress   integrating  the  different   races   and

religions, but the task is never complete.  The tendency  for

different   groups,  with  different  customs  and  religious

affinities,  to interact and seek comfort amongst  themselves

will  always be present.  Given today's heightened  religious

consciousness, we must move beyond mere tolerance,  in  order

to  enhance  appreciation and build  confidence  amongst  the

different groups.  We must re-double our efforts to encourage

more  mixing  and  interaction between the  communities,  and

gradually  widen  the  common ground  that  all  Singaporeans

share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will maintain its impartial, secular

approach  to  managing religious diversity.  We will  protect

the  minority communities, their cultures and their  ways  of

life.  At the same time, all groups must be willing to adjust

and  compromise, in order to live harmoniously  in  a  multi-racial, multi-religious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jemaah Islamiyah arrests highlighted the fault lines

in  our  society.   Had the group succeeded  in  setting  off

multiple bombs in Singapore, it would not only have cost many

innocent  Singaporean lives.  It would have  caused  distrust

and  enmity between Muslims and other Singaporeans, and  torn

our social fabric apart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jemaah Islamiyah group has been broken up, but the

problem  has  not  gone  away.  The virus  of  terrorism  has

infected  our region.  Other groups will form,  and  at  some

time, will try again.  This is why we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>

must  strengthen  inter-ethnic  relations,  for  example,  by

forming  Inter-Racial Confidence Circles and Harmony Circles.

We  must  make  sure that should such an attack  ever  occur,

leaders  of  the different communities can work  together  to

contain  the  damage, re-establish trust and confidence,  and

prevent further harm to our society.



<br><br><i>Political Renewal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In politics, we must remake our policies to fit a new

generation of Singaporeans, and adapt our style and  approach

to  stay  in  tune with the times.  No policy is so  cast  in

stone   that   it   can  never  be  changed,   whatever   the

circumstances.   Provided  we  recognise  the  realities   of

survival   in   Southeast  Asia,  and  remember   Singapore's

fundamental constraints and vulnerabilities, we can widen the

out-of-bounds markers in a realistic and practical way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life experiences of the new generation are quite

different  from those of their parents.  With the benefit  of

good   education,   their  options  are  wider,   and   their

expectations  higher.  This is natural  and  positive.   Each

generation strives to give their children a better  life  and

brighter future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must engage young Singaporeans in issues which affect

their  future.   Singaporeans  are  now  better  equipped  to

participate in the national debate, and more ready to discuss

sensitive matters in public.  We must open up more space  for

Singaporeans to do so.  This is an important way  to  harness

the  ideas, idealism and dynamism of the young, while keeping

their hearts and minds rooted in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more vigorous debate should not lead to more

fractious  and  polarised politics.  We  enjoy  a  broad  and

strong  national consensus on the direction which the country

should  take.  This consensus is a major advantage  over  our

competitors.   We must nurture it by pursuing policies  which

benefit  the  majority of Singaporeans, and by enlisting  the

energies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



and  support  of all those who have Singapore's interests  at

heart,  including those who disagree with specific Government

policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true test of our nation building is whether

Singapore's  success endures beyond the founding  generation.

We  have  made  one  successful transition,  from  the  first

generation  leaders to the second.  During the term  of  this

Parliament,  we expect to make another political  transition.

The nucleus of the next generation of political leadership is

already  in  place.  Before the next elections in  2007,  the

core  members of the new team must establish themselves,  and

take Singapore another step forward.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>CONCLUSION



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is at a turning point. The challenges are

formidable,  but  we are well equipped to tackle  them.   Our

system  is  transparent, efficient and  corruption-free.   We

have  pursued forward-looking, rational and prudent policies.

We  have  invested heavily in our people, and built a  stable

and cohesive society, an oasis in a turbulent region.  Let us

remake  Singapore together, so that despite the  difficulties

and  dangers,  we will continue to thrive and prosper  in  an

uncertain world.

<div align="center"><b>ADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>THE FIRST SESSION OF THE TENTH PARLIAMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ON MONDAY, 25TH MARCH 2002</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>



<div align="center">MR LIM HNG KIANG</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Health</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry of Health strives to achieve a more

cost-effective  health care system to  keep  Singaporeans  in

good  health.   We  aim  to provide good quality  preventive,

promotive  and  curative health care which is affordable  and

accessible to all Singaporeans.



<br><br><i>Making Health Care Affordable</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Ministry will continue to strengthen the 3M

framework  (Medisave,  MediShield  and  Medifund)   so   that

Singaporeans  are better able to pay their  share  of  health

care  costs.   We will study how best to extend  Medisave  to

cover  ambulatory and outpatient treatments, and  review  the

adequacy  of  Medisave in meeting the health  care  needs  of

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will expand the role of medical insurance in

financing  health  care  costs.  ElderShield,  an  affordable

basic severe disability insurance scheme, will be implemented

in  the third quarter of 2002.  New MediShield features  such

as  lifetime  coverage and pre-funding will be introduced  by

2003  so  that  Singaporeans  are  better  protected  against

catastrophic  illnesses.   We  will  also  facilitate  family

coverage  for  MediShield  so that  non-working  spouses  are

adequately protected.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The introduction of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs)

to  the  public  health care system in 1999 has  allowed  the

Ministry  to  target  more subsidies for  medical  conditions

which  require more resources to treat.  We will  re-set  the

Medisave  withdrawal limits and MediShield  claimable  limits

for  inpatient and day surgery cases to be based on  DRGs  in

2003,  to reflect the resources needed to treat the different

medical conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Despite more effective resource allocation with the

introduction  of DRGs, demand for health care  services  will

still  outpace the additional resources allocated.  To ensure

that  health  care subsidies are targeted at  the  low-income

groups who deserve the most financial help, we will introduce

selective means testing.



<br><br><i>Bringing Health Care Facilities Closer to Singaporeans</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will develop two new regional general hospitals

to  provide broad-based general medical care to Singaporeans.

Jurong  General  Hospital,  which will  replace  the  current

Alexandra Hospital, will be completed by 2006, while Northern

General  Hospital  will  be  completed  by  2008.   Community

hospitals  will  be  built next to  these  two  hospitals  to

provide  convenient  access to step-down  care  services  for

elderly Singaporeans.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. By 2006, we will also complete the new

Rehabilitation  Centre (RC) and Communicable  Disease  Centre

(CDC)  at  the Tan Tock Seng Hospital campus.   The  RC  will

function  as  a  tertiary centre providing  multidisciplinary

intensive rehabilitation services in specialised areas.   The

new  CDC  will  serve as the national centre  for  diagnosis,

treatment and control of infectious diseases.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. At the primary care level, the Ministry will

develop new polyclinics in Jurong West and Sengkang, and  re-develop the existing Queenstown polyclinic.  These three  new

polyclinics will be ready by 2004.



<br><br><i>Integrated Health Care for the Elderly</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To address the needs of our rapidly ageing

population,  the Ministry has established the  framework  for

integrated  health services for the elderly.  We will  extend

this to include dementia care and strengthen home medical and

home nursing services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



so  that  our  elderly can be cared for  by  the  family  and

community. We will also raise the quality assurance standards

in  step-down  care facilities, and enforce the  requirements

through  the  licensing  and  clinical  audit  process.    In

addition, we will continue to reserve and tender land parcels

to  the  private sector to increase the proportion of private

nursing home beds to 40% by 2010.



<br><br><i>Seamless Health Care Delivery</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Ministry has completed the restructuring of all

public healthcare institutions and re-organised them into two

vertically  integrated health care delivery networks,  namely

the  Singapore Health Services and National Healthcare Group.

The  two clusters will undertake further integration of their

services  to provide better seamless health care  service  to

Singaporeans.   Both clusters will also collaborate  and  co-operate to minimise wasteful duplication.  At the same  time,

we  will  explore  opportunities for  greater  public-private

sector  collaboration,  in  order to  harness  all  available

resources to raise standards of health care to Singaporeans.



<br><br><i>Health Promotion and Disease Control</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. To keep Singaporeans in good health, the Ministry

will   continue  to  strengthen  disease  control  programmes

against major chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and

stroke,  and major infectious diseases like tuberculosis  and

HIV.   The  Health Promotion Board will spearhead efforts  to

encourage  a  healthy and fit population.  It will  implement

national   screening  programmes  for  breast  and   cervical

cancers,  and  extend  basic  oral  health  services  to  all

secondary schools.



<br><br><i>Pursuit of Clinical Quality</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The Ministry is enhancing the clinical quality

assurance  framework to improve the standard and  quality  of

health care.  By end-2003, we would have implemented hospital-wide  and speciality-specific clinical indicators to  monitor

and improve clinical service provision.  At the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



same  time,  we will revise and issue regulations  under  the

Private  Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, to stipulate  the

scope  and  depth of quality assurance and infection  control

activities required of hospitals.  In addition, a  system  to

detect and mitigate potential sources of medical errors would

be put in place.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) will review and

update the Medicines Act, Poisons Act, Sale of Drugs Act  and

Medicine (Advertisements and Sales) Act.  One area of concern

is  to  provide  for  the appropriate  regulation  of  health

products  such  as medical devices and health supplements  to

safeguard public health and safety.



<br><br><i>Enhancing Professional Competence</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. The Ministry will work with the Singapore Medical

Council  to introduce compulsory Continuing Medical Education

for  doctors in 2003. Compulsory Continuing Medical Education

will  ensure that our doctors maintain professional standards

and stay abreast of the rapid advances in medical science and

technology.     We  will  also study the  need  to  introduce

regular    re-certification   of   doctors,    taking    into

consideration the trends in developed countries.   Similarly,

we  will  work  with  the respective Professional  Boards  to

introduce   Continuing  Education  Programmes   for   nurses,

dentists and pharmacists.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The Ministry will enhance the career development

opportunities  for nurses and other health care professionals

to  attract  Singaporeans  into key paramedical  professions.

Opportunities for local students to pursue paramedical degree

courses at overseas universities will be enhanced.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center">MR MAH BOW TAN</div>

<div align="center">Minister for National Development</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. MND will contribute to strengthening our economic

competitiveness by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



optimising land use, adopting a lighter regulatory touch, and

upgrading the construction industry.  MND will play its  part

in  keeping  public  housing  affordable  and  responsive  to

changing  needs.  In  addition, we  will  ensure  that  other

aspects  of  a  quality living environment like  a  resilient

supply  of  safe  food  and  sufficient  avenues  for   green

recreation will be met effectively.



<br><br><i>Land Use Policies</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Given Singapore's size, good land use planning is

critical  to  ensure that we can meet competing  demands  for

land as well as put in place a quality living environment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. MND will strive to optimise the use of our existing

land.   For example, we will explore new land use zonings  to

give  businesses more flexibility to change the use of  their

land to respond quickly to changing business needs and market

demand. We will study introducing a greater variety of  lease

tenures  in Government land sales, to meet changing  business

needs   and   foster  experimentation  with  new  development

concepts.  We  are  also  exploring  releasing  a   site   of

significant scale in the New Downtown area for the integrated

development of a business and financial centre.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To meet the increasing demand for land, MND will

also  continue  our  land  reclamation  programme  from   our

territorial waters.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. An orderly property market is important for

economic growth.  MND will continue to improve our land  sale

process,  in order to release a steady supply of state  land,

and avoid causing big fluctuations in property prices.



<br><br><i>Going for a Lighter Regulatory Touch</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. In keeping with our ongoing efforts to make

Singapore  an  attractive  place to  do  business,  MND  will

continue to reduce and simplify our rules and regulations  on

development control, and allow greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



flexibility  in building designs.  We will also move  towards

greater   self-regulation  for  architects  and  professional

engineers.



<br><br><i>Meeting our Housing Needs</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will maintain a high level of home ownership by

a  wide  cross-section of Singaporean households,  and  build

strong  community  ties through our public housing  policies.

These  are  cornerstones of our national strategy  to  foster

social  cohesion.  MND will continue to  ensure  that  public

flats  are  priced  affordably to  enable  at  least  90%  of

Singaporean households to be homeowners.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. MND will make public housing more responsive to the

needs  of  the people. New flats will be built  to  order  to

enable  Singaporeans  to  choose a flat  according  to  their

budget,  preferred  location and design. We  will  offer  new

flats in the more established estates to Singaporeans through

regular   balloting  exercises.  We  will  also  make   flats

available  on a walk-in selection basis to those who  need  a

flat   urgently.  We  will  explore  greater  private  sector

participation in the design and development of  public  flats

to inject competition and provide Singaporeans a wider choice

of public flats in terms of designs, layout and finishes.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. MND will also continue to rejuvenate older HDB

estates   through  the  Main,  Interim  and  Lift   Upgrading

Programmes  and Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme.  This

will help households to remain in their existing estates  and

help  preserve the community ties built over the  years.  The

pace of upgrading will depend on the budget surplus that  the

Government can generate.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. For the longer term, MND will review the structure

of  the  HDB  so that it continues to fulfil its  fundamental

objective of home ownership for Singaporeans.  We will review

our  public  housing  policies to  keep  our  public  housing

expenditure  in line with economic growth, and to  take  into

account



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



the  need for a balance between expenditures on housing,  and

other areas such as health and education.



<br><br><i>Moving Construction Ahead</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. MND will review our policies to promote

consolidation  and  raise productivity  in  the  construction

industry,  as  well as develop new competitive  strengths  in

areas  such  as project planning and design, IT  applications

and pre-fabrication technology.



<br><br><i>Ensuring a Resilient Supply of Safe Food</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Our high dependence on food imports makes Singapore

vulnerable to imported food borne diseases and disruption  in

food  supply. MND will step up efforts to diversify our  food

sources.  We  will  help  our food  importers  broaden  their

network  of sources, stimulate the development of new sources

of  supply  and  offer  consultancy  services  in  safe  food

production techniques so that more sources can meet our  food

safety standards and supply to us.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. MND will also continue to ensure high standards of

food  safety  by  upgrading our diagnostic  capabilities  and

systems. We will work with the Ministry of the Environment to

integrate  and strengthen our food safety control  system  to

ensure the safety of both processed and unprocessed food.



<br><br><i>Meeting Demand for Green Recreation</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Our policy of greening Singapore will grow in

importance in the years ahead as we become more urbanised and

densely  populated. MND will enhance our Garden City ambience

creatively  by promoting vertical greening, sky-rise  gardens

and more distinctive streetscape greenery. We will develop  a

variety of parks, open up selected nature areas and build  up

the  island-wide  park connector network  linking  our  green

areas,  inland water bodies and the coast. We will also  move

from just providing green infrastructure to actively engaging

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



community  to  develop  and organise park-based  recreational

activities  for residents. To preserve our natural  heritage,

we  will  establish an inventory of nature areas, and  ensure

that adequate studies are done before development.

<div align="center">Minister for the Environment</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>



<br><br><i>Environmental Infrastructure and Services</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Singapore has achieved economic and social growth

despite   our   lack  of  natural  resources,   and   without

compromising  the quality of our environment.  Our  challenge

ahead  is  to  build  on this foundation and  to  strive  for

environmental sustainability in the long term.



<br><br><i>Water Supply</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A stable, secure and adequate supply of water is

critical  to our survival.  We will tap all possible  sources

of  water.  We will supplement traditional sources of  supply

with  non-conventional  sources,  such  as  desalination  and

NEWater.



<br><br><i>Sustaining a Quality Living Environment</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will introduce new policies and measures to

ensure  that  the clean environment which we enjoy  now  will

continue  to  be  there  for  future  generations.  We   will

encourage  the  use  of  cleaner energy  and  promote  energy

efficiency  and conservation. We will strive to minimise  the

need   for   land-fill  by  promoting  recycling  and   waste

minimisation. We will explore restructuring and corporatising

our  waste incinerator operations, to subject them to  market

discipline and improve efficiency.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To maintain high public health standards, we will

implement strategies to promote food hygiene and safety.   We

will  also progressively upgrade our hawker centres.  We will

strengthen our research capability in the prevention and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



control  of communicable diseases, in particular vector-borne

diseases.



<br><br><i>Involving Our Community</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Singaporeans should take greater ownership of the

environment. We will actively engage the People,  Public  and

Private  sectors  to explore innovative ideas  in  addressing

environmental  issues.  We will also implement programmes  to

enhance environmental awareness and encourage Singaporeans to

participate in environmental initiatives such as the national

recycling programme.  We will involve our community on issues

such   as  upgrading  public  toilets  and  improving   their

cleanliness,  as  well  as  stepping  up  our  anti-littering

efforts.



<br><br><i>Doing our Part for the Global Environment</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will participate actively in international

environmental  co-operation and seek ways  to  contribute  to

global  sustainable  development, while  at  the  same  time,

protecting our national interests.  At the regional level, we

will  work closely with our ASEAN neighbours to tackle common

environmental  concerns such as the problem of trans-boundary

pollution.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b></div>



<div align="center">RAdm (NS) TEO CHEE HEAN</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Education</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The continued success of Singapore depends on its

people.   How  well we can re-make Singapore depends  on  how

well we can prepare our people for the challenges ahead.   We

will  continue to invest heavily in education, to  equip  our

young  with the necessary skills and knowledge, and the right

values and attitudes.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. MOE has moved toward Ability Driven Education to

help  each  individual recognise and make use of his  talents

and  abilities.  We will build on the progress made.  We will

continue with efforts to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



improve  the  teaching service, update our school  curriculum

and upgrade our infrastructure.



<br><br><i>Pre-school Education</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. A good pre-school education (PSE) lays the

foundation  for  subsequent  learning  and  development.   To

ensure  our children get the most value out of PSE, MOE  will

focus  on  helping  kindergartens provide  good  quality  yet

affordable   pre-school  education,   within   the   existing

framework  of  private  and  community  provision   of   such

services.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MOE will pay particular attention to curriculum

design,  teacher training, and regulation.  A pilot programme

started in 2001 is currently underway to develop a good  pre-school  curriculum.  A regulatory framework will also be  put

in  place to ensure the quality of teachers and programmes in

the   pre-school   sector.   To  help   eligible   non-profit

kindergartens upgrade standards and to keep fees  affordable,

MOE  is  providing annual recurrent grants to  eligible  non-profit  kindergartens.   Lower  income  families  will   also

receive  financial  assistance  to  send  their  children  to

qualifying non-profit kindergartens.



<br><br><i>Secondary and Post-Secondary Education</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MOE will conduct a review of our Secondary and

Junior  College  (JC) Education to provide  more  choices  to

cater  to  the different talents and aspirations of students.

It will examine issues including:

<pre>

     (a)  the principles and outline for a revised national 2-

          year JC curriculum to align it more closely to the

          overall education philosophy and system;



     (b)  whether some of our schools/JCs which are ready,

          should offer through-train secondary/JC programmes

          with the flexibility of adopting different terminal

          qualifications;

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

     (c)  whether new state-funded Independent Schools that

          cater to students with special talents and

          abilities should be established; and



     (d)  whether privately funded secondary schools are

          necessary and can play a useful role.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We expect a 20% increase in the cohort size

eligible for ITE, polytechnics and junior colleges from 2005.

MOE will increase the capacity of our post-secondary sector

so that all those able to benefit from further education will

have access to opportunities in our technical institutes,

polytechnics, and junior colleges.  The plans include the

restructuring of the existing 10 ITE institutes into 3

regional campuses, the establishment of the 5th polytechnic,

and the expansion of places in JCs.



<br><br><i>The University Sector</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Different types of universities, with different

missions  and emphases, will provide the basis for  a  robust

and   diverse   university  sector   that   can   support   a

sophisticated  and  evolving economy.  The  universities  can

play  a key role in developing manpower at both the pre-  and

in-employment  levels, conducting R&D  to  support  knowledge

industries, and providing educational services to the  region

to  support  the services sector as an additional  engine  of

economic growth.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. To ensure that the university sector meets the

needs of the economy and provides more opportunities to those

who  can benefit from a university education, we will  review

the  long  term  structure  of the higher  education  sector,

including studying setting up a fourth university, given  the

desired cohort participation rates at the university level.



<br><br><i>Continuing Improvements</i>



<br><br><i>Teachers</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Education is ultimately a human enterprise, and

teachers are our most precious resource.  The introduction of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



Education  Service Professional Development and  Career  Plan

(EduPac) will allow MOE to attract and retain our fair  share

of   talent,   provide  opportunities  for  their   continual

development,  and extend the influence of our best  teachers.

New  career  and recognition structures, and enhancements  to

the  performance  management system under  EduPac  are  being

implemented progressively.



<br><br><i>Curriculum and Assessment</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We have revised our curriculum to develop our

students  more holistically and equip them properly  for  the

knowledge  age.   Assessment  must  go  in  tandem  with  new

curricular  emphases.   The new University  Admission  System

from  2003  will  help  to reinforce curricular  changes,  by

taking  into account other measures of abilities in  addition

to A-levels.    From 2002, MOE is taking greater control over

the  GCE  A-level.   MOE will also study the  possibility  of

establishing  a statutory board, the Examinations  Authority,

to  build  up  our capability and capacity  in  the  area  of

assessment.



<br><br><i>IT in Education</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Our young need to be IT savvy to do well in the

future.   The  Masterplan for IT in Education, introduced  in

1997,  has  equipped our schools, teachers and students  with

the  skills  and knowledge to use IT to enhance teaching  and

learning.   MOE will unveil a second phase of its  Masterplan

for  IT  in  Education for the period 2003-2007,  to  further

facilitate  the  integration of  IT  with  sound  pedagogical

principles   in   bringing   about   an   enhanced   learning

environment.



<br><br><i>Single Session Primary Schools</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Single session schools allow for better access to

facilities  and  greater  interaction  between  teacher   and

students.  All our secondary schools are now single  session.

MOE  is  exploring  the implementation of single  session  in

primary schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Continuing Education and Training</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Our polytechnics and ITE will also expand their

roles  in the areas of continuing education and training,  to

meet  the  upgrading needs of our workforce.  To address  the

demands  of  industry for new skills and  knowledge,  courses

will   become   more  multi-disciplinary,   broad-based   and

entrepreneurial in outlook.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF MANPOWER</b></div>



<div align="center">DR LEE BOON YANG</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Manpower</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Manpower planning, manpower development, attracting

international  talent, occupational safety  and  health,  and

tripartite co-operation and industrial harmony remain the key

components   of  our  strategies  to  develop  our   manpower

resources.



<br><br><i>Manpower Planning and Development: Managing the Present, Preparing for the Future</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To help workers tackle the current downturn, a Jobs

Task  Force (JTF) has been set up.  We will continue to  work

with  the  private and people sectors to give  training,  job

assistance  and  counselling to those  affected  by  economic

restructuring. We will encourage employers to  redesign  jobs

at   the   workplace.   This  will  uplift  the   image   and

productivity  of  some  industries and  help  such  employers

recruit  workers by offering higher wages and better  working

conditions.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will also prepare our workforce for jobs in new

growth  areas.  We  will revise, improve  and  introduce  new

programmes to help employers and workers meet the new demands

on  our  workers.   We  will  further  enhance  our  training

infrastructure.  We will also continue to work  with  unions,

employers, training providers and community organisations  to

nurture   lifelong  learning  among  Singaporeans.  As   more

Singapore  companies operate worldwide,  we  will  facilitate

Singaporeans to work overseas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Occupational Safety and Health</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The well being of every working person is important

and  we  will  maintain  our high standards  of  occupational

safety and health.  We will extend the coverage of the safety

and  health  legislation to all workplaces.  To  establish  a

culture  of  safety and health, we will continue  to  provide

safety  and  health training to all levels of  personnel  and

promote self-regulation by the industries.



<br><br><i>Foreign Manpower</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. There is a global competition for talent. Even as

we   continue  to  develop  the  abilities  and   skills   of

Singaporeans,  we will intensify our efforts to  attract  our

share  of  international talent to contribute to our economy,

and help some of them settle down in Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. At the same time, we will continue to pursue

policies that will reduce our reliance on low-skilled foreign

workers.  We will also step up our management and enforcement

efforts  to  curb  illegal employment and abuses  of  foreign

workers.



<br><br><i>Tripartite Co-operation and Industrial Harmony</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Changes arising from economic restructuring

including  the  loss of old jobs and the development  of  new

forms of employment relationships will be unsettling for  our

workers,  and put our worker-employer relations to the  test.

MOM   must  continue  to  strengthen  tripartite  partnership

between the government, employers and trade unions, to foster

stronger  teamwork  and  preserve our  harmonious  industrial

relations   climate  and  meet  these  new   challenges.   In

particular,  we  will  work  closely  with  the  unions   and

employers   to  ensure  our  employment  regulations   remain

relevant  to  the workforce in the new economic  environment.

We need to accommodate a wider range of employment practices,

including new work patterns and flexible work arrangements to

promote work-life harmony of employees.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Wage Flexibility</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Adapting to rapid changes in the business

environment  requires  a flexible wage system.  The  Ministry

will work closely with employers and trade unions to speed up

the implementation of the monthly variable component (MVC) as

recommended  by  the  National Wage Council  (NWC),  so  that

companies can adjust their monthly wage bill quickly when the

need  arises, to remain competitive and minimise job  losses.

We  will  also promote the adoption of performance-based  pay

structures over seniority-based wage system.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. In addition, we will refine the components of our

employment  benefits system, including the implementation  of

medical  co-payment  and  the adoption  of  a  more  rational

approach  in  the  payment of retrenchment benefits  so  that

companies can have greater flexibility in managing their wage

costs.



<br><br><i>Social Security</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will review the Central Provident Fund (CPF)

scheme,  to ensure it provides members with adequate  savings

for  their  housing,  medical and retirement  needs,  without

undermining business cost competitiveness.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SPORTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center">ASSOC. PROF. YAACOB IBRAHIM</div>

<div align="center">Acting Minister for Community Development & Sports</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The mission of the Ministry of Community

Development  and  Sports (MCDS) is to build  a  cohesive  and

resilient  society. Over the next 5 years, we will  focus  on

the following areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Building social capital to strengthen cohesion;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Strengthening the social safety net by linking timely and appropriate assistance to those in need with job counselling, training and placement; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Enhancing social services to help families discharge their care and support responsibilities.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Building Social Capital</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A cornerstone of building social capital is

strengthening multi-racial and multi-religious harmony.  MCDS

will  continue  to  actively promote the integration  of  the

different  races  and  religions in Singapore,  to  encourage

acceptance  and mutual understanding across different  ethnic

and  religious  groups, and expand the  common  spaces  where

different communities can interact in harmony.  We will  work

with  communal  and  religious organisations  to  expand  and

strengthen  Singaporeans' religious tolerance.  The  People's

Association  will  press  on  to  build  up  our   grassroots

organisations to extend their reach to more Singaporeans  and

bring  them  together  to  work for  the  betterment  of  our

society.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. MCDS will continue to work with the National

Council  of Social Service and the National Volunteer  Centre

to  promote  active  citizenry  and  community  self-help  by

encouraging volunteerism and philanthropy among Singaporeans.

In   particular,   MCDS   will  focus   on   increasing   the

professionalism  of  the social service providers.   We  will

work  with the Community Development Councils to improve  the

training of social workers at the district level in order  to

increase the responsiveness of social service agencies within

the community.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Sports can contribute towards community bonding and

enhancing  national pride.  For the individual, it cultivates

perseverance, discipline and a healthy lifestyle.  MCDS will,

through  the  Singapore  Sports  Council,  further  encourage

sports    participation   and   sports    excellence    among

Singaporeans, and promote the sports industry in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Maintaining the Social Safety Net</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MCDS will work with the community to provide timely

and appropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



assistance   and  relief  to  Singaporeans  who  need   help,

especially  those  affected by the current economic  downturn

and economic restructuring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The most effective long-term solution, however, is

to continue to inculcate in Singaporeans, the values of self-

reliance   and   the  dignity  of  work,  and   ensure   that

Singaporeans  are employable and gainfully  employed.   MCDS,

together  with other agencies, will encourage individuals  on

government assistance to return to work by linking short-term

financial  assistance  closely  with  job  counselling,   job

search, training and placement.



<br><br><i>Supporting Families</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Our low fertility rate, particularly among better

educated  Singaporeans, continues to be an area  of  concern.

We  will  continue to monitor demographic trends closely  and

consider new measures to address this problem.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The family is the basic unit of our society. MCDS

will  continue  to drive pro-family policies and  programmes,

including  promoting family life education, a balanced  work-

family  environment, and improved childcare and student  care

arrangements.  We will pay special attention to  the  welfare

and  development  of  children from low-income  families  and

families  at  risk,  to  ensure  that  they  have  access  to

developmental and educational opportunities. In addition,  we

will  examine  the  needs  of  various  caregivers,  be  they

caregivers  to  children, the elderly  or  the  disabled,  to

determine  how the community can offer services  and  support

that these caregivers need.



<br><br><i>MUIS</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. MUIS will work with the community, mosques and

other  Malay/Muslim  organisations  to  strengthen  religious

values and family units, and guide the Singapore Malay/Muslim

community  into  a knowledge-based economy, within  a  multi-

religious society.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT</b></div>



<div align="center">MR YEO CHEOW TONG</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Transport</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. MOT will maintain and build on Singapore's leading

position  as  a global transportation and logistics  hub.  We

will  also  continue  to  provide Singaporeans  with  a  high

quality yet affordable public transport system.



<br><br><i>Maritime Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To meet the intensifying competition from

neighbouring ports, MOT will continue to liberalise port  and

marine  services where appropriate, to ensure that  Singapore

continues  to provide high quality,  cost competitive  value-

added  services.   To  support  activities  of  the  maritime

sector,  we  will  develop new ancillary services,  including

maritime R&D.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will also leverage on our excellent port, road,

IT   and   e-commerce   infrastructure  to   facilitate   the

development of an integrated logistics industry, covering the

entire   chain   of   handling,   processing,   storage   and

transportation  of  goods,  as  well  as  the  management  of

information flow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To consolidate our lead as a regional cruise hub,

we  will continue to work with other government agencies  and

industry   players  to  attract  fly-cruise   passengers   by

leveraging on Changi's large foreign passenger base.



<br><br><i>Air Transport</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Passenger traffic and airfreight through Changi

have  declined following the 911 attacks in the US. Singapore

is  also  facing more intense competition from newer airports

in neighbouring countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To stay the premier air hub in the region, the

Government will continue its liberal air transport policy, to

extend  Changi's air network and connectivity  especially  to

rapidly growing and emerging aviation markets such as China



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



and India.  We will review incentives to attract new airlines

and  to entrench existing ones in Singapore. CAAS will launch

joint  promotion  and marketing activities with  airlines  to

increase their business through Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. CAAS will also ensure adequate capacity at Changi

Airport. CAAS will soon embark on a major upgrade of Terminal

2.  Development  of Terminal 3 will proceed  in  tandem  with

projections in traffic growth. Changi has opened  a  Business

Aviation  Centre,  offering  speedy  clearance  for  business

travellers travelling in executive jets. New cargo  terminals

are  also  being  built  and the Airport  Logistics  Park  of

Singapore   (ALPS)  will  open  in  2003  to  help   maintain

Singapore's position as the premier integrated transport  and

logistics hub in the Asia-Pacific region.



<br><br><i>Land Transport</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. MOT will continue to develop our road network to

increase  road capacity, improve connectivity and  strengthen

strategic  linkages  between major activity  and  residential

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. MOT will also review the vehicle restraint measures

to allow more people to own cars. We will progressively shift

from  a  reliance on ownership to usage control  measures  to

manage  the demand. The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP)  System

together  with  the  Vehicle Quota  Scheme  (VQS)  have  been

effective in checking congestion on our roads. The  ERP  will

be  expanded  further  to  form a second  cordon  beyond  the

Restricted Zone, and extended to other areas and times of day

where traffic conditions warrant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. There are limits, however, to road capacity. Beyond

a  certain car population, congestion is inevitable.  We must

continue  to develop our public transport system as a  viable

alternative.  We will expand the Rapid Transit  System  (RTS)

network into a comprehensive network to form the backbone  of

the  public  transport system. The North-East  Line  together

with  the Sengkang LRT will be completed this year.   Punggol

LRT will be ready in 2004.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



Beyond  that,  we  are  building the Circle  Line,  which  is

targeted  for  completion by 2010.  There are also  plans  to

build  the Bukit Timah Line, the Eastern Region Line and  the

Jurong  Region Line within the next 10 to 15 years. With  the

completion  of these 3 new lines, the total RTS network  will

more than double to 240 km.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will also leverage on technology. We will create

a transport information hub that can provide public transport

commuters and motorists with real-time information on  public

transport arrival times and road traffic conditions. We  will

review public transport quality standards to better meet  the

needs of the commuter population.

sector  as a key growth sector in Singapore's economy and  to

make  Singapore a key ICT centre that is globally competitive

in  IT  and  communications.  We completely  liberalised  the

telecommunications  sector in 2000.   Through  the  Info-comm

Development  Authority  of Singapore,  we  will  continue  to

regulate  the  industry to ensure open competition  with  low

entry barriers, and the availability of a wide range of  high

quality services at competitive prices.  We will strive to be

well connected to the key communication nodes in the world to

support the growth of electronic commerce.

not   global  operations  in  Singapore.  We  will   position

Singapore  as Asia's "working laboratory" for the incubation,

research   and   development  of  new  infocomm   ideas   and

technologies.    We   will  take  into  account   the   rapid

convergence in digital technologies, so that innovative ideas

and new services can be rapidly brought to market.  As ICT is

a knowledge industry that hinges on talent, we will work with

the  industry  and educational institutions  to  provide  the

sector with sufficient trained personnel.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We must leverage on ICT to enhance the quality of

life   and  standard  of  living  of  Singaporeans   in   the

Information Society. We will introduce programmes  to  bridge

the digital divide.  We will aim to have affordable and ready

access  to  e-services through broadband Internet  and  other

emerging  communication technologies,  to  make  Singapore  a

Connected Island.



<br><br><i>Arts and Culture</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will develop the Arts to enhance our economic

competitiveness  and  promote our international  image  as  a

vibrant,  cosmopolitan city, a Creative  Singapore.   Through

the  Arts  we  can  nurture a more creative  and  adventurous

spirit, and build an environment that encourages Singaporeans

to  explore,  innovate  and  invent.  This  will  deepen  our

cultural capital, and help Singaporeans to create value in an

innovation-driven economy.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The opening of the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay

this  October  will  provide the facilities  to  attract  and

present  world-class performing arts events as well as  local

and other arts performances to cater to all Singaporeans.  We

will  continue to invest in new arts and cultural facilities.

For the longer term, we are exploring the establishment of  a

new international museum of modern and contemporary art.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. To bring arts closer to people and people closer to

the  arts,  MITA will launch an "Arts Everywhere" initiative.

We  will  work  with agencies like HDB, schools and  People's

Association to make our arts, culture and heritage a relevant

and  palpable  part  of Singaporeans' daily  lives.  We  will

promote  more public sculptures, arts performances, and  arts

and  heritage  education programmes  to  widen  our  cultural

experience.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will also support the development of artists by

building  up  our  Arts education institutions,  and  through

programmes   that  give  our  artists  greater  international

exposure.   We will promote both traditional and contemporary

arts so that we can maintain our heritage and identity, while

keeping  apace  with  Arts development  elsewhere.   We  will

encourage  artists  to  fuse our rich multicultural  heritage

with  contemporary forms to create distinctively  Singaporean

expressions.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will enhance the contribution of Arts to

business, by promoting design and other forms of applied arts

with  a  Design Singapore initiative.  We will also grow  the

Arts  industry  by  strongly promoting Arts Tourism  together

with Singapore Tourism Board.



<br><br><i>Media</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Our long term objective is to foster a competitive

print  and  broadcast  industry.  We  liberalised  the  media

industry  in  June  2000, issuing new  licences  to  SPH  and

MediaCorp  to  undertake additional broadcast  and  newspaper

operations.   MITA will continue to encourage the local media

industry to restructure and improve its operations.  We  will

revise  our  newspaper and broadcast laws to keep abreast  of

the new media and economic environment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will draw up a strategic blueprint - "Media 21"

-  to  develop  both traditional and emerging  media  sectors

including film and digital media, to establish Singapore as a

media hub.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



will continue to introduce digital broadcasting technology in

line with market developments.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The advent of the Internet and the convergence

between   the   various  media,  brought   about   by   rapid

technological   advances,   have   opened   the   doors   for

Singaporeans to the world, providing them with easier  access

to  information, and bringing them into closer  contact  with

western culture and world-wide trends.  This will impinge  on

every  aspect of our lives.  We will continue to monitor  the

implications of these trends for Singapore.



<br><br><i>Library</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. MITA will continue to provide quality and

affordable  knowledge  access for all Singaporeans.  The  new

National Library, to be completed by 2004, will be six  times

larger  than  the  existing one at  Stamford  Road.  It  will

spearhead a Knowledge Singapore initiative to strengthen  the

nation's  knowledge capacity with its extensive  collections,

research facilities and innovative programming.  The National

Library  Board will also open the library@esplanade, a  niche

library  focussing on the performing arts at  the  Esplanade,

Bishan Community Library and Sengkang Community Library,  and

embark on library upgrading projects.



<br><br><i>Heritage</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. We need to strengthen our emotional and social

bonds  by staying connected within our community and  to  the

nation  in  this  rapidly  changing  world,  as  a  Connected

Singapore.  MITA  will promote and provide  wider  access  to

shared  experiences of our culture and heritage, in  fun  and

interesting ways that reach into the communities.  The  Asian

Civilizations   Museum  at  Empress  Place  Building,   which

showcases the ancestral cultures of Singapore, will be  ready

in  2003.  The  Singapore  History Museum  will  undergo  redevelopment in 2003 and double its exhibition space.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (PUBLIC SERVICE DIVISION)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center">MR LEE HSIEN LOONG</div>

<div align="center">Deputy Prime Minister & Minister for Finance</div>



<br><br><i>Serving the Nation</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A capable, forward looking and effective public

service,  working  together with the elected  government,  is

crucial for a dynamic, innovative and successful nation.   To

fulfil this vision, public officers must have the desire  and

capacity to contribute to and shape our society. They must be

prepared  to continuously improve, constantly change  and  be

open  to  innovation.  We will adapt our style and approaches

to  a  better  educated  and better  informed  generation  of

Singaporeans, while meeting the expectations and needs of the

older generation.



<br><br><i>Managing Talent</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Managing talent in the Public Service remains our

key  priority.   We will continue to review and  improve  the

scholarship  system to make full use of scarce  resources  to

nurture fresh talent for the Public Service.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will implement effective, rigorous and

enlightened  personnel management practices  to  attract  and

retain  talent  in the Public Service.  Our  officers  should

have  an  abiding  sense of purpose and a  fulfilling  career

serving the nation.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will develop and stretch civil servants in

challenging assignments to maximise their potential. We  will

set  up an internal job market in the Civil Service to  match

the  job  interests of civil servants and the  needs  of  the

Public Service.  We will progressively devolve responsibility

for  personnel management to Ministries to give them  greater

flexibility  to  better motivate their  officers  to  achieve

their specific missions.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will continue to keep civil service compensation

competitive with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



the  private  sector,  and  refine compensation  policies  to

motivate excellent performance.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We have also introduced a new framework to manage

Public  Service  Leadership (PSL) talent by  identifying  PSL

positions  to  be  filled  by the  most  able  and  committed

officers.    Under the framework, a "flow-through"  mechanism

ensures constant talent renewal.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. To provide better training for public officers, the

Civil Service College (CSC) was restructured into a Statutory

Board.  The CSC now provides an integrated range of  services

spanning  assessment, selection, training and  organisational

development.  The CSC will continue to improve the quality of

people  in the public service, strengthen teamwork and esprit

de  corps, and improve the performance of our agencies for  a

first class public service.



<br><br><i>Innovation and Responsiveness</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The Public Service will constantly seek new and

better  ways  of doing things to remain relevant and  improve

its  service  delivery. We will continue to  evolve  to  meet

future   challenges.   We  will  ensure   better   and   more

comprehensive public services, especially through the use  of

technology.   We will raise the efficiency and  effectiveness

of  the Public Sector, by integrating different services  and

making  them more accessible to the public.  We will  monitor

expectations  and  tap new ideas to improve  service  to  the

public.   We  will also actively review rules and regulations

to reduce red tape and speed up service delivery to create  a

more   business-friendly   environment,   thereby   enhancing

Singapore's competitiveness.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To nurture an innovative culture in the Public

Service,  the Enterprise Challenge (TEC) provides a  platform

for  promising  ideas to be funded for trial testing.   These

projects  will  then  be implemented by the  relevant  public

sector  agencies.  We will expand the network  under  TEC  to

encourage  greater  collaboration  between  the  private  and

public sectors.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY</b></div>



<div align="center">BG GEORGE YONG-BOON YEO</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Trade and Industry</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Our vision is for the Singapore economy to be

entrepreneurial   and  knowledge-intensive,   with   globally

competitive manufacturing and services sectors.



<br><br><i>Globally Competitive Manufacturing and Services Sectors</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Manufacturing will continue to be a key engine of

growth  for  Singapore.  To  increase  manufacturing's  value

creation  in Singapore, we will encourage companies to  adopt

more  sophisticated  products and  production  methods.  R&D,

market development and brand management will all become  more

important.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Besides strengthening electronics, chemicals and

engineering,  EDB  will build up biomedical  science  as  the

fourth  pillar  of  manufacturing. EDB will  attract  leading

international    companies   dealing   in    pharmaceuticals,

biotechnology,  medical  devices and healthcare  services  to

Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In addition, we will develop new growth sectors in

healthcare,  education, infocomm and media, while  continuing

to  promote  traditional  services like  trading,  logistics,

transportation,  tourism  and  financial  services.  We  will

promote  the further deregulation of our services sectors  to

foster   greater  competition  and  growth.  We  will  remake

Sentosa.



<br><br><i>Developing a Vibrant Enterprise Ecosystem</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will foster a vibrant enterprise ecosystem that

helps local businesses to flourish and internationalise,  and

international   businesses   to   locate   high   value-added

activities here.



<br><br><i>Pro-Enterprise Environment</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To ensure that Singapore remains one of the most

business-friendly places



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



in  the  world for enterprises, we will continue to  cut  red

tape  and remove regulatory barriers. We will put in place  a

framework for competition and fair trade.  We will  keep  our

costs  competitive and our taxes low to encourage and  reward

enterprise.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Land is scarce in Singapore and our industrial land

costs  more  than  in some other countries.  JTC  Corporation

(JTC)  will  provide  superior  value  to  investors  through

excellent  infrastructure and support  facilities.  JTC  will

explore new ways to intensify and optimise land use.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will also keep our energy costs internationally

competitive  by opening up the electricity and  gas  markets.

About   40%  of  electricity  sales  are  already   open   to

competition.  We aim to increase this to 70% by  the  end  of

this year. Competition for small consumers will commence next

year.   To diversify fuel sources for our energy market,  the

Energy  Market Authority (EMA) will facilitate the import  of

liquefied natural gas (LNG).



<br><br><i>Knowledge and Innovation</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Knowledge and innovation are key drivers of the new

Singapore   Economy.   We   must  create   a   knowledge-rich

environment and nurture an innovation-driven workforce.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will build up one-north, a hub for

entrepreneurs,  scientists  and researchers  to  work,  live,

meet,  exchange  ideas  and  strike  deals.  The  Agency  for

Science,  Technology and Research (A*STAR) will foster  world

class  scientific  research  in selected  areas  and  develop

talent for a vibrant knowledge-based Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We are working with the Ministry of Law to build a

strong and dynamic intellectual property (IP) regime,  so  as

to develop Singapore into a centre for IP and innovation, and

encourage  the  creation  and  commercialisation  of  IP   in

Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will also work with the Ministry of Manpower to

upgrade  the  skills of our workforce, and to attract  global

talent. The Singapore Productivity and Standards Board  (PSB)

has  been  reorganised to champion total factor  productivity

and  innovation at all levels of our society and renamed  the

Standards,   Productivity   and  Innovation   Board   (SPRING

Singapore).



<br><br><i>Linkages with the World</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We will help our enterprises gain the best access

to  world markets. We will continue to support the WTO and  a

successful  conclusion of the Development Agenda launched  in

Doha  last  year.  We will also pursue Free Trade  Agreements

(FTAs) with our key trading partners.  Our base is the  ASEAN

FTA. We will continue to support the economic integration  of

ASEAN,  and  help  strengthen  ASEAN's  competitiveness.   To

catalyse  deeper linkages of the region with  the  world,  we

have  signed  FTAs  with  New Zealand  and  Japan,  concluded

negotiations  with  the European Free  Trade  Area,  and  are

negotiating  with the US, Canada, Australia and  Mexico.   We

are  also  working toward a FTA between ASEAN and China,  and

closer economic partnerships between ASEAN and Japan, as well

as between ASEAN and Australia and New Zealand.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. These will help make Singapore a key node linking

Asia  to  the rest of the world. We want Singapore  to  be  a

major   hub   for  HQ  services,  R&D,  product  development,

logistical,  financial and service support for  international

companies operating within a 7-hour flight radius.



<br><br><i>Enterprise Development</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. We will nurture enterprises at different stages of

development  and  promote  the development  of  new  economic

activities. We will also assist start-ups by improving  their

access  to  capital, including attracting venture capitalists

to  Singapore and encouraging more private sector funding  of

venture projects.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. To help Singapore-based companies go international,

the  Trade Development Board has been reorganised and renamed

International   Enterprise  Singapore  (IE   Singapore).   IE

Singapore  will set up business support offices  in  selected

cities,  especially  in China and India, to  provide  on-site

assistance and Singapore Centres for our companies to cluster

together and share resources.  We will also encourage foreign

SMEs   to  establish  operations  in  Singapore  and  partner

Singapore companies in third countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. In addition to promoting innovation, SPRING

Singapore  will  continue to help local  SMEs  improve  their

productivity through a wide range of programmes. It will push

for greater standardisation as a way to improve productivity.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b></div>



<div align="center">MR LEE HSIEN LOONG</div>

<div align="center">Deputy Prime Minister & Minister for Finance</div>



<br><br><i>Fiscal Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The next few years will see lower GDP growth,

increased  demands  on  expenditure,  and  tighter   budgets.

Maintaining   fiscal  discipline  and  sound   macro-economic

policies  is  key.   These concerns underpin  our  effort  to

restructure   the   economy   for   competitiveness   in   an

increasingly globalised world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We must keep the tax burden on the economy as light

as  possible, and maintain a good balance between direct  and

indirect  taxes. This will help keep Singapore attractive  to

investments and assure jobs for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will pursue a prudent fiscal policy. We will

budget  for  a modest surplus over the business  cycle.  This

will  yield  enough resources to invest in new growth  areas,

and deal with the social challenges of economic restructuring

and an ageing population in a sustainable way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Monetary Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We have experienced more frequent shocks as the

world  economy  has  become more inter-linked  and  volatile.

Monetary  policy, centred on the management of  the  exchange

rate,  aims  for  price stability while being  supportive  of

growth.    Its objective is low inflation, a stable  currency

and sustained economic growth.



<br><br><i>Facilitating Business and Enterprise</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will make Singapore "Best for Business" by

simplifying  business  regulations  and  enhancing  corporate

governance  and  accounting  practices.   This  will  attract

global  capital  and  support Singapore  companies  in  their

efforts  to  reach world-class standards. We will  set  up  a

Council  on  Corporate  Disclosure  and  Governance  to   set

accounting standards and advocate best practices in corporate

governance.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Government fees and charges will be set to recover

costs,  except where we need higher rates to deter the misuse

or  misallocation of resources. The Government will outsource

services to the private and people sectors wherever  this  is

cost effective.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Government expects companies it holds shares in

to  operate commercially, without any preferential treatment.

Many  of  these  companies  will  contribute  to  Singapore's

external economy by expanding into significant businesses  in

the  region  and  beyond.  The Government will  progressively

divest   its  commercial  investments  which  are  no  longer

strategic, as market conditions permit.



<br><br><i>Budgeting Wisely</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will incentivise Ministries to focus on

obtaining the best outcomes with the resources available.  We

must strike a judicious balance in allocating funds among the

economic,  social  and  security sectors.   Helping  citizens

adjust to the new economic conditions is a high priority.  An

ageing population also presents special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



demands, especially in community services and healthcare.  We

will  make  more  use of means-testing to target  government-financed assistance and subsidies.



<br><br><i>Excellent Public Service</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Government will make public services more

customer-centred, through the e-government  programme.  "Many

Agencies, One Government" will provide greater convenience to

the  public.  We will set up more e-Citizen Help Centres,  to

service  those  who lack personal access to the  internet  or

need help to cope with it.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. All government agencies will aim to achieve

national   and  international  benchmarks  of  organisational

excellence,  especially  the  ISO-9000  series   of   quality

management  standards,  the People  Developer  Standard,  the

Singapore  Quality  Class, and the Singapore  Quality  Award.

They will continually review their regulations to reduce  red

tape, removing them altogether wherever possible.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center">PROF. S. JAYAKUMAR</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Foreign Affairs</div>



<br><br><i>External Backdrop</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September

2001  and  the  on-going global anti-terrorist campaign  have

added  a  key element of uncertainty to world stability.  The

end of the Cold War and globalisation have also fundamentally

changed the external environment for Singapore. Not only  are

convenient  distinctions between domestic  and  international

interests blurring, but the economic, political and  security

interests    of    states   can   no   longer    be    neatly

compartmentalised, instead interacting and overlapping  in  a

complicated manner in a globalised world.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As a small city-state plugged into the

international  grid, Singapore cannot be insulated  from  the

key global trends.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



The  conduct of Singapore's foreign policy has become an even

greater challenge.



<br><br><i>Key Foreign Policy Issues For Singapore's Future</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Southeast Asia remains in a state of flux following

the  Asian Financial Crisis.  Some countries continue to face

daunting  political  and  economic  challenges  domestically.

These  difficulties  have also provided  fertile  ground  for

terrorism  and  religious extremism to  take  root,  fuelling

ethnic conflicts and separatist movements. How countries such

as  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and the  Philippines  handle  these

problems will impact the overall security complexion  of  the

region.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Singapore's future is inextricably tied to

Southeast  Asia.  Managing  bilateral  relations   with   our

neighbours, especially Malaysia and Indonesia, will remain  a

top  priority. Occasional hiccups in our relations  with  our

neighbours are inevitable.  But we will continue  to  take  a

broad  and long-term perspective of these relations, and  not

be  side-tracked  by differences over individual  issues.  We

want stable and mutually-beneficial relations.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. At the same time, Singapore remains firmly

committed  to  ASEAN.   The perceptions of  Southeast  Asia's

political and economic drift, in contrast to Northeast Asia's

dynamism, cannot be brushed aside. ASEAN must reinvent itself

and  keep pace with global changes. It needs to forge greater

internal  cohesion  and rediscover a new direction.  We  will

work  closely with our ASEAN neighbours and Dialogue partners

through  the Initiative for ASEAN Integration and the Roadmap

for the Integration of ASEAN to integrate the newer and older

members  and  ensure that the region remains outward-looking.

We will try, within our limits, to help restore stability and

confidence in the region.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Beyond the region, the global anti-terrorism effort

continues. Singapore is an open society, totally dependent on

the   globalised   economy   and  an   orderly,   predictable

international environment for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



trade  and a living.  Terrorism which strikes at this  global

system  directly undermines our prosperity and security.   We

must  take  a  clear stand and contribute  our  part  to  the

international effort against terrorism.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The on-going anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan

has also demonstrated the US' unmatched military superiority,

in  addition to its dominance in the economic, political  and

technological  fields. How the US wields this influence  will

have profound implications for international stability.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Fortunately, the campaign against terrorism has

impelled   the   major  powers  to  emphasise  their   common

interests.  It  has stabilised the US-China-Japan  triangular

relationship,  which  is  crucial  to  Southeast  Asia.   But

uncertainties remain. China's growth will change the  balance

of  influence and power in the region.  Its integration  into

the   international  system  will  require  adjustments   and

accommodation on both sides. We will continue to  engage  the

US   to  ensure  that  it  stays  in  the  region.   We  will

consolidate  cross-regional links  and  mutual  understanding

with Europe, particularly through ASEM.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will also continue to support international

organisations, particularly the United Nations.   As  a  non-permanent  member  of  the United Nations  Security  Council,

Singapore has supported initiatives that strengthen its  role

as  the primary UN organ for maintaining international  peace

and    security.   In   particular,   we   have   contributed

constructively   to   the  Council's  efforts   in   building

international support for the campaign against terrorism.  We

will continue to be a constructive player in the UN.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Singapore Cooperation Programme remains an

important  channel for Singapore to fulfil its  international

obligations  by  sharing  our  development  experience   with

others.  Within  our limited resources,  we  will  strive  to

maximise our reach and accommodate the changing needs of  the

recipient countries by seeking collaboration and partnerships

with international organisations and other countries.

<div align="center">DR TONY TAN KENG YAM</div>

<div align="center">Deputy Prime Minister & Minister for Defence</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A strong defence is the foundation for Singapore's

peace,  security and prosperity.  The events of September  11

and  the  uncovering  of Al Qaeda-linked terrorist  cells  in

Singapore are important reminders that we must not take  this

for granted.



<br><br><i>Defence and Deterrence</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We must work together as a nation to deal

effectively  with non-conventional threats and  new  security

challenges,  including  low  intensity  conflict  and  global

terrorism. The SAF will broaden its capabilities and work  in

close coordination with other security agencies to deal  with

these threats. The National Security Secretariat will develop

a   more   coherent  and  integrated  approach  to   ensuring

Singapore's national security.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We must also continue to maintain and strengthen

our  capabilities  to  defend ourselves against  conventional

security threats.  We have built up a strong, integrated  and

technologically  advanced armed forces. We will  continue  to

upgrade and modernise the SAF to ensure that it continues  to

have  the  capabilities to defend Singapore against the  full

spectrum of potential threats:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <i>Technology:</i> The SAF will continue to harness

technology as a force multiplier, so that it can maintain its

strategic edge despite its manpower and resource constraints.

The restructuring of MINDEF's technology arm and formation of

the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) has enabled

MINDEF to better anticipate and exploit future trends and

challenges in the technology sector.  MINDEF will continue to

strengthen the SAF's technological edge and invest to develop

our home-grown defence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



research  and  development capability  as  well  as

deepen  our  collaboration with  international  R&D

agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <i>Training:</i> MINDEF will ensure that our people are

trained and developed to achieve their fullest potential, and

to be mentally and physically equipped to defend Singapore.

The SAF will continue to improve its training procedures and

methodologies to provide our servicemen with the best

training available. The SAF will also continue to benchmark

itself against the best armed forces in the world, and

validate and refine its training system. To optimise training

efficiency, the SAF will increasingly utilise simulation

technology to provide realistic and cost-effective training

locally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF needs to train overseas given our limited local training areas and airspace. MINDEF will continue to maintain and enhance our access to traditional training areas, as well as to look for more overseas training opportunities in friendly countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <i>People:</i> The strength of the SAF lies in its people. To ensure that the most able and dedicated serve in the defence of our nation, MINDEF will regularly review its manpower policies to maintain its attractiveness and competitive edge in the labour market as an employer of choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) </i>National Service:</i> Our national servicemen form the

backbone of the SAF. MINDEF will continue to review its NS

training and policies to ensure that our national servicemen

are motivated, well trained and prepared to defend the

nation. A review committee has been set up to examine how the

NS system and NS policies can be improved. MINDEF will also

implement the recommendations made by the 3rd Committee to

Recognise the Contribution of Operationally Ready



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



National Servicemen to Total Defence (RECORD III).



<br><br><i>Diplomacy</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The new security challenges facing the world today

transcend  national borders, and need to be  tackled  through

global  and  regional cooperation. MINDEF  will  continue  to

foster  good  defence relations with friendly  countries  and

contribute  to  efforts  to promote international  peace  and

stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Bilateral Defence Relations: MINDEF will continue

to   deepen  and  widen  our  network  of  bilateral  defence

relations  with countries both in and outside the region.  We

will  continue to explore new ways of cooperation to  enhance

the security of Singapore and the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Multilateral Arrangements: MINDEF will strengthen

dialogue,  confidence-building and cooperation with countries

in  the  region and beyond, by promoting multilateral defence

interactions  and  exercises. MINDEF will  also  continue  to

participate  actively in regional multilateral  arrangements,

such  as  the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Five Power Defence

Arrangements,  to enhance peace and stability  in  the  Asia-Pacific region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. UN Missions: MINDEF will support Singapore's role

as  a responsible member of the international community.  The

SAF  will  continue  to participate in  UN  peacekeeping  and

humanitarian   missions  where   we   can   make   a   useful

contribution.  MINDEF will also contribute to the  role  that

Singapore plays in the UN Security Council.



<br><br><i>Total Defence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Total Defence has been a useful framework to deal

with   our  security  challenges  in  a  unified  and   well-coordinated way, through the efforts of Singaporeans in every

sector   of  society.   Total  Defence  becomes  increasingly

important as Singapore prepares to meet a more diverse  range

of threats.  MINDEF will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



continue  to  promote  Total  Defence  through  our  national

education efforts. Singaporeans must always remember that  we

can  never take the peace, stability and prosperity  that  we

now enjoy for granted.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b></div>



<div align="center">MR WONG KAN SENG</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Home Affairs</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Home Team will strengthen its strategy of

continued  vigilance, tough laws, effective  enforcement  and

community  partnership to ensure the safety and  security  of

Singaporeans.



<br><br><i>Enhancing Operational Capability</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Home Team will collaborate with other agencies

to  undertake a fundamental review of our response  plans  to

deal with unconventional threats:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) MHA will implement an electronic emergency information

centre that will deliver up-to-date information to the public

during crises, and emergency preparedness information at

other times;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will strengthen

its capability to respond to chemical and biological agent

attacks. It will reorganise the fire stations and National

Service units to handle these threats. SCDF will develop a

new framework to regulate the storage and movement of

hazardous materials;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Singapore Police Force (SPF) will focus on improving

the three main areas of homeland security, policing, and

public order, and review its other services. The role of

Police NSmen will be reviewed and enhanced. SPF will work

with the private security industry to improve security

awareness and professionalism. It will further augment the

capabilities of its Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office

to counter money laundering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



and  detect  terrorist monies passing  through  our

financial  systems.  SPF  will  also  continue   to

leverage  on  joint  intelligence  and  enforcement

actions  to combat transnational crimes and  global

syndicates; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Internal Security Department (ISD) will remain

vigilant against internal security threats to Singapore.  We

will enhance ISD's capabilities to better deal with the new

threats of terrorism and subversive activities.



<br><br><i>Combating Drug Abuse</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. There will be no let up on our tough stance against

drug  abuse. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will continue

to  take firm measures to prevent new synthetic drugs such as

amphetamine-type  stimulants  from  gaining  a  foothold   in

Singapore. CNB will also work with community organisations to

develop  a  preventive drug education programme  targeted  at

synthetic drug abuse.



<br><br><i>Leveraging on Technology</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. SPF will establish a DNA database to facilitate

crime-solving  and  collaborate  with  industry  partners  to

develop computer forensic capabilities.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Singapore Immigration and Registration (SIR) will

deploy advanced biometric identification and vehicular  X-ray

systems   to   enhance   security   checks   at   immigration

checkpoints. It will also enhance its service to  the  public

by introducing more on-line applications.



<br><br><i>Responding to a Changing Singapore</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. MHA will review laws and practices under its

purview  and  contribute to the effort to  remake  Singapore.

Where feasible, regulatory controls will be relaxed. We  will

engage  the  community  on  licensing  matters,  through  the

establishment of advisory panels. SCDF will also introduce  a

new performance-based



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



fire  code  to  make compliance with fire safety  regulations

simpler and cheaper.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. SPF will engage non-governmental organisations and

voluntary welfare organisations more, especially in the areas

of   dispute   resolution,  family  violence   and   juvenile

delinquency.  It will also draw more on community  resources,

such as the Community Mediation Centres, to resolve non-crime

issues   such  as  disputes  between  neighbours  and   noise

complaints.



<br><br><i>Improving Our Prisons and Rehabilitation Framework</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Our prisons will expand the use of community-based

sentencing  options by introducing Front-End  Home  Detention

for selected offenders. A seamless throughcare rehabilitation

system, to enable drug and criminal offenders to re-integrate

into society more effectively, will be developed. Our prisons

will  also  reach  out to more employers to offer  employment

opportunities to match the skills and abilities of discharged

offenders.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LAW</b></div>



<div align="center">PROF. S. JAYAKUMAR</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Law</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw)'s focus will be to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) strengthen our legal infrastructure and expand the legal services sector;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) formulate a comprehensive legal and policy framework for Intellectual Property (IP) and develop Singapore as a centre for IP; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) optimise our land resource.



<br><br><i>Legal Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. MinLaw will work closely with the Attorney-General's Chambers, Academy of Law, Law Society and NUS Law

Faculty  to  accelerate the growth of the  legal  sector  and

upgrade our legal talent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



pool. Our lawyers must keep up to date on emerging areas such

as   info-communications  technology  (ICT),   biotechnology,

intellectual property (IP) and international trade laws,  and

continually  upgrade their expertise in  key  areas  such  as

corporate finance, banking, aviation and shipping laws.  This

will  support our strategies to make Singapore a hub for high

value-added activities such as ICT and financial services.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will also develop international arbitration and

mediation into a thriving service cluster together  with  the

Singapore  International Arbitration Centre  (SIAC)  and  the

Singapore  Mediation  Centre  (SMC).   MinLaw  will   further

promote  community mediation as a means of  resolving  social

and  relational  disputes.  We will work with  the  Community

Development  Councils to create greater public  awareness  of

community  mediation.   We will also raise  the  professional

standards    of   our   mediators   through   training    and

accreditation, and promote other forms of mediation  such  as

peer mediation in schools and pre-bankruptcy mediation.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Beyond these domestic initiatives, MinLaw will

enhance  our  training infrastructure  to  enable  the  legal

fraternity to share their legal knowledge with lawyers in the

region  and promote the harmonisation of trade and commercial

laws  within ASEAN and the region.  We will also explore  how

we can promote legal services as an export industry.



<br><br><i>Intellectual Property</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MinLaw and the Intellectual Property Office of

Singapore  (IPOS) will work with the Ministry  of  Trade  and

Industry  and  other economic agencies  to  put  in  place  a

legislative and policy framework to develop Singapore  as  an

IP  hub, attractive for companies, IP professionals and other

individuals to congregate, create and exploit IP. MinLaw will

capitalise  on Singapore's excellent legal infrastructure  to

position  ourselves  as  an  international  arbitration   and

mediation centre for IP dispute resolution.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To achieve this, quality IP-related manpower is

critical.  MinLaw will set up an IP Academy for the  training

of  IP-related skills, to increase the sophistication of  our

businesses  in IP management and to complement  the  academic

curriculum in the Universities.



<br><br><i>Land Branch</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. MinLaw and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) will

review our land policies, including lease expiry and renewal,

lease upgrading and the land charging and pricing policy,  in

order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



optimise and intensify land use, promote the orderly  renewal

of  Singapore's physical landscape and support  the  national

economic restructuring effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will also review regulations and practices to

ensure   effective  management  of  state  land.    We   will

streamline  our  land acquisition practices  so  that  public

projects  can  be  carried  out smoothly.   Land  legislation

including  the  Land Titles (Strata) Act and the  Residential

Property  Act will also be reviewed to meet new and  evolving

needs  and  improve the management of strata  development  in

Singapore.
