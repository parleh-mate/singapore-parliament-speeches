FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your permission to take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:&nbsp;</B> Yes.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, advance estimates indicate that Singapore's GDP declined by 0.5% in the third quarter. On an annualised quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy has now registered two consecutive periods of negative growth, which is the common definition of a technical recession. Given the deteriorating external climate and the volatile financial situation globally, growth will&nbsp;remain weak for some quarters to come.&nbsp; MTI has revised the GDP forecast for 2008 to around 3%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economy is small, open and closely linked to the global economy.&nbsp; We cannot escape the impact of the global financial crisis and economic <p align=left>Column: 312<p>slowdown. First, although Singapore banks have largely escaped the direct impact of the crisis because they have less exposure to distressed assets, the segments of our financial services sector which are more sensitive to market sentiments have been affected. This includes trading of stocks, shares and bonds, foreign exchange trading activities, as well as fund management activities. The local stock-market index has dropped by over 40% from the peak in October 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the financial market turmoil has clearly affected sentiments in the property market. The number of residential property sales transactions has fallen sharply. In the third quarter of 2008, the private property price index also registered the first quarter-on-quarter decline since the first quarter of 2004. This will weigh down on related real estate activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the financial crisis has weakened consumer demand around the world, and this has affected our manufacturing and domestic exports. In the third quarter of 2008, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports fell by 8.5%, with the biggest declines in electronics and pharmaceuticals. Our tourism sector has also been hit. Visitor arrivals fell by about 6% in July and August 2008. Also, growth in retail sales has slowed down. Excluding motor vehicles, real retail sales grew by just 2.5% in the first eight months of 2008, compared to 8% last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked about the impact on our SMEs and the construction industry. This slowdown has inevitably affected SMEs in the manufacturing sector who are facing lower demand and profits. SMEs in certain services clusters, such as retail and food and beverage, may also be facing slower growth. Other services segments are holding up so far, and overall growth in the services sector <p align=left>Column: 313<p>is estimated to be 6.1% in the third quarter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of financing, our banks are fundamentally sound. They do not face liquidity issues as serious as in other countries and still have credit available for lending. Nevertheless, banks have become more cautious. Default rates, while still stable, are also likely to increase. We will, however, ensure that credit is available to our SMEs through the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS), Loan Insurance Scheme (LIS) and Microloan Programmes.&nbsp; For instance, the amount of outstanding LEFS and LIS loans to SMEs for the first eight months of 2008 has grown by more than 55% over the same period last year. We will ensure that our SMEs will be able to continue financing their business operations and investing in capability upgrading with these loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the construction sector is slightly different. The sector is estimated to grow by 7.8% in the third quarter of this year, compared to 18% in the first half of this year.&nbsp; Part of this growth moderation is because of supply-side constraints. A shortage of contractors, a tight labour market for skilled engineers and project managers, and longer waiting times for construction equipment have all resulted in construction firms stretching out their projects over a longer period of time. Weaker market sentiments have also dampened the outlook for private sector construction demand, and the stream of new private projects to be launched has slowed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, total public sector construction demand is projected to remain robust; at between $10.5 billion and $13.5 billion for 2008 as the Government proceeds with several essential infrastructural projects such as the MRT Downtown Line and the Marina <p align=left>Column: 314<p>Coastal Expressway. As such, strong public sector construction demand is expected to provide some cushion and offset the possible decline in private sector construction demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to&nbsp;the employment outlook. Employment growth in the first half of 2008 has thus far been healthy, with 144,600 jobs added. However, there are signs that the economic slowdown has started to impact the labour market. Employers are exercising more caution in their hiring, with most employers preferring to keep their headcount steady. Given that the economic weakness is expected to continue into 2009, moderation in employment growth is expected in the second half of 2008 and through to 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowing economy and more cautious hirings have contributed to an increase in the overall unemployment rate&nbsp; from 2% in March 2008 to 2.3% in June 2008.&nbsp; The unemployment rate for 2008 as a whole is likely to be higher than the 2.1% in 2007, which was a record low in 10 years. Retrenchments so far have stayed at roughly the same level as in previous quarters, although this could go up if the economic weakness persists. The Government will continue to keep a close watch on the labour market situation and already has various measures in place to assist retrenched workers and the unemployed. For instance, the WDA has implemented the Place and Train programme which assists job seekers in securing jobs in industries such as construction, marine, aerospace and healthcare sectors before they undergo relevant training. In 2007, the WDA also helped 68,000 workers to upgrade and certify their skills through its Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006 and 2007, EDB client companies committed $27.5 billion worth of investments, which will create a total <p align=left>Column: 315<p>of 55,400 new jobs when fully operationalised. Additional job opportunities will also be created in SMEs that support these companies. Many of these investments will continue to come on-stream in the year ahead.&nbsp; For example, in this quarter alone, companies such as Halliburton and&nbsp;Soitec will all be launching their operations officially in Singapore. While we cannot expect overall job creation to be as robust as the past two years, these investments coming on-stream now will create new job opportunities that will benefit Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the impact of the evolving global financial crisis and slowdown has already started to flow through to the Singapore economy and our companies.&nbsp; We must be prepared for weaker growth in the next few quarters, and possibly longer depending on when the global economy recovers.&nbsp; However, Singapore's financial and economic fundamentals remain sound.&nbsp; This will enable us to weather the current storm, and emerge strong and resilient.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):&nbsp;</B> I would like to thank the Minister for the very comprehensive response.&nbsp; Two questions for the Minister: I would like to find out how will the increase in borrowing cost affect especially the small businessmen, and in what way would MTI come up with programmes to help them better address the increase in the borrowing cost; and c <I>aveat emptor</I> may be the principle that we are trying to encourage among the consumers, but is enough being done to educate our consumers on basic financial skills and knowledge for the principle to operate effectively?&nbsp; In fact, for that matter, what are the current programmes that are being run in schools, if any, to educate children and youths with financial planning?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as the financial crisis works itself through the system, particularly through the real <p align=left>Column: 316<p>economy,&nbsp;we must be braced for slower growth.&nbsp; One of the consequences of this whole deleveraging exercise is that credit will become scarcer and cost of credit will become higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that our companies have to face.&nbsp; This is the reality of the situation.&nbsp; On our part, the Government will continue to assist our companies, particularly the SMEs, as I have explained in my response just now, through the LEFS, LIS and the Microloan scheme.&nbsp; As I explained, the take-up rate is, in fact, now&nbsp;55% higher than previous years. So, already the mechanism is working.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second question of consumer education, this is an on-going exercise.&nbsp; I think there are several agencies involved to make the effort to explain and educate Singaporeans at all levels, including in the schools, on consumer conservatism and to purchase things that they really can afford.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> &nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;two follow-up questions.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, in view of the weakening economic condition and the slowdown in&nbsp;growth, whether&nbsp;the Government would be considering restoring some of the public construction projects that it had earlier on announced that&nbsp;it would be delaying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question: could the Minister also give us an update on the inflation situation&nbsp;&ndash; what is the expected inflation rate for this year?&nbsp; And in view of the weakening job situation as well, what is the expected inflation next year?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained just now in my response, so far the construction sector is holding up well.&nbsp; In fact, we do face some supply constraints.&nbsp; At this juncture, I do not think it will be very useful for the Government to add to these supply constraints and pressures by increasing our public sector projects.&nbsp; But this is <p align=left>Column: 317<p>something that we are watching very carefully, particularly the Ministry of National Development.&nbsp; And as I have explained in my response, we have several public sector projects which we have deferred previously and, of course, if the situation is right and there is some capacity for us to inject these projects into the market, I am sure the Ministry of National Development will do so.&nbsp; But it is a question of timing.&nbsp; If we do so now, I think it will just exacerbate the supply constraints and, in fact, the tender prices will continue to be very high.&nbsp; But at the same time, if the demand drops from the private sector, the Government is in a position to inject some of these projects back into the pipeline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is on inflation.&nbsp; Inflation for Singapore has peaked and we are now seeing the inflation numbers going down.&nbsp; But I must caution that&nbsp;inflation will continue to be sticky for the next few months because some of these costs have a certain amount of lag.&nbsp; Going into next year, over the next 15 months, both MAS and MTI are confident that our inflation numbers will revert back to the more normal 2%-3% that we had seen in previous years.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah):&nbsp;</B> Sir, the Minister mentioned earlier on that pump-priming&nbsp;is probably one of those measures that we probably took as public spending to boost the economy towards recovery.&nbsp; Given that there are many foreign workers in Singapore as well as some foreign companies, are we confident that this kind of measures will not lead to money flowing out of the country into foreign companies and foreign nationals, and help more to boost the local economy and domestic companies?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:&nbsp;</B>I think we are acutely aware of the impact of any of the <p align=left>Column: 318<p>so-called pump-priming measures that we may undertake later on, to make sure that there is proper flow-through to the local economy.&nbsp; We will look at the multiplier effects and make sure that whatever injection we put into the economy does not just flow out because of import content or foreign workers content.&nbsp; So, it is something that we have to analyse carefully.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:SINGAPORE'S  RESERVES AND INVESTMENTS--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

3.&nbsp; <B>Ms Ellen Lee</B> asked the Minister for Finance in light of the recent spate of events in the financial sector, whether the financial position of our national reserves and investments, and monies invested by our various Government-linked companies and related organisations have been affected and, if so, by how much.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) (for the Minister for Finance):</B>&nbsp; Sir, Ms Ellen Lee is understandably concerned by the intensification of the global financial crisis, and wanted to know how it had impacted our reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment climate has indeed been challenging.&nbsp; Since the start of the year, the key global indices are down, for both equities and bonds.&nbsp; As at last Friday, 17th October,&nbsp;the MSCI World (Equities) was down 40% for the year.&nbsp; As we discussed in this House less than two months ago, market volatility, coupled with slower global economic growth, have hurt most financial assets globally. The investments that constitute our reserves have inevitably been affected, like those of other global investors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the nature of investments that there will be market cycles, although the volatility this time is much more severe.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 319<p>However, we can ride through these cycles of upturns and downturns.&nbsp; I mentioned the reasons when the same question was last raised in this House.&nbsp; Let me reiterate them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our reserves are invested with a long-term horizon.&nbsp; This avoids the need for our investment agencies to sell in panic in a market downturn.&nbsp; In fact, it puts them in a position to invest in good quality assets at prices that are attractive from a long-term perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our investments are well diversified across a wide range of assets and currencies, which has helped to mitigate risks to the overall portfolio.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have emphasised sound governance and proper risk management procedures in investments by GIC and Temasek.&nbsp;</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, Mdm Cynthia Phua, Dr Lily Neo and Mr Inderjit Singh asked about the effects of the recent financial turmoil on banks and insurance companies in Singapore and the impact on Singaporeans.&nbsp; Let me explain the impact of the developments on financial institutions in Singapore, the actions that MAS has taken, and why Singapore is well placed to weather the uncertainties ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US is reeling from the bursting of a credit bubble.&nbsp; Much of the credit found its way into home loans.&nbsp; Some of these loans were made to borrowers without properly checking if they could afford to repay.&nbsp; These loans were securitised; the papers were widely distributed and heavily leveraged.&nbsp; When the housing market turned and house prices fell sharply, many borrowers could not repay their home loans.&nbsp; This has resulted in losses for US and European financial institutions holding mortgage loans and securities backed by those loans.&nbsp; This triggered a process of deleveraging in the housing and credit markets that started in the middle of last year, and is continuing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 323<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation in Singapore is different.&nbsp; We do not have the problems that the US banks are facing.&nbsp; Our banks have been responsible in their lending practices.&nbsp; Banks and insurance companies in Singapore do not have large exposures to either US mortgage-related securities or to the institutions that have failed.&nbsp; Nor do we have subprime mortgages that are originated here. The three local banks are very well-capitalised and their asset quality remains strong.&nbsp; Singapore's financial system is sound and stable, and has not been significantly affected so far.&nbsp; Let me elaborate further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS requires the assets of our banks and insurance companies to exceed their liabilities by an appropriate margin, which is set in accordance with MAS' standards.&nbsp; This provides the bank or the insurance company with a buffer to absorb unexpected losses.&nbsp; The riskier the financial institution's assets, the higher will be the safety margin.&nbsp; The quality of our banks' and insurers' assets remains good, and their capital buffers remain strong.&nbsp; Taken together, this means that a bank or insurance company in Singapore will have more than enough assets to pay what it owes to its depositors and policy holders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of foreign banks, MAS maintains high admission standards to determine which institution is permitted to operate in Singapore.&nbsp; Foreign banks, however, maintain significant operations in their home country and internationally, and MAS alone does not determine the solvency of these institutions.&nbsp; MAS, however,&nbsp;keeps in close contact with the foreign bank's home regulator to assure ourselves that the bank continues to meet high standards of solvency and maintain sufficient assets to meet all its liabilities in Singapore and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solvency alone is insufficient, and banks and insurance companies also have to address their liquidity risks.&nbsp; MAS requires both banks and insurers to <p align=left>Column: 324<p>anticipate their cashflow requirements arising from business needs and the claims of depositors and policyholders and to hold sufficient liquid assets to meet these claims.&nbsp; In addition, MAS requires banks to maintain a significant buffer of liquid assets to meet unanticipated claims from depositors.&nbsp; Insurers' asset portfolio typically comprises more liquid assets such as bonds and Government securities which are more easily liquidated to raise cash should the need arise.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Let me now turn to supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS generally adopts a conservative approach to the supervision of financial institutions in Singapore,&nbsp;and this has served us well.&nbsp; MAS monitors the financial positions of regulated financial institutions through regular reports of their assets and liabilities submitted by these institutions.&nbsp; MAS limits the amount that banks here can lend to any single borrower.&nbsp; This ensures that they are not overly exposed if any single borrower defaults.&nbsp; In addition, the Banking Act limits a bank's credit and loan exposure to property development and investment activity to 35% of its total non-bank loan and credit exposures.&nbsp; Most banks here are significantly below this limit.&nbsp; In the last&nbsp;two years, MAS has also required all banks with significant operations here to enhance their risk management system, as part of the transition to Basel II, a more risk sensitive international standard for capital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS has been closely monitoring developments in global financial markets and the impact on Singapore.&nbsp; The interbank markets in the US and Europe have not been functioning properly as banks, concerned about the solvency and liquidity conditions of other banks, have not been willing to lend to&nbsp;one another&nbsp;other.&nbsp; In Singapore, our domestic interbank markets have been relatively calm and have functioned in an orderly manner.&nbsp; Sufficient liquidity was maintained in the banking system.&nbsp; In <p align=left>Column: 325<p>anticipation of tighter lending conditions, MAS had in July expanded its Standing Facility to all MAS Electronic Payment System (MEPS+) participant banks. This provides assurance that banks can readily access central bank liquidity when required. &nbsp;MAS has also reiterated that it stands ready to inject additional liquidity if needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim also asked if there is any evidence of distressed American banks and financial institutions having to sell off their Singapore properties on an urgent basis and the implications on the local property market.&nbsp; The funding pressures that have arisen in the US and Europe do not arise in Singapore domestic market.&nbsp; The Singapore property holdings of US and European banks are small in relation to our market.&nbsp; Moreover, all banks here have a wide range of assets including corporate and consumer loans, substantial holdings of Singapore Government Securities, and other securities and assets which are not related to property.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, to summarise, the crisis in the US and Europe is serious.&nbsp; We have seen some of the largest financial institutions in those countries come under severe solvency and liquidity pressures.&nbsp; AIG, for example, which had huge exposures in the credit derivatives market, experienced losses and had its credit rating downgraded.&nbsp; This triggered liquidity pressures forcing US authorities to provide a loan to prevent AIG from defaulting on its obligations and being pushed into bankruptcy.&nbsp; Banks in the US and Europe have been unwilling to lend to each other.&nbsp; This has prompted the European and the US governments to take extraordinary measures in recent weeks to recapitalise their major banks and guarantee bank borrowings.&nbsp; This has improved confidence in their markets and banking systems.&nbsp; While the situation has <p align=left>Column: 326<p>improved with the announcement of these major initiatives, we are not out of the woods and substantial challenges remain in the international financial system and the global economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the openness of our economy and our role as an international financial centre, we cannot hope to be decoupled from what is happening in the global financial markets.&nbsp; We must, therefore, stay highly vigilant on the channels through which global developments can affect us.&nbsp; MAS has, for some time now, stepped up its surveillance of international developments and is also in close contact with regulators and central banks in other jurisdictions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are anxious about the impact of the US financial turmoil on their savings and insurance policies.&nbsp; I thank MPs for raising these concerns.&nbsp; Let me now address the specific questions posed.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Kiang asked about AIA Singapore's exposure to Lehman Brothers and the US sub-prime market.&nbsp; I am happy to assure him that the exposure is limited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked about the impact of the AIG bailout on insurance companies in Singapore.&nbsp; The bailout of AIG does not directly impact other insurance companies in Singapore besides the AIG related insurance entities here.&nbsp; The bailout, in fact,&nbsp;has given AIG time to address its deteriorating financial position and, with its recent announcement to sell some of its businesses to restore AIG's financial strength, AIG policyholders can be more assured that AIG will be able to meet its obligations to its policyholders.&nbsp; AIG has also announced that it would continue to operate most of its life insurance business in Asia, including Singapore. This has given some assurance to policy holders of the continuity of their policies with the same insurance provider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Banerjee asked if insurance companies can put in place measures to <p align=left>Column: 327<p>educate policy holders and the public at large on the nature of risks involved in different insurance policies, as well as the financial strength and performance of the insurers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Life Insurance Association and General Insurance Association have been working with MoneySENSE, the national financial education programme, to conduct free public talks and publish consumer guides on different types of insurance policies, such as participating policies, investment-linked policies, health policies, and motor policies.&nbsp; These guides are available on the MoneySENSE and the two associations' websites.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also various avenues to obtain financial information on an insurance company.&nbsp; MAS publishes on its website the annual statutory returns of insurers containing information on the type of investments and solvency positions of individual insurers.&nbsp; In addition, some insurers publish financial information on their corporate websites and/or in their annual reports.&nbsp; MAS also requires insurers to provide their participating life insurance policyholders information on the investment strategy and broad investment mix of the participating fund as well as the performance of the fund on a regular basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo and&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked what safeguards are in place to protect policy owners and depositors if an insurance company or a bank should fail.&nbsp; Let me reiterate that the most important safeguards are what I have just outlined earlier, ie, high admission standards, standards of solvency and liquidity and rigorous supervision, as well as&nbsp;the functioning and orderly interbank market.&nbsp; Our focus has been, and must continue to be, on preventing problems in the first place.&nbsp; However, in the worst case scenario that a bank or insurance company fails, policy owners and depositors have higher priority under the law than other unsecured creditors to <p align=left>Column: 328<p>claim against the assets of the insurer or the bank.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">        	      		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The additional line of protection is in the form of the policy owners' protection fund (PPF) and the deposit insurance schemes.&nbsp; The PPF protects 90% of what the insurer is liable to pay to the owners of life policies.&nbsp; The protection is 100% for compulsory insurance policies for motor bodily injury and work injury. As Members would be aware, the Government announced a guarantee on all deposits last Thursday.&nbsp; I will say more later in my Ministerial Statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to assure Members that the confidence that depositors and policyholders have in the stability and soundness of Singapore's financial system, and in the protection and priority they are accorded under the law, is well-placed.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I have two questions.&nbsp; The first is whether any of our local banks has applied for liquidity assistance from MAS. &nbsp;In the light of what is happening right now, MAS has offered&nbsp;its help.

In the last&nbsp;one and a half&nbsp;years, there&nbsp;were a number of en bloc sales.&nbsp; As a result, there&nbsp;are a number of condominium developments&nbsp;and a number of the developers&nbsp;have offered deferred payments. What are the impacts on the financial institutions as well as on the small-time owners and&nbsp;purchasers?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, can the Minister shed some light on the factor of the safety buffer&nbsp;margin on our financial institutions?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, in my response earlier, I referred to the exposure of our banks to the property sector. &nbsp;There is a cap&nbsp;and banks are not allowed to go beyond 35%.&nbsp; In fact, most of our banks stay well below this cap.&nbsp; So the banks&nbsp;and MAS continue to monitor this closely and&nbsp;do a sensitivity test to see what is the impact should the property market decline by different amounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the impact of the en bloc sales and the deferred payments, this is something that will unfold over the next 18 or 24 months. As of now, as I have said, the extent of the banks exposure is well below the cap and the banks are extremely well positioned to deal with the property downturn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua also asked about the safety buffers. I am afraid there is not one single factor to determine the so-called safety factors. This requires a range of perimeters. Suffice to say, the banks in Singapore have a very high capital adequacy ratio. So if&nbsp;we look at banks here and banks overseas, the capital adequacy ratio here is much higher than other countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;we have to look at the business model and how the banks operate. For example, if&nbsp;we look at other countries, many of the banks there depend on the wholesale market for their funding requirements. Here, our local <p align=left>Column: 331<p>banks have a very strong and&nbsp;broad depositor base, and the loan-to-deposit ratio is comparatively low, compared to other banks. So again, that gives them a lot of buffer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if&nbsp;Members have been following the developments in the US,&nbsp;they will find a strange phenomenon&nbsp;that banks with huge depositor base&nbsp;are now considered safer and more stable. In fact, that is the situation here.&nbsp; Our banks are well run and&nbsp;have very strong capital adequacy ratio.&nbsp; The business model that they embark on is&nbsp;more conservative and they have recourse to a very stable depositor base. The interbank market is operating in an orderly manner, unlike in some other countries. So, by and large, our banks are in a very strong position.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Minister in his answer said that AIA's exposure to&nbsp;sub-prime is limited.&nbsp; I would like to know what is the limited amount&nbsp;that he was talking about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also understand that the&nbsp;Insurance Act&nbsp;requires insurance companies to provide a deposit with MAS for each class of insurance&nbsp;business.&nbsp; What is the current market value of deposits from AIA that MAS holds?&nbsp; What is the composition and&nbsp;risk profile of AIA insurance funds?&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the future outlook of the funds to meet future obligations of the policy holders?

So I think the problem lies beyond liquidity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some institutions, it is a solvency problem. Because of the exposure, they are, in fact, insolvent and no amount of liquidity injections is going to save them. For some, it is really a whole deleveraging <p align=left>Column: 333<p>exercise. Credit has been very ample and less then appropriately costed in the past. Going forward, I think it is fair to say that we will not face the same conditions. And corporates and households&nbsp;will have to deal with this new situation where credit will be scarcer and the cost of credit will be higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMEs and companies that operate in Singapore have to take this into consideration. It is not just a question of liquidity or lack of confidence by the banks. I think there is an overall global deleveraging exercise taking place and our companies will have to look at their business model and those that operate on higher levels of leverage&nbsp;or high levels of loans will have to readjust their business models.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of the Government, as I have explained, we are extending help to all the SMEs and this is already&nbsp;borne out by the numbers.&nbsp; Our loans in the LEFS and LIS Schemes have gone up by 55% compared to last year.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> &nbsp; Sir, the problem is two-fold. One is the business and&nbsp;the other,&nbsp;is&nbsp;the financial institutions.

<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mdm Halimah Yacob,&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Siew Kum Hong have asked about the current regime that governs the sale of structured products to investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regulator, the financial institution, as well as the individual investor, all have a part to play in this regime. MAS's approach is one that balances regulation with the responsibility on the part of the institution to ensure that consumers are given a fair deal, and the responsibility on the part of the investor to understand the products he invests in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS regulates the offer and distribution of financial products. Our approach is to require financial institutions and issuers to properly disclose the features and risks of investment products to investors. MAS has put in place the necessary infrastructure to support this approach. There are two key pieces of legislation&nbsp;&ndash; the Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Securities and Futures Act (SFA) governs information disclosure that must accompany any offer of securities to the public. The issuer must include in the prospectus all information that an investor would reasonably need to make a proper assessment of the securities being offered. The issuer and its advisers are responsible for ensuring that the prospectus complies with the law. MAS checks, based on information provided by the issuer and its advisers, that the prospectus discloses the risk and product features, and that there are no false or misleading statements.</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MAS is satisfied, it will register the prospectus.&nbsp; MAS does not judge the merits of the investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is stated on the cover of the prospectus so that investors understand that the securities are not endorsed by MAS.&nbsp; This regime has been applied to structured products from 2004.&nbsp; MAS registered the pro<p align=left>Column: 337<p>spectuses for the Lehman Minibond Programme, DBS High Notes 5 and Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3 LinkEarner Notes as they met the requirements for registration under the SFA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Financial Advisers Act regulates the sale and advisory process for financial products, and sets out the steps to be followed when giving advice on investment products.&nbsp; Unless an investor chooses to opt out of receiving advice, financial institutions (FIs) and their representatives must have a reasonable basis when recommending investments.&nbsp; In doing so, FIs must consider the investment objectives, financial situation and the needs of the investor.&nbsp; In other words, the FI and the financial advisor have to do a risk profiling of the investor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS also expects the board and senior management of FIs to be responsible for ensuring their FIs deliver fair dealing outcomes to consumers, particularly with the needs of retail consumers in mind.&nbsp; MAS has published a set of good practices which FIs are encouraged to follow.&nbsp; For example, customers who are illiterate or not fluent in English should be accompanied by someone who is able to explain what is being presented by the representative.&nbsp; The representative's supervisor should also be present during the sales presentations.&nbsp; FIs are also encouraged to have supervisors review the recommendations made by representatives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investors must also play their part and take responsibility for their own investment decisions.&nbsp; MAS launched the MoneySENSE national financial education programme in 2003 to enhance the financial literacy of consumers.&nbsp; MoneySENSE aims to empower investors to make informed decisions.&nbsp; As investors, we must understand the products we intend to invest in and ask as many questions as <p align=left>Column: 338<p>needed.&nbsp; If we still do not understand the product or its risks sufficiently, we should not invest.&nbsp; Another sound principle is to diversify our investments and not put all our eggs in one basket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current regime is intended to achieve an appropriate balance and to avoid over-regulation or under-regulation.&nbsp; It recognises that investors have different needs and risk appetites, and that a one-size-fits-all rule is not desirable.&nbsp; As a practical matter, there are limits to which a regulator can determine the suitability of each individual class of products for particular types of investors.&nbsp; MAS' approach allows a wider range of investment options for Singaporeans to cater to their diverse needs.&nbsp; Our regulatory framework is in line with those in other major jurisdictions and we believe it is fundamentally sound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Phua and Ms Lee asked about the extent to which Singaporeans have been affected by the Lehman-related products.&nbsp; MAS has released data on the profile of these investors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The total issue size of the Lehman Minibond Programme was S$508 million, of which S$375 million was sold to about 8,000 retail investors through nine distributors.&nbsp; For the Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3 LinkEarner Notes, S$23 million of the total S$28 million notes issued were sold to about 350 investors through six stockbroking firms.&nbsp; Over 80% of the Lehman Minibond Programme and Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3 LinkEarner noteholders invested up to S$50,000, with 28% having bought S$10,000 or less.&nbsp; In the case of DBS High Notes 5, over 1,400 investors bought S$103 million worth of notes.&nbsp; More than half of them invested S$50,000 or less.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that a good number of Singaporeans are affected by the current situation, and the amounts involved are not insignificant.&nbsp; We fully understand that affected investors are very anxious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 339<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What MAS did from the start was to ensure that the FIs and the trustee communicate clearly with the investors and provide timely updates.&nbsp; MAS has been in close touch with the FIs and the trustee.&nbsp; For the Lehman Minibond Programme where Lehman Brothers is the swap counterparty, MAS has reminded HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Ltd, the trustee, that it is to carefully consider all options and to act in the interest of the investors.&nbsp; The trustee is considering various options available, including the possibility of a new counterparty taking over the swaps.&nbsp; If a new counterparty is available, investors will have the opportunity to vote on this option.&nbsp; MAS will also appoint an independent financial adviser to help investors make an informed decision.&nbsp; For DBS High Notes 5, DBS has appointed KPMG as an independent party to ensure a fair and transparent valuation process for determining the final redemption value.&nbsp; For some of these products, investors may be able to realise some residual value.&nbsp; There are others, such as the Merrill Lynch Jubilee Series 3 LinkEarner notes, where investors would not recover any value at all.&nbsp; Affected investors should also bear in mind that the determination of the final payout under some structured notes could take some time, due to the need to dispose of the underlying securities under current market conditions where liquidity is rather low.&nbsp; We should allow the process to take its course, as rushing into a 'fire sale' would not be in the interest of the investors.&nbsp; We expect the trustee to know whether options will be available to noteholders by the end of this week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with complaints by investors, MAS' priority is to ensure that the process is fair.&nbsp; MAS, in consultation with the relevant FIs, identified three well-respected individuals who have been appointed to review the complaints handling and resolution processes of the FIs for these products.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 340<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The role of the independent parties is to determine whether the complaints handling and resolution processes are independent, fair and transparent.&nbsp; The terms of reference spell out what this means.&nbsp; First, each complainant must be given a fair opportunity to state his complaint.&nbsp; The complaint must be assessed by reviewers who are independent of the financial advisory arm of the institution.&nbsp; Second, where there is any evidence of mis-selling, there must be a process to surface this to the attention of the institution's senior management and to MAS.&nbsp; Third, the independent parties are to highlight to the institution's senior management any shortcomings in the FI's processes or in the execution of the process.&nbsp; Such shortcomings must be rectified, failing which MAS must be immediately notified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS has also set a very clear timeline for the FIs to resolve the complaints.&nbsp; The FIs&nbsp;are expected to devote&nbsp;the necessary resources&nbsp;to deal with the complaints.&nbsp; All the FIs have also set up internal review panels which are chaired by their CEOs.&nbsp; The panel is expected to conduct a thorough review of each complaint and decide on a course of action within four weeks.&nbsp; The decision will then be communicated to the customer.&nbsp; MAS is keeping a close watch on the resolution process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If investors are not satisfied with the outcome of the FIs' complaints resolution process, they can have their complaints referred to the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC) for mediation or adjudication.&nbsp; FIDReC provides investors with an affordable and impartial avenue to pursue their claims.&nbsp; The FIDReC adjudicators are all well-respected professionals.&nbsp; The Chairman of FIDReC is Mr Goh Joon Seng, a retired High Court judge.&nbsp; MAS has put in place a fast-track process for referrals to FIDReC.&nbsp; As over <p align=left>Column: 341<p>80% of customers invested less than $50,000 or below, FIDReC is the right avenue for them to pursue their claims.&nbsp; In case of the affected structured notes, the FIs have also consented to FIDReC to hear all deserving cases, even those beyond $50,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew has asked why MAS did not appoint the three independent parties instead of letting the FIs appoint them.&nbsp; MAS has full confidence that the three independent parties will carry out their work objectively.&nbsp; The terms of reference for these independent parties are set out by MAS.&nbsp; They are required to provide MAS with regular updates on the progress of the complaints review and an overall report at the end of the review.&nbsp; The three parties who have been appointed are highly-respected individuals, whose independence I do not think is questioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, MAS has set out a clear three step dispute resolution process for the handling of complaints by investors in the affected structured notes.&nbsp; Any investor who genuinely believes that he has been mis-sold these products should take the following steps.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;he should lodge a complaint with the FI that sold&nbsp;him the product.&nbsp; The FI will arrange for&nbsp;him to be interviewed.&nbsp; Second,&nbsp;he should explain the details of&nbsp;his case fully to the FI to allow it to make a fair assessment of&nbsp;his case. &nbsp;Third, if he is not happy with the proposed resolution by the FI,&nbsp;he can refer the matter to FIDReC for independent mediation or adjudication.&nbsp; This is a serious and impartial process that MAS has put in place.&nbsp; Affected investors should follow these three simple steps to enable a fair resolution of their complaint.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Low and Mr Siew have also asked if MAS will investigate how these products were marketed and sold.&nbsp; MAS has said that <p align=left>Column: 342<p>where there is evidence of regulatory breaches, it will not hesitate to take firm regulatory actions against the FI or the representative.&nbsp; MAS has required the independent parties to highlight potential cases of mis-selling to MAS.&nbsp; A number of possible mis-selling cases have already been raised to MAS' attention.&nbsp; MAS is reviewing these cases.&nbsp; MAS has also confirmed it has been conducting formal inquiries into allegations of breaches of the law, inadequate internal controls by the FIs, or poor sales practices by their representatives.&nbsp; MAS will make an announcement of any actions it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;taking when the inquiries are completed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, there is a range of investors who bought these products.&nbsp; Some are well-educated professionals.&nbsp; Others are sophisticated investors.&nbsp; The group that MAS is most concerned with are the vulnerable customers.&nbsp; MAS is focusing on cases of mis-selling to vulnerable customers and on cases where the products were clearly inappropriate for them given their circumstances.&nbsp; MAS has required the FIs to give priority to these cases.&nbsp; FIs should not take an overly legalistic approach to mis-selling in dealing with these cases.&nbsp; For cases where there are sufficient indications that the product was mis-sold or that it was clearly inappropriate given the investor's profile and circumstances, the FI should take responsibility.&nbsp; Several FIs have assured MAS that they will take full responsibility in such cases and we expect all FIs that have sold these products to take the same approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also bear in mind that the current financial environment is quite unprecedented.&nbsp; Stock markets have fallen sharply globally.&nbsp; Investments across a wide range of products have lost value, some more than others.&nbsp; For example, investors with foreign exchange structured deposits have lost about 25% due to depreciation of certain currencies.&nbsp; Any assessment of whether mis-selling <p align=left>Column: 343<p>occurred has to take into consideration circumstances at the time of the sale and not what we&nbsp;know now.&nbsp; For example, until July this year, Lehman's bonds were rated "A1" and "A" by Moody's and S&amp;P respectively.&nbsp; As a result of the global financial crisis, institutions that many would have considered safe, have failed or needed to be bailed-out, taken-over or re-capitalised by their government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The current crisis has raised the need for MAS to review aspects of our regulatory and supervisory approach. Other countries are also doing so. MAS has announced that it will undertake a review of the marketing and sale of structured products. Some areas of review would include stronger suitability requirements for certain types of products, clearer product labelling and risk rating, and simpler descriptions of the features and risks of products so that they can be more easily understood. However, we need to be careful not to take a step backward by developing overly-prescriptive rules.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But regulation alone is not enough. The industry also has to do more. The board and senior management of FIs must be responsible for ensuring that investors get a fair deal. MAS is looking into how best to implement the Guidelines on Fair Dealing which we had earlier consulted upon. Mr Banerjee has also asked about improving training provided to persons who market structured products. Under the Financial Advisers Act, MAS requires financial adviser representatives to pass the Capital Markets and Financial Advisory Services examinations, which include modules on both rules and regulations, and product knowledge. Further, MAS expects these representatives to undergo continuing education to keep abreast of developments in the industry and acquire new <p align=left>Column: 344<p>skills and knowledge relevant to their activities. As part of its review, MAS will consider how these areas can be strengthened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is also important for investors to make well-informed decisions. Financial education is an ongoing process that requires sustained and collaborative efforts by all&nbsp;stakeholders.&nbsp; MoneySENSE has been collaborating with various partners to deliver financial education to students, working adults and seniors.&nbsp; Recent events have also highlighted the need to further strengthen our financial education efforts. To this end, as part of the MoneySENSE programme, MAS will be looking at ways to enhance investor education on investment products.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Would the Minister agree that selling investment products, which are very risky to retirees using their life savings, is not an act that has taken into account the risk profile of the retiree?&nbsp; How does the MAS ensure compliance with section 27 of the Act by financial institutions?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question&nbsp;is this:&nbsp;the Minister had said that MAS would be investigating those instances of mis-selling.&nbsp; When will these investigations be completed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained just now, our rules and our guidelines do encourage the financial institutions and&nbsp;the financial advisers to undertake a risk profile of the investors when they want to put in their investments.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some of the investors signed the form to say that they do not need the investment advice and they opt out of this risk profiling exercise.&nbsp; And I have explained in my response, even if they have opted out of the process, we are encouraging the FIs to undertake, in this review of the complaints,&nbsp;a risk profile of the vulnerable investors and if the risk profile shows that it is inappropriate for them to undertake or to invest in such products, then the FIs will have to act accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question on when the mis-selling investigations&nbsp;would be completed and also when the review would be completed, here I would like to urge Members to be patient.&nbsp; This involves many cases.&nbsp; MAS is undertaking the investigation and the review, both of individual cases as well as a review of the system at large.&nbsp; For the individual cases, we also need to have enough cases to see whether there is a pattern of either the representative involved or the FI involved so that we can take the appropriate action.&nbsp; So MAS&nbsp;will not act just on individual cases. &nbsp;As they complete the investigation,&nbsp;I think it is better for us to take an overall view of the situation.&nbsp; So can I urge Members to be patient?&nbsp; MAS is doing all that&nbsp;is necessary to make sure that every complaint is adequately dealt with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have explained, the three-step process &ndash; send in your complaint, and&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 346<p>within&nbsp;two weeks the FI will have to respond to you;

Essentially, as the MD of MAS explained last week, it means people of a certain age, the&nbsp;elderly, the retirees.&nbsp; Secondly, their proficiency in English.&nbsp; If they do not understand the product in English, if they are illiterate, then, of course,&nbsp;they may not be able to read the documents given to them.&nbsp; Thirdly, if they are investing for the first time compared to somebody who has been regularly investing, then this may be the first exposure, they do not know what they are in for.&nbsp; Fourthly, as a proportion of their funds, if they have limited funds and it is inappropriate for them, based on their risk profile, to invest in these funds and they invest a very high percentage of their funds, then obviously they have been wrongly advised.&nbsp; So these are&nbsp;some of the parameters that we put down as investors that&nbsp;we will have to pay special attention to as we work ourselves up the spectrum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure Members every complaint will be dealt with and the FIs&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 347<p>would deal with them&nbsp;impartially.&nbsp; But, at the same time, we do realise that they all fall into different categories and priority should be given to the more vulnerable groups so that we can address their concerns earlier.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the fact that we take the disclosure-based, tick-the-box-based approach to selling these products contributed to this problem as opposed to a principle-based approach where the financial institution takes a more holistic view of the issues, including the position that the customer finds itself?&nbsp; In the UK, for example,&nbsp;it is taking a more principle-based approach,&nbsp;and it is very difficult to buy these off high street banks.&nbsp; So, perhaps, in our review, do we consider whether we should move towards principle-based rather than disclosure-based, tick-the-box approach?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> &nbsp; It is not useful to categorise the approach into different boxes.&nbsp; I think, basically, as I explained at the beginning of my reply, our regime requires everybody to play their role.&nbsp; First, there is a disclosure element.&nbsp; Second, the FIs must do the correct thing.&nbsp; For example, when they manage the process, they must not have incentive scheme which incentivises the relationship managers to be overly aggressive.&nbsp; Third, the investors must also have&nbsp;a responsibility,&nbsp;not just because it is a principle-based, then they do not have any responsibility.&nbsp; So I think our regime carved out the responsibility for every stakeholder and for it to work, all of us must play our role.&nbsp; Having said that, of course, there&nbsp;is always room to improve on how we can ensure better disclosure and&nbsp;better clarity in the product or the risk classification of the product.&nbsp; On the FIs, having gone through this episode, I think they will know the pitfalls of the different types of selling approaches.&nbsp; And on investors, I think this is a useful episode to remember when the next time they <p align=left>Column: 348<p>approach the banks or when the banks approach them on investing in different higher risk products.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I have three supplementary questions for the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first question comes back to the question of timeline for MAS' investigations.&nbsp; Given that MAS has given the financial institutions&nbsp;four weeks, a timeline of&nbsp;four weeks to review each complaint,&nbsp;I think most consumers in Singapore would also expect MAS to commit to some kind of timeframe, perhaps a question of months.&nbsp; So I hope the Minister can give this House some assurance that there will be a commitment on the timeframe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question, Sir, relates to the Minister's comments on the priority being given to vulnerable investors.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether this means that other investors, who have been subject to mis-selling by the financial institutions, will not receive due recourse because if the focus in the FAA is&nbsp;on&nbsp;appropriate conduct by the FIs, then it does not really matter whether or not the investor is vulnerable or not.&nbsp; The focus should be on mis-selling and not on the status of the investor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my third question is on the manner of disclosure.&nbsp; The Minister has given a very detailed response in terms of how disclosures are captured in the prospectus and how the MAS reviews the prospectus.&nbsp; But, Sir, prospectuses are very complex, huge documents that very few people read.&nbsp; So I would like to ask the Minister whether or not MAS agrees that these kinds of disclosures are not meaningful and do not result in informed&nbsp;consent and also there is a very valid question on those who are not English-educated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my final question is to ask the Minister&nbsp;how would he evaluate the <p align=left>Column: 349<p>performance of MAS as compared to, for example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority which has faced&nbsp;very similar situation,&nbsp;very similar instances of consumers being mis-sold and yet seems to have been much more proactive in managing the situation?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> &nbsp; The reason why I did not give a specific timeframe for MAS to complete its investigations is because we&nbsp;would like to have the full picture and we are also undertaking the review of the processes.&nbsp; But let me assure the House that MAS is treating this issue with the utmost urgency and will expeditiously complete the review.&nbsp; We do not want to be bogged down by this.&nbsp; We have huge challenges and events happening in the global financial markets.&nbsp; We will definitely want to be able to resolve this as expeditiously as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, before Mr Siew put his question, I have already explained that even though we have this category of vulnerable customers, all complaints would be dealt with in the same manner.&nbsp; If there is a mis-selling, whether it is to vulnerable customers or not, they will be taken care of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, on the manner of disclosure, I agree that the prospectus is a very complex document and there are many ways to improve the ways disclosure is done,&nbsp;but I do not think at the same time we should hide behind the fact that it is a complex document.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Members look at any of the documents,&nbsp;I have copies of it here, I can show Members, on the&nbsp;first page, the financial&nbsp;institutions will be very careful, in bold letters, to indicate all the key points.&nbsp; So, even though there are lots of pages&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

Finally, Mr Siew asked about our approach compared to Hong Kong.&nbsp; I would say that, essentially, the approach is the same&nbsp;&ndash; it is&nbsp;a disclosure based.&nbsp; If it is&nbsp;a complaint,&nbsp;the institutions have to deal with the complaint.&nbsp; MAS is not being behind the curve.&nbsp; We have been very much involved.&nbsp; We have been telling the FIs how we expect them to deal with the case, and I think the FIs, to their credit, have also done a lot to make sure the system is working.&nbsp; True, for some FIs and some of the stockbroking firms, they may not have been geared up to handle hundreds of complaints overnight and their response in the early stages may not have been as rapid as we have wished.&nbsp; But I can assure&nbsp;Members that all the processes&nbsp;are now being geared up to deal with these problems.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Mr Low, last question.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> &nbsp; Thank you, Sir.&nbsp; Sir, the Minister's answer sounds like MAS is shouting across a river while watching a fire burning.&nbsp; Can the MAS take a more proactive approach by convening a Committee of Inquiry to deal with the matter directly?&nbsp; Is it fair for the Government to leave the investors, many of whom are retirees who have invested their savings, to deal with individual FIs and simply refer them to FIDReC?&nbsp; I would like to ask whether the Minister is aware that after the amendment to the Securities and Futures Act in October 2005, MAS exempted banks which continuously issue structured notes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;those issued over the counter&nbsp;&ndash; from having to lodge a registered pricing statement with the MAS.&nbsp; So the banks felt that probably these structured notes could be issued without having to go through&nbsp;complex and extensive requirements, but by just disclosure based prospectus.&nbsp; Hence, more structured notes&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 351<p>flooded the market, with the financial advisors selling to the retail investors.&nbsp; Is this not a result of less prudent regulation by the MAS?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Mr Low, are you making a speech or are you asking a question?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang</B>:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I am asking the Minister&nbsp;a question:&nbsp;are the investors in these minibonds today not victims of the Government's decision to liberalise the financial market?&nbsp; The last question I would like to ask the Minister is whether MAS agrees that the products sold by the financial institutions are indeed low risk and safe products to invest.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, what the MAS and Government want to avoid is to politicise this whole issue.&nbsp; Our main concern is to get the process done and to make sure that any investors who have been mis-sold or who have invested inappropriately in these products have due recourse and compensation.&nbsp; That has been&nbsp;our focus.&nbsp; If we were to have a Committee of&nbsp;Inquiry or if we were to take this to&nbsp;the courts, I can assure&nbsp;Members that&nbsp;nothing will move.&nbsp; All financial institutions, everybody, will freeze and take legal defensive actions and then the affected investors will have to wait weeks, if not months, maybe even years, before they can have recourse.&nbsp; I do not think that is the best approach.&nbsp; That of course makes a lot of good headlines.&nbsp; It is grand standing.&nbsp; It scores a lot of political points.&nbsp; But it does not address the issue which is at the nub of this whole episode and, that is, we are concerned about investors being mis-sold, we are concerned about investors who have invested inappropriately, and therefore MAS' actions are all taken to address these two key issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His second question is about disclosure.&nbsp; If the FI puts out a programme of similar structured notes, I think it will <p align=left>Column: 352<p>be very inefficient for them every time they put up the series to have to go through the whole process of putting up the&nbsp;full prospectus.&nbsp; So our rules allow them, if they are putting up a programme of notes, like in the case of Lehman Minibond Series, and they are planning to come up with&nbsp;the Series of 1 to maybe 10 or 12,&nbsp;and these are all similar products,&nbsp;they put up a general disclosure through a prospectus.&nbsp; Then with each new series that they put up, they come up with a pricing statement which explains the risk and the price that they are setting.&nbsp; I think that is a better approach than to say that, every time, you put up one of&nbsp;a series of&nbsp;notes, you have to come up with the whole process of the full prospectus.&nbsp; Finally, these products are not low-risk or safe products.&nbsp; These are explained in the first or second page that these are structured products and it is in bold print that you can lose everything.&nbsp; So MAS has never said that these are risk-free products,&nbsp;low-risk products or safe products.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:FOREIGN WORKER DORMITORIES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:FOREIGN WORKER DORMITORIES:::357--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Yes.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp; Let me start by putting the foreign worker housing issue in context.&nbsp; After a number of years of slow growth, the economy picked up sharply in the past two to three years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The strong economic rebound in turn resulted in a spike in the demand for manpower, therefore more foreign workers had to be allowed in.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we did not do so, business costs and costs of living would have&nbsp;increased even more sharply.&nbsp; These foreign workers were needed to fuel our economic recovery in various sectors&nbsp;&ndash; to support property and infrastructural development, to keep our manufacturing sector competitive against lower cost countries and to support the growth in our services sector.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has adopted a range of measures to address the downstream housing needs of the foreign workers.&nbsp; First of all, we facilitate on-site housing for construction workers.&nbsp; We&nbsp;allow <p align=left>Column: 354<p>industrial premises to be converted into dormitories and we provide permanent dormitories for these workers.&nbsp; Foreign workers can also rent residential premises for their housing needs.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In identifying sites for dormitory development, we consider a number of factors, for example, whether the sites are in health and safety buffer zones and therefore could pose health risks to workers, whether there is adequate infrastructure to support the development, and so on.&nbsp; As far as possible, worker dormitories are located further away from residential areas.&nbsp; There are currently 25 dormitory developments providing close to 100,000 dormitory bed spaces.&nbsp; These are in various parts of Singapore, and many are located within or at the fringe of industrial estates.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has released 11 sites since February 2007 that can provide up to 65,000 new beds by 2010.&nbsp; As these sites are in more remote areas, time is needed to put in the necessary infrastructure such as sewerage, roads, and so on.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding these efforts, there is still a shortage of housing for foreign workers in view of the exceptional increase in numbers in the last few years.&nbsp; The number of foreign workers, excluding domestic maids, increased by 55,000 in 2006.&nbsp; But, in 2007, the number increased by another 102,000, in other words,&nbsp;double or almost double the increase between&nbsp;2006 and 2007.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So even as more permanent dormitories come on-stream, temporary dormitories are needed urgently to meet the current shortage of worker housing.&nbsp; We will build temporary dormitories on vacant state lands.&nbsp; We will also convert vacant state properties, vacant buildings,&nbsp;into temporary dormitories.&nbsp; The Serangoon Gardens Technical School site is one such site for a temporary dormitory <p align=left>Column: 355<p>development.&nbsp; These state lands and state properties are generally nearer to residential areas and will cause some inconvenience to residents living nearby.&nbsp; However, they are meant as temporary measures only, until permanent dormitories are available.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all dormitory developments, whether temporary or permanent, we will seek to ensure that the disamenities are kept to a minimum.&nbsp; We have asked the dormitory operators to provide amenities within their premises to reduce the need for workers to access facilities outside.&nbsp; They are also required to put in place a set of security measures, including access control, visitor registration and perimeter fences.&nbsp; All these measures will serve to curb unauthorised access into the dormitories and deter illegal activities.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MND will also work with the relevant Advisor and grassroots leaders on specific measures to reduce disamenities, with reference to the specific characteristics of the site.&nbsp; For instance, at Serangoon Gardens, we will construct a new access road to serve the temporary dormitory so that the development is completely segregated from the local traffic network of the estate.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in land scarce Singapore, it is a challenge to house an increasing foreign worker population. I do not believe that it is a good idea to completely isolate the foreign workers from the local population.&nbsp; In practice, even if we wanted to do that, there is a limit to such a policy.&nbsp; As Singapore becomes more built up, it is likely that these developments will be closer to residential areas over time.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, even if we locate these facilities within industrial areas, many new industrial estates are already located in closer proximity to residential areas.&nbsp; If the demand for worker housing grows <p align=left>Column: 356<p>over time, we will build permanent dormitories to a higher density in order to optimise land.&nbsp; These will not be "townships" on the same scale as HDB towns.&nbsp; But these&nbsp;will be more intensive developments which&nbsp;will be equipped with more comprehensive amenities to make them self-sufficient.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, this issue cannot be resolved by Government alone. We must each play our part. While the Government will seek to ensure adequate housing facilities and step up enforcement against any crime and littering problems, employers must take on the responsibility of planning for adequate housing for their employees and educating them on the social norms here.&nbsp; The community can also help by working closely with the police and dormitory operators on joint projects to further enhance the safety and security of their neighbourhoods.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the final analysis, the larger issue is about a choice that we have to make collectively as a nation.&nbsp; Since the early days of industrialisation, we have relied on foreign workers to augment the workforce and also to take up jobs that Singaporeans avoid.&nbsp; However, there is a social cost to be paid.&nbsp; In land scarce Singapore, they will have to share our common space and facilities.&nbsp; The presence of a large group of people, with different habits and customs, and unfamiliar with our social norms, can create suspicion and anxiety.&nbsp; So we have to make a choice.&nbsp; If we want more foreign workers, we must collectively make adjustments to resolve the social problems.&nbsp; If we want fewer foreign workers, we must be prepared for slower growth, higher costs, lower service level, and delays in the completion of our flats, roads and rail lines.&nbsp; We have decided to go for growth because it is good for Singapore and for Singaporeans.&nbsp; But, going forward, we may need to review if a new balance is needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 357<p><p>3.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the global economy is slowing and the international financial system is still under significant stress.&nbsp; Amidst the current turmoil, the financial system in Singapore remains stable and robust.&nbsp; Financial institutions in Singapore continue to be sound and to operate normally.&nbsp; Our local banks and finance companies are financially strong and well-capitalised.&nbsp; They meet capital adequacy ratios in excess of MAS' requirements, which are in turn higher than international standards.&nbsp; Foreign banks in Singapore are subject to strict licensing and admission criteria, and are required to maintain assets against their liabilities by an appropriate margin.&nbsp; Our financial markets remain stable and calm, and financial institutions in Singapore do not face funding difficulties in the interbank market.&nbsp; Public confidence remains high, and we have not had to take extraordinary measures.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Why the need for Government guarantee</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Government has carefully assessed the international situation and its implications for Singapore.&nbsp; The actions taken by <p align=left>Column: 358<p>governments and central banks over the last few weeks in Europe and the US to recapitalise banks, purchase bad assets and guarantee bank borrowings in the wholesale markets have improved confidence in the international financial system, even though there remain significant problems and stresses.&nbsp; However, the announcement in the past week by a few jurisdictions in our region of blanket government guarantees on all bank deposits could potentially have a more direct impact on Singapore.&nbsp; Last Thursday, the Singapore Government announced a guarantee on deposits of individuals and non-bank customers with banks, finance companies and merchant banks in Singapore until 31st December 2010.&nbsp; We have decided that such a guarantee is necessary for the following reasons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the guarantee ensures a level international playing field for banks in Singapore.&nbsp; The recent announcements in the region of blanket government guarantees on deposits set off a dynamic that puts pressure on other jurisdictions to respond or else, risk disadvantaging and potentially weakening their own financial institutions and financial sectors.&nbsp; If Singapore had not introduced a similar guarantee, there was a real risk that depositors would have shifted some of their deposits out of Singapore banks to banks in other jurisdictions which guarantee deposits.&nbsp; This would have weakened financial institutions here.&nbsp; The Government has therefore taken a precautionary step to pre-empt and avert any such possibility.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the guarantee bolsters the confidence that the public has in Singapore's financial system. It provides certainty to Singaporeans during such challenging and uncertain times in the international environment, notwithstanding that in Singapore, our institutions are fundamentally sound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 359<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, financial services are an important pillar of Singapore's economy, accounting for 12% of GDP and 5% of Singapore's employment.&nbsp; Beyond this substantial direct contribution to GDP, the financial sector plays a critical role in intermediating credit for the economy, and in providing other critical financial services to companies and depositors in Singapore.&nbsp; It is, therefore, important for the whole economy that the financial sector continues to function normally.&nbsp; Should financial institutions in Singapore become less competitive or credit becomes less readily available, it would hinder the financing of economic activities and raise the borrowing costs of businesses.&nbsp; This would aggravate the already challenging economic situation and thereby adversely affect our growth and jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, this financial crisis is not confined to any country or region, but is a global one.&nbsp; Singapore's guarantee of deposits demonstrates our confidence in the soundness of our financial system, and helps contribute towards restoring confidence in the international financial system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now explain why we are confident that guarantee is sufficient and prudent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Why the guarantee is sufficient and prudent</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deposits of individuals and non-bank customers with banks, finance companies and merchant banks in Singapore amount to about S$700 billion.&nbsp; In view of MAS' stringent regulations and close supervision of financial institutions in Singapore, their strong capital and asset positions, and the potential support that foreign institutions in Singapore can avail themselves of where necessary under the government guarantees provided by their home jurisdictions, MAS and the Ministry of Finance have assessed that the backing of S$150 billion of the <p align=left>Column: 360<p>Government's reserves provided to the guarantee would be more than sufficient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; First, the likelihood of a bank failure as a result of problems in Singapore is small as our banking system is sound and closely supervised, even though it is possible that problems elsewhere will affect a bank's operations in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, even if a bank were to fail here, it should still have substantial assets to meet its liabilities to depositors.&nbsp; Under the law, non-bank depositors enjoy priority in being paid, ahead of other unsecured creditors.&nbsp; This makes it more likely that the failed institution will have sufficient assets to pay out to depositors.&nbsp; Hence, for the guarantee to be called, two things have to happen: a bank has to fail, and at the same time its assets must be worth so little that there is not even enough to repay its depositors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even then the draw on the guarantee should only be for the shortfall, which should be a fraction of the deposits outstanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, we have calculated that the S$150 billion backing is an amount that will be ample to meet any eventuality except the most remote.&nbsp; S$150 billion does not in any way reflect an estimate of the likely draw over the two years of the guarantee.&nbsp; On the contrary, we expect the actual draw to be small or, if we are fortunate, even zero.&nbsp; Instead, the S$150 billion reflects the Government's confidence in the banking system, and its intention to give all depositors that same confidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is in a good financial position to provide this guarantee because of the fiscal discipline of successive governments.&nbsp; We are in a strong fiscal position, having accumulated surpluses during good times for exigencies just like this.&nbsp; In contemplating making this guarantee, the Government has carefully assessed that it is well within our means, does not impair our ability to meet all <p align=left>Column: 361<p>government obligations and will not jeopardise Singapore's financial standing.&nbsp; We are using our reserves to back this guarantee.&nbsp; In the event of a payout, past reserves may be drawn upon.&nbsp; The Minister for Finance has sought and obtained the President's concurrence to issue the guarantee, as required by the Constitution because of the President's role in safeguarding our reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also make clear that this guarantee does not impact at all on MAS' ability to defend the Singapore dollar. That is because even after giving this guarantee, the Government still has ample means, with the full backing of our not insignificant reserves, to safeguard our currency if this should prove necessary.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent financial institutions abusing the guarantee by expanding aggressively and taking on excessive risks, MAS has emphasised to financial institutions in Singapore the need to remain prudent in this current operating environment.&nbsp; MAS will continue to supervise financial institutions in Singapore closely.&nbsp; It will take the necessary actions to see to it that they operate in a sound manner, and do not put at risk the stability of our financial system or the Government's reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that Singapore's financial system remains sound and we are well-placed to meet the challenges facing us.&nbsp; This global crisis is unprecedented, and requires Singapore to respond effectively, decisively but also prudently.&nbsp; The provision of a Government guarantee on deposits is a necessary temporary measure to protect the interests of Singaporeans and the economy, which are in turn dependent on a strong and competitive financial sector.&nbsp; The risk of drawing on the guarantee and potential impact on Singapore's reserves are low.&nbsp; This is a measured, precautionary <p align=left>Column: 362<p>action that will help us to weather the global economic slowdown and the ongoing financial crisis in international financial markets.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Sir, I am glad that the Government reacted by giving the guarantee on Thursday. I would have thought that, given that we have a strong financial system and fundamentals in Singapore, we should have been the first to react in Asia, maybe after Europe. We could have been the first to react in the world. Now that we have done so, that is good news for us. I am asking that MAS be proactive and to act fast in case any changes come. We should be among the first to react to give confidence to everyone.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were cases of people who were withdrawing their money and&nbsp;keeping it below their pillows&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I was told by my classmate&nbsp;&ndash; and I think that is unhealthy. Had we guaranteed it earlier, I think we could have avoided this position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second question:&nbsp;by guaranteeing the deposits for all banks in Singapore, how will MAS proactively monitor foreign banks which may take deposits from Singapore that are guaranteed by the Government, and then use these deposits outside Singapore to maybe invest and help&nbsp;defend their own foreign subsidiaries and home-based companies?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> First of all&nbsp;&ndash; as I emphasised in my statement&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the financial system in Singapore is robust, stable and orderly, so there was really no reason for us to react. It does not mean that if the US and the EU put in various measures to support the system that we must do likewise. There was no necessity for us to do so.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when&nbsp;governments in our region decided to have blanket guarantees in deposits, first in Australia and&nbsp;then in Hong Kong, I think it sparks off a dynamic <p align=left>Column: 363<p>and creates a potential problem for us, as I have explained in my statement. For example, Australia guarantees foreign branches of Australian banks. So the deposits of a branch of an Australian bank in Singapore are guaranteed by the Australian government. In Hong Kong's case, they guaranteed the branches of foreign banks situated in Hong Kong. So the deposits of DBS branch in Hong Kong are guaranteed.&nbsp;Once that is done, I think it sets off a different situation and it sets off a dynamic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike your grassroots leaders who put money under the pillow, my grassroots leaders tell me that even though they want to continue supporting Singapore banks&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they know that Singapore banks are well regulated and very strong&nbsp;&ndash; but if a branch of an Australian bank offers guaranteed deposits for their Singapore dollar deposits, then there is a lot of pressure for them to be on the safe side. Nothing about being disloyal but just to be on the safe side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if you are a DBS customer and you can shift your deposit to a branch in Hong Kong and that is guaranteed, you are still supporting a Singapore bank but now your deposit is booked in Hong Kong. So we do not have to wait for all these things to happen. I think we know that such a blanket guarantee by surrounding countries would spark off a dynamic and, therefore, we had to act.&nbsp;On the same day that we acted, Malaysia also provided similar guarantees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other countries have assessed their needs and have done so differently. For example, Indonesia has increased the level of deposits that is being guaranteed, not unlimited but they increase the ceiling. So I think this is a development which caused us to have to move. If we had moved earlier, we may have been the one setting off the dynamic and I do not think that is the right thing for us to do, because our <p align=left>Column: 364<p>banks are stable and there is really no reason for us to be guaranteeing all deposits in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is that branches of foreign banks in Singapore may be tempted to increase the level of deposits here, remit their money overseas, and invest or support their parent operations overseas. This is something that we are very mindful of and MAS, in its supervision of the various banks, especially branches of foreign banks in Singapore, will insist that as the deposits increase in</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Could we have&nbsp;kept it to the local banks?&nbsp; Two questions arise from that.&nbsp; Firstly, with regard to foreign banks, Mr Inderjit has&nbsp;talked about&nbsp;foreign banks financing their operations out.&nbsp; But there&nbsp;is also the issue of foreign banks not being regulated <I>per se</I> in terms of the parent bank being more susceptible to collapse, for example, and therefore we do have to guarantee using Singaporeans' savings, Singaporeans' money, for these foreign banks.&nbsp; And, secondly, we are also looking at foreign investors.&nbsp; We are also using Singapore's reserves and Singapore's money to support these foreign investors and&nbsp; depositors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister please explain?&nbsp; Did we consider the alternative of&nbsp;keeping the guarantee just to local banks, protect the interest of our local banks and to strengthen them at this time?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And, therefore, we felt it necessary that this is not just a question of protecting deposits.&nbsp; This is a much larger agenda.&nbsp; The larger agenda is that we want to make sure&nbsp;the finanical system in Singapore continues to contribute to our growth and our employment, and therefore that would involve the foreign banks;

When Singapore became independent, we had very little in reserves. It is only through hard work, consistently prudent fiscal policies, and successive strategies that grew the economy over the years, that we have arrived at where we are today. We lived within our means, and painstakingly built up the country&rsquo;s reserves. Even so, although our reserves are now a sizeable asset for Singapore, they remain smaller in value than what many other countries have in financial reserves and natural resources combined.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a strategic asset, our reserves serve two purposes. First, they provide a key defence for Singapore at times of crisis. We cannot know in advance what crises will hit us, whether caused by economic happenings in the world, natural calamities, pandemics or events that impact our security. But they are not hypothetical rainy day scenarios, as we can see in today&rsquo;s global financial crisis. The use of our reserves to back the Government guarantee on deposits that we issued last week underscores how important the reserves are in responding credibly and confidently&nbsp;during a crisis. Our reserves provide confidence in Singapore, contribute to a stable Singapore dollar and keep our economy resilient at times of difficulty.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second purpose our reserves serve is to&nbsp;provide for a continual stream of income that can be spent or invested for the benefit of current as well as future generations. The Government is allowed to spend part of the investment returns on our reserves.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 371<p><p align="justify"><I>Conserving our reserves</I></p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For both of these purposes&nbsp;&ndash; to ensure that we will have ample reserves to deal with major crises, and to provide a stream of income that lasts across generations&nbsp;&ndash; it is essential that we have a sound framework of governance and policies for the management and use of the reserves. That is the only way we can keep and enhance the value of this strategic asset over the long term. There are a few pillars to this governance framework:</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Singapore's Constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an Elected President to safeguard the reserves and prevent a profligate government from squandering them. Specifically, the President has the right to veto the Government Budget if it is likely to draw on past reserves. The President's concurrence is also necessary for the appointment of the Board members and CEOs of MAS, GIC and Temasek, to ensure that these are persons of ability and integrity.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, also within these Constitutional provisions, the Government can spend only from the investment returns on our reserves and not the principal sum. Further, the spending rule is designed to allow only part of the investment returns (50% of Net Investment Income, or NII) to be tapped for the Budget, thereby providing for the remaining part to augment the reserves so that its value grows over time.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Singapore's financial reserves are managed by professional investment teams, who aim to deliver sustainable returns over the long term. GIC and Temasek are both well-respected internationally for their strong, proven track records. They are rigorous in their allocation of assets and in managing risks, and have achieved consistently creditable <p align=left>Column: 372<p>returns. The MAS has also managed our official foreign reserves prudently, while fulfilling its other central bank functions of promoting monetary and financial stability.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this framework for conserving and growing our reserves cannot stand on its own, without being matched by the principles that underpin our budgetary policies. We spend prudently and live within the constraints of the revenues that we are able to raise, so as to avoid running persistent budget deficits. This is why our total Government spending is only 15% of GDP currently, much lower than most other countries. It is this approach of fiscal prudence that has allowed us to keep the Government lean and our taxes low, so that both individuals and enterprises have incentives to work hard, grow their incomes and strengthen our economy.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"><I>Preparing for future spending needs</I></p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must keep to these fundamental principles as we introduce new rules to allow the Government to draw on more of the investment returns from our reserves for spending.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, the Government has only been allowed to spend from the interest and dividend income, and not the capital gains. This was conservative, but it has served our fiscal needs adequately while allowing us to build up our reserves. In the 1990s, after the Constitutional amendments were passed in 1991, the economy was growing rapidly, we were running large surpluses, and the investment income comprising only interest and dividends was more than adequate to meet fiscal needs. The Government moved to lock up 50% of the NII in 2001 to ensure that we continue to grow our reserves and not spend all the income on current fiscal needs. By this judicious use of NII to supplement the <p align=left>Column: 373<p>Budget, and prioritising between competing budgetary needs, our budget has stayed neutral on average, with surpluses and deficits balancing out over the years that followed the 2001 amendment.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the current NII spending rule will not be adequate as we go forward, as we expect our expenditures to increase, even over the next&nbsp;five years. Over the long term, Government spending will need to rise significantly. We have to find new revenue sources, and the spending rule, if revised judiciously, can provide more to help meet these demands.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three main reasons for this increase in budgetary needs. I will spell them out, as they are the essential reasons why we are amending the Constitutional framework now to draw on more investment returns.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is that we must do more to invest in capabilities and stay competitive, so that we grow our economy.&nbsp;We want to invest in the best quality education for our young and continual learning for&nbsp;all Singaporean adults. That is why we are moving towards more single-session primary schools and improving pupil-teacher ratios across the school system. We are also increasing university participation rates for Singaporeans and building two more ITE colleges similar to the ITE College East at Simei, which is already regarded as best-in-class internationally.&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also substantially scaling up our investments in training and continuous learning, to retain the competitiveness of our workforce. MOM and WDA have embarked on the National Continuing Education&nbsp;and Training (CET) 10-year Masterplan this year, which will significantly increase the annual CET institutional capacity from 50,000 training <p align=left>Column: 374<p>places today to 250,000 training places in three to five years&rsquo; time.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to invest in R&amp;D, to build new capabilities that will drive our future growth. Singapore is already emerging as a key R&amp;D player in areas linked to industries with high growth potential globally, such as the biomedical sciences, interactive and digital media, and environmental and water technologies. We have also deepened our incentives for making innovation pervasive across the economy, among both big and small enterprises.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together, these increased investments in our human capital, knowledge and innovation will benefit all Singaporeans. They will sharpen our capabilities, enabling us to move up the value chain and keep our relevance in a much more competitive global economy.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes are the other key consideration in competitiveness. At the same time that we invest more, we have to maintain a competitive tax environment for both companies and individuals. With tax rates coming down internationally, we have to be ready to make further cuts in direct taxes, where required, to maintain Singapore&rsquo;s attractiveness as a key business hub in Asia.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason why our budgetary needs will grow is that we are doing more to make Singapore a top quality home. In the years to come, we will enhance almost every facet of the city, both in the city centre and across our neighbourhoods, to make this a highly liveable and inclusive home.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are transforming Marina Bay into a place with something to appeal to everyone&nbsp;&ndash; business, entertainment, the arts, unique gardens, the F1 at night and even the peace of a reservoir&nbsp;&ndash; all rolled into one. We are also enhancing our green lungs and blue waterways across the <p align=left>Column: 375<p>island. And we are rejuvenating our housing estates, to create a first-class and inclusive living environment that enhances the assets of Singaporeans.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are investing in new commercial and lifestyle hubs outside the city centre, such as the Jurong Lake District, Kallang Riverside and Paya Lebar Central, which will spread out the economic activity around the island and bring jobs and attractions closer to homes.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transport&nbsp;alone will be a substantial expense, in fact, the largest increase in our Budget. To achieve our vision of a people-centred land transport system, we will have to ramp up our spending on land transport over the next&nbsp;10 to 15 years.&nbsp; In fact, transport spending will rise from 0.8% of GDP last year to about 2.9% of GDP in five years&rsquo; time and stay at that level over the next five years. 0.8% of GDP going up to 2.9% of GDP&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;an increase of more than two percentage points of GDP. And this is even with significant borrowings by LTA to smooth out expenditures over the long term. These investments would allow us by 2020 to double our rail network, increasing both capacity and coverage, expand our network of expressways, and achieve better integration between road and rail to improve both public and private transport.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third reason why we will have to spend more in the future is the need for higher social expenditures in an ageing society and one facing growing income gaps. Our population is getting older, and this will create new demands on resources to look after our elderly. We will have to spend more on healthcare, both in the Government&rsquo;s budget and nationally, including private expenditures. Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has highlighted the challenge on several occasions. We are already spending an additional $2.4 billion over the next&nbsp;five years to recruit and train manpower, build new hospital <p align=left>Column: 376<p>capacity and upgrade existing facilities, and enhance the capabilities of community hospitals and nursing homes. These are&nbsp;new expenditures.&nbsp;We will also invest more in preventive care. Altogether, in constant dollar terms, we expect to more than double the Government&rsquo;s healthcare expenditures over the next decade. But we must be careful in how we design the framework for financing healthcare to keep us from going the way of countries that have seen their budgets balloon uncontrollably, placing increasing burden on taxpayers.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of healthcare, we will introduce new measures to push ahead on the &lsquo;active ageing&rsquo; agenda, and will continue retrofitting parts of Singapore such as providing more barrier-free access for elderly pedestrians and bus and train commuters.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further social challenge is the widening income gap that is being seen in every city plugged into the global economy. This is a challenge that will be with us for some years to come. We have already embarked on major new programmes to help lower-income Singaporeans and strengthen our social compact. We have implemented the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, and the Government and NTUC are both expanding schemes to help low-income workers upgrade their skills. We have also augmented a broad range of social assistance and community support programmes to help the most vulnerable members of our society, including developing capabilities to help dysfunctional families and ensure that their children are not disadvantaged.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also redoubling our efforts to counter low fertility rates, through the recently introduced Marriage and Parenthood package. In addition to increasing the financial and workplace support for parents, improvements in the quality of kindergartens and childcare will <p align=left>Column: 377<p>help to give every child a head start towards fulfilling his or her potential.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all these reasons that I have mentioned&nbsp;&ndash; the increased investments needed to keep Singapore competitive and a highly liveable city, the need to keep taxes competitive, as well as the need to cater to an older population and to keep our social compact&nbsp;intact&nbsp;&ndash; we need additional resources. We expect a significant increase in our expenditures amounting to about 3% of GDP each year in five years&rsquo; time (FY2012), and moving slightly higher thereafter. This is on top of the 15% of GDP that we are currently spending. So we expect to get to about 18% of GDP in five years' time. These are large increases, although our total expenditures would still remain amongst the lowest internationally (as a percentage of GDP).</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are key programmes for expenditures that we are able to anticipate and prepare for. But besides these programmes, we must always provide a buffer in our fiscal planning to deal with unexpected adverse events or downturns, and give the Government the flexibility to implement countercyclical measures when necessary. This year, for example, we are spending $3.3 billion on measures that are helping low-income and other Singaporeans cope with the increased cost of living. With the likelihood of a weaker economy next year, we will also consider how we can help Singaporeans and our businesses through these difficult times and position the economy for a robust recovery.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify"><I>The new fiscal framework</I></p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government therefore needs a larger budget in the future, but we will retain our basic principles of sound fiscal management. We have a systematic <p align=left>Column: 378<p>framework in place to ensure prudent spending amongst all agencies, and we will keep improving it. Under the block budgeting framework, Ministries have to ensure that their budgets do not grow faster than our resources can support, and must prioritise and reallocate funds so that they live within their means. New requests for funding are prioritised and evaluated by the Ministry of Finance, and all major development projects have to be approved by the Developmental Planning Committee. We also conduct reviews during and after each project to ensure that the outcomes are met, and that taxpayer monies are spent effectively and efficiently.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even with tight budgetary practices in place, we face the fundamental need of having to spend and invest more in the future. We will need more revenues to meet this need. This is why PM stated in 2006, during the Debate on the President&rsquo;s Address, that we had to make two key revisions to the structure of our fiscal revenues. The first was the GST increase of 2% which we made in 2007. This contributes about 0.8% of GDP per year to our revenues, and has allowed us to proceed with important initiatives such as Workfare, as well as to begin ramping up our expenditures on healthcare and continuous education and training. The second revision that PM indicated the Government would have to make was a new framework for spending the investment returns from our reserves that should take into account capital gains, thereby enabling us to tap on more of the returns to finance our growing spending needs.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both these changes, the GST increase and the revisions to the rules for spending investment returns, are necessary parts of our new fiscal structure. They will allow us to meet Singapore&rsquo;s future needs with confidence.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 379<p><p><I>New framework for spending from investment returns</I></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill therefore seeks to revise the rules for spending from investment returns to allow us to tap on more of these returns for the Budget but on a basis that is sustainable over the long term. The new framework retains the 50% cap on spending from investment returns. But the spending rules will be based on a new and broader definition of investment returns, with the following key features:&nbsp;(1) total returns, including capital gains; (2) long-term expected returns, instead of year-to-year actual returns; and (3) real returns, rather than nominal returns, so that we preserve the purchasing power of our reserves. I will set out each of the changes in turn.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"><i>Total returns</i></p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capital gains and losses are part and parcel of investment outcomes. This is true not just for investments in equities, but for interest-yielding bond instruments where the value of the investment goes up and down as interest rates move. In changing the definition of investment income to include capital gains, and not just interest and dividend income, we are adopting the right basis for determining how our reserves have grown.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, a Government spending rule based only on interest and dividends could lead to bias toward investments that generate income rather than capital gains. This will be inconsistent with our objective of maintaining a diversified investment portfolio aimed at achieving long-term returns. GIC, for example, has in fact substantially diversified its investments over the last 30 years, and even over the last&nbsp;five years, with significant allocations to various asset classes such as public equity, private equity and real estate. The new rules will be consistent with a strategy of asset allocation that is focused on maximising <p align=left>Column: 380<p>total returns, including capital gains,&nbsp;over the long term.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"><i>Expected long-term returns</i></p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second change is to move towards the concept of expected long-term returns.&nbsp; As we have discussed in this House before, capital gains are inherently volatile. Take a look, for instance, at the MSCI World Index over the last 10 years, from 1998 to 2007, which captures the market value of global equities and hence includes capital gains and losses. If annual returns were computed based on the MSCI World index, they would have been negative in three of those years and above 20% in another three. And in 2008 so far, we have seen a 40% drop in the MSCI World Index.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we had to spend based on actual total returns each year, the volatility would severely constrain how we plan the Government Budget and commit ahead for future expenditures. Furthermore, it would be imprudent for the Government to overspend in a bull market, and end up finding itself short of resources in a bear market. Therefore, in studying how to tap on capital gains for the Budget, our key consideration was to determine a smooth stream of returns that can be taken in for spending on a year-to-year basis. We considered two alternatives to achieve this smoothing effect.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first way is to rely on a historical rate of return, based on a suitably long period into the past to smooth out the volatility in returns. This is doable, it is practical, but it is not satisfactory, because past performance in global markets may not be representative of likely future outcomes. Markets can and have gone through extended bullish or bearish periods of as long as 10-15 years, before eventually changing course. Consider if we were standing in 1997, for instance. In the 10 years before 1997, the average annual nominal return for the <p align=left>Column: 381<p>MSCI World Index was 9%&nbsp;&ndash; a strong and positive result. But in the 10 years following 1997, the figure fell to 5%. So even if we take historical averages over a relatively long period, 10 years, you still find significant changes in course from one phase to another, and lasting over more than one&nbsp;market cycle.</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further problem with using historical returns, computed over a long period, is that it does not take into account the fact that returns from our investments depend on the asset allocation mix, which&nbsp;can change over time. Historical returns can therefore&nbsp;provide a useful reference for future returns, but are often not the same as future returns. They are useful reference, but they are not appropriate as a predictor of future returns.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second approach to smoothing out the volatility of returns is to look at the long-term expected returns on an investment portfolio. This is a forward-looking assessment of the overall returns that we expect over the long term. Actual returns will of course vary from these expected returns each year, sometimes very significantly. This year, for instance, should be a very bad year for most international investors, who would have found it difficult to achieve investment returns that meet their long-term profile of expected returns. But in making projections of expected returns, we are estimating what actual returns in the years ahead will look like when averaged out over the long term.</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In deciding on our framework, we have studied and adapted from good practices in various international funds with endowment characteristics, which are invested for the long term just like our reserves are. The expected returns concept has been practised for several years amongst several endowment funds. For instance, since 2001, the Norwegian <p align=left>Column: 382<p>Government has adopted fiscal guidelines to spend the expected real return on its Government Pension Fund&nbsp;&ndash; Global,&nbsp;a fund that holds its petroleum revenues and fiscal surpluses.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Yale has a spending framework based on long-term expected returns, which it has been running successfully for many years.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While each of these endowments has its own unique characteristics and spending rules, the principles are essentially similar.&nbsp; All of them seek to achieve some budgeting stability, while seeking to achieve inter-generational equity&nbsp;&ndash; in other words, to balance the spending needs of current and future generations, whether of citizens or student cohorts as in the case of university endowments.&nbsp; This is similar to what we are trying to achieve with our spending rules.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We have decided to adopt the second approach for estimating total returns&nbsp;without being&nbsp;saddled with volatility -&nbsp;which is&nbsp;to determine the returns for spending based on long-term expected returns on the reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expected returns will be based on an investment horizon of 20 years, which is roughly equal to three investment cycles in global markets.&nbsp; This is consistent with the investment strategies that our investment companies have adopted, which is to invest for the long term and ride out the market cycles.&nbsp; This ability to ride out the cycles is a key advantage that well-run endowment funds have in their investments, which sets them apart from many other financial investors.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; However, an assessment of expected returns cannot be made in one year and then left unchanged for 20 years.&nbsp; If we do that, chances will increase that the actual returns will deviate from the estimate of expected returns, even when the actual returns are averaged over the <p align=left>Column: 383<p>20 years.&nbsp; Much in the world can change in between, which could mean a very different outlook for the years ahead.&nbsp; This is why we have to keep refreshing our estimates of long-term expected returns, taking in all the information and assessments available at the time, including the actual historical performance of the markets.&nbsp; As I will explain later, we will do this annually&nbsp;- so that we make a thorough assessment each year of the long-term expected returns on our investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should clarify that in looking at long-term expected returns, the distinction between realised and unrealised capital gains and losses does not arise.&nbsp; The long-term expected return depends on how the market value of our reserves will grow over the specified time horizon.&nbsp; This does not depend on when the assets are sold,&nbsp;in other words,&nbsp;when the gains and losses are realised.&nbsp; The distinction between realised and unrealised capital gains would be relevant only if we were spending based on actual returns each year rather than long-term expected returns.&nbsp; As I have explained earlier, however, spending on the basis of actual returns would subject the Budget to too much volatility.&nbsp; Furthermore, if the spending rule was based only on realised capital gains, there could be incentive to sell assets to make capital gains available for spending, even if it means doing so at an inopportune time.&nbsp; We should therefore keep our investments focused on maximising long-term value, and spend on the basis of total returns expected over the investment horizon.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There are further technical rules that we will&nbsp;apply to avoid volatility of returns available for spending.&nbsp; The market value of the asset base itself goes up and down depending on the state of the market&nbsp;(the asset base as distinct from the expected returns that we hope to earn on our reserves).&nbsp; The estimated rate of returns is applied on the asset base in order to <p align=left>Column: 384<p>derive&nbsp;the sum of money that we call Net Investment Returns.&nbsp; But this asset base itself moves up and down in line with the market.&nbsp; So we have to smooth that as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ensure that the asset base, which is what the long-term expected rate of return would be applied to in order to derive the investment returns for spending, is also smoothed and not heavily influenced by market cycles. This too will ensure that governments do not overspend during boom years and underspend when the markets are down.&nbsp; We will follow established methodologies.&nbsp; Yale University, for example, applies its expected rate of return to a smoothed asset base, which takes into account past market values of the asset base but gives greater emphasis to those in more recent years.&nbsp; The Government will adopt this concept of smoothing, the details of which will be agreed with the President.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Real returns</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third key feature of the framework is that we will spend based on real returns.&nbsp; This is unlike the current framework, where spending is based on nominal dividend and interest income.&nbsp; Our spending rules must ensure that we continue to maintain the international purchasing power of our reserves.&nbsp; Otherwise, in a scenario of sustained high inflation globally, even if we were to earn decent investment returns, our past reserves would be gradually eroded in real terms.&nbsp; From 1998 to 2007, for instance, the MSCI World Index returned an average nominal return of 5.4%.&nbsp; Over the same period, global inflation in US dollar terms was about 4%, and would have wiped&nbsp;off almost 75% of these&nbsp;returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is before taking into account the large negative real returns on the&nbsp;MSCI&nbsp;Index in 2008 thus far.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new framework will therefore allow the Government&nbsp;to spend only out of real returns, that is, returns adjusted <p align=left>Column: 385<p>for the effects of global inflation.&nbsp; This means that, at minimum, past reserves will continue to grow at the same rate as global inflation.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Applying new framework to MAS and GIC</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new framework will be applied to reserves invested by MAS and GIC.&nbsp; The Bill refers to these as "relevant assets", which are also net of the liabilities defined in the Constitution.&nbsp; By netting off these liabilities, such as Government Securities, Treasury Bills and Social Endowment Funds, we are in effect setting aside returns to cover the costs of servicing the liabilities.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We are not applying the new framework&nbsp;of spending on the basis of&nbsp;long-term expected returns to Temasek Holdings.&nbsp; We have studied this carefully, and the Government&rsquo;s assessment is that it is prudent to retain Temasek Holdings on the existing framework.&nbsp; We have decided to do so for two reasons.&nbsp; The first reflects the nature of Temasek's investment strategy, which involves taking concentrated stakes in companies, including direct investments.&nbsp; Like other such investors, this strategy entails higher risks, with the expectation of higher returns&nbsp;- and it has indeed yielded higher returns historically for Temasek than seen for traditional global portfolio investors.&nbsp; However, this approach makes it more difficult for us to project a long-term expected&nbsp;rate of return on Temasek's portfolio&nbsp;to a reasonable degree of certainty.&nbsp; It is unlike the case for global portfolios like that of GIC's, which are spread widely across the public markets, and for which there are established methodologies for projecting expected returns. &nbsp;There are benchmarks, there are peers and there are ways of projecting expected returns with reasonable confidence.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 386<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that Temasek's investment strategy is still evolving, having begun a major effort to diversify its investments geographically as well as&nbsp;sectorally in 2002.&nbsp; Temasek today operates very differently from the way it was operating six years ago, and its strategy will continue to evolve in response to the investment climate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will therefore be prudent to leave Temasek out of the new framework, although we will review this again after some years, once Temasek's diversification strategy is more settled.&nbsp; However, we will continue to draw on Temasek's actual investment returns each year in the meantime, as the Government is already allowed under the current NII framework to tap on 50% of the dividends from Temasek. &nbsp; In&nbsp;so doing, we already tap on part of Temasek's capital gains for spending&nbsp;under the existing framework,&nbsp;because Temasek declares&nbsp;dividends based on its net profit, which takes into account the realised capital gains and losses from its investments.&nbsp; This will remain the case.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Summary: Government to spend up to 50% of Net Investment Returns</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, we will retain the 50% cap on the amount of returns that can be taken out for spending.&nbsp; This is in addition to setting aside the full inflation component of our returns in past reserves.&nbsp; In this way, the real returns on investments will be shared between the current Budget and past reserves.&nbsp; This allows the past reserves to grow in real terms, and thereby provide for a growing economy in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarise, the Government will spend up to 50% of our Net Investment Returns (NIR).&nbsp; NIR is&nbsp;the sum of: (1) the long-term expected real rate of return on the reserves invested by GIC and MAS, and (2) the NII on the remaining assets, comprising primarily Temasek for which there will be no change.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 387<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This framework strikes the right balance between the needs of current and future generations of Singaporeans.&nbsp; It would allow us to take in more for spending, but not so much as to prevent our reserves from growing in line with the economy and providing for future generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Presidential safeguards</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me finally return to the issue of governance procedures.&nbsp; The new framework will require an important change to the budgeting process each year, so as to operationalise the concept of long-term expected returns and ensure that the Presidential safeguards on our reserves are maintained.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The projection of the expected long-term real rates of return is not a mechanical process, but one that involves both professional expertise on the part of our investment agencies and sound judgment.&nbsp; We have therefore designed a systematic and robust process by which the Government determines the NIR each year for spending, and by which the Elected President can perform his role as custodian of our reserves.&nbsp; I will bring the House briefly through the sequence of events that will take place each year.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the start of each financial year, the Government will propose the expected long-term real rates of returns for GIC and MAS for the President's agreement.&nbsp; In order to do so, the Government will ask the Boards of the GIC and MAS&nbsp;to provide and certify estimates of the long-term expected rates of return on the assets they manage.&nbsp; These Boards would evaluate the future outlook on their portfolios, taking all factors into consideration&nbsp;&ndash; including the overall investment environment, bottom-up assessments for each asset class and peer comparisons of expected returns.&nbsp; They <p align=left>Column: 388<p>would take into account historical rates of return, which provide a useful check for what is realistic going forward.&nbsp; Although the measure of expected returns is fundamentally forward-looking, the projections cannot completely ignore historical performance.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will propose the long-term expected real rates of return to the President, taking reference from the rates certified by the respective Boards.&nbsp; The President will consult with the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) before deciding on whether to agree with the Government's proposal.&nbsp; If the President disagrees with the proposal, the average historical real rate of return over the previous 20 years would be used.&nbsp; I have explained earlier why it is not ideal to use historical rates in the first instance.&nbsp; However, the 20-year historical rate of return provides a neutral and pragmatic basis for resolving any dispute between the President and the Government, and avoids paralysing the government of the day.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the President has agreed with the Government on the expected long-term real rates of return that are to be applied, the subsequent processes are fundamentally similar to the current approach.&nbsp; After the close of the financial year, the Minister for Finance will still certify to the President the amount of NIR that the Government has actually taken into the Budget, within the caps specified in the Constitution.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dispute resolution mechanism that I spoke about&nbsp;&ndash; the 20-year historical rule&nbsp;&ndash; as well as other details and working arrangements to implement the new framework, will be stated in a set of Principles to be agreed upon by the Government and the President.&nbsp; The Principles will be tabled to Parliament for information after the Bill is passed and gazetted.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 389<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President and the Council of Presidential Advisers have been briefed on the framework proposed by this Constitution Amendment Bill, and have deliberated the issues.&nbsp; The President is satisfied that the new framework is a sustainable one that will continue to preserve and grow the past reserves, and will be in Singapore's interests.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Deletion of reference to EDB Act in Article 144(3)</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to present a further amendment to the Constitution, which is not related to the proposal to implement the new&nbsp;NIR framework that I have just described.&nbsp; Article 144(3), which governs guarantees and loans raised by the Government, currently makes reference to the EDB Act.&nbsp; This House had earlier updated the EDB Act to remove the provisions for Government guarantee on EDB's bonds and debentures.&nbsp; Consequent to that amendment, the reference to the EDB Act in Article 144(3) will be deleted.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the changes we are putting into place in the new NIR framework will not deviate from the fundamental principles that we have adopted towards our reserves.&nbsp; We will maintain and grow our reserves, so that they serve both as a strategic buffer to tide us through unforeseen crises or emergencies, and generate returns for spending on a sustainable basis.&nbsp; The new rules are a fair and equitable basis for sharing the benefits of the reserves between present and future generations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new NIR framework will contribute to strengthening the Government's revenues so that we can position Singapore to meet the challenges of the future with confidence.&nbsp; The GST increase in 2007, which contributes an additional 0.8% of GDP each year, together with the additional revenues made available from <p align=left>Column: 390<p>NIR which we currently expect to be slightly above 2% of GDP each year, will allow us to press ahead with our expenditure plans, which should&nbsp;require&nbsp;additional resources of 3% of GDP within the next five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may repeat this, the GST increase has yielded 0.8% of GDP extra. The NIR amendments today are expected to yield slightly more than 2% of GDP extra and this will help us to fund our growing expenditures which we estimate at about 3% of GDP extra within&nbsp;five years. They will allow us to upgrade our economy, strengthen our society, and make Singapore amongst the most vibrant and liveable cities in Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The funds made available through the revised rules for spending from investment returns will be channelled mainly towards building up Singapore's capabilities and infrastructure through education and R&amp;D, and the major programmes to expand our transport infrastructure and rejuvenate&nbsp;our city.&nbsp; These investments will position Singapore for the next stage of growth, and ensure that we continue to attract investors, create jobs and open up opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will&nbsp;emerge from this crisis with confidence and can look forward to more years of good growth that&nbsp;will be for the better of all Singaporeans, now and in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.33 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister mentioned in his speech that the Prime Minister, for the first time in a long time in 2006, spoke of the need to finance increasing spending by tapping on to the reserves. We never talked about this in the past.&nbsp;During the 2007 Budget debate, we had a debate <p align=left>Column: 391<p>about using more of our reserves to fund Government spending and not burden Singaporeans with higher and higher GST to fund high Government spending. In 2007, the Minister for Finance agreed to look at different models, including the way universities endowment funds in the US were tapped to fund expenditures. And, of course, finally, we are seeing the constitutional amendment today. I am very happy to see that we have finally decided to make this change. And I am also happy that we did not pull this amendment out, despite the problems that we are seeing in the financial market&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the tough time and the uncertain investment environment ahead&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;we are moving ahead confidently with these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some comments on the amendment process which should, in theory, will allow the Government of the day to unlock a larger portion of the reserves for future budgets, than it is presently allowed to do so under the current definition of Net Investment Income (NII).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Minister highlighted in his speech, in the years ahead, major investments will be needed in various areas of infrastructure, capabilities and greater social needs like funding retirement, Workfare Income Supplements, baby bonuses and many more. It is therefore unrealistic, as the Minister mentioned, to depend on the NII alone as this would mean that we sacrifice some of the much needed investments and expenditures.&nbsp; Or worse still, the Government would have to tax Singaporeans&nbsp;higher and also implement high&nbsp;GST in the coming years to all of these things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these investments need to be planned and built, taking&nbsp;a long-term view of the economy,&nbsp;irrespective of whether the economy is in a period of a slowdown or a period of expansion. Up&nbsp;to now, the <p align=left>Column: 392<p>amount available from out of the national reserves for such spending was largely dependent on the performance of the economy in the previous year. While this provided a useful way to keep spending within our means, it had its disadvantages, as the Minister has mentioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one, in years of slowdown, the available funds shrink, and&nbsp;may therefore lead to the Government not spending on much needed projects and social spending. While in strong years of&nbsp;growth, spending on&nbsp;added available funds leads to an overheating of the economy, as we have discussed during the Budget debate this year. This deepens the troughs and exaggerates the peaks of the economy and is not desirable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another disadvantage&nbsp;that the Minister has pointed out is that it may encourage the Government to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;greater financial risk for short-term investments just to reap higher returns so that the government of the day can meet higher spending needs. So the investment patterns may change just to suit the short-term needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, spending on social and welfare needs should in fact increase in periods of economic hardship.&nbsp;In the past,&nbsp;this spending was&nbsp;dependent on the performance of the economy and if we do that, the spending&nbsp;actually decreases when actually we should be increasing spending in difficult times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;note that the Government's willingness to undertake this amendment comes after many years of an almost allergic reaction to any suggestion made to touch the&nbsp;reserves for any Government spendings. And I still remember, in this House, how Dr Wang Kai Yuen made&nbsp;a suggestion and was told that this is not meant for the past, not meant for the present, but is meant&nbsp;only for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 393<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Singaporeans increasingly facing the cost crunch of the global downturn, and the need to invest in structural improvements in Singapore and its economy, this expansion of the Government's ability to tap on the reserves is, therefore, timely&nbsp;to&nbsp;help us align the economy to meet the needs of the future and to convince the present generation of Singaporeans that some part of what we have prudently accumulated will be used for their benefit, as opposed to just being stored&nbsp;for the benefit of some unspecified future generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's current proposal based on the long-term expected total returns, including capital gains, in principle, would allow long-term planning of spending and avoid knee-jerk reactions. It would also give the government of the day confidence that its plans for capacity building can be funded, even in periods of slowdown. So this is a very good move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a general guide, one indication of whether this Bill meets its objective is to see whether, in any given year, and irrespective of the performance of the economy, it would increase the absolute amount that the Government is able to draw from the reserves when compared to the amount the Government is able to draw using the present formula for the&nbsp;Net Investment Income. If it does that, then this Bill will have achieved the flexibility we wanted to give the Government by this amendment.&nbsp; I therefore ask the Minister if he can confirm&nbsp;that this is the case if he applies the&nbsp;Net Investment Returns formula for past performance of the reserves as opposed to the NII. Had we done that, would we have more money to spend?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to&nbsp;turn now to some&nbsp;queries that I have on the mechanics of the proposed amendment.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 394<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill makes amendments to Article 142 of the Constitution. Broadly speaking, Article 142 allows Net Investment Income to be pushed into the past reserves, except for the portions certified by the Minister. Hence, only the portion that is carved out in this manner would be available for current spending. The amendments also&nbsp;tweak the formula for what is carved out in&nbsp;Article 142(1A) and it&nbsp;sets out a formula of the long-term real&nbsp;returns of NIR, as we have heard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first query is on the term&nbsp;"long term". Can the Minister please tell us what it means in the context of the amendment? We hear about a 20-year horizon&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;is there a consensus on this? Can the Minister clarify on the process of aggregating the long-term expected returns?&nbsp; He mentioned that boards of GIC and MAS will determine the number and that the Minister will present this to the President. Will the Minister be aggregating this before presenting to the President? Can the Minister share with the House the consultation process that was undertaken to determine what "long term" means and who was consulted in this process?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second query relates to the&nbsp;ability of the President's office to assess the advice of the Minister, as required under Article 142(1A)(a), on the long-term real rates of return expected to be earned on the&nbsp;assets that are being measured. This, of course, is a very serious duty as it concerns the amount that is being carved out from the past reserves; what we&nbsp;wanted to protect for a very long time.&nbsp;Can the Minister please elaborate what measures are in place to assist the President's&nbsp;office&nbsp;to evaluate this, including&nbsp;the information that will be supplied to the President for this? In particular, is the President able to call on relevant expertise to assist him, and do we also need to&nbsp;provide a budget for the President's office&nbsp;to put in place the required expertise to make the assessment? Will the President have to rely on <p align=left>Column: 395<p>the Government's experts for assistance in this? If so, how&nbsp;will we ensure that the President gets advice and assistance that is independent as well as competent?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third question is on&nbsp;dealing with a deadlock. Can the Minister elaborate on how a deadlock or disagreement between the President and the Government about what the long term real rate of return is expected on the&nbsp;assets that are being measured will be handled? How will&nbsp;this be&nbsp;resolved? Will there be a structured process&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the Minister&nbsp;briefly mentioned there will be&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;or will we see a&nbsp;prolonged disagreement period&nbsp;that could stifle&nbsp;Government spending? So a fast structured process will help us avoid such a deadlock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A concern I have is that long-term forecasts can be generally positive, and hence the amount carved out from the reserves for present consumption can be optimistically high, even in periods of a few years of negative growth. The problem that I foresee is that it may be some years before the government of the day is forced to recognise&nbsp;its optimistic forecast that may&nbsp;be unwarranted. By that time, we could have significantly overspent beyond our means. Is there a trigger point where the Minister must go back to the President with a revised set of numbers, say, when the projected long-term real rate of return changes significantly over a short period of time?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, can the President ask for such a review once the numbers have been submitted? The last thing we would want is for&nbsp;the future government to hide behind a long-term forecast in the face of an economic slowdown, especially when&nbsp;poor economic performance is due to structural problems in the economy that may impede the achievement of the long-term rates. So if we have many years of slowdown and we still expect to achieve a long-term rate, that may be not realistic in the long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 396<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related point is that we must remember that the forecasts which&nbsp;are&nbsp;carved out&nbsp;are notional amounts. When we value the appreciation&nbsp;of&nbsp;assets, for example, the assets are not liquidated&nbsp;to give us funds to spend. Instead, the amendment will allow the Government to spend a certain amount based on the underlying value of the reserves. A major problem can arise when the assets are suddenly devalued, for example, in situations like what we are facing today.&nbsp;Is there a trigger for a review in such a situation of what the underlying base value of the reserve will be? The most important thing in determining the long-term return rate is going to be what is that base value. So what is the process to trigger a review of this, in case&nbsp;there is a major change?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth question I have is on why Temasek Holdings is excluded from the amendments? Is this delay in including Temasek in this pool because it needs time to digest&nbsp;the recent investments that have come unstuck? If the reason is bad or underperforming investments, should we not at a global level include Temasek so that we have a handle on how prudent we then need to be to make up for the losses in the other areas?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related point is that the Ministry should be looking at Temasek, GIC and MAS together and then assign them their respective roles, which I am sure the Goverment is doing but it is not so clear. MAS, for example, is probably the entity&nbsp;to perform currency stabilisation and&nbsp;the most liquid GIC could take a long term, slightly more conservative view in its investments, while Temasek shoulders more of the risk. At least that way, with a coordinated strategy, we do not risk overexposure in any one sector of the economy. With Temasek excluded from this amendment, will MOF still retain the oversight needed to coordinate the investments of&nbsp;our national reserves so that there is no over investment by any <p align=left>Column: 397<p>one entity if they are not coordinated?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister please tell us when does he expect Temasek to be included&nbsp;into the competition of the NIR?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a final comment, I wish to highlight the difference between using a nominal rate of return and a long-term real rate of return. In the latter, which is the proposal, inflation would be factored in to give us what is projected as the real available amount. This may even lead to a lower figure than the nominal one which may not be adjusted for inflation. Hence, it will be a more accurate view of what is actually available&nbsp;for us to spend. I think, on the balance, this is a more prudent approach than in the past where inflation was not factored when we used the NII.&nbsp;Can the Minister comment on what the short-term impact will be on the returns available for the Government for spending as a result of the current era of high inflation rates? Will we&nbsp;actually see lower amounts available in the next few years?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on balance, the proposed changes on how our reserves can be tapped for Government spending are necessary and timely. And I look forward to the quick implementation of these changes after the Bill is passed, as I am quite sure we will need to spend more to help Singaporeans as we go through a prolonged period of tough times ahead as a result of the global financial crisis that we are seeing today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak on the Bill.&nbsp; I fully agree with the position of the Minister in his Second Reading speech that "A country's reserves are a key asset in a globalised and uncertain world."&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 398<p>idea of redefining our NII was first raised and mooted by our PM in 2006 to include realised capital gains, well before the global financial crisis we see today.&nbsp; While certainly not a knee-jerk reaction to or a spontaneous remedy for the global financial crisis, it&nbsp;certainly gives comfort to Singaporeans and my residents that the Government has a slew of initiatives and a multi-pronged strategy to keep our economy competitive and our infrastructures modern.&nbsp; Who would have thought that an initiative mooted in 2006 would have been so welcome at its time of launch in 2008?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to raise four points, Sir.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first point relates to the proposed Article 142(1A)(a) of the Constitution which states that "before the start of any financial year, the President acting in his discretion, concurs with the advice of the Minister responsible for finance on the long-term real rates of return which are <I>e</I>xpected to be earned ...".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I searched through the amendments and was unable to find a definition for "long-term" or "expected".&nbsp; I did find a definition for "real rate of return", which refers to adjustment for inflation, deflation, and deduction of expenses in relation to managing the assets.&nbsp; However, this does not give us a definition of "long-term" or "expected".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, my question to the Minister is, and to echo Mr Singh, how does the Ministry for Finance define "long-term" and "expected"?&nbsp; I know the Minister has said "we are estimating what actual returns in the years ahead will look like when averaged out over the long term."&nbsp; And it seems "long term" is over 20 years, a 20-year horizon, and&nbsp;three business cycles.&nbsp; But I ask for a better definition of "expected" and "long term" because the past 11 years have seen unprecedented upheavals in the global economy, starting with the Asian <p align=left>Column: 399<p>economic crisis in 1997;&nbsp;September 11; SARS in 2003, and now the world economic crisis in 2008.&nbsp; With this in mind, I ask the Minister for his clarification on how the projection of "long-term" and "expected" is calculated.&nbsp; And if there is a formula for projection, would the Minister consider adding this in the amendments for the sake of certainty and predictability?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is in relation to the proposed Article 142(1A)(b) of the Constitution which states that the Minister will certify "under his hand to the President the spending limit for that financial year, specifying an amount which shall not be more or shall not exceed 50% ...".&nbsp; My question is: how will the Minister calculate what the amount shall be within the cap of 50%?&nbsp; There is a vast difference&nbsp;&ndash; and I think Members of the House will appreciate&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;between, say, 10% and 45%.&nbsp; Hence, I wish to enquire on the considerations the Minister will bear in mind when deciding which percentage to use up to the maximum of 50%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point is a clarificatory point.&nbsp; I wish to ask: once the President has assented to $X money being spent, has the Minister the discretion or ability to decide how much of that $X will actually be spent in the year, or must he spend the full amount?&nbsp; The reason I ask is the economic outlook could change dramatically in the space of a few months, and I think this point was touched on very eloquently by Mr Singh.&nbsp; Will the Minister be bound to spend the full $X, or can he spend less than the full amount if the global outlook has changed within that year?&nbsp; Must he wait till the following year before he can ask the President for a different, for example, lower amount of money?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fourth point, Sir, relates to what this additional money should be used for.&nbsp; There seems to have been a lot of <p align=left>Column: 400<p>discussion and excitement over the use of this money for social infrastructure.&nbsp; While I am fully in favour of improving our social infrastructure in these capricious times, through worthy programmes like Workfare Improvement Scheme&nbsp;and ComCare, I would urge the Government and the House to remember other areas of infrastructure that are in need of funds.&nbsp; For example, although I notice the Minister for Health has just left the Chamber, healthcare is screaming for funds with our ageing population.&nbsp; There is also the need to invest in R&amp;D and our education infrastructure, so that we can educate our young.&nbsp; Not to mention the need for job retraining and investment in our physical infrastructure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, my last point is to emphasise that it is not only for our social infrastructure that injection of funds is needed.&nbsp; There is also a need to invest in long-term infrastructure development in other areas of this nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Bill principally because it displays how the Government has a multi-pronged strategy to keep our economy competitive and our infrastructure modern.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.51 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join the debate on the Constitutional amendment.&nbsp; The late British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill described a pessimist as someone who sees difficulty in every opportunity, and an optimist as someone who sees opportunity in every difficulty.&nbsp; In the financial world, it is indeed during the times of upheavals that there are plenty of opportunities for the bold and the daring.&nbsp; But regardless whether one is a pessimist or an optimist, there is no denying that we are entering an unchartered territory in the road ahead of us; one filled with lots of uneven and rocky path.&nbsp; How long, how difficult and <p align=left>Column: 401<p>the type of difficulties that we are going to face, no one really knows.&nbsp; I term these as the "unknown unknowns".&nbsp; We are veering towards the abyss with the financial markets around the world setting lower lows on the indices.&nbsp; For sure, lower lows on the&nbsp;indices and stock prices will be the order of the day for some time yet as the US takes some time to deleverage.&nbsp; For the past few weeks, we have seen unprecedented falls in the stock markets unseen since the Great Depression of 1930s.&nbsp; If I may add, with the exception of Minister Mentor, none in this House have actual memories of the Great Depression except those confined to history books.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our latest memory of anything financial and economic hardship as earth shaking as today may be the&nbsp;10-year old Asian Financial Crisis.&nbsp; We rode out of that crisis well, a little shaken but relatively unscathed for most and grew stronger.&nbsp; Sir, I might add that many too shared my belief that Singapore is likely to chart through this unprecedented global financial turmoil.&nbsp; It will take time but we will recover from the pain and bane&nbsp;of this confidence crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at first hesitant to the idea of using more of our returns on our investments.&nbsp; I always believe in the mantra that&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;save, to be safe financially.&nbsp; For a country, I believe even more that it is necessary&nbsp;to accumulate reserves than to spend.&nbsp; This is especially so for an island city-state like Singapore with no natural resources.&nbsp; Our prudent investments and financial discipline put us where we are today in terms of the amount of reserves we have accumulated.&nbsp; The minor scuffle with hedge funds during the Asian Financial Crisis illustrates most succinctly the need to have strong reserves.&nbsp; The reserves give our financial system the stability in the current financial turmoil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 402<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The financial turmoil that is gripping the world is still unfolding.&nbsp; There are, I believe, still a few unknown unknowns in the horizon.&nbsp; The challenge it poses is confounding even the brightest mind in the world.&nbsp; The global financial crisis is adding more complications to Singapore's own problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I reflect on the problems facing Singapore and the future challenges brought on by globalisation and interconnected financial markets and economies, I have a change of mind on the need to amend our Constitution to allow a greater use of the returns on our reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is how I see it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem that falling fertility rate could cause Singapore is already quite well discussed and debated.&nbsp; With an ageing population, Government spending on these areas is likely to increase, if not, in some instances, it already has.&nbsp; For example, our Government had set aside about $8.3 billion since 2006 to strengthen social security.&nbsp; But what is not well debated is that with falling birth rate and an ageing population, our Government's revenue is likely to fall while spending increases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very clear what is before us.&nbsp; With spending escalating and revenue falling, no Government in the world can go on indefinitely.&nbsp; The Government would at some point have to try new ways and means to increase revenue to balance the budget.&nbsp; The struggle before us is whether we allow a greater use of the returns on our investment or the dreaded solution of taxing more from the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we have reduced personal taxes and corporate taxes, lost some tax revenue flows from the abolishment of estate duties, facing the challenges of a greying population, combined with an <p align=left>Column: 403<p>increasing mobile workforce, there will come a time when we need other revenue streams and "lifelines" for the government of the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of crisis or other will be sure to visit us again.&nbsp; The curve ball will be thrown at us again for sure.&nbsp; Happening at a time when all the scenarios I mentioned before will severely reduce our options and our ability to see through strategies that will be vital for Singapore's continued growth.&nbsp; We need the financial resources to fuel us in seeing around the curve!&nbsp; The new framework will address the year-to-year market and return volatilities.&nbsp; This smoothening will lend the Government a steady hand steering towards our long-term objectives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody likes taxes, not especially when the country is holding large amount of reserves.&nbsp; With the passage of the Amendment, hopefully, Sir, our Government may, at the very least,&nbsp;not have to contemplate raising the Goods and Services Tax as often.&nbsp; For this reason, the choice is clear and obvious.&nbsp; And for this reason, I am convinced and I support the move to amend our Constitution to allow greater use of the returns on our investment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a second factor that made me change my mind is our re-distribution of wealth.&nbsp; So far, for many years, our Government has been re-distributing our accumulation of wealth back to the people in the many "ang pows" that we give out annually.&nbsp; So much so, many foreigners see us as a benevolent paternal Government and our own people have grown to expect the handout.&nbsp; In a good year, we give out "ang pows".&nbsp; In a bad year, it comes in the form of "packages".&nbsp; Sir, to this end, it is therefore important that our Government be given the margin to tap on to ensure adequate social spending on our people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me change the tune to one of cautioning possible further use of the <p align=left>Column: 404<p>reserves down the road.&nbsp; It took us many years to invest wisely and saving, calling on our citizens to live on less and having Singaporeans rising to the occasion.&nbsp; For instance, in the past, HDB flats were providing basic lodging with clean water and electricity.&nbsp; We have moved on and spend more to enhance the living standards of our people including nicer landscaping, covered walkways and colourful facades of our flats.&nbsp; Today, we have what my residents call the HDB macam CONDOs!&nbsp; We have the "ang pows" and packages, but be that as it may, let us not abandon our primary policy of enhancing our reserves.&nbsp; Let us keep in place stringent measures to prevent easy passage of future profligate government from Constitutional Amendments that would kill our golden goose.&nbsp; Whether the future government is PAP or otherwise, there is no guarantee that the government of the day would not opt for the soft option of using our reserves rather than to try to accumulate more reserves.&nbsp; I share Mr Inderjit Singh's concerns as to how we can give the President more structured measures and controls to scrutinise the government of the day.&nbsp; We are but trustees of the future generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this, Sir, I support the Amendment.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.59 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Sir, the Workers' Party supports this Amendment.&nbsp; We believe that it is justified to broaden the definition of Net Investment Income to include realised capital gains from the relevant assets.&nbsp; Social spending must go up as our population ages.&nbsp; More social safety nets are required to address wage stagnation for lower-income earners and the higher cost of essentials such as food and electricity.&nbsp; The Bill provides for a cap of 50% of realised capital gains which can <p align=left>Column: 405<p>be used for current spending.&nbsp; This means that at least 50% will still accrete to the reserves and form part of national savings.&nbsp; We are thus not squandering our reserves.&nbsp; How much more will this additional revenue stream&nbsp;yield?&nbsp; The Minister, in his Second Reading speech, mentioned that it is expected to yield the equivalent of about 2% of GDP expenditure, which together with the 0.8% GDP yielded by the GST hike recently should be sufficient to fund the additional expenditure required.&nbsp; Going forward then, will the Minister confirm that there would be little justification for the Government to go back to the people to raise more revenue by further hiking GST or raising Government fees and charges?&nbsp; Will he confirm that the people are already doing their part and there will be no need to burden them further?</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align="center"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, this latest Constitutional Amendment Bill presented in the 43rd year of our nationhood is the 38th since Singapore attained Independence.&nbsp; It relates to the returns derived from the investment of our national reserves.&nbsp; In essence, it seeks to enable the Government to spend more in each year&rsquo;s Budget on its various programmes.&nbsp; It does so by providing that the Government may spend a certain percentage of the total returns from "relevant assets" managed by the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and those assets owned by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), minus certain liabilities.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This alters the formula currently set out under Article 142 of the Constitution, which relates to "Net Investment Income" or NII.&nbsp; Under the current legal framework <p align=left>Column: 406<p>established by Article 142(3), the Government is limited to spending only up to a ceiling of 50% of the NII of each financial year derived from the "past reserves" of Government.&nbsp; The current NII rule affects Government spending by placing a ceiling on what the Government may spend on&nbsp;two components of total investment returns on past reserves, namely, the investment income derived from interest and dividends paid out every year.&nbsp; It does not include other components like capital gains, for example.&nbsp; This Government expenditure limiting rule does not apply to "current reserves" of Government; neither does it extend to the past reserves of statutory boards or Government companies (SBGCs) listed in the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution such as the HDB and Temasek Holdings&nbsp;&ndash; their NII goes to their "current reserves" and may be freely spent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Past reserves" are defined under Article 142(4) as those reserves which the Government does not accumulate during its current term of office.&nbsp; A minimum floor of 50% of the NII of each financial year derived from past government reserves will be ploughed back into the past reserves. This 'grows' or enlarges the past reserves, which are not static in size. This is a 'savings' rule which feeds the national piggy bank, kitty or nest-egg.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendment before us relates to the Financial Provisions in Part XI, specifically Articles 142 and 144.&nbsp; In interpreting this section, one is not engaging in mere constitutional niceties but wading into constitutional complexities where constitutional lawyers fear to tread. &nbsp;Accountants and economists are more literate in adding up the numbers and making financial projections, and far better equipped to traverse this particular terrain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, this Amendment Bill does affect the Elected President&rsquo;s <p align=left>Column: 407<p>constitutional duty to protect "past reserves" against wasteful fiscal expenditure.&nbsp; It will affect the rate at which past reserves will grow. &nbsp;I wish to raise a few concerns and points for clarifications in this respect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to set things in context, it is instructive to recall that prior to the introduction of the NII rule in 2001, there was no limit on what the Government could spend, in relation to investment income; it had a free hand in spending total investment returns both from past and current reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NII rule was a rule of fiscal prudence or budgetary restraint, restraining the free hand of the Government in relation to investment income derived from past reserves.&nbsp; It effectively binds the Government&rsquo;s hand through a system of mandated prudence and enforced savings; it restrains a profligate government while allowing a responsible one sufficient operational flexibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that over the past five years, an average of $2.8 billion from the NII was taken into the budget. Without this, the Government would have run a deficit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the debate over the President&rsquo;s Address in November 2006, the Prime Minister expressed the germ of the thinking behind this current Amendment to relax this rule of fiscal prudence.&nbsp; He highlighted that in years to come, there was a need to spend more to bolster the social safety net, while avoiding a dependent 'welfare state' mentality; this would address the growing income divide and the needs of a greying population.&nbsp; To ensure competitiveness and economic survivability, infrastructure investments needed to be funded.&nbsp; The public spending bill is going up and someone has to pay the piper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 408<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NII rule sought to strike a balance between the legitimate claims of today&rsquo;s generation with the need to steward resources for tomorrow&rsquo;s generation of the unborn.&nbsp; The rule seeks to reconcile the exigencies of the current with the legacy, including the blessings of financial security, we hope to bestow upon future Singaporeans long after our earthly tenure.&nbsp; Fifty percent of NII is locked up to grow the past reserves for future benefit, while the Government may draw from the income stream of up to the other 50% of NII to fund contemporary needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This current Amendment will not change this formula but it does redefine how to calculate the amount of investment returns which must be saved. It will not eat into the existing store of past Government reserves, but will affect the rate of how these past reserves will grow by determining the accretions to be added to the national kitty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last Constitutional Amendment which affected our "past reserves" was adopted in 2004. This related to Articles 22B, 22D and 148I which effectively removed presidential oversight in relation to transfers from the Government or Fifth Schedule SBGCs to each other, which draw down on past reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, the Elected President could withhold his assent or, to put it colloquially, "veto" these transactions. This power was removed, reducing the scope of presidential powers to safeguard past reserves. In 1994, a Constitutional Amendment also truncated the scope of presidential oversight over spending on defence and security measures which drew down on past reserves, under Article 151A.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to the 2004 amendments to Articles 22B, 22D and 148I, the presidential oversight was replaced by an alternative 'check'.&nbsp; For example, if a transferor statutory board proposes to <p align=left>Column: 409<p>transfer reserves to the Government or a government company, which draws down on its past reserves, the relevant Minister or Board of Directors must undertake in writing or by resolution not to spend this transfer; instead, they must add it to the past reserves of the Government or the transferee company. In this way, the past reserves of transferee Fifth Schedule SBGCs may be augmented by such transfers.&nbsp; Of course, the investment returns from the "past reserves" of Fifth Schedule SBGCs are not subject to the NII rule which only applies to the Government&nbsp;&ndash; these returns may be freely spent, subject only to the limits of prudence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rationale for creating the elected presidency was to provide a check against the untrammelled powers of cabinet government in a dominant party state.&nbsp; The Constitution was amended in 1991 to confer novel reactionary custodial powers of the executive genre upon the President to discharge a watchdog function over financial reserves.&nbsp; This pre-emptive strike sought to place shackles on a rogue government seeking short-term political gain by squandering the national coffers through giving vote-buying subsidies, precipitating financial ruination.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extremely onerous qualifications which&nbsp; presidential candidates must satisfy was meant to ensure that a President possesses both the competence and moral stature to oppose the Prime Minister&rsquo;s decision in relation to transactions affecting past reserves.&nbsp; The removal of the President&rsquo;s watchdog role over transactions described in Articles 22B, 22D and 148I was thus a fundamental change in the mechanisms of accountability; instead of the presidential checking function, transfers involving past reserves were to be protected by requiring the recipient body to give undertakings not to spend the transfers but to sequester this into its own pool of past <p align=left>Column: 410<p>reserves.&nbsp; Augmented past reserves could translate into augmented investment returns from past reserves which, in the case of SBGCs, would not be subject to the 50% cap on spending under the NII rule. This is quite a substantive change; I was surprised in studying <I>Hansard</I> to find that the 2004 Constitutional Amendments were not roundly debated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Constitutional Amendment before us today is not a fundamental change to the constitutional rules regulating public spending.&nbsp; It does not entail the re-aligning of institutional checks.&nbsp; It seeks to refine or fine-tune existing provisions.&nbsp; While the 2004 amendment related more to the shifting of money between the Government and SBGCs, today&rsquo;s amendment relates more to the counting of money, the computation of what must be saved, and what may be spent, to avoid over-spending and over-saving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, our past reserves can be increased under the NII rule.&nbsp; In terms of the components of investment returns, today&rsquo;s amendment provides a formula which casts a bigger net by providing three ways to increase past reserves: first, drew up to 50% of the long-term rates of return on investment of relevant assets; second, Net Investment Income and realised capital gains, directly attributable to relevant assets and received by the Government; and, third, a revised NII rule which excludes relevant assets in its computation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Including realised capital gains and real rates of return should increase what is available for spending on average, except for the years where there may be capital losses or large liabilities.&nbsp; However, the task of quantifying such terms is rendered more difficult by today&rsquo;s unstable financial markets.&nbsp; For example, the real rate of return is difficult to predict, given the inherent volatility of price shifts due to inflation or deflation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 411<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To perform these calculations, one must presumably be able to precisely identify the value or amount of past reserves. Before we can ascertain the returns, however formulated, from past reserves, we need to determine the composition of past reserves, which may include financial assets such as investments and equities and physical assets such as buildings and land.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty in calculating the NII from past reserves has been the lack of clarity regarding the size of our past reserves.&nbsp; Indeed, this was one of the issues President Ong Teng Cheong raised at a 1999 press conference before leaving office.&nbsp; He expressed concern over not knowing what past reserves consisted of and his difficulty in obtaining relevant information.&nbsp; How could he safeguard something which could not be clearly identified?</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem of identification is compounded by the fact that past reserves are not static.&nbsp; They grow through accumulation of interest and dividends, and capital gains during the Years of Fat where budget surpluses are enjoyed.&nbsp; However, if market conditions are not favourable, during the Lean Years, past reserves can depreciate in value.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The size of past reserves, and many other matters relating to the "long list" of problems President Ong raised was debated before this House in July 1999.&nbsp; This led to the adoption of a White Paper setting forth the Principles for determining and safeguarding the accumulated reserves of the Government and Fifth Schedule SBGCs.&nbsp; This was a form of non-binding 'soft constitutional law' setting out non-exhaustive guidelines to promote a 'harmonious working relationship' between the President and Government, ensuring that daily government operations were not unduly fettered.&nbsp; The goal was to prevent any "significant" draw down <p align=left>Column: 412<p>on past reserves by the Government without the President&rsquo;s consent.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 2(1) of the Constitution defines "reserves" in relation to the Government as "the excess of assets over liabilities of the Government".&nbsp; The White Paper identifies the relevant assets, that is, financial and physical assets, such as investments, loans, equities and buildings, as well as what constitute liabilities.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 148A empowers the President to withhold assent to a Supply Bill likely to draw down on past reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 148D provides this may be overridden, where the President rejects the advice of the Council of Presidential Advisers, by a two-thirds parliamentary resolution.&nbsp; If the President approves such a Supply Bill, his opinion must be published in the <I>Gazette</I>, which provides for some transparency.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past reserves comprise net financial assets and physical assets.&nbsp; While financial assets and liabilities of the Government are calculated on a cash accrual basis, Fifth Schedule SBGCs generally adopt an accrual basis. Apart from the difficulty in listing and valuating the assets, the determination of 'past reserves' at the start of and during any current term is fraught with uncertain variables.&nbsp; For example, one uncertain component of past reserves relates to (a) the excess of taxes over expenditure every financial year, and (b) earnings from investments of previous reserves.&nbsp; The difficulty in determining the investment earnings from previous reserves is that we need to know the Government&rsquo;s exact investment portfolio in order to calculate whether profits are made, or losses sustained.&nbsp; We would need to precisely identify these two components of past reserves for the President to make an informed decision as to whether a government budget eats into past reserves and whether this should be supported.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 413<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 142(4) of the Constitution provides that past reserves are not accumulated by the current Government and include accretions deemed to be part of the reserves.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first imponderable affecting the exercise of presidential discretion is: what is the extent of past reserves?&nbsp; We also need to know what the accumulations and accretions are. This cannot be known without knowledge of the extent of the Government&rsquo;s holdings of financial and physical assets.&nbsp; However, such information, particularly in relation to the Government&rsquo;s investment holdings, is not disclosed on grounds of national interests.&nbsp; If the President does not know whether a proposed budget draws down on past reserves, how can he or she exercise discretion?</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the President&rsquo;s watchdog duties are constitutional duties, this means, in principle, that whether these duties have been fearlessly and faithfully discharged should be subject to judicial scrutiny.&nbsp; On what basis will the Courts be able to determine whether the President has acted prudently or fulfilled his constitutional mandate?</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendment further exacerbates existing complexities. &nbsp;It introduces the new term: "relevant assets".</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Article 21(3), the President is obliged to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers before performing certain functions such as withholding assent to a Supply Bill.&nbsp; Under clause 3 of the Amendment Bill, a new function is added.&nbsp; The President must, under the new Article 142(1A), consult with the Council before exercising his discretion to concur with the Finance Minister on the "long-term real rates of return" expected <p align=left>Column: 414<p>to be earned on the respective components of the relevant assets.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Finance Minister must then certify the spending limit for that financial year, which is capped at 50% of the total of all amounts ascertained by applying the "long-term real rates of return".&nbsp; Article 142(1A) goes on to provide that any reference to past reserves in this Part shall exclude those reserves equal to the amount so certified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the President&rsquo;s watchdog powers are triggered by potential encroachment on past reserves, this new provision apparently means that in identifying "past reserves", we are to exclude those reserves which the Finance Minister has certified as forming part of the amount to be spent for that financial year, not exceeding 50% of the total of all amounts determined by applying the expected long-term real rate of return under new Article 142(1A)(a).&nbsp; What might otherwise be counted as past reserves are not to be counted as past reserves.&nbsp; Is this so?&nbsp; Also, what is the rationale for the "not more than 50%" benchmark?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, in relation to proposed clause 3(c), and the Minister&rsquo;s existing responsibility under Article 142(3) of the Constitution to certify to the President the amount of the NII of that financial year from past government reserves deemed to accrete to the past reserves, can the Minister clarify what, broadly, are the items comprised within the new insertion "past reserves of the Government not comprised in the relevant assets"?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to know what relevant assets are before we can calculate long-term real rates of expected return.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 offers a definition or description of&nbsp; "relevant assets".&nbsp; However, this includes more unknowns.&nbsp; One component of&nbsp; "relevant assets" includes the net assets and certain moneys of MAS, and the total net assets managed <p align=left>Column: 415<p>by the GIC and its wholly owned subsidiaries.&nbsp; This is not generally accessible information; indeed, it is a well-known secret notwithstanding the recent report issued by GIC on the management of its portfolio!&nbsp; It is unclear what the scope of "relevant assets" is. &nbsp;How then is the long-term real rate of return calculated?&nbsp; Will more information be forthcoming, perhaps in another White Paper? This needs to be clarified, in the interests of transparency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is uncertainty with respect to "relevant assets", on what basis may the President in his discretion decide whether or not to concur with the Finance Minister on what long-term real rates of return are expected to be, and to ascertain that the spending limits for a financial year will not exceed 50% of the likely returns on the relevant assets? It is the President&rsquo;s job not to allow more than 50% of the likely returns on relevant assets to be spent and the People who elected the President will want to know whether this task is discharged with due diligence. How is monitoring possible when it is hard if not impossible to measure what is meant to be monitored?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Minister clarify whether the definition of&nbsp; "relevant assets" applies to current and past reserves of the Government and the other actors mentioned in proposed clause 3(d) who hold relevant assets?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are the assets managed by entities substantially owned by GIC, let us say owning at least a 50% share, not included in the computation of&nbsp; "relevant assets"?&nbsp; What is the rationale for using 100% ownership as a benchmark?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the holders or managers of relevant assets include Fifth Schedule entities, particularly, Temasek and statutory bodies?&nbsp; Indeed, can the Minister <p align=left>Column: 416<p>confirm whether SBGCs have been restructured or privatised so as to warrant an updating of the Fifth Schedule list?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the impenetrable imponderable of what "relevant assets" comprise of, another imponderable, particularly to those lacking public finance literacy, like myself, is the term: "long-term real rates of return".&nbsp; What exactly does this mean?&nbsp; I presume long-term means about&nbsp;20 years?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed provisions in this Amendment Bill provide no guidance as to what the formulation "long-term real rates of return" entails.&nbsp; On what basis will the real rates of return be decided?&nbsp; Will further guidelines be provided?&nbsp; Can the Minister also clarify the accounting standards and methods concerning definitions of&nbsp; "real rate of return", "adjusted for change", "expenses arising from or incidental to investing and managing", set out in proposed clause 3(d)?&nbsp; Will these be spelt out in a code or regulation pursuant to the Financial Procedure Act or other appropriate legislation? &nbsp;In the alternative, will untethered flexibility be the order of the day in leaving the Auditor-General or Accountant-General absolute discretion to determine the meaning of these terms?&nbsp; Who will hold this process to account?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my concern is this: there is a danger of extensive discretion inherent in putting vague public finance terms like "relevant assets", "realised capital gains" and "long-term real rates of return" into the Constitution, the supreme law of the land which is more suited to the articulation of broad principles rather than detailed regulations; such terms certainly do not bear self-evident meanings.&nbsp; Will not the vagueness in the formulation of these terms affect how the relevant constitutional actors will apprehend and apply these terms?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the President&rsquo;s men in the Council of Presidential Advisers must be able to <p align=left>Column: 417<p>render sound financial advice on these complex fiscal matters, but will they have sufficient information to do so?&nbsp; Indeed, if the Council recommends or the President independently decides not to concur with the Finance Minister, what mechanism is available to break this potential deadlock?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is judicial review available, to ascertain if the President or other actors have acted constitutionally?&nbsp; If it is, what standards will the courts or constitutional tribunal apply?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if judges disagree with the President or Finance Minister as to what long-term real rates of return are?&nbsp; We are not talking pin money or pocket change here!&nbsp; Will this matter be exempted from judicial determination, much like questions of security?&nbsp; Could the Minister kindly clarify?&nbsp; Are we faced with problems of definitional ambiguity, with terms not susceptible to precise evaluation? &nbsp;Will this hamper the operation of the proposed new regime?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, could the Minister shed some light on whether the proposed Amendments will, based on existing figures, result in increased net returns for the Government&rsquo;s current reserves and past reserves, as compared to the current NII mechanism?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the system of financial checks associated with the elected presidency grafted by constitutional reform upon the inherited Westminster parliamentary system is still evolving, some 17 years after its inception.&nbsp; Despite its then novelty, the elected presidency was considered important enough to the scheme of limited government to warrant a unique entrenchment mechanism involving the possibility of a popular referendum under Article 5(2A) of the Constitution.&nbsp; This remains in abeyance.&nbsp; Indeed, if Article 5(2A) was in force, <p align=left>Column: 418<p>today&rsquo;s amendment might necessitate a referendum insofar as it impinges on the President&rsquo;s financial guardianship over past government reserves.&nbsp; While the introduction of the Elected President might be considered revolutionary, in confiding more executive authority in this office than that customarily associated with a ceremonial Westminster Head of State, its development trajectory has been evolutionary. This is consonant with the brand of constitutional pragmatism extant in Singapore practice, where truth is located in experience and social realities rather than grand theories or lofty abstractions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the passage of this Constitutional Amendment Bill, the likelihood is that the Government will want to have a 'trial run' period to test how it works.&nbsp; Would the Minister comment on when the Government is likely to entrench the elected presidency by bringing into force Article 5(2A), which would also give Singaporeans the long-awaited entrenchment of other constitutional provisions like Part IV, which safeguards our fundamental liberties?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in principle, I support the Government&rsquo;s move towards a more liberal spending policy on social services such as workfare and health care, as it is important for the heart of a society always to care for the poor and vulnerable.&nbsp; This amendment by affording greater access to more money from the reserves will facilitate this.&nbsp; More money will also be needed to support further expenditure on education and transport, which is integral to human development.&nbsp; Taxes alone may not be enough, particularly in economic downturn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I find myself as a constitutional law professor somewhat befuddled with these complex Constitutional Amendments which, to me, would seem to be more at home in a statute on financial procedures and <p align=left>Column: 419<p>accounting practices. &nbsp;I hope the learned Minister can help shed light on the issues raised, particularly, how, given the definitional ambiguities involved, the relevant actors can effectively discharge their respective constitutional functions.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.23 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gautam Banerjee:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill to amend the Constitution to fundamentally change the basis on which the government of the day can spend Singapore&rsquo;s reserves has been contemplated during various discussions and debates in this House&nbsp;for a number of years.&nbsp; Indeed, every year during the Committee of Supply debate following the Finance Minister&rsquo;s Budget Statement, this subject has received attention from many MPs asking the Government to undertake a review of the&nbsp;hitherto strict, narrow and limited ways a government can use past reserves for current spending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the Second Reading of this very important Bill is taking place today when we are in the midst of a global financial crisis of unprecedented proportions is entirely a coincidence.&nbsp; However, the financial meltdown we have experienced over the past few weeks will inevitably influence the discussion and debate we will have in this House during the Second Reading of this Bill.&nbsp; But I view the timing of this debate as positive because it has raised the awareness of how complicated and convoluted the global financial system has become and that we cannot implicitly place trust and reliance in the system, or on venerable and reputable institutions, which for years have been pillars of strength supporting the global financial infrastructure that we have taken for granted.&nbsp; We are fortunate in some ways that we can take on board <p align=left>Column: 420<p>some basic "do's" and "don'ts" from this present financial crisis that we are embroiled in, as we change our Constitution to allow the use of our hard-earned and precious reserves for current spending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, before I comment on this Bill, let me say that I agree with the Government that a review of the present rules relating to the use of reserves is necessary because of the following reasons:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our present rules only allow the use of:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;dividends, interest and other income received by the Government during the financial year from investing the reserves of the Government; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;the interest received by the Government during the financial year from loans whenever given by the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Under our&nbsp;current rules, all capital gains, realised or unrealised, are not available for spending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the present rules on the spending of our reserves implicitly assume that all our reserves are invested in fixed income instruments, which clearly they are not.&nbsp; A quick look at the accounts of GIC will reveal that a significant portion of the "relevant assets" referred to in the Bill are in asset categories such as private equity, real estate or alternative investment funds, which do not provide regular interest income on dividends.&nbsp; In any case, the concept of total returns should take into account not only the fixed annual income that is received from these assets, but also the change in the carrying value of the underlying assets.&nbsp; So unless we update the present rules on spending of reserves, we will have available for current spending only a small proportion of the total returns that are being earned on our reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 421<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current rules, most of the returns being generated from our reserves will, therefore, not be available&nbsp;for the present generation of Singaporeans.&nbsp; So it is necessary to recalibrate the use of our reserves if we are to be fair to different generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now to examine and comment on the main provisions of this Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Amendment Bill applies only to relevant assets, which is defined to be assets held by GIC and certain assets held by MAS less certain liabilities.&nbsp; Other assets remain under the current constitution provisions, and all the capital gains therefrom are still considered past reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister will derive and apply an expected long-term real rate of return to the relevant assets.&nbsp; Fifty percent&nbsp;of the amount so computed will form part of current reserves.&nbsp; The actual dividends, interest and other income received from the relevant assets will be ignored (ie, they will go into past reserves) to avoid double counting.&nbsp; This "expected long-term real rate of return" is forward looking and based on the Minister&rsquo;s expectations and assumptions.&nbsp; It may not be the same as the historical realised rate of return. &nbsp;It also may not be the same as the actual realised returns each year.&nbsp; The only check and balance is the President&rsquo;s concurrence.&nbsp; This is a completely different basis from the current Constitution which is based on actual returns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inclusion of capital gains will ensure consistency in the treatment of asset classes with different proportion of yield versus capital gains.&nbsp; Returns from investment take the form of dividend/interest or capital gains upon disposal.&nbsp; Often, the&nbsp;two elements are inter-related.&nbsp; For the same investment, a <p align=left>Column: 422<p>lower dividend/interest distribution will, in theory, result in higher eventual capital gains, and vice versa,&nbsp;for example, high growth companies.&nbsp; Hence, it is inconsistent to include only the dividend/interest but not the capital gains.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "expected long-term real rate of return" entails the use of various assumptions and expectations about the future.&nbsp; These are subjective, so the Bill seeks to incorporate certain safeguards into the proposed amendment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, only 50% of the long-term return is allowed to be used.&nbsp; This provides some buffer against uncertainties, which are inherent in any forward-looking assumption and expectation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Minister is required to review the long-term real rate of return each year.&nbsp; This ensures that current market conditions and outlook are taken into account, and the rate revised if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the President has to concur on the long-term real rate of return each year.&nbsp; This allows a process of check and balance on the assumptions and expectations adopted.&nbsp; This is very important given the subjectivity and judgment involved in deriving the rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the checks and balances in the Bill have been well thought through, but my main concern is that they must not only work but be seen to work by Singaporeans at large.&nbsp; We have to step up transparency and communication compared to what we do now.&nbsp; Unlike the present system, which is based on historical earned income, the proposed new system will be based on assumptions of future trends and outcomes&nbsp;&ndash; and requires a great degree of judgement.&nbsp; So we should discuss and embellish the checks and balances.&nbsp; I have the following suggestions, which I would like the Minister to consider:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 423<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "expected long-term real rate of return" used for the computation should be capped by the actual historical long-term real rate of return of the components of the relevant assets.&nbsp; While the past is not necessary an indication of future investment performance, a cap based on historical actual return provides a sanity check on the assumptions and expectations adopted.&nbsp; In the long run, the historical cap will be automatically revised upwards if the actual returns consistently turn out to be higher.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Before I conclude, I would like a clarification from the Minister.&nbsp; Given that the expected rate of return includes both realised and unrealised investments, how is the Government proposing to fund the amount available for current use if the long-term expected rate of return exceeds the realised dividend/interest and capital gains each year?&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, put in another way, how do we manage the liquidity issue because the expected long-term rate of return is based on assumptions and expected outcomes, not actual cash that has been earned?</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify"></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Bill.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.32 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the call on Government to tap its reserves to fund spending has been made consistently.&nbsp; This is to avoid having to tax Singaporeans more heavily, such as through GST increases, even as we&nbsp;increase public spending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendment is another step to allow Government to tap more into our reserves.&nbsp; I note that the Government has taken pains to ensure that the proposed amendment will preserve the real value of past reserves at <p align=left>Column: 425<p>minimum and allow for the reserves to continue to grow.&nbsp; This is important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Finance Minister has explained that the changes are to meet our increased spending needs.&nbsp; The Government has estimated that these increased expenditures will cost an additional 3% of GDP within five years, whereas our increased GST will generate additional revenues of about 0.8% of GDP.&nbsp; Therefore, on the assumption that current revenues are just about meeting current expenditures,&nbsp;we will face budgetary shortfalls in the future.&nbsp; The Minister had earlier said that our budget had stayed neutral, on average, since 2001.&nbsp; However, if we look over a longer time horizon, we see a different picture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, we had budget surpluses for 14 of the last 20 years since 1988, except for the six years from 2001 to 2006.&nbsp; Cumulatively, in the last 20 years, we have generated over $50 billion in surpluses.&nbsp; What then are the reasons for the Ministry to expect that this record of performance cannot be sustained?&nbsp; I hope the Minister can give a more complete picture of the expectations on our current revenue sources&nbsp;while we are not expected to grow much further in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related question is: &nbsp;if we do not have the Net Investment Return (NIR), does it mean that we have to forego the increased spending?&nbsp; Or does it mean that we have to use other funding sources, eg, issuing Government bonds?&nbsp; It would be useful also for the Minister to share the Government's considerations in using different funding sources.&nbsp; Have we considered the cost effectiveness of tapping our reserves instead of these other funding options?&nbsp; For example, if our expected long-term real returns are 5.5% and the bond yields are 5%, is it <p align=left>Column: 426<p>not better for us to issue bonds instead of tapping on our reserves through the NIR?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second area of concern is what happens if the actual real returns are lower than expected real returns over a five-year period, for example.&nbsp; Supposing the expected real returns of 5% and if inflation exceeded expectations by 3% over a five-year period, or if our investment returns were actually poorer over the five-year period, do we still stick to the original long-term projections or do we make the necessary adjustments?&nbsp; What happens to the money that we have already taken into the budget and spent them all?&nbsp; Do we adjust the next tranche taken into the budget to recognise the over estimation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there is the question of risk.&nbsp; Just because we can tap more into our reserves, it&nbsp;should not become a licence for us to spend on extravagant projects.&nbsp; With the proposed amendment, Singapore's reserves will still grow but the risk is that the growth is much slower.&nbsp; This is unless the increased funds taken into the budget are used wisely to strengthen Singapore to generate more growth which will in turn multiply our reserves.&nbsp; Therefore, I propose that the following criteria be considered before committing to a large expenditure in the future:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it should stretch Singapore's growth potential right through our limits of growth with potential multiplier effects.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, this sort of expenditure should help to keep Singapore a shining city for all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it should allow Singaporeans to share in the fruits of our success, to improve substantially our quality of life, thereby generating the support for our future growth strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if I may, I would like to conclude my remarks in Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 427<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):&nbsp; <I>[For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081020/20081020VS_153700.pdf"">Appendix A</a>*.]</I> Mr Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I heard this saying recently:&nbsp; if there is a mountain, we depend on the mountain; if there is water, we depend on the water.&nbsp; If there are no mountains and no water, then we have to depend on our two legs.&nbsp; Throughout our 43 years of nation-building, we have adopted such an approach, stayed united and cultivated a society based on self-reliance.&nbsp; As a result, Singapore has surmounted all odds and developed steadily.&nbsp; We are now able to enjoy a high standard of living.&nbsp; However, we cannot depend on our "two legs" alone in achieving future progress.&nbsp; The Chinese say it is like rowing a boat against the tide&nbsp;&ndash; you move either forward or backward. We face intense competition and must dare to innovate.&nbsp; For example, oil-producing countries in the Middle East can tap their vast resources.&nbsp; They can plan ultra-modern cities that the world has never yet seen, they can recruit top global talents in every field, and they can set up first-class research universities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have oil, but our reserves are quite substantial and can be better utilised.&nbsp; This Amendment Bill will indeed provide us with more revenue to spend on economic development and social infrastructure.&nbsp; However, we must establish the pre-condition that most of these funds will be used to break through our limits of growth, and should not be squandered on extravagant projects.&nbsp; Our attitude should not be to "depend on our reserves, if there are no mountains, no water".&nbsp; We have to depend on our intelligence, our wisdom, so that we can use our reserves sensibly, rationally and appropriately for the benefit of our nation.&nbsp; Only then can we hope to secure the steady development of Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support this Amendment Bill.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 473-474.<BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I rise in support of the amendments to the Constitution for the new framework for spending investment returns, as the intended principles of the amendments are to increase the contributions of investment returns to the budget while preserving the real value of past reserves, and also to allow for the reserves to grow.&nbsp; Given the current economic situation, I think all of us will agree that the amendment is a timely and welcome one to increase the funding to the budget to support both important social and developmental spending.&nbsp; I would also like to&nbsp;ask the Minister&nbsp;whether all other channels of sources of income have also been considered apart from increased taxes, because I think many will agree that given today's current economic situation, as Minister Lim Hng Kiang had earlier shared the stickiness of inflation, and that further taxation of our people would definitely have adverse impact.&nbsp; So this is definitely welcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now touch on the point of preserving and enhancing the value of our reserves.&nbsp; Minister Tharman had reiterated the point that given Singapore has no natural resources, it is vital that we ensure that we drive for economic growth and increase spending for longer term social and developmental needs, as we continue to grow the value of our reserves.&nbsp; As this new framework will be based on the long-term expected returns on investments by GIC and MAS, this would, to some extent, introduce risk to spending ahead of actual monies received or realised value of capital gains.&nbsp; This will increase the risk profile.&nbsp; I hear the reassurance given with the proposed governance framework to safeguard the reserves, but echo the same concerns <p align=left>Column: 429<p>highlighted by my parliamentary colleagues who have spoken before me on the need for clarity of the definitions of "long term" and "expected returns".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we continue to see the extreme economic situation and adverse conditions that exist and that we are experiencing in the markets currently, will the 50% cap on NIR and the amendments to governance process to enable the President's role in safeguarding the past reserves be sufficient?&nbsp; While I appreciate the expected returns approach to avoid the inherent volatility of total returns on an annual basis, and this prevents also a feast or famine approach based on a bull&nbsp;and bear market respectively, I am concerned on the possible erosion with a few years of under performance to be expected to the reserves if expected returns for whatever reasons due to the adverse market conditions continue to erode the value of the reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the proposed change in the budgeting process or the governance model enable the elected President's role in safeguarding our past reserves allow for constructive dialogue and flexibility to reach agreement on the proposed rate of long-term real rate of returns?&nbsp; Will the process allow for the President to have consultation with an independent board of advisers on the proposed long-term rate of returns?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see the wisdom of having the mechanism to break the deadlock in the event of a dispute to revert back to the average historical rate of returns. I believe the Minister mentioned a 20-year period&nbsp; that would be used, although this is not optimum.&nbsp; Would the process allow for intervention to review the proposed rates in the event of prolonged under performance against expected returns?&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from just having a mechanism to revert to just the historical rates of <p align=left>Column: 430<p>returns, will the process allow for consultation and review of the rates?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope the Minister will be able to clarify these areas, because I believe that the amendments are the right ones to support the need for increased spending and to continue the investments required to keep Singapore competitive.&nbsp; But these areas need still to be discussed and clarified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.44 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will speak in Mandarin first.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In Mandarin</I>):<I>&nbsp; [For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081020/20081020VS_153841.pdf"">Appendix A</a>*.]</I>&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, this amendment to the Constitution will be very significant to the future of Singapore, particularly to narrowing the gap between the poor and vulnerable group and the rich people in Singapore.&nbsp; I would support the Bill.&nbsp; I will speak first on a matter of principle and then on some technical points.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on a matter of principle, the amendment is to expand the definition of the "net investment returns" which could be utilised by the Government.&nbsp; Why should we do that?&nbsp; Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had already mentioned this in the year 2006.&nbsp; What the Government is trying to do is to spend more money on helping the low-income people, so that they will have a better standard of living.&nbsp; This move on expanding reserves so as to increase spending on the poor and vulnerable group is worthy of support by all the people of Singapore, especially in tough times when the economy is going through a restructuring. The economy has been developing so quickly and its growth is so fast that many people, especially those in the poor and vulnerable group, <p align=left>Column: 431<p>are not able to catch up&nbsp;with the rest and are lagging behind.&nbsp; Some of them in the elite group have even fallen behind and become part of the&nbsp; vulnerable group.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we go to our neighbourhood, we can find that there are a lot of new immigrants.&nbsp; They come and they are seen by Singaporeans as the privileged group.&nbsp; With comparison, the people found that they lose their advantage to the new immigrants. So I think to spend more of our reserves to help the vulnerable group is something which we need to support.&nbsp; Who are the vulnerable people? In the community, we see more ice-cream vendors&nbsp;&ndash; whether the weather is fine or no good, they will have not much&nbsp;business&nbsp;and they will have problems to make ends meet. In the manufacturing sector, when the factories change their production mode, these people will lose their jobs.&nbsp; But, fortunately, with the help of the Government, the subsidies given to these elderly workers helped them to undergo retraining programmes through NTUC to acquire new skills, so that they can be employed.&nbsp; However, the process will take a long time and life will be difficult for them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these people, they may not understand why electricity tariff will be raised.&nbsp; When it is raised, it is raised by such a big margin.&nbsp; And when price went down, it is just a little.&nbsp; When the Formula One was in Singapore, they could not understand why some people could spend few thousand dollars but they could not afford to.&nbsp;And they do not understand why we are digging up our roads. When we are digging up the roads to lay underground cables, it is to provide gas or build underground tunnels, so that all these facilities will enhance the value of our property.&nbsp; So, in other countries, one square foot of land can be just a dollar, but it can cost a few thousand dollars in Singapore.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course , all know&nbsp; that the Government is capable of creating&nbsp; wealth. <p align=left>Column: 432<p>Recently, the Government Investment Corporation (GIC), for the first time, published its annual report and the average rate of return is 4.5% over last 20 years. Therefore, the people are confident of the Government's investing strategies. And they say, if you want to have sound investments, we need the veterans, people like Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and some of our senior Ministers.&nbsp; Our GIC has been able to generate good returns on our reserves because they have been very prudent and they have very good strategies.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of the financial crisis, many people, especially the vulnerable elderly, would ask why the Government has not encouraged senior citizens to keep their money in CPF,&nbsp; so that they can enjoy 5% interest. It is better keeping the money with CPF as with the money in hand, they go to coffee-shop and may get cheated.&nbsp; When they invest in stocks and shares, they may lose money.&nbsp; We all know that the Singapore Government has been giving a lot of rebates and <I>ang baos</I> to the people, yet people are complaining that it is not fair. The Government has been kind and it simply deposits the money into their bank accounts. Unlike in Indonesia, we recently heard of the case of a rich man who was distributing money to the people&nbsp;&ndash; just 40,000 rupiahs, which is about $6&nbsp;&ndash; it had resulted in a mad rush for the money, and many were crushed to death. Eventually, 23 people died in the stampede.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, the money is wired straight into the people's bank account. But, on what criterion?&nbsp; If we give more to the old, then the young ones will say it is not fair.&nbsp; If you give more to the 3-room flat dwellers, the 5-room dwellers will say it is not fair to them. If you based it on income, some will say they have more mouths to feed. So it is difficult to satisfy everybody.&nbsp; I think we should adopt a different approach based on economic <p align=left>Column: 433<p>growth. When times are good, we should give healthcare incentives and CPF top-ups to the people.&nbsp; When the economy is not so good, we need to care for the people, eg, giving transport vouchers and other vouchers to help the poor and vulnerable people. Because the Government can generate wealth, that is why it can afford to distribute the money to the people.&nbsp; I think we should distribute more to those who need the money and not just equal distribution to everybody.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now speak in English on two technical points so that the Minister for Finance will understand better.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 475-478.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

I have two technical questions for the Minister: (1) How would the long-term expected return be calculated?&nbsp; Does it include mark-to-market losses that most likely the GIC and Monetary Authority of Singapore's investments in property equity and debt securities would have suffered during a financial turmoil?&nbsp; How could the Government predict the future since it is "expected return"?&nbsp; What happens if the realised return over a period turns out to be negative?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) This proposed change has opened up more revenue sources for the Government to spend.&nbsp; The Government may also want to set some ground rules on how it should be spent.&nbsp; For example, should the spending of fund from a realised capital gain be channelled mostly, if not all, to long-term development needs or building the long-term competitiveness for Singaporeans?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p align=left>Column: 434<p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.52 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Amendment Bill to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the&nbsp;Bill seeks to amend the Constitution to allow the Government to spend up to 50% of the Net Investment Returns or expected long-term real returns on net assets invested by the GIC and MAS.&nbsp; This will allow the Government to have access to more funds which would include capital gains which are available from the investment of the Government reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current financial turmoil has affected many countries in the world and this has led to predictions of a difficult depression.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is already in a technical recession and there is this fear amongst many companies and workers that there will be slower growth next year, job losses and fall in income.&nbsp; Allowing the Government to have access to more funds would certainly allow the Government greater flexibility to achieve its plans to develop a top-quality economy and to build a resilient community.&nbsp; For this year's budget, even with a contribution of $2.22 billion from the Net Investment Income, we still end up with a budget deficit of $0.8 billion.&nbsp; In view of the current economic crisis, there are predictions that tax collection is likely to fall, and it is thus critical for the Government to be able to tap on a bigger source of funds which take into account the total returns on the reserves, including capital gains.&nbsp; With the flexibility of tapping on up to 50% of the long-term real returns and up to 50% of Net Investment Income from the reserves, the Government would be in a better position to plan its expenditure for healthcare and&nbsp;other social expenditure like&nbsp;Workfare.&nbsp; There is already a huge demand on Government expenditure to develop the infrastructure of the country like spending <p align=left>Column: 435<p>on education, road expansion, development of a larger trade network and&nbsp;public housing.&nbsp; Without the additional source of funds, the Government's other option may be to raise taxes like&nbsp;GST.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There may be some people who ask whether by this amendment, we are saving less for the future.&nbsp; In 2001, during the debate on the amendments to this same Article 142 of the Constitution, the former Minister for Finance said that "past reserves belong to the people, and the Government is merely a guardian and steward of these reserves".&nbsp; Minister Mentor also said that the Government owed an obligation not just to the present generation but also to the future generation.&nbsp; I feel that we can strike an appropriate balance in saving sufficiently for the future as well as providing adequately for the present generation.&nbsp; At the end of the day, there will still be at least 50% of the Net Investment Returns which will go back to the reserves as savings for the future.&nbsp; Further, the more we save in the reserves, the lesser funds we have to spend for the current generation.&nbsp; The question really is how much do we wish to save for the future generation at the expense of the present generation of Singaporeans.&nbsp; Perhaps the Government can clarify whether it has a long-term fixed target as to how much it would wish to maintain in its reserves or how much does it wish to grow its reserves too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if you speak to the people of the present generation, they will all complain about the increased cost of living.&nbsp; They complain about&nbsp;the increase in taxes via the GST, the increase in property tax,&nbsp;healthcare cost,&nbsp;ERP,&nbsp;public transport fares,&nbsp;food prices, even&nbsp;telephone charges, and the recent hike in utility charges.&nbsp; The general perception for the man-in-the-street is that what they earn is never going to be enough to offset against the ever increasing cost of living.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 436<p>And the frightening thing is that as the population ages, the cost of healthcare would definitely go up, and so would other social costs as the income gap widens between the rich and the poor, as well as&nbsp;the lower-middle income.&nbsp; The question to me is not so much whether we should allow the Government to use up to 50% of the Net Investment Returns from the reserves but, rather, how do we spend the funds wisely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I urge the Government to consider using part of the funds available from the Net Investment Returns to help keep costs down for the average Singaporeans.&nbsp; If the Minister for Finance is able to estimate a higher long-term real rate of return to more than 2% of GDP, could the Government consider a reduction in GST or a reduction in property tax to keep the cost of living down?&nbsp; I would also urge the Government to consider reduction in public transport cost by cutting&nbsp;some indirect taxes on the public transport companies.&nbsp; What about having a bigger budget for some Government agencies, like the ICA or the Police, so that they can&nbsp;employ more contract staff to improve on their response to the public?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would prefer that the Government finds ways to keep the overall cost of living lower rather than provide targeted financial aid to the needy as the only solution.&nbsp; I watch with concern each time we have an increase in transport fares,&nbsp;telephone charges or utilities.&nbsp; And what we see is a long queue of people&nbsp;at the&nbsp;community clubs applying for financial help to cope with these increases.&nbsp; But, really, Sir, there is nothing much they can do as the cost of living is simply too much to bear for many of them.&nbsp; For the many lower-middle income or middle-income residents who do not qualify for the financial assistance or&nbsp;transport vouchers, they seethe in anger quietly as they see <p align=left>Column: 437<p>their savings deplete with every increase in cost of living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a Member of Parliament, I know that the Government is spending huge amounts of money on utilities rebate, Edusave top-ups, Senior Citizens Bonus, GST credits, etc, to help these people cope with the increase in cost of living.&nbsp; However, each time I meet my residents, I never cease to hear repeated complaints from them that life is more difficult and that their income is severely stretched due to the various increases in the cost of living in Singapore.&nbsp; It is not my intention to ask that the Government spends its income in an imprudent manner on the current generation, but I believe that the Government can and should use part of the Net Investment Returns to help ease the cost of living for its citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this, I support the Amendment Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.58 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to participate in this debate.&nbsp; As a Nominated Member, I will not be able to vote on this Constitutional Amendment.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I wish to express my support of this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the world is on the verge of a global recession or has possibly already entered one.&nbsp; Indeed, Singapore is&nbsp;already in a technical recession and things will almost certainly get worse before they get better.&nbsp; The Government has always said that it is building up the reserves for a rainy day.&nbsp; Well, it is going to thunderstorm over the next few quarters and Singaporeans will be expecting the Government to use the reserves to help Singaporeans.&nbsp; So the timing of this Constitutional Amendment could not have been better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 438<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Amendment will unlock more of the investment returns from our reserves to fund social expenditures than are needed today.&nbsp; The economy has in recent years become less reliant on direct taxes and become more reliant on indirect taxes.&nbsp; But with the upcoming economic troubles that Singaporeans will inevitably start running into, this means that there will be less tax revenue precisely at the time when more help is needed for struggling Singaporeans.&nbsp; So being able to tap on more of the returns from our reserves will go a long way in helping the Government balance its books.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister has explained the mechanics of this Constitutional Amendment and I will not go into that.&nbsp; It suffices to say that the current formula artificially excludes capital gains from the calculation of investment returns from the reserves and the new formula corrects this by including realised capital gains in the returns that may be used, and hence presents a much more accurate measure of these returns.&nbsp; Having said that, I have a few concerns that I hope the Minister can address and, perhaps, clarify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the new formula will not apply to Temasek Holdings' portfolio of assets which is not included in the definition of "relevant assets" introduced by clause 3(d) of the Bill.&nbsp; The new formula applies only to relevant assets which will comprise only the assets managed by the GIC and the assets of MAS, less the Government's liabilities.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister has stated the reasons for excluding Temasek Holdings, but this exclusion remains surprising. After all, Temasek is reported to have achieved a historical annual rate of return of 18% or so. Temasek is perceived to be similar to a private equity fund, which is prepared to make higher-risk investments than&nbsp;GIC.&nbsp; In a way, it is the higher-risk and&nbsp;higher-return portion of the Government's diversified portfolio.&nbsp; Presumably, the <p align=left>Column: 439<p>higher rate of return enjoyed by Temasek over GIC&nbsp;is at least substantially due to capital gains in Temasek&rsquo;s portfolio. To exclude Temasek&rsquo;s portfolio from this new formula would be to undercut the new formula and remove much of the potential benefits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sizes of GIC&rsquo;s and Temasek&rsquo;s portfolios are not publicly known. It is, therefore, impossible for the public, and indeed this House, to ascertain what are the effects and repercussions of excluding Temasek&rsquo;s portfolio of assets.&nbsp; Hopefully, the Minister can elaborate on why Temasek&rsquo;s portfolio is excluded from the new formula, and what impact this exclusion will have on the amount of incremental budget that would have been available to the Government.&nbsp; In this regard, it will also be very helpful if the Minister could shed some light on what are the Government's estimates of the fiscal effect of these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following&nbsp;from this exclusion of Temasek&rsquo;s portfolio of assets from the new formula, it becomes possible for the Government of the day to manipulate the actual amounts that become available for use under the new formula. If the Government of the day wants to increase the returns from the reserves that are available for usage as net investment returns, it may seek to transfer assets from Temasek's portfolio into the assets under GIC's management, so that these assets then become relevant assets to which the new formula applies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This possibility cannot be desirable. There should be more transparency, and more controls, over the allocation of reserves between the respective portfolios of Temasek and GIC, so as to prevent such situations.&nbsp; Of course, bringing Temasek Holdings under the umbrella of the new rule will obviate any such manipulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, on the point of transparency, the President and the Minister have to agree <p align=left>Column: 440<p>on the expected long-term real rates of return&nbsp;of our reserves at the start of each financial year, and the Minister then has to certify to the President the amounts available for spending using the agreed expected long-term real rates of return.&nbsp; Prof Thio has rightly noted that the President may&nbsp;have difficulty in determining whether the Minister's proposed rates are appropriate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the Constitutional provisions do not require the rates of return, or the basis upon which they were calculated, to be published. There is, therefore, no way for Singaporeans or this House to evaluate whether the agreed rates are appropriate. One would also expect the expected long-term real rates of return to be consistent over time, but there is no way for the public to ascertain whether the agreed rates between the President and the Minister are&nbsp;indeed consistent over time, or whether they change radically from year to year. These are potential flaws that could weaken the strength of the system we have put in place to protect our reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still on the issue of the expected long-term real rates of return, these rates effectively set a benchmark for the performance of GIC. That must be so, because the rates effectively state the returns that we expect the assets managed by GIC to achieve over the long term. That being so, I hope the Minister can confirm whether the long-term performance of GIC will be assessed against these agreed rates, and if so, how that will be translated into a system to measure the annual performance of GIC, which admittedly will fluctuate from year to year. But if the Minister does not intend to use these agreed rates as a benchmark for measuring GIC&rsquo;s performance, I hope the Minister can clarify why not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this further strengthens the case for including Temasek Holdings <p align=left>Column: 441<p>under the new formula. When the Government was queried on the performance of Temasek Holdings and GIC in the past, it has consistently maintained that it looks at their performance over the long term. This is an answer that, I dare say, has not sat well with many Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now have a mechanism for assessing the long-term performance of our reserves.&nbsp; So, why not take advantage of this opportunity to place both Temasek and GIC within this framework, so that in future there is an objective benchmark against which the performance of these companies can be measured? This would be the perfect answer to those who are concerned with ensuring that the performance of Temasek and GIC are adequate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a question over the treatment of unrealised capital losses. The definition of "realised capital gains" includes realised capital losses.&nbsp; So, how will unrealised capital losses be addressed?&nbsp; Does GIC adopt any form of mark-to-market accounting that would capture such losses?&nbsp; I hope the Minister can shed some light on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to touch on the investments made by Temasek and GIC in the recent past.&nbsp; I do not propose to discuss the merits or otherwise of the massive investments into the financial institutions. I believe that it is&nbsp;perhaps too early to tell whether or not they were wise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would make this point.&nbsp; Now that the returns from the reserves have assumed a much more important role in the Government&rsquo;s budget, the reserves have become even more relevant to the people.&nbsp; This Bill will more closely <p align=left>Column: 442<p>align the size and performance of our reserves, with the well-being of Singaporeans.&nbsp; Singaporeans frequently ask,&nbsp;"What is the point of having massive reserves that are never touched and are never used to help us?"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this Bill and&nbsp;with these changes, the point should start becoming clear to the people.&nbsp; That being the case, Singaporeans will expect more transparency, more accountability and sustained good performance in the management of our reserves. That is because the Government&rsquo;s ability to help and improve the lot of Singaporeans will become&nbsp;more tied to the continued strong performance of our investments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the investments by GIC and Temasek perform poorly in a financial year, could this affect the expected long-term real rate of return in the next financial year, which would then affect the amount of funds available to the Government to use in helping Singaporeans?&nbsp; It will be even more unsatisfactory to Singaporeans, if they learn of more big investments using their reserves that do badly, and are told by the Government that it does not micro-manage GIC or Temasek and that they invest for the long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the answer given when the investment into Shin Corp was made, and when&nbsp;the investments into the financial institutions such as UBS, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were made, and many Singaporeans were not satisfied with that answer. We can expect them to be much more unhappy in similar cases in future, because their well-being could become much more directly affected by the performance of such investments. The Government will have to be much more conscious of this moving forward, and will have&nbsp;to better accommodate and address the concerns and questions of Singaporeans with regard to our reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 443<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have made some criticisms of the Bill, and have touched on some areas of concern that I hope the Minister can clarify.&nbsp; But there should be no mistake in whether I agree with the objectives of this Bill.&nbsp; I firmly do, and I endorse it even though I am not able to vote on it.&nbsp; With that, I support this Bill.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Firstly, the new approach could make the investment of GIC and MAS more transparent, a path that benefits Singapore to take,&nbsp;as it is a significant player among the sovereign wealth fund investors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, by including capital gains in the calculation, it will turn Singapore from a typically cash-rich, comfort-deprived individual who prefers money in the bank to a standard of living that a more generous use of savings can buy to one who lives comfortably yet continues to live within his means.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, there are enough safeguards against overspending, namely, (i) President has to assent to the long-term rate used for estimating what's available to be spent; (ii) only 50% of what is available will be spent as the 50% cap on maximum spending is retained even within the&nbsp;Net Investment Returns model; and (iii) not all the Net Investment Returns will be used for current expenditure for improving the hardware, such&nbsp;as transport infrastructure, and software, such as healthcare, education and&nbsp;to give more assistance to the low-income group of Singapore, and could be regarded as capital investment for the future with their own future returns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is some concern, as expressed by some colleagues before me, <p align=left>Column: 444<p>that long-term rate used to determine what is available for spending may over-shoot or under-shoot the real outcomes, and, hence, Government could be spending more than is available in bad years and underspend in good years.&nbsp; Sir, underspending should not be any reason for concern if it means that the future&nbsp;turns out to be more bountiful than projected.&nbsp; However, if under-projection becomes the norm, then we know that the formula and those providing the scenarios may need to be fine-tuned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the real area for concern is when the mismatch between projection and outcome is due to over optimism and Singapore is spending more than its investments are yielding.&nbsp; Even then, the 50% bar will ensure that overspending will not be to an extent that eats into the capital and the capital gains within the reserves.&nbsp; Perhaps one way to even out the feast or famine situation and also to reflect that in international markets where high volatility is currently the norm and where it is not always possible to make long-term projections with nano accuracy is for us to have an equalisation fund.&nbsp; Such a fund, Sir, would drain off the excess from under-projected returns in years of plenty to supplement the lean years when projected returns are far above what materialise eventually.&nbsp; However, given that long-term rates covering 15 to 20 years will be used, representing, as the Minister had earlier mentioned, several business cycles of today's fast-moving business world, it is likely that the outliers would be moderated and there would not be wild swings between actual and projected returns from year to year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to suggest another potential alternative&nbsp;for the use of Net Investment Returns as a formula for budgeting due to the risks involved.&nbsp; To address the volatility of earnings and, hence, its impact on Government's <p align=left>Column: 445<p>spending, perhaps we can retain the use of Net Investment Income as the basis for our budgeting.&nbsp; However, capital gains and losses could be included in the calculation of net investment income.&nbsp; We can also include a new provision that requires parliamentary or presidential approval for the Government to draw down amounts exceeding 50% cap on Net Investment Income.&nbsp; This approach would ensure a measure of safety in that our budget is still based on money that has been received but allows for flexibility should the need arise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture, Sir, I wish to register a few points.&nbsp; One is on the sentiment from some Singaporeans.&nbsp; I am concerned with the public perception of the timing of introducing this Constitutional amendment as, at one time, it was decided to lock the reserves.&nbsp; Subsequently, the Government unlocked the reserves.&nbsp; Now, with the deepening financial crisis, any change made at this stage may lead people to perceive that the Government is in a financial mess.&nbsp; It is, therefore, important that the Government address this point with the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to suggest that provisions be made for an annual review to be carried out by an independent body to check whether Net Investment Return when implemented, in effect, eats into the reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much will the change from the regime of Net Investment Income or Net Investment Returns raise the amount of money available to the Government in absolute terms is another question which I hope the Minister would be able to throw some light on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 446<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, like colleagues before me, I would also like to ask why have Temasek's assets been entirely excluded from the Net Investment Returns regime.&nbsp; Should these assets at least be included in the changes that deem as realised capital gains directly attributable&nbsp;as part of the past reserves?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, Sir, I&nbsp;would also like to stress on the need to eliminate wastage and unnecessary expenditure and for us to look for ways to ensure&nbsp;efficiency in generating income.&nbsp; For example, some of the unused buildings could generate rental income and be put to good productive use instead of being left&nbsp;unused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, in support of this Bill, I wish to reiterate that, of course, incomes like dividends and interest are usually more predictable than the growth in the value of an investment and what the capital gains realised may be should the investment be sold.&nbsp; Still, dividends and interest income do not operate in vacuum and are related to market and economic performances.&nbsp; Injecting the capital gains component into what is available from the country's reserves would provide us with&nbsp;a useful third leg in the pool of funds&nbsp;available to support the Government's annual budget spending especially in a slowing economy in the next few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I would like to support the&nbsp;Bill.</p></P></span></div>									       		<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      					<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE:::447--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

These signages are positioned to allow motorists to choose whether to pass through the gantry or use another road.&nbsp; For example, motorists travelling on the East Coast Parkway (ECP) towards the city in the morning will see a sign informing them of the gantry ahead before the Fort Road exit. Motorists can take the Fort Road exit if they do not wish to pass through the ERP gantry on the ECP.&nbsp; Whenever LTA implements a new ERP gantry, extra signages are provided in the initial period of implementation.&nbsp; In addition, the Expressway Monitoring Advisory System (EMAS) Travel Information Displays (TID) are also used to inform motorists when the ERP is in operation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, we think it is better for motorists to plan their route and take into account ERP before the start of any journey. Hence, LTA informs the public ahead of time before making any changes to the ERP system.&nbsp; The location and operational hours of each ERP gantry are available in LTA's website and, when significant changes to ERP system are made, extensive publicity through the print media is also used to reach out to motorists.

First, we will focus on prevention, especially on diabetes management to reduce the incidence of kidney failure.&nbsp; This means getting all diabetic patients to adopt a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; Second, we will focus on raising kidney transplant rate through promoting and supporting altruistic kidney donation by both cadavers and related living donors.&nbsp; We have some way to go, as compared to, say, Spain and Norway.&nbsp; These must be the main sources of kidneys for transplantation.&nbsp; Specifically, I will come back to this House to amend the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) in 3 areas: (a) lift the HOTA age limit, (b) allow pair-matched transplants by living donors, (c) support the welfare of donors, including financial reimbursement to cover the additional expenses that they have to incur as a result of their kidney donation. These would include costs such as for additional medical care, loss of income and higher insurance premiums.&nbsp; Such reimbursement is best done by a voluntary welfare organisation, which will need to raise funds from the public to support such a mission.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reimbursement to kidney donors is to help protect donor welfare and reduce the barriers against kidney donation.

These are described as "lifestyle diseases", as they are often due to modern lifestyle, in contrast with infectious diseases which were the main killers 40 years ago.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides causing death, they are also the main causes for morbidity or ill-health.&nbsp; Together with diabetes and mental disorders, these five diseases account for more than 70% of disease burden, contributing to the bulk of our patients in the clinics and the hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key control strategy is prevention: keeping Singaporeans healthy through healthy lifestyle, and managing the chronic diseases to avoid future complications. This is particularly urgent as the continued ageing of our population will only worsen the problem. My Ministry will ramp up the preventive effort and allocate more resources to support the increased emphasis. There are two main programmes: public education through the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and a systematic disease management programme through hospitals and clinics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The budget for HPB has increased by 40% since its establishment in 2001, to around $100 million this year. But HPB can only be a catalyst, working through partners like the schools, sports council, employers and the community organizations.&nbsp; The total national budget on health promotion is, therefore, much bigger than what is reflected on HPB's financial statements.&nbsp; But this is money worth spending if we can get more Singaporeans to adopt a healthy lifestyle: eat less, exercise more and do not smoke.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts have had some success.

More employers have joined the Employer Alliance, which is a network of corporations committed to creating a work environment that enhances work-life harmony. Its membership has more than doubled this year, from 194 members at the beginning of the year to 451 as at 30th September 2008.&nbsp; This is a positive development which shows that businesses are seeing value in good work-life practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also seeing good progress at the Tripartite Committee on Work-Life Strategy, which I chair.&nbsp; For this year's Work-Life Excellence Award, the Tricom has seen 10% more applications compared to 2006, as well as a significant improvement in the quality of applicants. We recognised 60 companies from various industries and of different sizes for their success in helping employees manage work and life responsibilities. The Work-Life Conference in August this year also saw strong interest from the business and HR <p align=left>Column: 459<p>community with more than 600 participants. As at 30th September this year, the Work-Life Works! Fund (or WoW! Fund), which provides subsidies to help employers implement work-life strategies, has benefited over 450 companies of which over 90% are SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of work-week patterns, MOM's 2006 survey found the five-day work-week to be the increasingly prevalent work pattern in Singapore, with close to two in five, or 40% of full-time private-sector employees working&nbsp;five days a week, up from 34% in 2004.&nbsp; If those working more than&nbsp;five days a week, but with a regular Saturday off are included, the figure is about 49%.&nbsp; The public sector has implemented the five-day work-week since 2004.&nbsp; The proportion of private sector establishments with formal flexible work arrangements also grew from 16% in 1998, 20% in 2004 to 23% in 2006.&nbsp; The trends show that a growing number of employers have implemented work-life programmes, including flexible work arrangements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The promotional approach, with strong tripartite commitment, is working.&nbsp; Mandating flexible work arrangements is not practical nor desirable as it imposes unnecessary rigidity on the labour market.&nbsp; This is because the needs of individual employees and that of their employers vary from company to company.&nbsp; It is therefore better for companies to introduce appropriate work-life strategies based on their own situation that are practical and sustainable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For the student, such qualifications also are highly valued by industry and attract better pay.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why courses in Science and Technology related disciplines already receive higher subsidies compared to other general disciplines.&nbsp; To facilitate, universities also provide more spaces into Science and Technology disciplines, which make up about 55% of total enrolment.&nbsp; Scholarships from public sector agencies are also skewed towards providing for students from these disciplines.&nbsp; Currently, about 61% of the scholars holding scholarships from public sector agencies are from the Science and Technology disciplines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The bond periods for these scholarships range from&nbsp;three to&nbsp;six years, and reflect the value of the scholarship provided as well as the talent development plans of the parent organisation.&nbsp;

Within the existing curriculum, subjects such as Social Studies and Civics and Moral Education promote environmental awareness and responsibility.&nbsp; Through discussions, hands-on activities and self reflection, students learn to appreciate the natural environment and about ways to protect it.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental education is a key focus in Geography which is compulsory subject at the lower secondary level.&nbsp; At the lower secondary level, students study about managing the changing environment in topics like land supply, water resources, pollution, global warming and ozone depletion.&nbsp; At the upper secondary level, students study about climate change, resource depletion, food security, environmental management and sustainable development.&nbsp; These topics are discussed using real-world examples and case studies drawn from both the developed and developing countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the classroom, there are several programmes and activities to help raise students' awareness and appreciation of the environment and its management.&nbsp; The Community Involvement Programme in many schools involve students in taking care of the school environment, waste minimisation and nature conservation.&nbsp; Schools have Environmental Clubs whereby students undertake environmental projects like recycling in the schools and the neighbourhoods and participate in programmes like the Seashore Life Programme by NEA and HBSC and the Adopt-A-Park Scheme by NParks.&nbsp; Our schools have also participated in activities such as Clean and Green Week and Earth Day.&nbsp; They have also taken part in competitions like the Green Wave Environmental Care Competition organised by Sembawang Shipyard and National Weather Study Project (NWSP) Competition sponsored by Senoko Power Limited.&nbsp; In the 2007 NWSP Competition, about 67% of our schools took part in the competition.&nbsp; Through their participation in the NWSP Competition, our students are better able to relate the impact of climate change to their daily activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Prof. Kalyani K Mehta </B>asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs in view of the need for a rooted local populace in Singapore, whether the future immigration policies will be tightened since our recent population statistics reveal that citizens comprise only 65% of the total population.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of June 2008, Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (PRs) account for 75% of our total population, with Citizens making up 65%. The balance, our non-resident population, comprises transient foreigners working, studying and living in Singapore.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By far, foreign manpower accounts for the largest proportion of our non-resident population. These are foreigners who are here on a transient basis to take up jobs in sectors which our local manpower is not able to fill. The size of our foreign workforce is not fixed.&nbsp; It depends on the state of our economy, and also on other global factors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last few years, there has been a strong demand for manpower in sectors such as construction and marine.&nbsp; Hence, the size of our foreign workforce has increased.&nbsp; Without them, our industries would have been handicapped and we would not have been able to achieve robust levels of growth.&nbsp; Overall, our flexible foreign workforce policies have enabled us to maintain a critical competitive edge over competing economies by allowing companies to expand their workforce quickly to capitalise on opportunities, at the same time creating more and better jobs for our citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To survive and prosper as a nation, we need to maintain a core group of Singaporeans committed to our long term future.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main challenge is our low fertility rate.&nbsp; Over the last decade, we have introduced measures to encourage Singaporeans to get married and have children.&nbsp; These measures have helped to facilitate a more pro-family environment, but despite this, we do not expect our total fertility rate to reach the replacement rate of 2.1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our resident population and workforce would decline rapidly if we close our doors to immigrants or substantially reduce inflows. This would have serious repercussions on our ability to maintain our standard of living.&nbsp; Encouraging immigration is therefore a key strategy which we must continue to pursue.&nbsp; Beyond population imperatives, immigrants inject new ideas and dynamism into society.&nbsp; Many countries, such as the United States and Australia, have benefited greatly from having absorbed a diverse group of immigrants.&nbsp; Singapore itself is an immigrant society and we would not be where we are today if not for the contributions of our immigrants over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today's globalised world, human capital is extremely mobile, particularly the talented and driven.&nbsp; Our current economic and social conditions make us an attractive immigration destination for many nationalities around the world.&nbsp; It is important that we leverage on our strengths and continue to attract talented people to settle here, as we drive towards building a knowledge economy.&nbsp; To restrict the number of foreign talents who are prepared to immigrate would be counter-productive and not in our long term interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 465<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we recognise that some Singaporeans may feel threatened by the number of immigrants that Singapore is absorbing.&nbsp; This is a natural human response.&nbsp; However, Singaporeans should be assured that this Government will always consider the interests of Singaporeans first.&nbsp; This is reflected in the way our policies are crafted, from healthcare and housing to education and other social policies.&nbsp; While we welcome immigrants to our shores, our own people are always closest to our hearts.&nbsp; We will ensure that there remains a sizeable group of Singaporeans which will form the core of our society&nbsp;&ndash; people who are here for the long haul, who will stand fast in times of difficulty, but who will also be first to enjoy the fruits of our success.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><p align=left>Column: 467<p><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank Dr Lateef for her interest in the Singapore Biennale (SB), which is into its second edition this year. The SB 2008, as Singapore's premier international contemporary visual arts show, is important in furthering our vision to position Singapore as a culturally vibrant international arts hub. SB 2008 continues to have a strong focus on community outreach and engagement, with programmes to reach out to Singaporeans and encourage appreciation for and participation in contemporary visual arts.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the SB 2008 is still ongoing, it is too early for us to assess the public response and outcome for the event. Nonetheless, MICA can provide a broad comparison of the 2006 and 2008 editions at this point in time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The SB 2008 continues the general programming direction of SB 2006, featuring predominantly Asian artists, and showcasing the best that Singapore and the region have to offer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to the 2006 edition, the SB 2008 provides excellent opportunities for Singapore artists, curators and art businesses to exchange and collaborate with the international visual arts community. Many of the Singaporean artists who exhibited in the 2006 Biennale have been selected for other international exhibitions. The current crop of Singaporean artists has also garnered a lot of international interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2008 Biennale has incorporated useful learning points from the inaugural Biennale experience in 2006. For example, taking into account the general feedback that SB 2006's 19 exhibition venues were too dispersed and challenging for both curators and visitors, the 2008 Biennale is more accessible with artworks exhibited at centrally located venues such as the former City Hall, South Beach Development and the Central Promontory Site. Outdoor exhibits have also been installed at the Esplanade Bridge, Raffles City and the Singapore Flyer to bring about greater artistic vibrancy and excitement to the streets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a new arts educational and outreach initiative under the SB 2008 aimed at strengthening engagement in the arts among the young. For example, the Kids' Biennale has successfully attracted more than 8,000 students from 35 schools. SB 2008 is also extending its reach to children with special needs as part of the objective of making visual arts accessible to everyone in society. In addition, the SB this year has made special efforts to engage the different ethnic groups and senior citizens by including guides trained to conduct tours in Malay, Tamil and even Chinese dialects such as Hokkien and Cantonese.&nbsp; There are also English, Mandarin and Japanese tour guides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at end September 2008, the Biennale has attracted a total visitorship of about 20,000 for the three main exhibition venues. This is an encouraging sign as the figure is comparable with that of SB 2006 for the same duration, although the latter had more exhibits and exhibition venues. Visitors to the Biennale this year have commented that "... this time, the pieces are more imaginative and inspiring ...

This includes consulting closely with the Biennale's partners and supporters, as well as taking into consideration the audience needs and public feedback received for the event.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:HOUSING OF FOREIGN WORKERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:HOUSING OF FOREIGN WORKERS:::470--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 469<p><B><P>HOUSING OF FOREIGN WORKERS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Number of sites--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Number of sites)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak </B>asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many sites are currently being used to house foreign workers and where are these sites located; (b) how many more sites are required and what are the new areas being considered; and (c) which constituencies do not have any foreign dormitories at all.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign workers from the various industries have a number of housing options.&nbsp; They can rent residential premises or stay in permanent dormitories, factory-converted dormitories and dormitories at construction sites.&nbsp; These are located all over the island.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are currently 25 permanent dormitories and these are located across the island, mainly within and near the fringe of industrial estates in the West, East, North, Northeast and Central planning regions.&nbsp; The Government has released 11 sites for dormitory development since Feb 2007.&nbsp; Majority of these sites are located in the West and North regions.&nbsp; To meet the immediate housing shortage, we are studying a number of vacant state lands and vacant state properties for the development of temporary dormitories.&nbsp; These are also located across different regions in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When identifying sites for workers' dormitories, we have to take into account the land use context and technical feasibility of the available sites.&nbsp; While we have sought to spread the dormitory developments in various parts of the island, it is not possible to work towards a totally equal distribution of these dormitories across various constituencies in Singapore.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:LIFT UPGRADING PROGRAMME--><!--END_COL_TITLE:LIFT UPGRADING PROGRAMME:::472--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 469<p><B><P>LIFT UPGRADING PROGRAMME</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Options for lift shaft design and construction--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Options for lift shaft design and construction)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak </B>asked the Minister for National Development besides the conventional concrete cover for the lift shaft as part of the Lift Upgrading Programme (a) what are the other different options for lift shaft designs and construction methods; (b) what is the difference in each of these designs and methods; and (c) what is the difference in the construction cost for each of these designs.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has been continually exploring the use of new materials and technologies to ensure that the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) is carried out in a cost-effective manner. To this end, we have switched from the use of conventional concrete to lighter materials such as ferroconcrete and steel in the construction of new lift shafts.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 471<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weight reduction for both ferroconcrete lift shafts and steel lift shafts results in substantial savings in terms of foundation design and piling cost. The cost of a ferroconcrete lift shaft in a typical 11-storey LUP block is about $386,000&nbsp;(1) each. The cost of a steel lift shaft is about $350,000 each. This is about 6%-15% lower than the cost of a conventional concrete lift shaft, estimated to be around $410,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the steel lift shaft is cheaper than ferroconcrete lift shafts, HDB has used only steel lift shafts for its LUP works since March 2007.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
