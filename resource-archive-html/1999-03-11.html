<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTION SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of tax implications)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching</b> asked the Minister for Finance if

his  Ministry  will review the tax implications of the  Employee

Share  Option  Scheme  to  make the scheme  more  attractive  to

employees.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  under our current tax system, when  an  employee

exercises his share option and a gain is realised, the  gain  is

taxable as an employment benefit in the same way as other  forms

of  income  such as salary.  The taxable benefit  would  be  the

difference  between  the exercise price of the  shares  and  the

market price of the shares when issued to the employee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tax treatment of employee share options is similar to

that  in Hong Kong, US and UK which also impose tax at the point

of  exercise.   However,  the US and UK have  qualified/approved

share option schemes in which tax is levied at the point of sale

as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>

capital  gains at the capital gains tax rate, which is different

from the above tax rate.  But such capital gains schemes are not

applicable in Singapore as we do not tax gains on capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry of Finance is studying possible

options  to  facilitate  the use of employee  share  options  to

promote entrepreneurship, and this is something which we will do

over the next few months.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> I wish to ask the

Minister when will this study be completed.  He mentioned  "over

the next few months".

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not wish to give the Member a

promise  at  this stage.  But we will do it within a  reasonable

period.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>HYGIENE RATING SCHEME FOR EATING ESTABLISHMENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching</b> asked the Minister for the Environment if

the  Hygiene Rating Scheme for eating establishments has been  a

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek bin Saniff) (for the Minister for the Environment):   Sir,

the  purpose of the grading system of cooked food retail outlets

is  to  give consumers an idea of the outlet's level of  hygiene

and  cleanliness  standards, as assessed  by  my  Ministry.  The

system is also intended to prompt the operator to improve or  to

maintain  the  high standard he already has  achieved.   I  must

inform the House in this respect, the scheme has worked well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scheme was first introduced in May 1998, 7,171

food outlets (or 34.5% of all food outlets) were graded "A"  and

"B".   The number of these two categories has increased to 8,313

(or  38.7%),  an  increase of 4.2% of grade "A" and  grade  "B".

Generally,  feedback  from  both the  public  as  well  as  food

retailers has been very positive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I wish to ask the Senior Minister

of  State  whether he will tell the House the criteria  for  the

assessment and how frequent is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>

assessment  made  and whether MOE can step up its  frequency  of

review and assessment of the food establishments.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> There are only two important

criteria.   Sir,  first,  the  hygiene  of  the  person  who  is

involved.   The second criterion is the standard of  cleanliness

of that outlet.  Generally, we assess the shop or outlet once  a

year.   But  there  is leeway for him to make  it  earlier,  for

instance,  the food outlet may request for reassessment  if  his

premises undergoes extensive renovation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> I think the Senior Minister of State

has   not  answered  my  second  question.   I  have  one  other

supplementary question and, that is, whether the location of the

food establishment is one of the criteria.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> We have never stipulated that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> How about the frequency of review?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> It is once a year, or when they

have spent a lot of money on renovation, they can call us and we

will consider it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Would the Senior Minister of State

step  up the frequency of review to, say, twice a year in  order

to uphold the standard of hygiene?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> As of now, it is once a year. But

for  those with "D" grade, we allow them an earlier review,  for

instance, once in three months.  For the rest, in order  to  see

how  good  they are, we give them up to one year.  But  if  they

have  extensive renovation, they can just write a letter  to  my

Ministry and we will assess them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Would the Minister consider requests

by   CCCs  or  constituencies  inviting  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment  to  go in to review the food establishment  as  and

when necessary?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> You are not talking about one

outlet.  You are talking about the whole area or centre.  We may

consider the request.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head N (cont.) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [10th March, 1999],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head N of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Shriniwas Rai].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head N - Ministry of Finance. Amendment No.

(1).  Mr Leong and Mr Chng are not here.  Mr Chuang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like

to  request permission to circulate a table.  [Copies  of  Table

distributed to hon. Members].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along, the Singapore Government has subscribed to the

policy  of having an open economy.  It believes that a free  and

fair market will derive the most benefits for the nation in  the

long run.  The recent incident whereby TAS asked SingTel to show

cause  why  their  latest  pricing was  not  predatory  and  the

subsequent heated debate in this House affirmed the belief  that

the  Government  has always wanted to ensure  that  the  playing

field is level, and free and fair market is maintained.  At  the

administrative level, this belief has been translated  into  the

Government  procurement policy and implemented  by  the  Finance

Ministry all these years and,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>

that is, in any public open tender, the bids must be competitive

and the award goes to the lowest bid with substantial compliance

with the specifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have studied economics, this procurement

policy can be said to meet the requirements for optimum consumer

and   producer  benefits  based  on  the  assumptions  that  the

following conditions are met:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There must be a large number of competitors;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The competitors are about the same size;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The competitors are provided with the same information;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The competitors will have the same product quality; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Free entry and free exit for all competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one or more of these conditions are not satisfied, the

outcome  may  not  be  optimum.  The  interference  by  TAS  was

actually trying to make sure that all these conditions are  met.

However, in other segments of the economy, particularly  in  the

construction industry where most of the development  funds  will

be  spent,  I  observe  that the players repeatedly  deviate  or

attempt to deviate from these conditions for their own benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare my interest here. One typical

example of violating free entry conditions is the process of pre-qualification  where unreasonable conditions are set  to  reduce

the  number  of  competitors.   Another  example  would  be  the

predatory  pricing  policy  practised  by  almost  all   foreign

contractors.  The table distributed earlier shows that six local

construction companies with a turnover of $6.6 billion  reported

a  profit  of  2.8% and paid a tax of 1%, that is, $46  million.

But  seven  Japanese companies with a turnover of $6.1  billion,

which is almost the same as the local companies, reported a loss

of  $201  million and paid a tax of 0.4%, that is, $24  million.

What is worse is that three Korean companies with a turnover  of

$4.6  billion reported a loss of $300 million and paid a tax  of

$14,869.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>

One Chinese company and one French company also reported losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, anyone who reads this report, which is extracted from

our  ROC,  will straightaway recognise that all these firms  are

either  poorly managed, or they carry out dumping, or  they  are

practising  transfer  pricing, or doing  a  combination  of  the

three.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Finance Minister whether it is his

policy  to  allow this to happen.  I wish to highlight  to  this

House that dumping and transfer pricing are predatory in nature.

It  helps these firms to increase their ability to grab projects

at  all  times,  and thereby crowding out the  local  firms  who

honestly price the projects and pay their taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise the question why these foreign

firms  could sustain huge losses year after year.  Do they still

meet  our  CIDB's  registration requirement?  And  if  they  are

branch  offices,  is their head office still  a  viable  entity?

Sir, let me look at this issue from another angle.  I would like

to  bring up a point made by the Finance Minister two days  ago.

In  his reply to Mr Lim Swee Say, he mentioned that at our stage

of  development,  he  would  like  to  have  more  aesthetically

designed buildings and these buildings should also be built  for

easy  maintenance.  He has in fact brought home the  point  that

his  Ministry  believes in paying for good value,  and  not  the

cheapest.  Hence, again, I agree with Mr Lim that we should save

but we should go further by stretching our dollar to the fullest

from  the present and future benefits.  And that is to  say,  in

financial  terms,  the price we are paying  should  be  the  net

present  value  of present and future benefits.  Aesthetics,  as

mentioned by the Minister, can be classified as present  benefit

and ease of maintenance is of course our future benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to urge that the Finance Ministry build into the

procurement  system  more  measures to  incorporate  some  other

benefits and these benefits can assist SMEs to build capability,

just like our previous policy on CONQUAS;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>

to  create  jobs;  to  acquire and retain  knowledge;  to  build

community bonding and to be environmentally friendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members of this House have brought up this issue in

the first two days.  Here, I am suggesting a mechanism where all

wishes can be fulfilled and yet we still get the most benefit of

an  open  and fair market.  By not sticking to the lowest  price

method,  we  can  adopt the bidding model based  on  performance

specifications  or the design-and-build specifications  to  meet

the WTO requirements and to get the most benefit.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Chuang, could you wind up because

we  need  to allow time for the Minister to reply to about  nine

Members?  If you use up all the time, I am afraid there will  be

no more time for reply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Yes, Sir. I hope the Minister can see

that  there is a need to change our mindset and again I want  to

ask,  in  line with the call by Mr Lim Swee Say, that we  change

the  mindset of our people.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock has called on the

Government  to care for the people, in the light of our  foreign

talent policy.  I would also like to echo his call by asking the

Government  to  care  for  the  SMEs  in  the  light  of  unfair

competition from overseas.  With Government accounting for  more

than 50 cents for each dollar spent in Singapore, the Government

can  show  that it cares by changing its mindset,  that  is,  it

should be left to market forces.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I will respond to questions

raised  yesterday, beginning with Mr Lim Swee Say.  Mr  Lim  has

asked  whether Government could consider granting pioneer status

or   special  investment  allowances  to  companies  which   are

proceeding to move into the knowledge-based industries, as  this

is  the future we envisage for our country.  I can assure Mr Lim

that  the  Government recognises the need to transform Singapore

into a knowledge-based economy so that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>

have been constantly revising our incentives to try to meet  new

requirements.  For example, in the 1998 Budget, I  have  already

announced   an  Approved  Cyber  Trading  incentive  scheme   to

encourage  companies  to  take advantage  of  trading  over  the

Internet and several other existing tax incentives, such as  the

pioneer  status, the Development Expansion incentive and  double

tax  deductions for research and development, already  cater  to

companies  engaged in high-value activities in  high  technology

projects  which  should  also  cover  the  knowledge-based  type

industries.   Indicators  such as value-added  per  worker,  the

profile of the workers and the level of research and development

spending are already currently being used to evaluate the awards

of these incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I should point out that to achieve what we aim to do,

the  tax incentives granted must be focused.  Otherwise, we will

be  giving  away money without any specific objective  in  mind.

For  example,  if  we simply give tax incentives  for  whichever

company  claims  to be investing in manpower redevelopment,  the

dispensation of such tax advantages would be too broad  to  have

any direct focus or desired outcome.  However, agencies such  as

the  Economic Development Board can leverage on the granting  of

tax  incentives  to  get  companies to  upgrade  their  manpower

capabilities  and  my Ministry is also always open  to  consider

specific  proposals  to  incentivise  manpower  development  and

upgrading  and  I would ask Mr Lim to let us have  his  specific

views  which we will consider.  I can assure him that they  will

be  well-received.   But we need to know  specifically  what  is

needed,  and in which directions should we give these incentives

because  it  is  obviously not possible to try  and  give  broad

incentives  covering all sectors because that will  be  far  too

costly.   As Mr Lim himself has said, there are already referral

schemes   by   Government  to  facilitate  and  fund  continuous

learning,  but  more  can  be done if this  is  necessary.   The

Manpower  21  Committee is also looking  into  ways  to  promote

lifelong learning and upgrading in our workforce.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has raised the issue of helping our local

traders grow by providing trade financing.  He is quite right in

saying that small traders form an important part of our economy,

and, therefore we should try and help them whenever we can,  and

many of these had been hit by the present downturn.  However, he

has suggested that Government should provide financing along the

lines  of the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) for trading

activities.  Alternatively, Government should arrange for  local

banks or international banks to provide low-cost loans for  such

purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that the commercial market for trade

financing  in  Singapore  is  already  very  well-developed  and

efficient, since trading has been a long established part of our

economy  and our entire banking infrastructure is geared  up  to

service  this  sector.   As such, I do  not  see  there  is  any

compelling reason why Government should intervene and extend the

LEFS  scheme into the trading sector.  But if he can  put  up  a

specific proposal, we would welcome it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also indicated that Hong Kong

provides tax exemption for third country trade done outside  the

economy by a company in Hong Kong.  I should point out that Hong

Kong  has a different tax rule from Singapore.  Such income will

be  regarded as a foreign source income and therefore not  taxed

in  Hong  Kong.  In the case of Singapore, such income would  be

taxed  if  it is carried out by a company in Singapore  as  this

would  be  regarded  as Singapore source  income.   However,  to

promote  offshore  trading,  we have  introduced  tax  incentive

schemes  such as Approved Oil Traders and Approved International

Traders  Schemes.   Under these schemes,  income  from  offshore

trades  carried  out  by  approved  traders  are  taxed   at   a

concessionary  rate  of  10%.  These schemes  are  open  to  all

companies,  whether local or foreign, as long as they  meet  the

approval criteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai has asked for a review of the tax on the

sale  of  property.  Tax rules were changed in  May  1996  as  a

measure to dampen property speculation.  The key

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>

change  was to impose capital gains tax on property sold  within

three  years.   At  this point of time, we do not  think  it  is

necessary to remove this restriction because genuine home buyers

should not be disturbed by this requirement.  They ought not  to

be  selling their property within three years. In any case,  the

tax  is on a sliding scale.  What we are concerned about is,  if

this measure is lifted now, and the property sector recovers, we

will  be faced with the same problem again and will have to  re-introduce a new set of regulations.  For the time being, I would

prefer to leave it be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has raised concern over the administration

of  GST,  particularly  in the cashflow problems  faced  by  the

smaller  companies and she has asked that the  Government  could

perhaps streamline these procedures to help them.  I would  like

to  say that the Government has already several schemes to  help

ease  the  cashflow  burden of these businesses,  including  the

SMEs,  and these include the Major Exporters Scheme, the  Bonded

Warehouse  Scheme and companies with MES status could  have  GST

suspended  on  imports.   In  my  FY99  Budget  speech,  I  also

announced  two  new  schemes to help contract manufacturers  and

traders who are operating as logistics companies.  I do not want

to spend any more time on this issue because my time is limited.

But  if  Mrs  Lim  is interested, I can provide  her  with  more

details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has raised questions on whether we should

not be amending the Companies Act as a comprehensive overhaul of

the Companies Act is long overdue.  I agree with Mr Sin that the

Companies  Act  has to be amended regularly to ensure  that  its

ambit  does  not fall behind comparable jurisdictions elsewhere.

In  particular, it should be updated to ensure the provisions do

not  inhibit  or  place obstacles in the path  of  new  economic

activities.   This is especially important at the  present  time

when  we  are  trying  to  restructure rapidly  to  a  knowledge

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin has also suggested that we scrutinize changes made

in other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>

countries such as Australia.  We will indeed be looking  at  all

the  new schemes which other jurisdictions have proposed to help

smaller  companies and we will incorporate whatever we  consider

appropriate.  Instead of embarking on a comprehensive review  of

the  Act, it is more prudent and practical to progress in stages

to  improve  the Act and to introduce changes which  are  needed

urgently,  rather than try to do a comprehensive review  all  at

once  as this will take quite a long time.  Otherwise, the total

overhaul  of the Act  at this time will hold back other  changes

unnecessarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also raised questions with regard to

changes in our tax laws.  He said that our current tax laws  are

too  restrictive and inflexible.  Mr Heng Chiang  Meng,  in  his

Budget  debate speech, also called for a full review of our  tax

system  to  ensure  that  it  is totally  business-friendly  and

supportive  of the economy's broad goals.  I can understand  why

Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Heng are being deliberately provocative

in  making  these  appeals.  Clearly, in these difficult  times,

they  want as much help as possible for our companies,  which  I

think  is  very  laudable.   But I  hope  that  they  will  also

understand  that the Ministry of Finance, in responding  to  the

needs  of businesses, has also to cater to the needs of a  wider

constituency  which  is  to safeguard  the  Government's  fiscal

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help businesses, we can cut taxes, increase rebates and relax

our regulations.  But there is a point beyond which we cannot go

without  fore-going  too much revenue and  allow  too  much  tax

leakage,  leading  to permanent budget deficits.   Striking  the

correct balance is not an easy process but I believe that up  to

now, we have not done too bad a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that we look at our tax system in totality

when making comparisons with tax systems elsewhere.  One has  to

look   at  the  overall  effective  tax  burden  on  businesses,

determine  the  competitiveness of our tax regime,  rather  than

comparing a particular feature in a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>

tax system with another.  Compared to many countries, we have  a

simple  tax  system  which is not onerous  in  compliance.   Our

income  tax rates are low.  We do not tax foreign source  income

until  it is remitted.  We do not have a capital gains tax  such

as  in  countries like the United Kingdom and the United  States

and  we allow full imputation for corporate tax.  This has  made

our  effective  corporate  tax  burden  low  compared  to  other

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to stress that the Ministry of Finance and the IRAS

review  our  tax structure regularly with the changing  business

environment  and aims to achieve a tax regime that is  conducive

and  friendly to business.  This is our main aim and if  Members

have constructive ideas, these will be always welcome subject to

the  caveats I have stated earlier.  Any changes we make are not

done  in  isolation but always in consultation with our economic

agencies and frequently with feedback from the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also puts forward seven specific proposals in

great detail.  I am afraid that I do not have time to deal  with

these  in full and I suggest that I give him a written reply  so

that he at least gets a proper response.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I think the House

must  be  grateful to the Minister for giving very comprehensive

replies. He has offered a written response to Mr Inderjit  Singh

and I hope that he would also give Mr Chuang a written reply  as

well.  With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head U, Ministry of National Development.

Amendment No. (1), Mr Lew Syn Pau.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this time last year, when I spoke on the state of the

property market, the property price index of private residential

properties  had  only dropped about 16% from  its  peak  in  the

second  quarter of 1996.  Prices were then back to the level  of

the first quarter of 1995.  Since then, with the full impact  of

the  regional economic crisis felt, it is estimated that by  the

end  of  last year, prices have corrected by about 40% from  the

peak, and this has brought prices back to the 1993 levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter of grave concern to many. While deflating

property  values  can  help  improve  Singapore's  international

competitive  position, drastic asset price  correction  of  this

scale can trigger negative multiplier effects on consumption and

investment.  It also imposes an additional strain on the banking

sector  as  many  credit lines are secured by  property  assets.

Calls  for  top ups by banks and finance companies not  met  can

lead  to  reduction in credit lines, defaulting loans, corporate

failures  and  personal bankruptcies.  The consequences  on  the

economy can be disastrous, as business failures can lead to mass

unemployment and social unrest, as we have seen in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, in my view, it is the duty of Government

to  do its utmost to stabilise the property market.  Despite the

actions  taken  by  the  Government so far,  such  as  deferring

Government   land  sales  programmes,  extending   the   project

completion period for Government land sale sites to eight  years

and so on, according to the property consultants, the prices are

still  falling  against a backdrop of fewer transactions.   This

problem  is obviously a very complex one caused by the  regional

economic  crisis, poor sentiments, tight liquidity, over  supply

of space and, of course, high land values.  It is just a problem

of mismatch between the demand and supply.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to property consultants, on the supply side, the

effective  potential  supply of residential  property  is  about

30,000  units.  The average take up rate, however, is  estimated

to  be only 6,000 units per annum.  This means it will take five

years, ie, until the year 2003, for the current potential supply

of  30,000  units  to  be absorbed.  I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether he agrees with these estimates put up  by  the

property  consultants and, if so, what are the implications  for

the  future  sale  of residential land.  Does it  mean  that  we

should defer land sales for a few more years beyond 1999?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the demand side, consultants have also estimated that by the

year  2000, effective total housing stock comprising both public

and  private units will be 875,000 units, exceeding the  housing

needs  of 797,000 units by 9%.  So there will be an excess stock

of  80,000 units.  Here again, I would like to ask the  Minister

whether  he agrees with these figures and, if so, what  are  the

implications for housing policy.  Would the Ministry review  the

total  housing  supply in a comprehensive  manner,  taking  into

account  the demographics of Singapore and let us know  what  is

the long-term sustainable supply that should be planned for?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister whether he thinks all

the  measures  currently in place are enough  to  stabilise  the

property  market,  and,  if not, what  new  measures  should  be

introduced.  Would the Government consider going into the market

to buy back the surplus land at current market prices and return

them  to  the  State land bank, or perhaps put them  into  other

alternative uses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion I made at the debate on the Budget

Statement  but  which was not given a specific response  by  the

Minister  for Finance is the possible waiver of stamp duty  paid

by  the purchaser until further notice.  Would the Minister look

into this proposal also?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee (West Coast):</b> Sir, I listened with great

interest what my GPC Chairman has said.  I totally disagree with

him.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1992 and 1996, property prices increased by well over

300%.   This  had  brought about a lot of  undesirable  effects.

Owning  a  private  residential property for most  Singaporeans,

became  an  impossible dream.  Our business costs also escalated

and  we  became  uncompetitive.  Our efforts to attract  foreign

talents  to  Singapore were also hampered, because the  cost  of

housing  had become a very serious stumbling block.   After  the

introduction  of  the  anti-speculation measures  in  May  1996,

coupled  with  the severe regional economic crisis,  prices  had

declined.  But the prices are still relatively high compared  to

other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property market has a tremendous impact on the economic

performance  of  the  country.  It has to be  properly  managed.

Therefore,  I  would  like  to urge the  Government  to  closely

monitor  the sale  of land.  As we know, the supply of  property

is  inelastic, given the gestation period necessary to bring the

supply  to  the  market.  I am concerned that if the  freeze  in

Government land sale is continued for too long, it might  result

in  a shortfall when demand picks up.  This can lead to a repeat

of the boom and bust cycle that is economically unproductive.  I

therefore urge the Government not to delay the sale of land  for

too long, in order to maintain greater stability in the property

market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, owning a private property is a very

desirable  ambition, and I think we should  encourage  it.   The

only  caveat is that in this country, the property market is  so

volatile.   If  we  take  1981 as a base,  a  terrace  house  in

Serangoon/Hougang  used to cost $40,000.   Ten  years  later  in

1991, it was $400,000,  10 times.  Nowhere in the world could we

have such a high appreciation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here this morning's Business Times. Let me quote Mr

Greenspan.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Based on a medium period of owning a home for nine years, that

each home sale since 1995 has averaged roughly US$35,000."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>

Here,  in  the height of the property speculation, the next  day

you can make $35,000.  This is dangerous and we should check it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some proposals for the Minister. There has been

some  success  with Executive Condominiums.  The Government,  at

the  moment,  is the biggest owner of land, and I  am  concerned

especially  with  99-year  leasehold properties.   The  cost  of

construction does not rise and fall very much.  It is almost  at

a very level position.  What the Government can help to make the

dream  become a reality is this - sell the land or possibly  the

HDB  could join forces with the private developers, and then  at

least you have some control over the market forces.  I know  the

Minister  will say that we should not interfere with the  market

sentiment.  But this is one suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is this perception in some Singaporeans

that we must buy a private home within 5-10 years.  I think this

perception  has  to change with the economic  reality.   I  must

especially applaud the Ministry, and the HDB in particular,  for

building very good housing.  I have been to other parts  of  the

world,  both  developed and developing, but I think our  housing

policy  has  been a resounding success.  Can we improve  on  it?

That is the question.  And if the HDB can carve out some of  its

older  5-room  and  HUDC blocks, build some swimming  pools  and

other  facilities, upgrade them into a real condominium, I think

many  Singaporeans will then stick with these flats  for  a  few

years and then move on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plea to the Minister, and in fairness to the other

Members,  is  this.  Watch the market and then have a  long-term

planning.   Do not act on short-term measures.  Take a long-term

planning.  After all, land is limited in Singapore.  And I share

the  sentiments of what Dr Wan Soon Bee has said  earlier.   The

property prices should not be too volatile.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in land scarce

Singapore,  land  will  always be costly if  sustained  economic

growth continues to generate a high demand for land.  That is  a

fact that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>

have to live with.  Having said that, it is important to examine

whether  there are other factors which contribute  to  the  high

cost of land and, if so, what can be done about it.  Mr Lew  Syn

Pau  and  Dr  Wan Soon Bee spoke about land sales and disagreed.

What I would like to speak about would be policy changes on  the

demand side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that there was a property bubble which started

from  about  the beginning of 1992 when there was a  discernible

escalation in property prices.  From the first quarter  of  1992

to  the  second  quarter  of  1996,  when  the  anti-speculation

measures  were  imposed, the residential  property  price  index

increased  by about 160%.  What this meant was that  a  property

which  costs  about  $1  million in 1992 would  have  cost  $2.6

million, some four years later.  On hindsight, the May 1996 anti-speculation  measures, by curbing the sky-rocketing of  property

prices,  also  helped prevent an even steeper  drop  during  the

financial  crisis which began to seriously affect  Singapore  in

early 1998.  That same piece of property which cost $2.6 million

in 1996 would have cost $1.4 million at the end of 1998.  And  I

think  that what three of the MPs before me have been saying  is

that  this  kind of up and down movement in property  prices  is

undesirable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason for the property bubble was the expectational

spiral.   When  prices started rising, the expectation  of  even

higher  prices  in future spurred demand, which in  turn  caused

prices  to increase in an ever increasing upward spiral.  During

that period, property was seen as a one way street to increasing

wealth,  much  faster  than  earning  a  salary.  However,   the

financial  crisis has taught us otherwise, and I  hope  that  we

learn this very important lesson that investment in property has

its risks and property prices can fall as well as rise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, expectation was not the only cause. Changes in

Government  policy  which were implemented  to  achieve  certain

specific objectives, such as home ownership, contributed to  the

increase in demand and hence the property price

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>

escalation.  For example, the price of a 4-room HDB resale  flat

rose  from about $96,000 in 1992 to over $260,000 in 1996. The

<br><br>1996&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost  Review  Committee  identified  two  factors   which

contributed  to this price escalation:  (1)  the  relaxation  of

mortgage  financing  rules  in  1993,  which  allowed  for  loan

financing  to be granted up to 80% of current valuation  instead

of the 1984 posted prices; and (2) the revised resale procedures

to ease cash upfront problems which occurred in 1995.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, it would be advisable that account be taken of the

possible  impact  on property prices before policy  changes  are

made.  The  property  price escalation has  another  undesirable

effect.  There was a time when property development was the best

business  in  town.   Every  large  company  in  Singapore   was

considering  property development even though its core  business

was  entirely  unrelated.  Although each company  should  decide

what  is best for its bottom line, I question whether, from  the

national  point  of  view,  this is a  desirable  allocation  of

business  resources.  The way to reduce this is not to interfere

at the company level but to ensure that the macro incentives are

conducive to a desirable pattern of resource allocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we need to do our best to ensure that the

property  bubble of the scale that was experienced in  the  past

does not occur again and, in particular, that policy changes  do

not inadvertently contribute to the development of the bubble.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, we have been hearing

many  calls  from many Members of this House and also  from  the

public  to ask the Minister to help the ailing property  market.

While  I  have  nothing against doing things to  strengthen  the

fundamentals to ensure a solid base for the property  market,  I

cannot agree to any attempt to artificially prop up the property

market  or  to  open  the  market  to  speculation  as  we   had

experienced in the past, particularly from 1994 to 1996.  I feel

that the root cause of the cost competitiveness

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>

of   Singapore  and  the  high  cost  of  living  here  is   the

artificially high prices of property, particularly  the  private

property, both industrial and residential.  Companies  pay  high

prices  for  land rentals and in buying buildings which  add  to

their  cost. Similarly, retail and commercial users who have  to

pay high rental prices also see a much higher cost.  Ultimately,

the  high cost is passed on to the consumers or, in the case  of

exports,  the  products  cannot compete with  products  produced

elsewhere,  resulting in either lower margins or  losses.   This

then leads to companies closing down or scaling down to relocate

to cheaper areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the people, Singaporeans in general, who have to

pay  high  prices  for their private properties  or  residential

properties,  will  demand high wages so that they  can  pay  for

their mortgages.  Sir, this is a vicious circle which originates

from the high cost of owning properties in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the property prices have come down in Singapore in

the  last  couple  of  years, the prices  here  are  still  high

compared  to  many  countries around the world.   In  fact,  our

neighbouring  countries have seen a similar drop  in  prices  by

bigger percentages than what we have seen.  Furthermore, I  feel

that only a small cross section of our population has been hurt,

particularly those who bought their private properties from 1994

to  1996, while we have a bigger potential population who may be

able to purchase properties if the prices are lower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I have a few suggestions. First of all, I would like to

renew  my  call to the Government to decide on a long term  land

sales policy for private property development for, say, 10 years

at a time, and do not change the policy irregardless of what the

state  of the private property market is.  In this way,  we  can

ensure  certainty and we avoid jerking the market around  as  we

have  done  in  the past few years.  So I hope we will  continue

with  the  land sales at the end of this year when the time  for

announcement is due.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government basically sets the stage for

private  property market by setting benchmark  prices  for  land

sale  tenders.  Could the Ministry look into how the  mechanisms

can be changed to allow true market forces to rule?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way that the private property market gets propped

up  is  by the prices the Ministry sets for new HDB flats.   The

current prices for new flats are too high with a very small  gap

against  resale  HDB  flats  and also against  private  property

market.   Sir,  while the quantum paid for new  flats  is  still

lower, considering the renovation and furnishing costs of resale

HDB  flats and private properties that are already in place when

a  person buys a property, I feel that it is about time that the

Government  reviewed HDB prices for new flats, which  should  be

reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there has been a lot of talk about long term

prices  of industrial land and to set the mechanism that is  not

internally based but based on external competitiveness.  I would

like  to ask the Minister to clarify what is the mechanism  that

we have put in place so that in the long term we can ensure that

our property prices remain competitive.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, every year

the Government decides on land sales based on its assessment  of

the  supply  and  demand  for that particular  year.   With  the

downturn in the property market, the land sales announcement has

generated  a  lot of interest, especially those associated  with

the   property  market.   I  believe  this  year  many  property

developers are very relieved by the delay of the land sales.  By

the  same  token, there are a lot of Singaporeans,  particularly

younger Singaporeans, like what Dr Wan Soon Bee pointed out, who

are  thinking that although the prices have come down, they  are

still  relatively  high.   I join Dr Wan  in  appealing  to  the

Government not to delay the land sales for too long.   In  fact,

in  assessing how much land to release each year must perhaps be

a  very  fine  art  of  judgment of market  conditions  for  the

Ministry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the process in which it is being done is not

very  clear and transparent.  Perhaps, I would like to  ask  the

Minister  how this process is done every year.  Also, there  are

certain  problems in this assessment in so far as the public  is

concerned,  for example, how the Ministry determines  whether  a

particular  unit is occupied in assessing the total  supply  and

demand.   There  has been a lot of controversy and  much  debate

about  this in the media.  I would like the Minister to  clarify

this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we find that very often it is the property

developers  who come out to the media to say various things  and

put  some  pressure on the Government not to  release  land  for

development.   In this regard, I would like to ask the  Minister

whether  it  is  feasible to form a Land Sales Review  Committee

which  could comprise not just representatives from the property

sector,  but also with sufficient representation from  consumers

through grassroots organisations and perhaps the NTUC.   Such  a

Committee can function similar to the National Wage Council  for

determining  annual wages.  In the same way, this Committee  can

recommend to the Government how much land has to be released  on

a yearly basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Although I believe in a free market,

especially with regard to prices of private properties,  I  also

believe  that  the  Government has a certain  responsibility  to

regulate  and  ensure  that  the market  operates  smoothly  and

efficiently. A market is only perfect if every player has access

to  perfect  information.   Recent  events  highlighted  in  the

newspapers on the confusion arising from the interchangeable use

of  the two terms - "built in" and "built up" - is an example of

imperfect  information which may lead to market  failure.   Some

developers  and marketing agents have compounded the problem  by

freely  interchanging the use of the two terms.  The  Government

has been thus far silent on the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry

intends  to  standardise the use of these two  terms  so  as  to

remove all ambiguities from their use in market brochures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue which I would like to raise is with regard

to  the  legal  liabilities of purchasers when they  default  at

different  stages of the legal completion process.  Here  again,

there  seems  to  be  some differences in the  understanding  or

interpretation  of  the  legal  provisions  governing   property

transactions.   I  think the Government should,  through  public

education or otherwise, inform all prospective purchasers  about

their  legal  obligations.   The amount  of  money  involved  in

property  transactions is very high and buyers should know  what

they  are  committing  themselves  to  before  they  enter   any

transaction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I think I must

be  the  first  speaker today on land that does not  talk  about

sales or price but about use and ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In calling for this cut to enhance public consultation on

land  use,  perhaps  some  context may  be  useful.   First,  as

publicly  noted,  Singapore's population is increasing.  We  are

close to four million now.  This is earlier than projected.   We

are  reaching our year X scenario.  With this greater population

of both Singaporeans and foreigners, there are even more demands

on  Singapore's  land  space. There  are  different  wishes  and

priorities  and there is a need for balance. The aim,  moreover,

is  not  just  to  squeeze everyone in in as tight  a  space  as

possible,  to make do, anyhow.  Rather, our aim is  to  build  a

world class city of many amenities, physical and mental, with  a

good  environment, to make this our best home,  both  physically

and  psychically.   In  this  sense, ownership,  familiarity  of

surroundings, conservation, and a good environment, are all  key

attributes of land use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The context of today is also that a current review of the

master plan is on-going.  In this, the main tool is what we call

the  Development  Plan  Guidelines  (DPG).  These  are  detailed

specifications on land use.  Often, it has been said that  these

are  effective  rather  than  the use  of  environmental  impact

assessments.  There are some existing forms for consultation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>

on  land use today.  Elaborate models are sometimes developed by

the Ministry or its agencies, open to the public for discussion.

But, Sir, events in the last year have been of concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first has been that this House has made some changes in

property  rights.  I can think of two issues which have detained

this  House.  First, the Strata Titles Act allowing for  private

redevelopment and the second, HDB powers to acquire  a  property

while upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change has been public acquisition for private

redevelopment  and  use.  And there is an  on-going  controversy

over the Dawson Road properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is that there has been use of nature reserves for

other  uses.   Here, there was some use of nature  reserves  for

water  storage  tanks.   And second, a decision  not  to  follow

through  on  some aspects of the Green Plan that the  Government

adopted in the early 1990s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not arguing that all these changes are wrong. In this

House  and in the media, I have expressed my views on these  and

on  other  matters.  I will not repeat my points.  But  I  think

that  in  sum, we are pointing to a more general need to enhance

public consultation.  This is especially when Government changes

the  law or policy or goes against its original statement,  such

as  the  Green Plan, or changes the use, which has already  been

identified  under the land use plan, such as the use  of  nature

reserves  for  other purposes.  The Government, of  course,  may

have  its reasons for these changes.  But I ask the Minister  to

consider that people too have concerns and perspectives and they

have  their  interests arising from what Government has  already

said and planned.  Thus, when changes are made, I will encourage

the  Minister  and  his agencies to engage in a  full,  rational

discussion  and consultation to explain and also to  listen.   I

believe  that  where  the Government is rational  and  has  good

reasons,  Singaporeans  can be convinced.   Some  may  not,  but

others will understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>

and  respect  the  Government's views.  Trust, transparency  and

accountability  are not only terms we should use  for  financial

matters, but also about land use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, citizens end up using the court legal system

to  challenge the Government for breach of what they think of as

the  public  trust in the use of land. This is not  good.   Even

though  I  am  a  lawyer, I would not encourage  such  litigious

practice.   But  just as the Government has  a  land  bank,  the

Government  has a bank of trust.  If it is an urgent matter,  it

can  draw  on the bank of trust and use it without consultation.

But  where  land  use  is  important but  not  urgent,  I  would

encourage the Minister to consider a full public consultation on

land use where land policy is changed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir, I

would like to take these proceedings with the time constraint in

mind.   In  case Members do not realise, we are all  given  four

minutes  per cut.  So this segment should have taken 32 minutes,

but since Members have taken 30 minutes, you will get a 2-minute

response  from  the Minister.  You have all made  very  eloquent

speeches.   Mr Simon Tay has asked the Government to listen  and

explain.   Since  I  have  two  minutes,  it  shall  be  largely

listening, and not very much explanation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I will just take the key points. First, the correction

in  the  property market has progressed reasonably well.   These

adjustments  in  the  property  values  and  rentals,  like  the

reduction in wages, have ensured that we remain competitive, vis-a-vis  the  other international cities.  The correction  in  the

property  market has been achieved without posing  any  systemic

risk  to  the  financial sector. This is very important  because

since  we introduced the anti-speculation measures in May  1996,

our  banks have taken prudent steps to reduce their exposure  to

the  property market.  The banks are also well capitalised  with

capital  adequacy  ratios well above the BIS' guidelines.   They

have  also  made  prudent  provisions for  their  non-performing

loans.   Therefore, our banks are in a strong position  to  meet

the uncertainties ahead.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have this firewall between the property market and

the  financial sector, we can expect to let the property  market

continue its current consolidation process.  The Government will

therefore let the existing property market measures run the full

course  and  there is no need to introduce any new  measures  at

this point in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, I want to stress that we will continue to

stick  to our long-term policies on the property market.   There

are  three  key elements:  First, we want to maintain prudential

measures  in  the property market.  Second, we want  to  release

sufficient  land  to  meet the medium-term  demand  through  the

Government  land  sales  programme.   And,  third,  we  want  to

encourage   greater   transparency  by  providing   timely   and

comprehensive real estate information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me take the various suggestions of the MPs in these

areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On prudential measures, the demand is there, especially

from  the  HDB  upgraders.   The  core  measures  like  the  80%

financing  limit  on  mortgage loans will therefore  remain.   I

agree with the views of many of the Members that we do not  want

to  encourage another speculative bubble and therefore we should

not allow easy credit to fill a new speculative boom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government land sales programme, I have heard both

views,  for and against the resumption of the sale.  Our  policy

remains  the  same.   First,  our property  prices  must  remain

affordable  and  competitive  in order  to  retain  and  attract

talent.  Therefore, the Government has set aside sufficient land

to  meet  the housing aspirations of Singaporeans and to  ensure

competitive  housing for foreign talent.  And  we  will  release

these  lands at a steady pace to meet the demand over the longer

term.  The Government has suspended land sales in 1998 and  1999

in  view  of the regional economic crisis.  We will resume  land

sales  as  soon  as practicable in tandem with  the  medium-term

demand.  As I have announced earlier, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>

land  sales  decision for year 2000 would be made  in  September

this year.  We will review the demand and supply situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Sinnakaruppan, let me assure him that the land

sales  process is fairly transparent and logical.  We take  into

account  what  is  in the current stock, what is  the  projected

demand  and  the supply in the pipeline.  And we  will  announce

this  in  September  for  the  next  year  within  a  multi-tier

framework.  So it is fairly transparent and rational.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that the Government set a 10-year land sales programme and do not deviate from it in good

times  or  bad.   This  is  too inflexible,  because  conditions

affecting   demand   and   supply  of  properties   can   change

substantially  over such a long period.  I  think  the  last  10

years  is a case in point.  It would not have been possible  for

the  Government to totally ignore the speculative froth in  1995

and  1996  or  the regional economic crisis in  1997  and  1998.

Therefore, it is prudent that the Government continue  with  its

current  practice  of reviewing the land sales  programme  every

year, but within the medium-term framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third element of the Government's property policies is

to  make  sure  the information flow is timely and comprehensive

and  to  encourage market transparency.  We do so by having  the

URA  to  release comprehensive and timely data.   This  is  very

important  to  make sure that the market works efficiently,  and

the  URA will continue to improve the quality and timeliness  of

these data.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked how the occupancy rates are

computed.  This the URA does with a standard survey method.  For

commercial   and  industrial  properties,  URA  ascertains   the

occupancy  through quarterly surveys of the property owners  and

their  agents, as well as site visits.  For private  residential

properties,  the  URA infers the occupancy from the  consumption

levels  of water and electricity on Power Supply's records,  ie,

if  the  house  does  not record a certain  level  of  water  or

electricity,  we  deem the house to be not occupied.   URA  also

carries out field visits

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>

to confirm whether properties are actually occupied for doubtful

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai asked for HDB to join with private developers. I

think  HDB is quite tied up, with its hands full, with  its  own

programme,  without  having to dabble in  the  private  property

market.   He  asked  for  HDB flats to be  privatised.   I  have

answered before that this is not something that we rule out, but

it is not something in the foreseeable future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asked us to make sure Government policies

do  not contribute to the property volatility.  I think we  will

be  more careful in future Government policies.  We try to be as

wise as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will refer to the pricing of new HDB flats later on when

there is a segment on HDB flat price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked how industrial land is priced. I

will refer him to MTI.  Industrial land pricing policy is set by

MTI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked for a land sales review committee,

much  like  the  NWC.   I  think we  have  enough  processes  of

dialogues with the various players.  We can look at whether such

a  review committee is workable.  I can tell you that it is  not

very  difficult.  We just set X number of units to be sold every

year and we try not to deviate from that number, unless there is

a major change in the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked the Government to intervene to

standardise  the  use  of  terms and also  stipulate  the  legal

liabilities of buyers.  I think the two instances he referred to

are  presently  in  court,  because  there  are  differences  in

interpretation  of  the sales and purchase  agreement  and  also

there is no standard definition of "built-in" area or "built-up"

area.   I think we will leave it to the court to decide on these

two issues first and, if necessary, my Ministry will talk to the

various  participants to resolve this issue.  But  to  intervene

now when there is a court case, I think, would not be wise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked for more consultation so as not to

diminish the reservoir of goodwill.  I agree with him.  I  think

we  would try to present our plans.  We do that regularly.   For

example,  our Development Guide Plans plus any changes  in  land

use,  we  do  it  in  a very systematic way.   But  in  specific

instances,  whether it is water tank in the nature  reserves,  I

think  such  issues ought to be explained more, so that  we  can

convince the public that it is a necessary decision.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, let me begin by

stating that this is not a critique of existing housing policies

which  have served us well.  It is an appeal for an exercise  of

greater  flexibility  towards Singaporeans  who  may  be  caught

unwittingly by the current economic crisis.  Allow me,  Sir,  to

now cite some live examples for the Minister's consideration.

<br><br><i>Scenario One</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop in HDB resale prices has correspondingly led to

fluctuating  valuation levels.  This has  given  rise  to  cases

where a Sale and Purchase Agreement is entered into at an older,

higher  valuation level, and transaction completed  at  a  lower

valuation  level,  leading  to  a  shortfall  in  loan   quantum

eligibility.   Such a situation places parties involved  in  the

transaction in a dilemma and creates a cash squeeze.   Can  some

kind of bridging finance be provided for the shortfall?

<br><br><i>Scenario Two</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans need more time to dispose of their

existing  flats  upon taking delivery of their new  flats.   The

sluggish market has led to lower-than-expected resale prices, so

both  timing and price expectations frequently go out of  whack.

Consequently, pressure from having to meet the deadline to  sell

off  the existing flat mounts and stress is felt, especially  by

the  upgraders.   Even if the grace period were  extended,  they

would  still  frequently have to finance two  flats  during  the

interim  period.   Can some restructuring of  the  two  mortgage

schemes  be  allowed  so as to enable them to  cope  financially

during this time?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Scenario Three</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet some other Singaporeans have no choice but to withdraw

their  applications or reject allocations for new flats.  Others

are  forced  by  business or financial woes  to  downgrade  from

private properties or existing HDB flats.  Some of these persons

have  no  means  to buy on the resale market but are  disallowed

from  applying for a rental flat under current rules.   Can  the

consequences of their decision, in terms of debarment,  penalty,

or forfeiture be administered with flexibility?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a comment on sale among ethnic grouping

guidelines.  Sir, allocation along ethnic grouping guidelines is

well  justified.  Unfortunately, they pose a real  challenge  to

resale  potential during this crisis, owing to  a  much  smaller

market demand. Can the Minister comment on how the HDB can  help

Singaporeans cope with this crisis, specifically for  the  above

scenarios?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan Cheng Bock is not here. Dr Wang Kai

Yuen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, HDB has a policy to

maintain   the   distribution  of   ethnic   households   in   a

neighbourhood to reflect the racial composition of  our  nation.

I  support this policy.  This is a wise policy.  However, strict

implementation of this policy might cause difficulties when  the

owners  try to sell their flats in the resale market.   This  is

especially  so  for the precincts that are physically  small  in

size.  One case in point is the Toh Yi Estate in the Bukit Timah

GRC.   There  are altogether only 19 blocks in the precinct,  in

fact two of which are 4-storey shophouse blocks and two more are

walk-up  4-storey  maisonette apartments.  So  actually  we  are

talking about a very small precinct here, and this is a precinct

favoured  by  the Chinese without too many facilities  that  the

other  races  would normally prefer.  In fact,  there  are  many

cases  of  Malay owners trying to sell their flats in  the  open

market and the only buyers they could find are Chinese families.

HDB  would typically disapprove of such sales.  This has  caused

great financial hardship to these Malay families,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>

especially during this time of economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the HDB could be

flexible  in implementing this policy to take into consideration

situations like the Toh Yi Estate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chng is not here. Mr Kenneth Chen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, during 1996 the

waiting list for HDB flats had gone up to around 150,000.  Since

the  start of the financial crisis, the number of applicants has

declined  rapidly.  I understand that it is around  80,000  now.

Because  of  the  shorter waiting list and many have  downgraded

their  flat  type, some of the applicants have been  advised  to

take  possession  of their flats earlier than  scheduled.   This

presented a lot of problems for the applicants because when they

made the application for the flat, they coincide the timing with

the  selling of their existing flat, especially those upgraders.

And  when  they  are  asked to take possession  of  their  flats

earlier,  some  of them are unable to do so.  They  cannot  sell

their existing flat in time because of the time restriction  and

therefore  cannot meet the financial obligation  for  their  new

flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the HDB can look into this and make the

necessary adjustments, so that the applicants can receive a more

accurate  hand-over date and enable them to  make  their  change

over to coincide with the HDB schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister what is the impact of

such  a  decrease  in number of units to be  built  on  the  HDB

building  programme.  Would the scaling down affect the  pricing

of   the  flats,  since  the  price  of  the  flat  takes   into

consideration  the  overall overhead and  administration  costs?

And how did HDB forecast the number of flats to be built in such

a time of uncertainty?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, at the

moment,  more  than  86% of our population  are  living  in  HDB

estates,  and   96%   own their flats under the  home  ownership

scheme.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>

order  to ensure that old estates enjoy better facilities and  a

better living environment, various upgrading programmes such  as

the  MUP, IUP and Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme  (SERS)

are introduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to qualify for the Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP),

the  flats  must be between 10 and 17 years of age.   Under  the

programme,  the Government bears all the expenses  incurred  and

the  residents do not have to pay for anything.  Upgrading works

are  carried out outside the flats and the inconvenience  caused

to  residents  is minimal.  IUP improves the living  environment

and enhances the value of the flats.  Usually, IUP receives more

than  95%  of  support from the residents.  In some  cases,  the

support is as high as 99%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) is meant for flats which

are more than 17 years old.  In this case, residents have to pay

between  $15,000 and $25,000 per unit to have their  floor  area

increased by about 6 square metres at the balcony or the toilet.

Works  have  to be carried out inside the flats, and  the  whole

project  takes  some  two  or three  years  to  complete.   Much

inconvenience  is  caused  to  the  residents,  especially   the

children and old people.  The flats are all very old and most of

them  have  leaking  ceilings.  Even after the  upgrading,  this

problem  still exists.  Of late, the support rate  for  MUP  has

dropped from 90% to about 80%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third scheme is SERS which is for flats of 25 years old and

above.   In Singapore, land is scarce.  In order to make  better

use  of the limited land available, and because these flats  are

very   old,   it   makes  more  sense  to  demolish   them   for

redevelopment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three proposals to make. Firstly, increase the

number of IUP precincts from 18 to 25 so that more residents can

enjoy  the  benefits.  Multi-storey car parks and  lifts  should

also be included in the IUP.  Secondly, reduce the number of MUP

precincts  from  five to three, and that it be done  selectively

for areas which have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>

more  4- to 5-room flats.  If possible, this MUP can be repealed

for  redistribution  into the IUP programme or  SERS  programme.

Thirdly,  I  hope  that MND can launch about  10  or  more  SERS

programmes because this kind of redevelopment programme will not

only  benefit  HDB but also the residents.  So it is  a  win-win

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to request the

Minister  to reconsider the overall development of flats  in  my

Bukit Gombak Constituency to solve the problems of some of these

very old flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, the Government introduced two

upgrading  programmes,  Interim  Upgrading  and  Main  Upgrading

Programmes,  to  help upgrade older housing estates.   Over  the

years,  the  Interim Upgrading Programme has been  expanded  and

now, with the inclusion of the lift landing at every floor, many

residents find that IUP is almost as important as MUP.  Perhaps,

the  main distinguishing feature in the MUP is the space  adding

item  (SAI).   But looking at the feedback from many  residents,

most  residents  are very happy with the lift landing  in  every

floor and covered linkways that takes them to the bus stop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, space adding item. During the pilot phase, it was

allocated 10 square metres.  But over the years, it was  reduced

to  6  square metres and to build a bedroom with 6 square metres

is indeed very difficult.  I am sure, Sir, you will find it very

difficult to go into a 6 square metre bedroom.  Sometimes, it is

used  for  toilet, utility room or an extension of the  balcony,

and so on, of the living room.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the size and cost, as Mr Ang Mong Seng has just

pointed  out, it costs about $25,000 in total to build this  SAI

for  4-room  or 5-room flat and the residents pay about  $15,000

for  a  4-room flat and about $17,000 for a 5-room  flat.   This

works out to a total cost of about $4,200 per square metre which

by  HDB cost standards is relatively high.  Sir, given this  and

given  the trend that many 4-roomers and 5 roomers are  starting

to upgrade to ECs and low-end private properties, I think

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>

we  need  to  question whether there is a need to offer,  as  an

option,  SAI  for  4 roomers and 5 roomers.  I  believe  that  3

roomers  will  still  find that having this  SAI  will  be  very

useful,  particularly with the larger Government  subsidy.   But

maybe  it is time to review the SAI option for 4-room and 5-room

flats.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, since 1992, selected old HDB flats

have  been  undergoing upgrading through the Main Upgrading  and

the  Interim Upgrading Programmes.  These programmes are  highly

popular  with  the residents since they have brought  about  new

facilities  and  amenities  in  the  precinct  as  well  as   an

enhancement in the value of the flat in the resale market.   The

recent  announcement on the cutback of the upgrading  programmes

as  a result of the economic recession has to some extent put  a

brake  on  these  upgrading projects and  perhaps  given  us  an

opportunity to review the programmes.  I would like  to  suggest

two areas for such a review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the selection of precincts for upgrading, HDB

should  consult  the  MP  concerned in  the  identification  and

demarcation  of the precincts.  This is necessary  because  over

time,  neighbourhoods would have evolved and  established  their

own  identities  through activities organised by the  grassroots

organisations.   When a precinct is selected for  upgrading,  it

would  be  more meaningful if residents can identify  with  that

precinct.   Currently, the lack of consultation  has  led  to  a

selected precinct that straddles two RC zones, as happened in my

constituency.  The improvement works which are being planned may

have  to  be  duplicated  because  of  the  need  to  serve  the

activities of two different Residents' Committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second issue. While there is no doubt

that  the upgrading programmes have helped to improve the living

environment of the old HDB estates, I am concerned that some  of

the features and projects being introduced in some precincts are

repetitive and not fully utilised.  For example, it is  a  waste

to  have  covered linkways all over the precinct just to satisfy

every single resident.  Features

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>

which  may  have high aesthetic value but are hardly  used  when

completed  are really unnecessary.  Such duplication  and  under

usage is not cost effective.  Besides they have a serious impact

on the long term maintenance cost.  Perhaps the HDB could ensure

greater  coordination amongst the precincts undergoing upgrading

so  that  the improvement works carried out are well chosen  and

cost  effective.   If  we  could  cut  down  on  some  of  these

duplications  and  unnecessary improvement  works,  the  savings

could  be  redistributed to more precincts  and  more  residents

could benefit from the upgrading.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since 1992, HDB

has  been  selling shops to sitting tenants, and has sold  about

7,600  shop  units hitherto.  In  1997, HDB also began  to  sell

some 30-year lease shops at a lower price because the lease  was

shorter.   These  cheaper  shops were welcomed  by  the  sitting

tenants.   Up  till now, some 444 units of 30-year  lease  shops

have been sold under the scheme to the sitting tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in April 1998, HDB stopped selling its shop units.

Many  shopkeepers want to know when will HDB sell the  shops  to

them.   I  believe HDB is holding back the sale because  of  the

poor  sentiments in the property market today, and to sell  shop

units  at this moment will further lower the value of the shops,

and  people  who bought the shops earlier would feel  they  have

suffered  a book loss as they had bought their shops earlier  at

higher  prices.  On the other hand, those who have  yet  to  buy

over  the  shops which they are renting at the moment desire  to

buy  the shops now because the prices are low at this moment and

it  is the right time for them to buy their shops.  If HDB holds

back  the  sale  of these shops to them, they will  harbour  the

feeling that HDB is waiting for prices to go up before they sell

the shops with the aim of making more profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, HDB has already sold about 7,600 units of shops. The

remaining  number of shops to be sold will not  be  very  large.

That being the case, as long as the number of units offered  for

sale is not too large, the effect of lowering the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>

existing price will not be very significant.  So I would suggest

that  the  Minister consider the request of the shop tenants  to

resume  the sale of shops to them, especially the 30-year  lease

shops which are very popular among the residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

to  the  industrial and commercial sector, the problem  of  land

rent  has  all  along been a big headache.  It  is  one  of  the

biggest items in their business cost.  Fortunately, in the  cost

cutting  package  announced last November,  the  Government  has

attached  great importance to this matter.  It has  also  agreed

with   the   recommendation  of  the  Committee  on  Singapore's

Competitiveness  (CSC) that the two biggest  landlords,  namely,

the  JTC and HDB, should also adopt the rent reduction measures,

particularly  to  reduce  the  rents  of  industrial  land   and

factories  substantially down to the level of the  early  1990s.

The  industrial and commercial sector is of course very grateful

to the Government for its care and concern for the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many people in the trade are sceptical about the

implementation of these measures.  The main concern is while the

Government has agreed to reduce the rent substantially  to  that

of  the  level of the early 1990s, the tenants of HDB are  still

required to enter into a lease agreement with the authorities on

the  "posted  rent" and a pre-determined rate of increase.   The

question  is:  what is the basis for the fixing of  this  posted

rate,  and  whether it is in line with the market  condition  or

based  on  other  factors?   By  right,  if  the  Government  is

determined  to reduce the rents to the level of the early  1990s

to  ensure our competitiveness, then the terms in the new  lease

agreement should be based on the level of the 1990s.  But I feel

the  present lease agreements are still being entered into based

on  the  recent  years'  level,  and  the  authorities  have  no

intention of reducing the rents to the level of the early 1990s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a company which has leased some industrial land from

HDB in Defu

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>

Industrial  Estate  on a 30-year lease in order  to  manufacture

light industrial products. According to the terms stipulated  by

HDB,  the  land rent would be increased annually  by  7.6%  from

1990.   By  1999,  the rent per square foot has been  raised  to

$59.91,  a  total  increase  of 71.2%.   According  to  the  CSC

recommendations, the rent should be adjusted  to  the  level  of

1990,  that  is, at $35 per square foot.  But in the  new  lease

agreement  with HDB, the rent is reduced by only 10%  to  $53.90

per  square  foot  and thereafter it would  have  to  be  raised

annually by 4%.  According to feedback from people in the trade,

the  market  rental  value of industrial  premises  (or  factory

space)  in this area has already dropped from its peak of  $2.50

per  square foot to about $0.80 per square foot, which is a drop

of  68%.  Even then, it is difficult to get tenants.  Since  the

market  value has gone down by such a big scale, why is it  that

the  HDB is only providing for a 10% reduction in the land rent?

How can we convince the people that the Government is determined

to  adjust the rent of industrial land to the level of the early

1990s?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business community has suffered a great impact from this

crisis  and apart from trying to solve all the problems  in  the

operation,  they  have  to  find  ways  and  means  to   upgrade

themselves to enhance their competitiveness.  What they need  is

a favourable business environment provided by the Government for

them  to set up their business, to develop their business so  as

to contribute to our economic and social development.  Rent is a

burden that the businessman cannot run away with, so we have  to

reduce  it  to a reasonably low level, otherwise they will  have

difficulties  making  ends meet and the effectiveness  of  these

cost-cutting measures will be in doubt.  In view of that, I hope

that  the  Government would set up an independent  committee  to

oversee  adjustments to rents for industrial  land  and  factory

space  to  ensure HDB and the JTC would abide by the  principles

set  down  by  the cost-cutting package, thereby reducing  their

rents to the level of the early 1990s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for difficulties faced by the tenants, I hope that the

relevant authorities would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>

give  them  the  necessary assistance and not to rub  salt  into

their wounds by imposing an interest rate of as high as 8.5% for

arrears  in  rent.   I  think we should reduce  the  rent  to  a

reasonable level, and help the businesses which are in  trouble.

Perhaps  for  those  who  simply  cannot  carry  on  with  their

business, the authorities should consider taking back  the  land

or  factory space at a reasonable price and then rent it out  to

other parties so that the land could be recycled and put to good

use.   Land  is  scarce  in Singapore and  it  is  an  important

resource  relied  upon  by the businessmen  for  their  business

operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in its report issued last year, the CSC has also

emphasized on the optimal use of our land to make sure that  the

land would be rented out at a reasonable and competitive rate so

that  we  can have a world-class infrastructure on our land.   I

feel that the available land in our HDB estates should be put to

full  use  by  allowing  some  suitable  economic  and  business

activities to be carried out in the common areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government would allow the residential

units  above  the shophouses to be used for business  activities

too.   Most  Singaporeans have their own  apartments,  and  more

often than not, these residential units above the shophouses are

not occupied.  If we could allow these units to be used for some

form  of business or commercial activities, they can be  put  to

good  use, and at the same time it will help to reduce  business

cost for the shopkeepers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, to meet the rising

expectations  of  Singaporeans, HDB  has  been  building  better

quality  flats  over the last 10 years.  More sophisticated  and

complex  designs were introduced in many estates and  new  towns

especially  with  the  introduction of  design-and-build  flats.

Today,  you can see that our HDB flats come in different designs

and a wide variety of building finishes and fittings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the design of flats has increased the aesthetic

value of our flats,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>

there  are  some problems associated with these designs.   These

problems may be classified into the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Maintenance problems - certain designs pose maintenance

problems.  For example, the introduction of protruding  concrete

or steel sunshades on the facade of buildings has obstructed the

movement  of gondola for re-painting works.  The use of tempered

glass for covered linkways and low level glass light fittings is

prone to frequent vandalism and abuses;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Maintenance cost - the use of expensive light fittings and

finishes  has  increased  the cost of  maintenance  drastically.

This has added much financial burden to Town Councils;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Security problems - certain designs of flats have dark

corners  or  easy access for thieves to gain entry  into  flats.

Enclosed  fire escape staircases also provide a convenient  spot

for drug abusers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Mosquito breeding - the provision of bamboo hanging poles

and ponding of water at roofs, parapet walls, and scupper drains

are  potential  mosquito  breeding  grounds.   Sometimes,  these

breeding grounds are inaccessible for maintenance; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Noise problem - inadequate consideration in the design of

the layout of flat and acoustic provision may cause much problem

in  noise  pollution.   More neighbours are complaining  against

each other of noise nuisance in recent years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the PAP Town Councils for taking the initiative

to  form  a  Maintenance  Feedback Committee  which  is  working

closely  with HDB to further improve the designs of  our  flats.

With  constructive  feedback,  I  am  confident  that  PAP  Town

Councils  will  provide  a  better quality  environment  to  our

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to suggest the following for the

Ministry to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Conduct an independent quality audit on the design of HDB

flats during the design stage;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Document good design practices to guide architects and

engineers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Second architects and engineers to Town Councils to better

understand maintenance problems; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Set a buildable and CONQUAS score to be achieved for all

HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in 1997, I wrote to HDB

to  inform  them  that  the  design  of  new  flats  in  Hougang

Constituency was such that it was prone to burglary. After  some

investigation by its architecture department, HDB told  me  that

no burglar would take such a big risk climbing over the external

wall  to  enter a flat.  However, a recent report of the  Police

confirmed that what the residents in the area were worried about

could  indeed happen.  I would like to know whether HDB has  any

remedial  measures for such defective designs  which  can  cause

security problems to the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I notice that in the new precincts, blocks of

flats  are  built  very close to one another.  I  have  received

feedback  from  the residents that the flats are so  close  that

they  can  fight  with people in the opposite blocks  simply  by

stretching out their bamboo poles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, at the 5th Southeast-Asian Geographical

Conference,  the Geography Department of our National  Institute

of  Education presented a study report which revealed  that  the

design  of  many HDB flats is such that there is difficulty  for

heat  to  be dispersed at night, thereby resulting in a  general

rise  of  temperature in Singapore.  One of the factors is  that

the blocks of flats are built too close to one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether in developing new towns, HDB has

taken  consideration  into the possible effect  on  our  natural

environment and the question of privacy of the residents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, the number of first-timers who dropped

out of the new flat queue increased from about 950 in the fourth

quarter  of  1997 to about 3,000 one year later  in  the  fourth

quarter  of  1998.   There  are various  reasons  cited  by  the

Minister  in a written answer.  Of all the reasons, two  of  the

most important must surely be price and size.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, property prices, including a resale HDB flat, has fallen

roughly  to about the 1993 levels.  In contrast, the  prices  of

new  HDB  flats have not dropped.  Surely the prices of new  HDB

flats  should move in line with the rest of the market.   Is  it

because  they are costed at historical prices when  land  prices

were still very high?  Also, since land sale has stopped for one

year,  at  what price does HDB buy land?  Surely this cannot  be

set  at  historical  prices  which do not  sufficiently  reflect

market  movements.  I understand that new HDB flats  are  highly

subsidised.   I am not suggesting that the subsidy be  increased

in order for prices to fall.  But perhaps there could be a float

where the prices of HDB flats are concerned and it is this float

factor which could move with the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for the dropping out could be because new flats

are  much  smaller than existing flats of the  same  type.   For

example, up to two years ago, 4-room flats were about 110 square

metres in size.  Now they are about 90 square metres.  And a new

5-room flat now has the same floor area as an older 4-room flat.

It  is  a  puzzle to me that as per capita incomes in  Singapore

rise,  flats  of  the same type are getting smaller  instead  of

getting larger.  On top of that, the civil defence shelter takes

up additional space.  Could one of the reasons be because of the

fact that two years ago, during the height of the property boom,

land  prices  were so high that a 125-square metre  5-room  flat

would  have been too costly, and so smaller flats were  designed

instead?   To  the extent that HDB policies are set during  boom

times  and geared to rising prices, it is time that they be  re-evaluated in today's changed circumstances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me just set the general environment

before  I  go  into the specifics.  I think Mr Kenneth  Chen  is

right.  The waiting list has dropped from 146,000 to 84,000 now,

so  this  is  a  drop of 42%. Secondly, the resale  prices  have

dropped  by  27% since its peak in the fourth quarter  in  1996.

Third,  the  resale market has been very active.  It  was  about

40,000  in 1996-1997.  Last year, there were 65,000 transactions

in  the  resale market.  Fourth, our CPF housing grant has  been

very  successful.   To date, we have disbursed  more  than  $1.3

billion  on  our  CPF housing grant.  So if  you  look  at  this

backdrop,  basically, the adjustments that we  see  in  the  HDB

sector can be understood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the implications? First, on the building

programme,  Mr  Kenneth Chen asked what we  would  be  building.

With  the  waiting  list now more manageable, the  HDB  building

programme will have to come down, but we will adjust it  gently.

The  building  programme  in 1998 was 28,650  units,  comprising

22,000 flats in the non-mature estates, 6,000 flats for SERS and

650 studio apartments for the elderly.  This year, HDB plans  to

build  26,500  units, comprising 20,000 flats in the  non-mature

estates.   So  it is only a reduction of 2,000  flats.   And  we

intend  to keep the SERS programme at around 5,000-6,000  flats.

Similarly, for the studio apartments, we hope the pilot  project

would  work  and  we  can continue to build  around  600  studio

apartments for the elderly.  Over the medium term, we would have

to adjust the building programme in line with the waiting list.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pricing, the principles on pricing new HDB flats remain

the  same.   Basically, we want to ensure  that  HDB  flats  are

affordable to Singaporeans.  The benchmarks we use are that  90%

of  Singaporean households will continue to be able to afford at

least  a  3-room  flat.  And 70% of Singaporean households  will

continue  to afford a 4-room flat.  Based on these affordability

indices, we track the various sectors of the population to  make

sure that the HDB flats continue to be affordable to them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asked what has happened to the new HDB

flats now that resale prices have come down.  Basically, the HDB

new  flats  have  been adjusted downwards by between  5-8%  last

year.   We  did not follow the sharp drop in the resale  prices,

because  the land that HDB buys is pegged to the resale  prices.

So  the  land  prices have come down from the Land Office.   The

flat  prices  have not come down because previously  the  market

subsidy  was more than $100,000, which is out of sync  with  the

CPF  housing grant.  If the CPF housing grant is around $35,000-$40,000, then the market subsidy for a new flat should be around $60,000-$80,000.  So the prices of the new HDB flats now reflect

this market subsidy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new HDB flats continue to be heavily subsidised, as we

show  in the HDB Annual Reports.  The overall sale proceeds  are

not sufficient to cover the total development cost and therefore

the  Government  has  to fund the HDB for the  development  loss

incurred by way of an annual grant.  In FY97-98, the deficit for

the sale of flats amounted to $591 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think is different in this year's debate is the

economic  situation that we face and therefore what is  required

of  us  is to have assistance schemes to help Singaporeans  cope

with  the  downturn, and also MPs have requested flexibility  by

HDB in administering existing policies, so that Singaporeans can

better  deal  with  the downturn.  I hate to  be  glib  and  say

flexibility is HDB's middle name.  But let me assure  the  House

that HDB will exercise flexibility as far as it can, so long  as

basic  principles  are not contravened.  Or that  in  exercising

this flexibility, we create more problems in the long run.  This

is  one  of the basic problems of HDB.  The more flexibility  is

exercised,  the  more complicated the rules.  I would  say  that

except  for  the ethnic integration policy where  HDB  has  zero

flexibility,  on everything else we will consider requests  from

MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first talk about the ethnic integration policy.

This was introduced in 1989.  When it was first implemented,  35

or  28% out of 125 neighbourhoods in public housing estates  had

reached at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>

least one of the ethnic limits.  After the implementation of the

policy, the ethnic balance in HDB estates has improved.   As  at

February  1999,  the number of neighbourhoods has  increased  to

163,  but only 29 or 18% of the neighbourhoods have reached  one

of  these  ethnic  limits, and therefore the ethnic  integration

policy   has   achieved  its  objective  in   promoting   racial

integration in public housing estates.  And I must tell you that

we have achieved this by having zero flexibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our neighbourhoods all come in diverse sizes. So I

understand Dr Wang Kai Yuen's problems, but I am very  reluctant

to  tinker  with  the  ethnic integration  policy  just  because

neighbourhoods   are  smaller.   So,  other  than   the   ethnic

integration policy, everything else is flexible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to what we can be flexible. Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua  asked about valuation of flats.  The valuation is good  for

three  months, and with that 3-month period, most people  should

be  able to transact their resale flats.  Sometimes we do  allow

extension of the valuation reports, but we do so carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are asked to sell their flats within six

months,  she also asked whether we could extend it.  HDB usually

exercises flexibility and allows the upgrader to sell beyond the

six months, giving a further extension of six months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On applicants who have sold their flats and are debarred

from  rental  flats during the next 30 months, again,  HDB  will

exercise   flexibility.   If  the  applicant  is  in   financial

difficulties, HDB will consider his case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked for the hand over date to be more

carefully  projected  and if possession is  taken  earlier  than

scheduled,  that we allow the applicant to sell  his  flat  even

though the occupation period is not fulfilled.  Again, HDB  will

exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the set of questions on upgrading. Just

to give Members the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>

overall  framework,  when  we look at the  housing  estates,  we

develop  an estate renewal strategy for each of the old  housing

estates.   Three  of the main programmes in the  estate  renewal

strategy are the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme  (SERS),

the  Main  Upgrading  Scheme and the Interim  Upgrading  Scheme.

Wherever  possible,  we  will implement  the  Selective  En-bloc

Redevelopment   Scheme,  but  it  must   be   economically   and

financially viable, ie, the redevelopment potential must  be  at

least  twice  the  existing  output of  units,  because  we  are

literally tearing down the flats.  We are demolishing the  value

of the units, and what we get is just land.  So the land must be

able  to  yield at least twice the number of units to compensate

for the loss in the building cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the flats cannot be redeveloped and if they are old

enough, we would undertake the Main Upgrading Programme, and  we

undertake the Interim Upgrading Programme for the younger flats,

as  a way of improving the estate before they are upgraded under

the  Main  Upgrading  Programme.  With that  framework,  I  hope

Members  can better understand how we select and how we identify

precincts for the different programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that we raise the number of

IUPs,  lower  the number of MUPs and keep SERS at 10  precincts.

We  intend  to  keep  SERS at 10 precincts per  year.   We  have

decided to reduce the MUP to five, and not to three, because  we

want a fair balance of upgrading between the older flats and the

younger  flats.   Mr Ang Mong Seng's proposal would  favour  the

younger  flats - 25 and only three for the older flats.  Keeping

the  MUP at five and the IUP at 18, I think it would give a fair

balance across the various ages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked why do we offer space adding item to

the  4-roomers and the 5-roomers.  I agree with him that  it  is

very  expensive, because we have to divert the services  and  it

costs a lot.  Because it is expensive, we do not encourage space

adding item for 4-roomers and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>

5-roomers  and,  therefore, we institute a  fairer  cost-sharing

ratio.   Therefore, it is entirely up to the  4-roomers  and  5-roomers  whether they consider it of value to  them  to  do  the

space  adding item.  If all the Members here feel that we should

not  offer  space adding item to 4-roomers and 5-roomers,  I  am

prepared to be convinced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee asked us to review the MUP programme after

sufficient  experience with it.  He requested  that  the  MP  be

consulted  on  the  demarcation of the precinct  boundaries.   I

would  assure him that we try to do so.  Sometimes the  precinct

straddles two RCs.  It is a toss up whether you fit the RCs with

the  precinct  boundaries which are physical and therefore  more

inflexible, or you fit the physical boundaries of the  upgrading

to  the RCs, which is whether you fit the hardware or you adjust

the  software.  I will leave it to the MP to decide.  If  indeed

his  RCs  are so stratified, then we will break up the  physical

boundaries.   If not, I think it is better to have the  precinct

forming a natural physical entity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee also asked that there be less repetition

and  duplication  in  the covered linkways,  and  asked  HDB  to

coordinate.  I think we will try to do so.  But MPs play a  very

important role, because the MPs are the advisers to the  working

committees of each MUP precinct.  The MPs are also the  advisers

to the Town Council which undertakes the IUP and also undertakes

the  CIPC  developments.  So, really, a lot of  coordination  is

done  on the ground, and not necessarily by the HDB itself.   So

it  is  entirely up to the MPs how they coordinate the  walkways

and the various developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker Sin Tze asked why there was no sale of shops since

1998.   We  held  back  the sale of shops because  we  were  not

certain  how  the regional economic crisis would impact  on  the

sale prices.  Now that the situation is more stabilised, we will

look into reactivating the sale of shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan asked that rents be reduced back to the

levels of the 1990s.  If he says that we reduce the rent to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>

market rent of the 1990s, I think there is a strong case for it.

But  I  suspect what he meant was the resettlement rent  of  the

1990s.  Let me explain.  We have a very diverse group of tenants

in  our  industrial shops.  Many of them are resettlement cases.

Some  of them tender for the premises and pay market rent.   The

resettlement cases could sometimes pay only 20-30% of the market

rent.  We are now in the process of moving the resettlement rent

closer  to the market rent, and reducing the market rent to  the

current  market rent, which reflects 1993-1994  rents.   We  are

indeed  moving towards the market rents of the 1990s.   But  for

the person who has been enjoying very low resettlement rent, his

resettlement  rent in the 1990s was only 20-30%  of  the  market

rent in the 1990s.  So he will see an increase in his individual

rent.   But we will take a look into this and see how  we  could

resolve this.  If the various associations are prepared to  have

the  1993 or 1994 market rent across the board, I will  be  very

happy to move everybody to that single rent.  That means we must

carry all the resettlement cases along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan asked for the residential units above the

shops  to be used for commercial uses.  My own personal view  is

that  this will complicate matters.  One of the problems we face

today  is excess supply of commercial space, especially  in  the

older  estates.  The purchasing power in the older  estates  has

dropped.   Younger families with bigger incomes have moved  out.

The shop space remains the same and therefore there is an excess

in  shop  space and a reduction in demand.  If we now allow  the

residential units above the shops to be converted to shop space,

it will worsen the supply situation.  So the approach to this is

to restructure.  And when we redevelop, make sure the shop space

is  commensurate  with  the purchasing power  of  the  immediate

catchment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for flat design, I have no wish to go through the

details.  I thank Members for their comments.  In fact, HDB  has

scheduled a seminar together with all the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>

Town  Councils to pass all the design features and how they  may

give  rise to maintenance problems, security problems,  mosquito

breeding   problems  and  noise.  We  will  leave  it   to   the

professionals  to sit down and resolve this. What  it  shows  is

that there must be better institutional feedback between the HDB

and  the Town Councils. We had that in the past when the  estate

management  was part of the HDB.  We have tried to put  in  this

feedback  loop, but obviously it can be improved.  So a  regular

seminar  between the various groups would help  to  improve  the

situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, at present, applicants for

HDB  rental flats have to wait no less than two to three  months

for  the  flat, depending on the availability, as the number  of

rental  flats is limited.  However, during this time of economic

difficulties,  the  number of applications must  have  increased

significantly, as is indicated by the increased number of people

who  have approached me during my meet-the-people session.  This

means that the waiting list would be much longer.  As those  who

require renting these flats are generally from the lower  income

family  or individuals, the usual recommendation by the  HDB  is

for  them to rent a room from the private property or other  HDB

flat owners would not help as even such rentals are beyond their

affordability.   I  would  like  to  request  the  HDB  to  make

available  more  rental  flats at the present  time  to  provide

accommodation for those who need rental flats at this  point  of

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister has promised to be more

flexible  to those who encounter economic difficulties and  have

to sell their flats and look for rental flats and overcome their

30-month time bar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to ask whether it is possible

for  the  Minister  to consider to have some  3-room  flats  for

rental as some of those who need to rent flats have a family  of

four  to  five persons.  They could not possibly be packed  into

one or two room flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, since June 1994, the

HDB started selling rental flats to tenants.  I would like to

know how many such flats have been sold to-date and where are

these flats located.  I would also like to know what are the

criteria for consideration under which these flats would be

selected for sale to tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Sunday Times of 12th January 1999, Mr Matthias Yao

was quoted to have said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I applied for it and I was pushing for it. I am very happy

that  within a week of election results, the HDB has  agreed  to

this."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know from the Minister whether the sales of

rental flats to tenants are also linked to election results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I request the HDB to sell the rental flats in Hougang

Constituency  to  the tenants.  The blocks that  I  request  for

consideration are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Blocks 8, 9, 10 and 25, Hougang Avenue 3;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Block 313, Hougang Avenue 5; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Blocks 315 and 316, Hougang Avenue 7.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> The HDB studio apartment scheme is a new

scheme  that was announced in November 1997, and subsequently  a

pilot project was launched in March last year.  I would like  to

ask  the Minister how well received the scheme has been; how  is

the  price  fixed,  and would it be lowered since  the  property

market  has  declined substantially since the scheme  was  first

announced; and how many more studio apartments would be released

in a year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> When the studio apartments for the

elderly  project was announced, my constituency in Bedok  North,

East  Coast GRC, was selected as part of the pilot project.   As

Mr  Lew  has said, the project was successfully launched in  the

later part of 1997 and the response was good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the senior citizens in my ward applied to purchase

the apartment. The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>

scheme was attractive as they could sell their existing 3- or 4-room  HDB flats and buy these studio apartments, and yet  pocket

the  difference  in  price as cash to  see  them  through  their

remaining years of life.  Depending on the size of these  studio

apartments,  the  prices range from about  $60,000  to  $85,000.

However,  Sir, since the launch of this project some  16  months

ago,  the prices of their existing HDB homes had fallen by  some

20%  to 30%.  Many of them now realise that they have less  cash

available to see them through their remaining years in life,  if

they  participate  in the scheme.  Many of the  senior  citizens

have  therefore approached me to appeal to the HDB to lower  the

prices for the studio apartments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore seeking the Minister's approval to review

the  scheme  and to lower the prices for these studio apartments

on the grounds that, through no fault of their own, these senior

citizens  will  now have substantially less  cash  to  see  them

through   their  life.   Unless  the  prices  of  these   studio

apartments are lowered by some 20% to 30%, many of these  senior

citizens  may consider pulling out of the scheme.   I  therefore

urge the Minister to consider their request and ensure that  the

success of the studio apartments for the elderly scheme stays.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, the proposal for studio apartments by

the  HDB is a timely solution towards elderly housing.  I  would

like to make two suggestions to improve the proposed scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to suggest that HDB reconsider the

conditions of sale that the studio apartment is only open to the

HDB lessees who have lived in their flats for at least 10 years.

If the proposed scheme is to provide housing for the elderly, it

should  not  be  restrictive to the  potential  applicants.   An

elderly  couple  who have lived with their children  in  private

property may due to changing circumstances need accommodation of

their  own.   If they so choose to apply for a studio apartment,

why should they be denied just because they have not lived in  a

HDB  flat before?  As the scheme is available to those  aged  55

and above, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>

unlikely  that those who need to apply for the studio  apartment

are still drawing a large income, whether or not they have lived

in a HDB flat before.  With little or no steady income, it would

be  unfair  to  deny such applicants who have a  real  need.   I

suggest we open up to anyone above the age of 55.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I refer to the condition that the owner will not

be able to sell the studio apartment in the resale market.  I am

recommending  that this condition be reviewed for the  following

reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition will restrict the mobility of the owner.

Suppose that the owner's family has moved to another estate,  it

would  make  sense  for  him to sell his present  unit  and  buy

another  one  to be closer to his family. The current  condition

entails  that the owner can only sell it back to the  HDB  which

will curtail the mobility of the owner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing the sale of the studio apartment in the resale

market  will also provide an alternative to potential buyers  in

the  queue,  similar to the circumstances existing  in  the  HDB

resale market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the Government's move to encourage individual

responsibility  or retirement plans, the purchase  of  a  studio

apartment should also be considered as an investment rather than

a payment for old age accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the studio apartment is a concept purely to satisfy old age

accommodation, it might lead to the deepening of the connotation

that  the  studio apartment is an old-age home.  In this  light,

studio apartments might eventually become slums for the old.  We

must  not allow the studio apartments to become another form  of

old-age home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the argument is to control speculation, although I do not

think that this will happen given the short tenure, then perhaps

the  condition could be amended to restrict the sale in the open

market for the first three years of ownership.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, with increasing nuclearisation of

families  in  Singapore, the trend of older  persons  living  by

themselves will rise in tandem.  Within this group, over time, a

possibly  significant  subset  could  be  households  which  are

reduced to a widowed older person living alone, and who may  not

be able to get support from family members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In circumstances where this older person is unemployed, he, or

more  frequently she, may end up with a physical home but  cash-strapped.   By  definition,  she does  not  qualify  for  public

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feasible resolution to generating cash to meet living expenses

could be in the form of a reverse mortgage on her existing flat.

This  has  significant advantage over the options of downgrading

to a smaller flat or queuing for a rental flat after selling off

the  existing  flat or buying a studio apartment  as  all  these

three options require a re-location.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, reverse mortgages exist only for private properties

but not for HDB flats.  Can the Minister explain the reasons for

not  allowing  reverse  mortgages on HDB flats,  and  would  the

Minister review the situation, given the plight of this group of

older persons?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to take the two

cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the regional crisis has affected many

Singaporeans,  especially  the  HDB  heartlanders.    With   the

introduction of CPF and pay cuts, some HDB dwellers  are  facing

difficulty in paying their rental or mortgage loan instalments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a caring Government, I understand the HDB has implemented a

number of initiatives to help HDB dwellers.  I hope the Minister

can  clarify  the various assistance schemes available  for  the

following groups of affected residents:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Those who are in arrears in their rental or mortgage

payments;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Those who would like to restructure their mortgage loan due

to retrenchment or other reasons;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Those who would like to request for downgrading due to

affordability problem; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Those who face problems paying the 20% deposit when taking

over the flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Estate Renewal Strategy (ERS) was first announced

in  1995 to rejuvenate older HDB estates to make them compatible

to  newer  estates.   Under the ERS, Main and Interim  Upgrading

Programmes  and  Selective  En-bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme  were

implemented in many constituencies.  Although MUPs and IUPs have

managed   to   spruce  up  older  estates,  there  are   certain

shortcomings:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Residents are inconvenienced during the construction

period which normally lasts two years.  Dust, noise and security

are key concerns of residents in these programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) MUPs and IUPs are sometimes unable to meet the needs of

residents,  especially in the provision of lifts  that  stop  at

every  floor and covered linkways.  Due to the design  of  these

old flats (especially those with staggered corridors), it is not

economical and structurally possible to install lifts that  stop

at  every  floor  or construct linkways which  can  benefit  all

residents  in these blocks.  This is a drastic setback  of  MUPs

and IUPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) MUPs and IUPs are unable to intensify the land use of

these older estates which usually have large open spaces.   Many

of these older flats are 10 to 12 storeys high, and thus deprive

the opportunity for higher density development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon feedback, the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment

Scheme  provides  a better alternative to rejuvenate  older  HDB

estates.   Better quality and higher density flats can be  built

to  maximise land use and provide better housing to Singaporeans

while keeping the community intact.  However, to achieve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>

this,  there  must be adequate vacant land set  aside  for  such

programmes when developing semi-mature estates or new towns.   I

notice  that not much vacant land was set aside in many estates.

Thus,  it  would  be  difficult for the Government  to  consider

Selective En-bloc Redevelopment programmes in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to suggest the following for the

Ministry to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Increase the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Programme; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Set aside more land for future SERS in semi-mature estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Executive Condominiums were introduced at

the  height  of  the  property boom when the "sandwiched"  class

could  not  afford private apartments.  At the same  time,  they

were  not  qualified to apply for HDB flats or  Executive  flats

because  of  the  income  ceiling.  The  Executive  Condominiums

served  a  useful role at that time.  Since the decline  of  the

private  residential  property market,  the  lower  end  of  the

private  condominium  market  has  become  very  affordable  and

already  provides  the next logical level  of  upgrade  for  HDB

dwellers.    Is   there   any  need  therefore   for   Executive

Condominiums  today?   Besides, I believe  that  the  Government

should  confine itself to providing basic housing for the masses

and  leave the supply of the more up-market ones to the  private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister tell us whether there is a review of the

role of Executive Condominiums and, if so, whether there is  any

plan to continue building such Executive Condominiums?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me thank Members for their

cooperation.  We seem to be moving along now at a better speed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked about rental flat applications. Our

statistics  show  that  there  are  not  more  applicants   than

previously.   The  waiting list remains the same.   In  February

1999,  the  waiting list was 1,331; February 1997 it was  1,341.

HDB would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>

continue to make rental flats easily available to applicants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen also mentioned that 3-room flats have not

been provided as rental flats.  This has been so since 1982.   I

will  get  HDB to look into the possibility of reopening  3-room

flats for rental applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked for the criteria for sale of

rental  flats to sitting tenants and he also requested  for  the

sale of the rental flats in the various blocks in Hougang.   Let

me  explain  the  sale  of  flats  to  sitting  tenants  scheme.

Primarily, it is to help those who are already renting flats  to

have  the opportunity to own the flats.  So it is our policy  to

encourage  sitting tenants to buy over the flats that they  have

been renting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong demand for rental flats in Hougang.

There are not very many rental flats in the area.  It is a  very

popular  area  and therefore we have no plans  to  offer  rental

blocks  in  the Hougang area for sale to the sitting tenants  at

this  juncture.  There is still more demand than available flats

in the Hougang area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studio apartment scheme for the elderly was announced

in November 1997 as a new housing scheme to cater to the special

needs  of  our  senior citizens.  Elderly lessees  who  wish  to

realise  the appreciation in value of their existing  flats  can

consider  buying  a  studio apartment that is  purpose-built  to

serve  their  needs.  The pilot project of the studio  apartment

scheme  was  launched in March last year at four sites,  with  a

total   of  650  studio  apartments.   The  response  has   been

encouraging  and we have announced that we will  have  two  more

sites  in  Bukit  Merah View and Toa Payoh Lorong  4.   We  will

continue  to  identify more sites if there is  demand  from  our

elderly lessees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the MPs have made a strong case about the

difficulties  faced  by  their residents  in  purchasing  studio

apartments as resale prices of their existing flats have fallen.

I  have  earlier  asked  HDB  to review  the  prices  of  studio

apartments to ensure that elderly lessees would still find them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>

attractive.   I  am  now pleased to announce that  HDB  will  be

reducing the selling prices of studio apartments by 25% for both

the  35-sq metre and the 45-sq metre apartments.  Before you all

get  too  carried  away and argue for similar reduction  in  new

flats,  let me explain why we are able to secure this  reduction

after very tough negotiation with the Chief Valuer and the  Land

Office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were able to do so because of the lower land prices on

the  one  hand, and also lower tender prices on the other  hand.

The  main source of savings is really from the lower land  rates

which  have been given by the Chief Valuer and agreed to by  the

Land  Office.  Why were we able to achieve this?  We argued that

the  studio apartments are sold under more restrictive terms and

conditions compared to normal HDB flats.  For example, they  are

sold on a 30-year lease compared to the 99-year lease for normal

HDB  flats.  HDB also argued that there is no resale value.   Dr

Wan Soon Bee, please note.  Therefore, the studio apartments can

only  be sold to a small group of elderly buyers above 55  years

old.   Furthermore, the studio apartments are located  on  small

plots of land in built-up areas which are generally not suitable

for  more  comprehensive  development on  its  own.   Therefore,

taking  into  account all these factors, the  Chief  Valuer  has

valued the land prices for the studio apartments far lower  than

those for the normal HDB flats.  I have also mentioned that  the

construction  costs  for  the studio  apartments  have  declined

because  we  have  adopted a more cost-effective  and  buildable

design,  and also there is a general fall in HDB tender  prices.

So  we  are now able to sell the studio apartments with a  price

reduction of 25%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the average selling price of the 35-sq metre apartments

will  now be $48,900 as compared to the estimated selling prices

of  $65,700 in November 1997.  For the more popular 45-sq  metre

apartments,  the  average price is now $61,600,  which  is  some

$20,000  cheaper than that announced previously.  We  hope  that

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>

reduction  in prices will make studio apartments more affordable

to our elderly lessees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have earlier withdrawn their applications,

they  can request to reinstate their applications.  HDB will  be

conducting the selection exercise for the pilot project soon and

we  expect  the studio apartments to be completed  by  the  year

2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee made two suggestions. One, to relax the

condition  that  the applicant must live in  HDB  flats  for  10

years.   We put that condition in because we want to give  first

priority to HDB lessees.  In subsequent phases, I think  we  can

consider relaxing this rule.  The second suggestion is to  allow

resale.  For the reasons I have explained earlier, we prefer  to

keep the studio apartments with the no-resale condition, so that

there  is  no speculation and there is no bubble in  the  resale

value  of  the studio apartments.  It is strictly  a  scheme  by

which  you convert your present flat to a studio apartment  that

will last you for the rest of your life, and you make use of the

capital  gain  to  give you an annuity, and to look  after  your

medical expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same objective as what Mrs Lim Hwee Hua spoke

about  on the reverse mortgages.  We have done the sums  several

times.   It is not as attractive.  Reverse mortgages are not  so

attractive  in  the HDB context because of the restrictions  and

the  regulations that we have in place, making  HDB  flats  less

mortgageable  to the banks.  We will monitor the market  to  see

how  effective  reverse  mortgages are  in  the  private  sector

market.  And if we find that it is viable for the HDB sector, we

will consider the application in the HDB sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the difficulties of Singaporeans

facing  rental  arrears, rescheduling of loans, downgrading  and

also  the  20%  deposit.  Rental arrears,  we  will  manage  the

problem  compassionately.  We will allow  them  longer  time  to

settle  the arrears through an instalment programme.  The rental

arrears problem is not very significant.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>

Less  than  4%  of  our rental tenants fall into  three  months'

arrears or more.  Particularly over the last few years, with the

very  generous  rental rebates that the Government  dished  out,

every  time  we have a very high rental arrears, the  Government

plays  Santa  Claus and the rents all get paid, and  the  rental

arrears problem was solved by itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rescheduling of loans, as we announced in November last

year,  we  have  five schemes by which Singaporeans  can  adjust

their mortgage loans:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) They can reduce the monthly loan instalments for the

first  five years to 75% of the normal amount.  This  is  called

the reduced repayment scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) They can reschedule the tenure of their loans to the

maximum repayment period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) They can defer payment of their monthly mortgage

instalments  for  six months if they face financial  difficulty.

If  necessary, HDB will extend the deferment period for  another

six months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) They can include more working family members as joint

owners  so that the CPF monies can be used to settle the arrears

and to service the monthly loan instalments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) They can pay their loan arrears by instalments over a

period of six to 12 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we announced these in November, more than 8,000 HDB

mortgagors have come on-board on these various schemes.  This is

a  very, very small percentage and therefore the problem is very

manageable.  The breakdown is that 5,800 have rescheduled  their

mortgage  loan  payments through the reduced  repayment  scheme;

1,200  have  extended their mortgage repayment  period;  another

1,200  have  deferred the payment of their mortgage instalments;

200  have  included  family members; and 300  are  currently  on

instalment plans to settle their arrears.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of downgrading, as we announced also in

November  last year, applicants on our queue who find that  they

now cannot afford the flats that they have applied for, can come

to  HDB  to  request  for  a  change in  their  flat  type,  ie,

downgrading  of  flat  type.  We will  consider  their  requests

flexibly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 20% deposit, I am afraid we cannot exercise

flexibility.   I think this is part of financial  prudence.   If

you  want  to upgrade and you want to buy a bigger flat,  please

pay up the 20% deposit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Estates Renewal Strategy (ERS), Dr Teo Ho Pin suggests

that  we  put in place vacant land so that we can have Selective

En-bloc Redevelopment in future.  I do not know what the  future

will look like in 20-30 years.  We have enough open space within

our  existing  estates  that if we want  to  undertake  SERS  in

future,  that can be done.  But I must tell you that  today  the

HDB estates are built to quite high density.  Mr Low Thia Khiang

has already complained that you can fight across the blocks with

bamboo  sticks.  If we build to any higher density, you  may  be

able to fight across with broomsticks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked about the status of the Executive

Condominiums.   I  agree with him that when the property  market

was  very  hot, the role of the Executive Condominiums was  very

important and they came in very useful.  Now that the prices  of

Executive Condominiums are coming much closer to the low end  of

private  property, the Government needs to review the  role  and

the  demand  for  Executive Condominiums.  As we have  announced

earlier, we will take this review as part of the September  1999

decision on how much Executive Condominium land supply  we  will

release for next year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification from

the Minister?  I would like to know whether the sale of flats to

sitting tenants scheme is linked to the level of support for the

PAP and the election results.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> There is no linkage in the sale of flats

to sitting tenants scheme to the level of electoral support.  We

encourage our tenants to buy over their flats.  But at the  same

time,  you  must balance the needs of other low income  families

who  are now on the waiting list.  So, wherever possible, we can

meet  the  demand we will sell the flats to the sitting tenants.

But if we sell all the rental flats to the sitting tenants, then

we  will not have enough flats for future allocation to those on

the waiting list.  So, unfortunately, the Hougang area is a very

popular area, not Hougang in his constituency, but Hougang as  a

general  area  is a very popular area.  There is a long  waiting

list  and  we  do  not have such a big supply  of  rental  flats

compared to the central areas.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, since the Minister said that he

was  not  referring  to  my  constituency,  could  the  Ministry

consider  selling  the 3-room flats in my  constituency  to  the

sitting tenants?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The history of HDB is that we built a

lot  of rental flats in the early years and most of these  flats

happened  to  be  in  the central areas  in  the  older  housing

estates, like Queenstown, Toa Payoh, etc.  Therefore, there  are

more  rental flats in these areas to be sold to sitting tenants.

By  the  time  we  moved up to Hougang area, we built  very  few

rental  flats.  Therefore, there is a premium.  People  continue

to  buy rental flats in the North East zone.  So we must keep  a

sufficient supply of rental flats to meet the demand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> You say it is not popular in Hougang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I say it is very popular.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Not in my constituency?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Not in your constituency.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, town councils were introduced in

order to help HDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>

housing estate management.  It is a laudable objective,  and  it

is  still  laudable.  But I would like to ask  the  Minister  to

consider changing the concept of the town council into  a  local

council  where  private  estates as  well  as  the  Housing  and

Development Board estates could be managed together.   We  could

go  one  step  further.   This town council  could  also  manage

schools as well as recreational activities in the area.  At  the

moment,  there  is  a clear segregation between  HDB  flats  and

private  properties.   It  would be good  national  bonding  and

integration if both could come together.  As it is, I know  that

some  of  the private residents provide membership for the  town

council,  but  that  is not adequate.  We  should  go  one  step

further.  I urge the Minister to seriously consider this.   This

will also lead to the growth of a civil society in Singapore and

people  from  the  private estates as well as  HDB  could  forge

together a national consciousness on issues affecting them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Every year, the Government has set aside a

huge budget for the Main and Interim Upgrading Programmes of the

HDB  estates.  For FY 1999 the amount is $413 million.   Private

housing  residents are feeling a bit left out in this  upgrading

exercise.   Many feel that they pay high taxes.   Yet,  when  it

comes  to the provision of infrastructural services for  private

housing estates, they are asked to pay again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members examples of how residents feel about

what  the  Government's role should be in this area.   First  is

regarding  the re-laying of Singapore Power gas pipes.   As  you

know, we have been told that when the pipes reach about 25 years

old, it is not safe to continue using these pipes.  They have to

be  abandoned and new pipes have to be re-laid if the  residents

want  to  continue using town gas.  Again, here, the  households

have  been  asked to pay a few thousand dollars.  Otherwise,  if

they  do  not  contribute their share, they would  have  to  use

bottled gas.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area is regarding cable TV. In many private

housing estates today, they have been told that if they want  to

subscribe  to  cable  TV, they are asked  again  to  pay  a  few

thousand dollars.  For bungalows, it is as high as about $6,000.

For  smaller housing units, it is about $2,000 to $3,000.  Here,

again,  the  residents feel that this is really  infrastructural

and  should  be  supported by the Government, if not  fully,  at

least partially.  So I hope the Minister will look again at this

issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have a question on the status of

the  upgrading  of private estate policy that was announced  two

years ago.  I would like the Minister to clarify.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, the Government announced a few years

ago  that they would implement an improvement scheme to  upgrade

private  housing estates.  However, no concrete plans  had  been

implemented to-date.  In comparison to HDB estates where  a  lot

of   resources  have  been  devoted  to  MUP,  IUP  and  general

improvement  works, private housing estates  have  been  grossly

neglected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current budget, the Ministry's development budget is

about $2.61 billion of which $2.26 billion, that is, about 86.3%

has   been   allocated   to   public  housing.    Infrastructure

development  in HDB estate alone accounts for $113 million.   In

order  to  correct  the bias and shift the emphasis  to  a  more

balanced position, improvement works in private housing  estates

should  be carried out as soon as possible.  These will  include

road widening, more parks and improved sewage system, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the many problems raised by land property owners,

the  cost of sharing the laying of Singapore Cable Vision  cable

to  private housing estates is a common concern.  In the case of

HDB  estates, the laying of SCV cable is taken as infrastructure

work  and  the  cost  is  subsidised  by  the  Government.   HDB

residents need only to pay for internal connections within their

flats.  However, private landed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>

property  owners  have to share the laying  cost.   In  general,

owners  of  terrace and semi-detached houses will  have  to  pay

about $2,000 and bungalow owners have to pay about $6,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my house visit to residents in Charlton Park and Tai

Keng  Gardens,  many residents asked whether the laying  of  SCV

cable  could  be  taken as infrastructure work,  just  like  the

laying of electrical cables, water and gas pipes.  Although  the

residents  are aware that SCV is a private company  and  so  the

laying  of SCV cable is a private project, they take it that  it

is  part  of the Government's efforts in achieving the  national

objective of promoting multi-media communications in future.  As

such, their request is not totally without justification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the Ministry's expenditure on

improvement  works  in HDB estates is extremely  high  vis-a-vis

improvement  expenditure in private estates.  This  is  probably

due  to  the  limited scope of improvement works  which  can  be

carried  out  by  the Government.  For instance, the  Government

cannot spend money to improve any item within the boundary of  a

private  property.  If this is so, then the laying of SCV  cable

up  to the front gate of private houses can be considered as  an

infrastructure improvement item, just like connecting SCV  cable

to   HDB  blocks.   I  would  therefore  urge  the  Minister  to

coordinate with the other relevant Ministries to see whether the

laying of SCV cable can be taken as an infrastructure item.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head U (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, my GPC colleagues have made a

spirited plea for the need for upgrading of private estates.   I

join them to find out the status of the upgrading programme  for

private estates that the Minister has announced some years  ago.

Those of us who come from constitutencies with large numbers  of

private  estates  are consistently under pressure,  particularly

after  the introduction of Neighbourhood Committees (NCs)  where

they look forward to some form of upgrading programme for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I undertand that with the deficit budget, it will be

very  difficult  to  spend too much money  on  private  estates,

nevertheless, I like to urge the Minister to consider starting a

pilot  programme for these private estates, especially now  that

the  costs  are much lower than before.  Secondly, the upgrading

of private estates need not necessarily be as costly as those of

the  HDB estates.  What is really required is a coordination  of

the  various agencies - the PWD, the Ministry of the Environment

and  maybe in some cases, the Ministry of Health - to help  look

after   the  environment,  coordinate  certain  works   in   the

environment,  and that could go a long way and,  for  this,  the

Government  need not spend so much money.  But, where  possible,

it   can   spend  money  to  upgrade  or  introduce   children's

playgrounds  and  so  on.   I  hope the  Ministry,  despite  the

difficult times, would consider some form of help and some  form

of  coordination  of  these works so  that  the  private  estate

residents would also feel just as Singaporeans as HDB residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> We are running out of time. Can I urge

Members  to  be  brief  so that we can  get  a  reply  from  the

Minister.  Mr Rai.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I will be brief, Sir. My other

colleagues have mentioned the question of cable vision.  I  will

not  touch  on  it.   I  will  just touch  on  the  question  of

developing  the private estates, like open drains. Mr  Koo  Tsai

Kee  was kind enough to send a note to me after the last  Budget

sittings.   The  private home owners bear a  greater  burden  of

economic  sacrifice.  It is inequitable, because the  Government

is subsidising HDB flat owners.  Here, all we are asking is very

minimal,  like  the planting of trees.  I will give  a  case  in

point.   At St. Michael's Road, there is a block of condominiums

that has just come up.  The drain has been covered, but part  of

it  is still open.  If people have to walk, they have to walk to

the  road  and come back.  For the older estates,  it  would  be

worthy  of  Government support and I urge the Minister  to  give

some thought to this matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> There is a tendency today for many

Government contracts to be tendered out in large amounts of more

than $100 million.  This is disadvantageous to small and medium-sized  contractors  who  are mostly local.   The  big  lucrative

contracts  tend  to  be won by the foreign contractors  and  the

local  contractors  then  become the sub-contractors.   In  this

period of recession, there is an urgent need to assist our local

indigenous contractors and help them to tide over this downturn.

The  Government  could  do this by tendering  out  contracts  in

smaller  amounts without sacrificing efficiency and lower  cost.

I  hope  that the Minister will look into this with the  aim  of

giving  local  contractors  more  opportunities  to  tender  for

Government projects.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Sir, I would like to declare my

interest.  My first point has been covered by Mr Lew Syn Pau  on

chopping  up  the  size  of projects to allow  more  players  to

survive in the market.  My second point is that the construction

industry  is currently very bad.  It is compounded by  the  pre-qualification  process  put up by some Government  agencies.   I

will quickly give two examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that the ENV Ministry has called for contractors to

pre-qualify for their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>

Deep  Tunnel  Sewerage System (DTSS).  But it sets a requirement

that  interested  contractors must have prior track  records  in

this  kind of work.  This is the first time we are building this

system.   I  do  not  see  how  the  agency  can  expect   local

contractors  to  have  a  track  record,  and  if  none  of  the

contractors  can  participate, then the nation will  forever  be

denied of a chance in gaining the knowledge to do such work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the pre-qualification by PSA to build

an   office  building  and  the  specification  says  that   the

contractors must have experience in design-and-build  on  office

buildings and this rules out a lot of contractors because  there

are very few of these projects so far.  But if PSA says that the

contractors  must have design-and-build experience  and  at  the

same  time have built some office buildings somewhere before  or

more  recently, you will still meet the requirement  of  getting

the correct capability to build and also the correct quality.  I

think it is important that all these things are taken care of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing I would like to ask the Minister is: under what

circumstances  are  the agencies allowed to  recall  design-and-build  tenders? It is very common for a team to put up a lot  of

money in preparing a tender, and if a tender is called after the

tender prices are published and all the designs are made public,

then the party calling the tender is effectively encouraging the

parties to breach intellectual copyrights.  Unless the re-tender

specifications are substantially changed, I urge the Minister to

ensure  that  no design-and-build projects will be called  after

the  tender prices are published or their designs are being made

known to the public or contestants.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, I will take less than one minute.

One  of  the  areas  most in need of regulatory  review  is  the

existing  building regulations.  The Building  and  Construction

Authority  will  begin operation next month.  I  would  like  to

propose  that  one  of its first priorities be  a  comprehensive

review  of  building  regulations.  There are  many  regulations

which have been inherited from the British which are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>

now  outdated.  Others should be brought up to the  standard  of

international  best  practice with regard to  safety  standards,

standardisation to achieve efficiency and use of technology.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, can I take the two cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Despite the implementation of the Construction

of  Quality Assessment Scheme and the Zero Construction  Defects

Scheme in 1991, building defects are still commonly seen in many

buildings  in  Singapore.  As reported in the Straits  Times  on

13th  January  1996,  I quote, "It is raining  outside.   It  is

leaking  inside many Singapore buildings and homes."  Over  half

of  the buildings on the island leak.  Building defects such  as

uneven  floor, leaky plumbing, seeping windows and  cracks  have

caused  much  inconvenience to many home owners.   It  has  also

resulted  in  an  increase in the number of disputes  among  the

developers,  home buyers, consultants, contractors and  property

management  organisations.  Much time and  resources  have  been

wasted in resolving these disputes which could have been avoided

if  buildings are built to achieve a specified quality.  I would

like  to  make  the  following suggestions to  the  Ministry  to

consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) set up a knowledge base on building defects, repair

techniques  and good construction practices.  The  Building  and

Construction  Authority  can  work  with  our  universities   to

spearhead research on building defects;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) provide a defect incentive sum, about 1% of contract sum in

all  contracts, so that developers, consultants and  contractors

can  use  the  money provided to rectify the  defects.   Defects

could  be  due to poor specification by clients over  design  or

shoddy  workmanship.  Any money saved from  this  sum  could  be

distributed among the developers, consultants and contractors;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) more warranty or insurance schemes should be provided to

safeguard  against  defects, especially  structural  and  water-proofing problems; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) exercise stringent control on imported materials and

components.  These materials must be tested in tropical  climate

before  being implemented in buildings. Endorsement  by  PSB  or

relevant authorities will provide essential quality control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of ERP, it is now timely to consider the

reduction  of car ownership cost for both private and commercial

vehicle  owners.  Carpark fees, especially season  parking  fee,

can  be  a  burden  to many vehicle owners and companies.   Some

people  own cars out of necessity while others drive their  cars

home  to  save  transport  cost.  In the  present  crisis,  many

vehicle  owners are feeling the strain to pay for  parking  fees

both within and outside the CBD.  Commercial vehicles pay a  few

hundred dollars monthly for season parking while HDB flat owners

pay  between $55 and $75.  To alleviate the financial burden  of

vehicle  owners,  I  would  like to propose  that  the  Ministry

consider  reducing  season and daily  carparking  fees  for  all

vehicle owners.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Many of these management corporations of

private  apartments and condominiums over the  years  have  been

facing  a  lot of problems with the property managers they  have

appointed, because many of them are incompetent and they are not

suitable to run this kind of estate management.  The main reason

is  that  there is no requirement for the licensing of  property

managers by the Commissioner of Buildings.  I would like to  ask

the Minister whether he would consider the licensing of property

managers so that management corporations can have more competent

property managers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> I would like to refer to the

painful  recent  episode in which two young girls  died  in  the

Pulau

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>

Ubin  incident.   I  would like to ask for the  introduction  of

measures  to ensure safe use of our national parks.   We  cannot

prevent all accidents but we owe it to our people to ensure that

no  lives are wasted when unschooled city-folks try to  live  in

the unfamiliar wild.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development (Mr Koo Tsai Kee): Sir, on behalf of the Minister, I

would  like to thank all the speakers for their valuable inputs.

You  can  be  assured that the Minister and I will  factor  your

inputs into future policy considerations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Town Councils, I wish to thank Mr Rai. Town Councils are

really new animals.  They are about 10 years old.  Over time,  I

am  sure  Town Councils will take on more responsibilities.   On

the  building of a civil society, Town Councils are working with

the CDCs to help mould the community together.  So I am sure the

aspect of community bonding will progress along quite fine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the improvement of private estates, I want to assure the

House that the Government has not forgotten its promise made  in

1997.   But we are in the middle of a recession and we  have  to

keep  these items in view for a little longer.  But it  will  be

done, and it will be done well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allocation of Government contracts, contrary to what Mr

Chuang  has  said, local contractors have done  very  well.   In

fact,  I have looked at the figures. Local contractors have  won

something like 60% or 70% of local contracts in terms of dollars

and  in the HDB design-and-build contracts, 23 out of 25 design-and-build contracts were awarded to local contractors.   Whether

we  should  cut  down a big contract into smaller  portions  for

local  contractors to bite on is something we have  to  look  at

very carefully.  There may not be economies of scale to bring  a

big project down to smaller projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On carparks, Dr Teo asked for reduction in fees. HDB has not

increased  HDB  and URA carpark fees since 1994 except  for  two

areas, Kampong Glam and another

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>

area.  And the reason is that HDB and URA carpark fees are still

very  low  compared  to private estates.  We  need  to  increase

carpark fees in the Kampong Glam area because there was  a  long

queue for limited carparks in that area.  In any case, URA  fees

there are much lower than the private carpark operators' fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Sinnakaruppan's point of licensing of property managers,

legislation  may  not  be  the  best  way  but  I  do  encourage

management  corporations to seek out competent and  professional

managing agents.  I understand that APFM has been formed and  we

encourage  MCs to approach APFM to propose some managing  agents

for management corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank Dr Toh for his suggestion on national parks.

That  was  a  tragic accident.  We have taken note of  what  had

happened  and we will make sure that these things do not  happen

again, but there is no guarantee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> I thank the Minister and the Parliamentary

Secretary  for  their  replies and seek leave  to  withdraw  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Professor Low.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated to the Head U of the Main Estimates

be reduced by $10 in respect to Code UF 1500.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to talk about the pig transmitted disease. It

was  reported  that there was an outbreak of  this  new  disease

known as Japanese Encephalitis (JE) disease in Malaysia.  Why it

concerns us is that Malaysia is one of the main sources of  pork

supply  to  Singapore.  The second thing is that the  pigs  from

Malaysia are imported live into Singapore.  They then go through

the  auction  house process before they are slaughtered  in  our

local abattoir.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask a few questions. First, could we

ensure  that  the live pigs which come to Singapore for  auction

are 100% JE virus free?  If not, what precautions do we take  to

ensure  that the virus in the pig will not spread to our  fellow

Singaporeans?  Third, is there any case that the Minister  knows

of  a Singaporean who has contracted such a disease?  Fourth, if

we  could  be  sure that the import of pigs are  100%  infection

free,  should we advise Singaporeans to reduce their consumption

of  pork  and import less pigs during this highly JE  infectious

period  or  divert our source of pig supply from other  sources,

which  we believe it will be less likely to be affected  by  the

virus.   My last question: is pork from infected pigs  safe  for

consumption?  If it is not safe, then how could we be sure  that

imported frozen pork is free from the virus?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, on behalf of the Minister, I want to

assure the House and everybody in Singapore that eating pork  is

very safe.  In fact, tomorrow, I will invite my good friend,  Dr

Low, to eat bak ku teh again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese Encephalitis (JE) disease is a viral disease

which  is  spread  by  mosquitoes.  It is potentially  fatal  to

humans.   The  disease,  however, cannot be  contracted  through

consumption of pork, provided the pork is cooked.  So  it  is  a

mosquito related problem, rather than a pig related problem.  Of

course, the pig is the carrier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department is taking all measures to

make  sure that mosquito breeding in the hog auction market  and

the  place where they load and unload pigs will be safe.  So  we

will  fog the place once a week.  We have been fogging the place

once  a week and we have been spraying insecticide twice a  day.

We  ensure  that  all  the operators there  will  be  vaccinated

against JE.  Again, eating pork is safe.  Please carry on eating

pork.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, in my rush to answer some questions, I forgot

to  answer  two  points  on  building regulations  and  building

defects.   On building regulations, we are not waiting  for  the

BCA to be formed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>

In fact, right now, BCD and CIDB are looking at ways to trim the

regulations.  CIDB has commissioned a consultant's report a  few

months  ago to make sure that our regulatory or compliance  cost

is low.  In areas where we can trim the regulations, we would do

so.   BCD is now looking at the new Building Control Act to make

sure  that  the  building regulations are in  line  with  modern

standards, and unnecessary regulations will be discarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to add that BCD has done very well, even though

there  is  a perception out there that BCD is the depository  of

rules and regulations, and making construction cost high.   Over

the  years, BCD has made sure that planning approvals have  been

speeded up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On building defects, this is something that the management

corporations  must  sort out with the  developers.   If  we  ask

developers to deposit more money with the Government, then  this

cost will be passed on to the home buyers.  It is true that  the

quality  of  construction in Singapore can improve and  we  will

work on that.  We need the help of everybody, including SCAL.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a garden city. Despite its small size,

parks  and  gardens are provided amongst the urban developments.

These  green  lungs are an important part of the infrastructure,

so  that Singaporeans  as urban dwellers have somewhere to go to

enjoy  nature.   The popularity of most of the public  parks  is

testimony to the satisfaction of such a need.  However,  I  have

observed that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>

Chinese  and  Japanese  Gardens are largely  under-utilised.   I

believe  this has to do with the entrance charges of  $4.50  for

adults  and $2 for children.  For residents in the western  part

of  Singapore, these gardens are one of the few which  they  can

enjoy,  but having to pay an entrance fee to enjoy the parks  is

surely prohibitive.  Can Members imagine if the East Coast  Park

and Pasir Ris Park also start to charge an entrance fee?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest to the relevant authority to

look  into  transferring the privately-run Chinese and  Japanese

Gardens  to  the National Parks Board, rather than having  large

and beautiful gardens open only to the paying few.  Why not make

it  into a public park where everyone can enjoy?  As it  is,  we

are  a small island state with little natural resources.  A park

that is under-utilised is surely a waste of limited resources.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I will forward the suggestion from Dr

Wan  to  JTC because the Chinese Garden and the Japanese  Garden

are  currently  managed by the Singapore Leisure Industries  Pte

Ltd,  which  is a subsidiary of JTC.  The National  Parks  Board

manages  a wide variety of public parks to meet the recreational

needs  of all Singaporeans.  There is also a role for privately-run  parks  and  recreational facilities like the Mandai  Orchid

Garden,  Haw  Par  Villa,  Japanese and  Chinese  Gardens.   The

National  Parks  Board  cannot justify  acquiring  privately-run

parks  on  the grounds of improving utilisation and giving  free

admission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for Singapore's economy to remain competitive, we have

decided  that a knowledge economy is the way to go.   What  this

means  is  that over time, we have to nurture as many knowledge-based  companies  as  possible.  The  question  is:  what  is  a

knowledge-based  company?  What kind  of  capabilities  will  be

needed for the knowledge-based companies to compete, and how can

we  create the environment so that more of these knowledge-based

companies can emerge faster and sooner in Singapore's economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, obviously, many of us will look at a knowledge-based

company differently.  I would like to present one way of looking

at  a knowledge-based company.  In the age of globalisation  and

technology,  we will see keener competition in the market  place

and  a  faster  pace  of technology evolution.   Knowledge-based

companies must have at least two sets of capabilities,  so  that

they  will  be able to cross two gates.  The first gate  that  a

knowledge-based  company needs to cross  is  what  we  call  the

technology gate, meaning that the company must have the  ability

either to develop and to enhance technology, or at least  to  be

able to access technology developed by somebody else, to be able

to  apply  the  technology, so that it can cross the  technology

gate.   But that is not enough, because at the end of  the  day,

you have to find customers in order to generate revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, companies will have to cross a second gate

known  as the market gate.  When we talk of the market gate,  it

could refer to new geographical markets or new customers in  the

existing  market,  or new customers through new  channels,  like

Cyberspace,  electronic  commerce  and  so  on.   This  means  a

knowledge-based company (KBC) must be able to know  how  to  use

the  technology and how to reach out to customers.  This is  the

first set of capabilities needed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not good enough, because customers in the

market  place do not buy technology.  They buy solutions,  which

means  that  the  KBC must also have the capabilities  to  build

bridges,  to bridge the gap between technology gate  and  market

gate.   The first bridge that they have to build is a bridge  of

innovation,  the  ability  to transform  the  potential  in  the

technology  into  new products, new services, new  applications,

new  processes and so on, something which the customers  in  the

market place would find relevant and useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even that is not good enough because customers do not buy

ideas.   They  buy physical goods or services.  So a  KBC  would

have  to  build  a  second bridge known as the  bridge  of  mass

customisation,  which is very different from the industrial  age

of  mass production.  Because in the case of mass production, we

talk   about  quality,  productivity.   In  the  case  of   mass

customisation,  we talk about flexibility, adaptability  and  so

on.   These are the new capabilities that the KBC will  need  to

build.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to go further to say that even this is

not  good enough.  Crossing the two gates and building  the  two

bridges  is  not  good  enough,  because  in  a  knowledge-based

economy,  the  key resource is people, knowledge workers,  which

means  a  KBC, in order to be able to get the best of  knowledge

workers,  must  have the two engines to drive its  growth.   The

first  engine is what we call organisation development.  I refer

to  the  ability  to create a culture, an environment  within  a

company  so  as  to  be  able to bring  the  best  out  of  each

individual, not just in terms of knowledge and skills but  their

attitude, their innovation, their creativity and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a spirit of entrepreneurship, which means that

they must be able to move fast, be able to look at opportunities

and respond quickly, a kind of enterprising spirit.  All in all,

Sir, it is not easy to be a KBC.  It must be good in technology,

market,    innovation,    mass    customisation,    organisation

development, and entrepreneurship.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, from a national point of view, obviously, we

hope that over time, we will be able to attract enough companies

to  nurture  these  total capabilities in  Singapore.   This  is

important  because  if we allow the KBE to  be  developed  in  a

lopsided  manner,  then,  over  time,  we  are  going  to   have

tremendous problems.  For example, not everybody can be good  in

R&D.  Not everybody can be good in design and so on.  Therefore,

what  we  have to do is to create opportunities in all  the  six

areas  so that every Singaporean can pursue career opportunities

according to their interests and capabilities.  But what we have

to  recognise is that, from the KBC's point of view, there is no

need  for them to put all these total capabilities in Singapore,

because  they have the option of distributing these capabilities

in  the  region  across  national  boundaries.   Therefore,  our

challenge is, firstly, how can we minimise the push factor  and,

secondly,  how  can  we  maximise  the  pull  factor,  so  that,

hopefully, as many KBCs as possible will actually develop  these

total capabilities in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report is an excellent report and many issues have been

addressed.   This  afternoon,  let  us  look  at  it  from   the

Government's  angle,  what Government  can  do  to  ensure  this

balanced development of total capability towards a KBE.  I  have

talked  about the need for the Government agencies to coordinate

better  so  as  not to promote each individual  capabilities  in

isolation.  Of  course,  the  first  step  that  the  Government

agencies  have  to do is not to contradict each other  in  their

investment  promotion but, more importantly, it is for  them  to

reinforce  each  other,  so that when the  agencies  talk  to  a

company,  they will be selling the company the message of  total

capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that some companies in Singapore have the

wrong   impression  that  when  we  talk  about  knowledge-based

economy, knowledge-based company, we are talking about giving up

manufacturing.  We are talking about going into design, into R&D

only.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>

I  have heard companies telling NTUC that we are going to  close

down our plant in Singapore because in line with the call of the

Government  to  move towards a knowledge-based economy,  we  are

going  to upgrade our operation into a design centre or  an  R&D

centre.   So, closing down the factory in Singapore is  entirely

in line with the Government's strategy.   And we have to explain

to  them  and say, "No.  When we talk about KBC, we are  talking

about  total capability."  I hope the Government can do more  to

strengthen that message.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a concrete thing the Government can do is to repackage

all  the  incentive  schemes to give additional  incentives  for

companies  that  are  able  to build that  total  capability  in

Singapore.  Take, for example, is it not possible for us to come

up  with  a  new  incentive scheme known  as  a  Knowledge-based

Companies  Incentive  Scheme  whereby  for  companies  that  are

prepared  to  invest in all six capabilities  in  Singapore,  we

adopt  an incentive-plus approach, that is to say, they will  be

able  to enjoy all incentives available to anybody else but,  on

top of that, a premium incentive to be given to them?  Is it not

possible  for  all the economic agencies to adopt a  centralised

account  management  system to appoint  one  agency  to  be  the

account  manager to manage all these investments as  an  account

and  to make sure that they would implement the six capabilities

together?  Is it not possible for the economic agency to  set  a

target  to form a knowledge-based company club in Singapore  and

set  a target over the next two to five years and have 100, 500,

or   1,000  KBCs  to  be  based  in  Singapore  with  the  total

capability?  Thank you, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, during the next three to five years

of  the economic recovery phase in Singapore and the region,  it

is important for us to monitor our business costs very carefully

in  order to ensure that costs do not increase at such a rate as

to render doing business in Singapore uncompetitive.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate, I mentioned the need to

systematically examine the regulatory environment to see  if  it

contributes to cost.  I would like to focus on the monitoring of

business cost in this speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracking of business cost can be done at two levels.

The  first is direct feedback from companies.  Some of  this  is

already  occurring  and I am sure that MTI's  statutory  boards,

namely,  EDB,  TDB and JTC, do receive real time  feedback  from

companies.   It  may be timely to formalise this practice.   One

efficient and cost-effective way to do this is via the Internet,

and  for  MTI  and  each of its statutory  boards  to  create  a

dedicated  e-mail address each where business people can  e-mail

their feedback to the Government.  The second type of monitoring

should  be  at the macro level by tracking Singapore's  business

cost  vis-a-vis that of its competitors.  In my view,  there  is

room  for  improvement where our indices of cost competitiveness

are concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a unit business cost index of manufacturing

but  there is none for services.  Perhaps it is time to start  a

unit business cost index for selected services sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the unit business cost index of manufacturing is

based  on  the  1988  input  structure.   I  am  sure  that  the

industrial structure has changed significantly over the last  10

years as to render an update timely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important question, however, is which countries

are Singapore's major competitors in order that we can benchmark

our  cost  against theirs.  The answer is not  too  obvious  and

varies  from  industry  to industry.  For  example,  Singapore's

share  of the electronic market in the US has dropped in  recent

years.   But  was this due to competition from the  US  or  from

companies,  including  US  multi-nationals  located   in   third

countries,  which  are also selling their  products  in  the  US

market?   In  other words, export destination may no  longer  be

identical  with the country which is the source of  competition.

Conversely,  Singapore's relative

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>

unit  labour cost in manufacturing vis-a-vis that of  the  other

NIEs  was a key indicator used in determining the extent of  the

total cut in wage cost needed last year.  There was a time  when

our  major  competitors in manufacturing were indeed  the  other

NIEs.   But  I  doubt if that is true today.  For example,  Hong

Kong has very little manufacturing left.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore think it would be timely for MTI to come up

with  new indicators to benchmark Singapore's cost in order that

we  can  carefully monitor our cost competitiveness in the  near

future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, this is not a time to slow down,

but  rather we should speed up the regionalisation process.   In

fact,  to  be  more accurate, we should encourage going  further

away and encourage globalisation to diversify our risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good opportunities exist in the region and around the world

and  Singapore  companies stand a good chance of  benefiting  by

investing before the upturn comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two possible ways in which Singapore companies

can globalise.  The first way is by complete replication, ie, by

moving  out  the whole operations from Singapore  resulting,  of

course,  in  the hollowing of our economy since all  the  value-added  activities will then occur outside the  country  and  the

host  country where these companies go to will benefit from  our

investments  while  Singapore  loses  out  because  of  loss  of

investment and loss of jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way is by breaking up the value chain of an

operation  and keeping some value added activities in  Singapore

so  that  this  still remains a centre where  funds,  trade  and

technology flow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other issue is that currently offshore operations of

Singapore companies cannot tap on the various incentive  schemes

offered to companies located here.  We are talking about the  65

or so schemes that are available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a few things. First of all, can we

devise new initiatives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>

and  incentives  to encourage globalisation by breaking  up  the

value  chains of operations so that Singapore still remains  the

centre  for  some  of its activities as opposed  to  encouraging

complete move out of operations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can we allow companies that still keep part of

their operations value in Singapore to be fully eligible for all

the  65  incentives instead of trying to devise new  schemes  to

help such companies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, provide new incentives to encourage mergers and

acquisitions of viable companies in the region, since there  are

good  opportunities like the acquisition of a Thai bank  by  DBS

recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, allow double tax deduction for costs related to

globalisation.   Some  of  these  are  the  relocation  cost  of

employees,  cost  of training of staff and the higher  insurance

cost of having operations overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, to encourage individuals to globalise to allow

personal  income tax rebates for higher cost of  maintenance  of

children, including education and the loss of spouse's income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to once again say that we have a very valuable

opportunity  to  extend the second wing of our  economy  and  we

should motivate more companies to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, we all know that the domestic

economy  of  Singapore is by comparison small.  It is  therefore

entirely  logical  for companies to grow  an  external  wing,  a

process  which  has already begun and towards facilitating  this

expansion,  many  Government  agencies  have  provided  numerous

assistance schemes.  The bulk of these schemes, however,  centre

on or favour greenfield or start-up operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not always be the ideal route, particularly at

this  time  when opportunities may arise to acquire attractively

priced and well managed businesses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>

outside Singapore, and the window may not be open for very long.

Acquisitions  provide  sufficient  leverage  and   momentum   to

Singapore  companies  venturing abroad, frequently  allowing  an

immediate penetration of other markets or securing expertise  to

complement operations back here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister provide incentives for such acquisitions

including perhaps extending similar tax concession to those  for

new businesses or capital?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, many of the points I want to speak,

Mr  Inderjit  Singh has already covered, but  I  have  just  one

suggestion.   Ministers go on official visits to many  countries

and  I  think it would be useful if the Trade Development  Board

works  with the country whenever a Minister is visiting  another

country  and  see what are the opportunities available  for  us.

Many  people  feel  that we should wait. An entrepreneur  should

look  now  if  there is  an opportunity to go forward  into  the

region  itself.   As  cited by Mr Inderjit  Singh,  DBS  is  one

classic  example.  Many people think it is not a good investment

but  they  think  in the long term.  We must take  a  long  term

strategy.  If I could just give an example.  In India, there  is

a  community call Marwaris who come from Rajastan. They are  all

over India and they are very successful.  We can be Marwaris  of

Singapore, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, few Singaporeans fully understand the impact

the  World  Trade  Organisation has on our economy.   The  World

Trade  regime is increasingly not only about trade.  It includes

and  influences Singapore's domestic policies and laws  on  such

matters  as intellectual property, investment incentives,  rules

for   industry,  government  procurement  and  the  opening   of

financial  services and other factors of our economy to  foreign

competition.   In this, I believe Singapore has been  an  active

participant in the WTO policy. In fact, we are perhaps among the

chief  proponents of free trade.  Other countries, however,  may

have  doubts, especially in this time of crisis.   There  are  a

growing  rumbles  of autarchy and narrow nationalism  among  our

neighbours.  There are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>

some   who  wish  to  withdraw  from  the  global  markets   and

international trade.  Such impulses would not be to our interest

in  my  belief,  nor are they in the long term interest  of  our

region.   There are such implications for Singapore and I  would

ask the Minister to comment on two areas of trade policy and the

WTO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singapore should continue to play a strong role in

working  with our ASEAN neighbours in initiatives  such  as  the

ASEAN  Free Trade Area.  In doing so, we will need to make  sure

if  regional efforts are compatible with the WTO as  a  form  of

open  regionalisation  rather than closed  regionalisation.   We

should also assist our neighbours in making transitions to freer

trade.   This  is  especially  so for  newer  ASEAN  members  in

Indochina.  In this regard, our Prime Minister made  a  call  at

the 1996 WTO Ministerial Meeting to give assistance to the least

developed  countries.   I  would ask  the  Minister  what  steps

Singapore has taken in this direction and whether consistent and

sufficient assistance has been given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would ask the Minister to comment on newer issues

coming into the WTO.  This includes the connection between trade

and  the protection of the environment as well as the connection

between trade and the protection of labour rights.  These issues

are  being put on the table by many developed countries  in  the

west,  including the USA, for the new so-called millennium round

of  trade  negotiations.  Many developing countries,  especially

those  in our region, have been sceptical about the initiatives.

There  are  grounds, indeed, to believe that these are disguised

attempts  at  protectionism.   We  should  guard  against   such

disguised  protectionism.   But, Sir,  I  ask  the  Minister  to

consider   that  Singapore  has  a  good  record  on  both   the

environment  and  on  labour rights judged  against  many  other

countries.   In  this  sense, I would agree  we  have  to  guard

against  protectionism.  But I would ask the  Minister  and  his

Ministry  not  to  shy away from the valid  discussion  of  such

issues.   I  believe that we should not be a nay  sayer  in  the

coming  rounds of negotiations whose only role is to  say  "No".

Together with others, I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>

encourage  Singapore and the Minister to engage with Europe  and

the USA on these issues to develop an international approach  in

the  WTO  that  is  fair  and agreeable to  both  developed  and

developing  countries.  May I ask the Minister  to  outline  our

policy in these areas for the coming rounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the WTO and international trade are vital to

Singapore's  present and future interest.  The WTO  is  a  rule-based regime that affords a degree of fairness amongst countries

both  big  and  small.  I hope the Minister will  elucidate  our

policies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, as I indicated during the Budget

debate,  I  would like to go into some detail as to how  we  can

promote technopreneurship in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1998 World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Singapore

second  after  USA  in  terms of overall  competitiveness  while

Taiwan  ranked  16.  However, if we go into the details  in  the

area  of entrepreneurship, Taiwan and Singapore switched  places

with  Taiwan ranking number 3 while Singapore ranked  number  17

and  in  the  category of creation of companies,  Taiwan  ranked

fourth while Singapore ranked 25th.  The USA ranked 1st in  this

category.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that we are losing the battle to be the Silicon

Valley  of  the  east and if we are serious about grooming  more

technopreneurs and entrepreneurs, we have to do a lot more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the experience of starting up two companies in

the last one year, one is a high-tech company and the other is a

trading business.  I have to admit that while the drive to be  a

technopreneur  comes mostly from within you,  a  more  conducive

environment could have facilitated things and make the  life  of

an entrepreneur less stressful.  While I did not wait for things

to  change to get started, I am hopeful that the path for future

technopreneurs  would  be better.  In my  case,  after  actively

looking for funds in Singapore and being unsuccessful, I had  to

raise  about 70% of the funds from my company from overseas  and

about 60% of them come from Taiwan.  I also faced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>

obstacles  that  originated  from  our  multi-national   focused

economic  strategies and policies that are not friendly  towards

local start-ups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the restrictive environment here, I almost agreed to

take on two opportunities, one in the USA in 1994 and another in

Taiwan   in  1995  to  be  involved  in  starting  up  high-tech

companies.  However, I decided to stay put in Singapore with the

hope  of helping to change the environment here and also try  to

initiate  similar projects in Singapore.  Also, I felt  that  it

was  my duty to stay here.  However, I know of a number of cases

of  capable  people  who  have left  Singapore  because  of  the

restrictive environment.  One is in Silicon Valley now  and  the

other  who has started up an Internet-based company in Singapore

is  very  discouraged by the lack of support and is  considering

leaving for the USA.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we should do a lot more to create an

environment that promotes technoprenuership and entrepreneurship

which  our  current  Budget did not  address,  as  I  have  said

earlier.  If  we start to do more now, can we then  achieve  our

objective of being the knowledge-based economy of the future and

avoid  losing our talented people to other countries  that  have

more vibrant KBE industries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on my experience and observations, I would like to

suggest the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We need to set up a new EDB-style organisation that

has  a  full-time job of supporting entrepreneurs.   EDB's  main

focus is on MNCs and lately, I believe, PLEs have been added  to

their list.  But no one takes a focused look at start-ups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The bankruptcy laws need to be amended. I think the

Minister has already addressed this and I will not touch on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Government sets up a high-risk fund which they are

prepared to lose.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>

Entrepreneurs can borrow from this fund or make use of this fund

for  their start-ups and pay back if they are successful.   Even

if  one in 10 of such projects makes it, the net loss to such  a

fund  can  be quite minimal, because the returns from the  other

one out of 10 that is successful can be quite substantial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In the area of venture capitalists, I talked about the

conservative nature of our VCs down here.  I think  we  need  to

develop a more vibrant environment for such venture capitalists,

like  those that exist in the Silicon Valley in the USA  and  in

Taiwan.  I would like to suggest the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Government should divide their current big funds in the

Government-linked VCs (like Temasek Holdings)  to  many  smaller

funds and invite private sector businessmen and entrepreneurs to

manage  these funds.  Fund sizes could range between $30 million

and $40 million.  We could start a pilot project with one or two

of such funds and inviting some local businessmen to take on the

challenge of managing such funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Initially, until we can develop a vibrant environment for

VCs,  I suggest that Government helps by providing a service  to

locate  VCs  from around the world and link them up  with  local

entrepreneurs  until a natural network of VCs can  be  developed

down  here.  Basically, I am suggesting that the Government play

a match-making role to link the technopreneur to the fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Set up permanent industry groupings or committees of the

various industry groups identified by the EDB in the Industry 21

Plan.   Let each of these groups be under the leadership of  the

private  sector.  And each permanent grouping should have  full-time   staff  consisting  of  administrative  people   providing

administrative  support  as well as technical  people  from  the

industry who can come and work on a rotational basis to work  on

key ideas and joint projects, the results of which can be shared

by the particular industry group members.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) I feel that we need to have a good mix of people at the

policy-making  level in the Government and Government  agencies.

We  need  not  just academically smart people, but also  street-smart people, as I have said many times.  I suggest we seriously

consider  the  selection and promotion system in the  Government

service to include people with good experience on the ground  in

the industry.  One possibility is to co-opt people from industry

for  two  to three-year term into key positions where  decisions

are made in supporting entrepreneurs and technopreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Modify the many Government schemes that we have today which

require  you to spend your money upfront before you are  allowed

to  claim  the  money  or  to  be  reimbursed  later  on.   Such

technological type of companies typically require a lot of  cash

outlay  in  the beginning and cash flow problem  can  be  a  big

headache  for  entrepreneurs.  So if some of these  schemes  can

allow upfront funding, it will help us quite tremendously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Finally, we need to be very serious about promoting

'cottage  industries'.   The  Prime Minister  talked  about  the

possibility of using HDB homes for some of these light  industry

types,  those  that use the computer, knowledge based,  software

development  type of companies.  I think we need  to  amend  our

company  laws that can promote such cottage industries.   If  we

start  with cottage industries today, I think this will lead  to

entrepreneurs and technopreneurs emerging five to 10 years  down

the road.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Shanmugam is not here. Mr Zulkifli.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, ask any

successful  entrepreneur today what are the problems  they  face

when  starting  their business venture, you  will  hear  a  very

familiar  story.  Among others are: (1) the lack of support  and

market;  (2)  it  is  expensive  to  start  a  new  business  in

Singapore;  (3)  too  many rules and regulations;  (4)  problems

getting  loans from local banks; (5) not many people wanting  to

work on new ventures

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>

or  local  companies;  and (6) Government incentives  which  are

generally  not  targeted towards new ventures like  these.   And

most  people rely on their savings or family support  system  to

help  them,  and  on  their own, with plenty  of  guts  and  big

appetite for risk-taking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, for example, there is a very strong and well-developed venture capital market. They are on the look out for

good  bright ideas.  In fact, it is possible to make  a  lot  of

money just selling ideas in the US.  Here, more often than  not,

it  is  not  worth anything.  In the US, there is  also  a  very

strong culture among major corporations to outsource portions of

their  business  to their employees who then,  in  turn,  become

independent contractors or consultants, service providers to the

company.   This  will  help ease the  burden  of  entry.   These

companies  can then leverage on the infrastructure  provided  by

these  major corporations.  In Singapore, sadly, we do not  have

such a culture or practice here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am very happy to note that there are new initiatives

being  announced  earlier to help, and I  am  referring  to  the

Committee to promote technopreneurs and the changes in  the  law

on  bankruptcy, I would like to propose to the Minister that  we

set  up a one-stop business centre for budding entrepreneurs  to

help them overcome some of these problems that we have mentioned

earlier.   It  can be a place where they can all  meet  together

with  one  another.  Because for entrepreneurs like these,  they

need  a whole host of people, network, in order to work together

to  synergise and compete with major corporations like  GLCs  or

MNCs.   But  now  they  have  to make  multiple  trips  to  many

Government  departments to get their businesses  registered  and

going,  from  EDB  to  TDB, to PSB, and a  host  of  many  other

licensing  agencies, just to get their businesses going.   Apart

from  the  other legal, financial and secretarial services  that

are  essential  to  start and run a business, the  centre  could

serve  as  a  place  where they can get  information  and  other

administrative  service from the Government,  for  example,  all

under one roof.  They can also share cost.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>

example,  a centre like this where they can share administrative

cost  of  rental, which is very expensive, and other secretarial

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, I think it will help lower the start-up costs

and  barriers of entry for these entrepreneurs.  And  I  hope  a

centre like this, if properly done, can also help symbolise  the

strong  support and importance that Singapore gives  to  budding

entrepreneurs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong is not here. Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the strategy of bringing in foreign

direct  investment  with a focus on big multinational  companies

has  worked  very well for Singapore in the past 30 years.   But

looking  ahead,  I  believe the strategy is not  going  to  work

because the value that Singapore provided for such investors  in

the  past can now easily be duplicated or improved upon by other

countries in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned before, in the USA, one new company is started

every  3.5  seconds  and  again  in  the  World  Competitiveness

Yearbook,  ranking on Creation of Firms, USA ranked  number  one

while Singapore ranked 25th; Taiwan was fourth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we set the objectives like bringing in $7-$8 billion of

investments in a year, I can understand that it is very easy for

the  agencies who have to work on such targets to attract a  few

big  projects, which bring in big dollar amounts and huge chunks

of jobs each time.  It is tougher and troublesome to attract the

same  dollar levels by working on, say, 10 to 20 times  more  of

SMEs.   Therefore, agencies, like EDB, prefer to focus on  these

big companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should in the next 10 to 15 years focus on making the SMEs

the  cornerstone for the growth of our economy, with  particular

focus on KBE type of industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many SMEs feel that the existing mindset among the various

Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>

agencies  is that SMEs are always asking for help.  The  mindset

needs  to change so that these agencies and the Government  feel

that they need SMEs' help for the economy to grow.  The attitude

among  some  agencies is also to prefer MNCs to local  companies

even if they bring in the same amount of investment.  In fact, I

have  experienced this personally.  I am trying to start  up  my

company with an investment that is bigger than some of the  MNCs

but we face some problems and issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit squeeze is a big problem because banks continue to adopt

a very conservative stance.  The 65 or so incentive schemes that

exist are a big help, but the ability to complete an application

form for some of the SMEs is still a concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to add that so far the

Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) has done an excellent job

in trying to meet the demands, but without additional resources,

their ability to reach out to more companies is limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the following suggestions for the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Again, for SMEs to set up a focused agency to support them.

The  current `First Stop Centre' (not One-Stop Centre), has  not

been  able to help effectively due to its lack of resources  and

established  roles.  In the one-stop centre, the companies  that

apply  for help are then directed to many agencies, and  in  the

process  of going from one agency to another, they get lost  and

they give up trying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Perhaps we can farm out some of the activities like the

processing  roles  for  some of the  incentive  schemes  to  the

various  industry associations like the Singapore  Confederation

of  Industries  and the ASME (Association of  Small  and  Medium

Enterprises).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Of course, the various industry associations too need to

play  their  part in helping themselves by attracting  more  and

bigger  members  to join them.  Industry players  need  to  also

become  more  committed  to  work  through  these  associations,

because these are useful organisations through which they can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>

achieve many of their objectives.  Currently, the Association of

Small and Medium Enterprises has only 380 members while SCI  has

about 1,000-plus members, whereas I believe that there are about

100,000  or  so  SMEs  in Singapore.  So I think  they  are  not

currently exactly representing all the SMEs in Singapore.  I  am

talking  about the two associations.  But once this can  happen,

when  more industry players can join these organisations and  be

more  committed  to help themselves, perhaps the Government  can

provide  funding for these associations to play  their  extended

roles  in helping to disburse the various schemes.  Furthermore,

the more successful association members could be mentors for the

smaller  players.  Once the industrialists can prove  that  they

can  be  a significant force and behave as such, I am sure  they

will be given more attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The LEFS scheme is great, but the interest rates are still

pegged  at  6.25%,  which  did not  change  despite  the  market

interest  rates coming down.  Can I ask the Government  if  they

can  half  this  rate?   Can Government agencies  also  be  more

involved in approving loans rather than depending just on banks?

Despite  the  boost to the LEFS scheme in June last  year,  many

companies  are still facing difficulties in getting their  loans

approved  because of the conservative nature of the  banks.   We

may  want  to  set up a joint body consisting of  PSB  and  bank

officers  to  act  as  loan approving  bodies.   Also,  can  the

Government increase the share of risk to encourage banks  to  do

more in lending the money?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Can we extend the SDF funds for executive and managerial

training  so that SMEs can take advantage of this down cycle  to

upgrade  their  staff,  and not just  focus  on  the  lower  end

employees?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, to the credit of EDB and PSB, many

schemes  have  been put in place to assist SMEs.   Although  the

intention  is  noble,  the potential may  not  have  been  fully

realised.   Based on feedback gathered by the GPC, the following

reasons were cited:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as Mr Singh has touched on briefly, the application

process  is  frequently too bureaucratic and long  drawn.   Many

SMEs  simply do not have the resources to devote solely  to  the

application  for assistance.  And many fail to apply,  not  from

want  of effort or interest, but from a lack of ability to  cope

with  the  rigours of the process.  This difficulty  is  further

complicated  by  the relatively high turnover of  public  sector

staff   handling  the  applications.   Towards  addressing   the

frustration  of  the SMEs so described, can the Minister  review

the  application process with the aim of making it a simple  and

straightforward experience?  In addition, can such assistance be

granted in a timely fashion?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, LEFS currently works on a fixed interest rate

structure,  as  also  referred to by Mr  Singh,  purportedly  to

provide  some  certainty  to  interest  liabilities  for   SMEs.

However,  the interest rate has been fixed at a level that  does

not  sit  well  with  the  current  low  interest  rates.   This

unfortunately  detracts  from the benefits  of  LEFS.   Can  the

Minister  explain the method for determining this fixed interest

rate  and  explore  the  possibility  of  a  cheaper  source  of

financing?   Can  flexibility be exercised to  adjust  rates  to

reflect more closely prevailing market trends?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the point that I would like to raise has

been  adequately  covered  by  the  speakers  preceding  me,  Mr

Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.  So I just want to join  in

by   urging  the  Government  to  evaluate  the  possibility  of

establishing  a single agency to provide greater leadership  and

sharper focus in our attempt to help the SMEs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, with more than 92,000

local  SMEs  employing 583,000 workers or 52% of the  workforce,

SMEs  undoubtedly  represent an integral part of  the  Singapore

economy.   The  phenomenal changes afflicting the  regional  and

global  economy, coupled with the onset of the financial  crisis

in  mid-1997, are having profound implications in the manner how

our SMEs conduct their business.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the timing should be appropriate now to undertake

a   critical   review   and  revamp  of   the   SME   Masterplan

conceptualised about 10 years ago to accommodate  the  multitude

of  changes in the local and global business environment  within

which  our SMEs operate.  We must ensure that our SMEs are  able

to  grow  and  thrive  in an increasingly  complex  environment.

Short and long term strategies need to be reviewed to ensure the

survival  ability  at  a time when we are  actively  pursuing  a

knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest the incorporation of the following, among others, as

and when a review of the SME Masterplan is undertaken:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Create an enterprise restructuring scheme aimed at

facilitating  and clustering of SMEs in specific  industries  to

make them more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Promote banding together of SMEs to reduce overheads and

operating  cost.  Such business alliances will also  enable  our

SMEs to share knowledge, expertise and experiences and encourage

resource   sharing  among  them  in  the  international   market

development efforts and venturing overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Expand the network of participating financial institutions

(PFIs)  in the LEFS scheme so that risk sharing is spread  to  a

wider network of participants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Facilitate the matching of venture capital with promising

and innovative SMEs to enable them to grow faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Review and redesign tax laws and incentive programmes to

promote  and encourage foreign investments and capital  infusion

into our SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Encourage the spirit of continuous value creation among SMEs

to  stay  competitive  in  the longer term.   This  entails  the

acquisition  and employment of the latest technology,  equipment

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>

information  technology  to enable them to  effectively  improve

products and service quality and manage their supply change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Conduct regular training to enable our SMEs to confidently

connect with the globalised world to accelerate their growth.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Sir, the Finance Minister in his Budget

Statement  said that "our approach to current economic  problems

is  to monitor developments closely and respond with measures to

maintain  the  competitiveness of our economy  relative  to  our

export competitors."  I think this is very important and I  wish

to  know if the Ministry intends to put in place a mechanism  to

monitor  the  impact of the cost cutting measures,  gauge  their

effectiveness,  fine-tune their implementation and  ensure  that

the  desired effect of those measures is filtered throughout all

sectors of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite alarming to learn that NTUC Secretary-General,

Mr  Lim  Boon  Heng, expects 1999 will see 20,000  people  being

retrenched.  If, despite the Government's best efforts to revive

the  economy, jobs continue to be lost due to lack  of  external

demand,  loss  of competitiveness and cash flow  problems,  will

there  be  any  contingency measures put in place this  year  to

minimise unemployment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of SMEs, many of them are now doing their best

to  overcome the economic difficulties in a positive  way.   One

positive finding that emerged from the pre-Budget survey on  the

needs  of  local enterprises which Singapore Chinese Chamber  of

Commerce  and  Industry  conducted  in  February  was  the  keen

interest  of  SMEs  to  make incursions into  new  and  emerging

markets.   They  are  keen to diversify their  market  base  and

source  for new products.  Obviously, the Asian economic  crisis

has  awakened  the need for SMEs in Singapore, formerly  content

with trading or doing businesses with a few traditional markets,

to spread the net wider and broaden their markets.  Indeed, many

SMEs  are  now acutely aware that relying on a few core  markets

exposes themselves to undue risks.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies having business dealings with United States and

Europe,  for  instance,  remain  largely  unaffected  from   the

financial  woes.   There  are  nascent  opportunities  in  other

emerging  markets  around the world which  should  be  explored.

While  such opportunities are being identified through the  many

trade  missions  which the Trade Development  Board  intends  to

launch  this year to such markets, such as Middle East,  Mexico,

Central and Eastern Europe and South Asia, we believe these  may

still be beyond the means of the majority of SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to impress upon the Ministry the need to

design  a  fresh  set  of pragmatic initiatives  or  schemes  to

facilitate  SMEs  in  making  that  critical  step  towards  new

markets.   Extraordinary circumstances created by this  economic

crisis demand creative solutions to buffer the negative effects.

Some  of  the  suggestions that our SMEs hope that the  Ministry

could  consider  implementing  to facilitate  their  entry  into

ventures in the new markets include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Providing more Government subsidies for participation in

international missions, fairs and exhibitions;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Extending more assistance to SMEs through the overseas

TDB  network,  like  making introductions to potential  business

partners  and  helping  them  with  the  cultural  and  language

barriers where necessary;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Providing more financial and tax incentives for their

overseas marketing efforts; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Implementing an export credit guarantee scheme for

SMEs, similar to that extended to SMEs in South Korea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there are currently a number of assistance schemes

which  are open to local enterprises, these schemes will benefit

companies  which  are  already  well-established  and  have  the

necessary    overseas   connections.     For    instance,    the

Regionalisation Finance Scheme provides loans to  companies  for

the acquisition of fixed assets overseas.  This scheme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>

would  not  be  applicable  to the trading  community.   Another

scheme, the Business Development Scheme, apparently applies only

to  missions or projects undertaken on a group basis endorsed by

the PSB.  Although we appreciate the efforts to expand the Trade

Development Incentive scheme to assist companies in  setting  up

overseas   marketing  office  and  other  business   development

programmes,  such as branding, franchising and licensing,  these

schemes   clearly  benefit  only  those  companies  which   have

established their contacts abroad and are ready to venture  into

the next stage of business development.  These preclude the SMEs

which  wish  to  explore  new markets who  neither  possess  the

financial means nor the right contacts to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the blueprint for Singapore to develop

world-class  SMEs  in  the  next  century  will  scrutinise  the

requirements of SMEs and design pragmatic schemes to bring  them

into that league.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, I am delighted that the

Government  aims  to  produce  a pool  of  100  Promising  Local

Enterprises (PLEs) with a turnover of $100 million each  by  the

year  2005.   But, Sir, six to seven years is a short  time  and

therefore  it  requires  strong  effort  and  support  from  the

Government  to make this happen.  The goal is further compounded

by the fact that growth in the foreseeable two to three years is

expected  to be slow.  Successful nurturing, such as a  pool  of

well-managed  and  world-class companies  with  capabilities  to

compete  globally,  will  contribute  towards  more  sustainable

economic growth while decreasing our dependence on multinational

companies in the longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that there is no clear information or

guideline  on  the criteria employed to designate  and  identify

PLEs  and  I  therefore assume that this is  probably  based  on

attainment  of  a certain level of revenue and profitability  by

the  SMEs.  While this is a good starting point, I think  it  is

important also that the criteria be broadened to include smaller

companies which demonstrate creative

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>

and  innovative elements with a strong drive to succeed in their

business  and not just be solely driven by financial performance

yardsticks.    Such  companies  are  likely   to   be   run   by

technopreneurs  with  products  featuring  new  technology   and

innovations.  Not all will make it big, but if we are in earnest

about   promoting  technopreneurship  and  creating  a   climate

conducive to the sprouting of knowledge-based industries, as DPM

Tony  Tan  has  said, then the Government should  exercise  more

flexibility in assisting and incentivising such risky ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the criteria I would like to suggest for

technopreneur  PLEs  are  the consideration  for  (1)  companies

staffed  with  resilient people with creative ideas  in  product

design  and a strong determination to succeed and make  it  big;

(2)  companies with specialised and unique core competencies and

capabilities in process development, manufacturing technology or

research  and  development; and (3) companies with  dynamic  and

forward-looking  management  with  very  strong   time-to-market

orientation to react to and serve international market demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I move on to the next cut, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> In spite of strenuous efforts by the

Government  to liberalise and make the Local Enterprise  Finance

Scheme  (LEFS)  more accessible, many local SMEs feel  that  the

eligibility  criteria  of the scheme are  still  too  stringent.

They felt that they are completely at the mercy of participating

financial  institutions (PFIs) when it comes  to  evaluation  of

their  participation eligibility under the  LEFS  scheme.   Many

felt  that  the financial crisis has made PFIs more cautious  in

lending  to local enterprises in spite of the extension of  risk

sharing to cover higher loan quantum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree that the LEFS scheme should not support

fully hopeless cases.  But I am concerned about borderline but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>

worthy cases with long term growth prospects which may be turned

away for assistance and therefore become victims of the economic

crisis.   Their demise will also result in more job  losses.   I

would like to suggest that an appeal channel be created for such

cases,  at  least  temporary,  during  the  current  period   of

recession  and  financial  crisis.   The  Appeal  Board   should

comprise  members from the participating financial  institutions

and  the  Singapore Productivity and Standards Board to evaluate

borderline   and   deserving  cases  for  financial   assistance

eligibility  under LEFS.  The Appeal Board could  possibly  also

play  an  extended and advisory role by facilitating cooperation

or  even  mergers between SMEs or similar industries for  shared

resources,  for  synergy and for economies  of  scale,  wherever

feasible.

<br>4.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I have listened with great interest

the  opening remarks by Mr Lim Swee Say.  He defined what  is  a

knowledge-based company.  He outlined some of the criteria  and,

in  fact,  six total capabilities of a knowledge-based  company.

But  at  the  end  of it, I am still not very  sure  what  is  a

knowledge-based company.  In fact, my colleague, Mr Ahmad Magad,

had  already very eloquently touched upon this topic  by  saying

that there is a lot of confusion surrounding what is a knowledge-based  enterprise.   In  fact, most  people  associate  it  with

anything  to do with computers and, therefore, any products  and

services  associated with computers are considered a  knowledge-based enterprise.  But how about products and services based  on

other  fields  of human endeavours?  As Mr Ahmad Magad  said,  a

knowledge-based  economy  is  primarily  about  unleashing   and

potentially utilising knowledge locked up in people's mind.   Mr

Lim  Swee Say also defined six criteria.  So I would like to ask

him whether a drug like Viagra will fulfil this definition of  a

product of a knowledge-based company.  However we define it,  if

Singapore could produce a product like that, it would provide  a

very  comfortable  lifestyle for all those associated  with  the

discovery and marketing of this particular product.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is just one example to show that there are in fact

immense  potentials for breakthroughs in other fields  of  human

endeavours  like life sciences and genetics.  There are  already

glimpses  of  promise of drugs and remedies for killer  diseases

like  cancer,  as  well as medical problems  linked  to  genetic

defects.   So  when  we  talk about knowledge-based  enterprise,

knowledge-based   company  and  knowledge-based   industry,   it

actually  covers a very wide field.  My question to the Minister

is  whether as a nation, we are spending our scarce resource  in

funding  R&D  in the right area and whether we are enabling  our

companies to cross the technology gate, using Mr Lim Swee  Say's

term, to grow into future knowledge-based companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, one of our key long-term

focuses is developing a knowledge-based economy with an emphasis

on  technology-related sectors.  This requires us to compete  in

the  global  arena which are seen and will, in  the  foreseeable

future,  see  the  most  intense and rapid  changes.   It  means

competing against other economies in various parts of the world,

all  intent  on establishing a foothold in the global technology

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heartbeat of technological innovation is of course research

and  development (R&D).  And all around the world, R&D is moving

at  a break-neck pace.  At this stage in the development of  our

IT  industry,  I  feel  that more should  be  done  to  get  our

researchers  together to discuss the work  they  are  doing,  to

share  information  and  to create that buzz  which  our  Senior

Minister mentioned.  Of course, confidential information  cannot

be  divulged.   But I feel that our technopreneurs  may  be  too

conservative and afraid that someone would steal their ideas  if

these are disclosed.  From time to time, I have been referred to

the  web  pages of some US start-up companies and was amazed  by

the  amount  of information they contain on the technology  they

are  developing.  These companies must find value in doing this,

either   in  looking  for  synergetic  cooperation  with   other

companies,  getting other researchers to join  them  to  further

develop the technology, raising the profile of the company,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>

attracting  venture capital funds, or simply educating  the  R&D

community about the work they are doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, I think such a buzz may be created and promoted in

several  different  ways.  First, in having an  IT  or  Internet

resource which local innovators, R&D personnel, IT entrepreneurs

can  tap  into  to  source for information particular  to  their

industry,   for  example,  a  directory  of  IT  resources   and

businesses   and  on-line  yellow  pages  of   sorts,   with   a

sufficiently  large database to provide a useful  and  efficient

means to find out who are doing what.  It will also serve  as  a

one-stop  website  where  foreigners  can  visit  to  look   for

Singapore  products and research capabilities.  We already  have

the  Singapore InfoNet, the national website, which tells  local

and  foreigners alike about the broad range of things  happening

in  Singapore.  How about setting up one specifically  targetted

for  the  IT  industry?  Thereon, there will be no  reasons  for

researchers when they meet somebody else to say, "I did not know

that  you  were developing this or we could have done  something

together."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on-line interaction provides a means of exchange

within  the  IT  R&D  circle.   Even  if  the  researchers   are

physically cooped up in their cubicles 20 hours a day, they  can

still  reach  out  to the rest of the world  on-line.   However,

there seems to be very few R&D discussion groups formed by local

researchers  and  IT  business  people.   Although   there   are

international   discussion  groups,  I  think   if   our   local

researchers  can  get  together for more  interaction  with  one

another  on particular issues and developments relating  to  the

local  R&D  scene, many more opportunities can be created  among

local  companies  to collaborate and combine  complementary  R&D

activities  and  different strengths to create better  products.

Perhaps,  the  National Computer Board can  host  a  website  to

encourage this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the buzz can also be carried on off-line through

newsletters  and publications which provide regular  updates  on

the latest developments in the local IT industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there is no substitute for physical interaction

and  our  technopreneurs should not underestimate the importance

of  networking through social interaction among themselves.   As

many  business  people  in  all industries  will  testify,  many

valuable  information is exchanged through  the  grapevine.   In

Silicon  Valley, it was reported that the sharing of information

is so spontaneous that two strangers, waiting in line to pay for

their  food  in  a  cafeteria, can start chatting  and  form  an

alliance  or  joint venture even before getting to the  cashier.

In  this area, organisations like the Singapore Science Park can

play  an  important role by providing facilities and  events  to

promote  more social interaction for not only their tenants  but

non-tenants   as  well.   This  will  also  make   our   foreign

researchers feel more at home while working here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I look forward to the day when we have a lively and

buzzing R&D community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, may I move on to the next issue about

the hosting of major exhibitions and conferences in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> I am very glad to see that much thinking and

effort  have  been put in to develop the exhibition industry  in

Singapore.   It  is  one  of the areas in  which  we  have  good

potential  to  grow  into a regional and global  hub.   The  tax

incentives  to be given to exhibition organisers who host  their

exhibitions in Singapore as well as the many initiatives by  the

Trade  Development Board should give the exhibition  industry  a

boost.   We  have the attraction of being relatively inexpensive

compared to other international exhibition centres in Asia  like

Tokyo  and  Hong  Kong, and we should continue to  maintain  our

comparative  cost advantage so that most organisers will  choose

to come to Singapore to put up exhibitions on a bigger scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we should bear in mind that being cost-competitive alone is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>

not  enough  to elevate Singapore to a regional or  global  hub.

Top  international convention centres built up their  reputation

over  a  period of time by hosting high profile exhibitions  and

events.   During such events, plans for the whole year  are  set

and  who's who in the industry congregate.  It is a must on  the

calendar  and  for leading firms and people in  that  particular

industry,  it  is  a  once-a-year  opportunity  to  widen  one's

network,  in  a  way  not possible at other  events  and  times.

Therefore,  in addition to getting the quantity in  numbers,  we

must also strive to secure one or two mega exhibitions or events

to   be  held  here  annually.   Indeed,  even  aspire  to  host

exhibitions to the scale and prestige of the annual events  like

Comdex Fall in Las Vegas and even the World Economic Forum  like

the one in Davos.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for this mega world-class events, we have to plan

our  infrastructure carefully.  Our main exhibition  venues  are

now  at  the  Singapore Expo Centre in Changi, Suntec Convention

Centre  and the World Trade Centre.  But for a truly mega event,

any  one of these venues, by itself, might not be sufficient and

if  the  event has to be divided into different venues, it  will

cause much inconvenience and unhappiness for both exhibitors and

visitors.  For example, I visited last year's Comdex Fall at Las

Vegas.   The  Singapore Pavilion was situated in the  Sans  Expo

Centre,  while  Microsoft, Creative and other major  attractions

were  at  the main Las Vegas Convention Centre.  People  had  to

travel  between the two venues by shuttle bus.  Compare this  to

Milan  which is able to host its annual furniture and  lightings

fair,  spread over 26 halls, all in one cluster.  Some of  these

halls are bigger than our Suntec Convention Centre.  I hope that

the  Minister would consider this in the further development  of

our exhibition facilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, this is a topic that I have not

raised in this House before but after two years of feedback  and

pleas from the representatives of this sector through our GPC, I

would like to channel their feedback to the Minister and I  feel

that they do deserve some attention.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism is an important component of our economy and we

should  continue to promote it.  The retail sector cannot depend

on  local  consumption alone.  Tourism can play a  big  part  in

helping this sector.  In 1997, tourist shopping was around  $2.4

billion,  down  by 18% from 1996 level.  The key challenges  are

threefold:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) how do we bring in new tourists to Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) how to make arrived tourists stay a little longer or to

keep a business visitor here for one more day for leisure; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) how can we bring in repeat tourists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost alone is not a major factor as long as we can become a

value-added destination for tourists.  So, we should not give up

bringing  in  tourists  just  because  the  cost  of  living  in

Singapore  is high.  We should look at Hawaii, Paris  and  other

popular  tourist destinations that still have a vibrant  tourism

sector  despite  being  expensive cities.   The  issues  and  my

suggestions are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have stale and outdated theme parks like the Haw Par Villa,

Tang Dynasty Village, the Malay Village and the various gardens.

These, I think, are all too stale and will not be able to  bring

in  repeat customers.  I guess the only theme park that is  able

to  do  this  is the Singapore Zoo.  I would say that  going  to

Sentosa  once after a very long time is also sufficient.   I  do

not  see  any compelling reason to go back to Sentosa after  one

visit.   In fact, I visited Sentosa after about 7 years,  and  I

found  there  was nothing really attractive to  look  at  there.

What  we  really  need  is  to  spend  money,  some  development

expenditure on developing world class theme parks like Universal

Studios or Disneyland Park.  I guess Hong Kong has beaten us  to

the  Disney  project, but we should not give up.  Alternatively,

we  could  provide attractive incentives for such  companies  to

locate in Singapore, to also tap on the regional market as  well

as  to  keep the business travellers in Singapore - and I  think

the number of business travellers is quite high - for at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>

least another day after their business has been done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest we focus on technology based theme parks that

offer attractions like virtual reality where a visitor can spend

the whole day in such a theme park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, both India and China are two very big markets for our

tourist  industry.   They still want to shop  in  Singapore  and

visit  our  places  of attraction.  In India alone  there  is  a

middle  class population of about 200 million people capable  of

spending money.  I am sure China has an equal, if not, a  bigger

number  of  middle  class population.  Can I  request  that  the

Ministry  work with the Ministry of Home Affairs to ease  travel

restrictions  for  people  of  these  countries  by  lifting  or

simplifying visa requirements for entry?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, double tax deductions for training expenses.

Because   retail  and  tourism  industries  are  mainly  service

orientated and depend on capability of human resources, can  the

Government allow double tax deduction for training expenses  for

approved training?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we should provide more funding to Singapore Tourism

Board so that they can more aggressively market Singapore  as  a

popular tourist destination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, staging world class sporting activities. This is an

area where we have not attempted to think big.  If we treat such

activities  as both sporting as well as a business  opportunity,

we  may be able to organise such activities on a different scale

in order to attract tourists to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, until we can develop world class theme parks, can

tax incentives be given for current operators like Tang Village,

the  Chinese and Japanese Gardens and others to upgrade  and  to

improve their facilities so that they become more attractive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, can we allow the use of satellite technology

as an alternative to cable television?  In this way, we will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>

able  to provide competition for Singapore Cable Vision as  many

Members  in  this House have asked for and, at  the  same  time,

reduce the cost to individuals, hotels and organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will seriously look into these

suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am interested in bringing to the

Government's attention the question of culture tourism.  We have

the  museums  here and I think more and more efforts  should  be

done  to attract tourists to visit these museums.  Secondly,  we

are  a  multi-racial society.  We have a lot of advantages  over

the  other countries, whether it is a Chinese opera or an Indian

dance.   We  should try to market these values to the  tourists.

There is a growing number of tourists who are interested in  not

just  seeing  the  sights in Singapore  but  also  the  cultural

aspects  of  it, and we are unique in that we have the  Chinese,

Malay  and  Indian  cultural heritage here.  I  would  urge  the

Minister  to  consider ways and means of  selling  this  to  the

tourists.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, although I work for an

international logistics company, I wish to give my  feedback  to

the  Minister  on some of the problems faced by local  logistics

companies.   Recently, I see the Singapore Government's  growing

emphasis to develop Singapore as a logistics hub.  And this  has

gained recognition amongst MNCs of the need to use Singapore  as

an   important hub for Asia Pacific countries.  It  is  of  such

strategic importance to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the MNCs, amidst the gloom of the Asian crisis, many of

them  are  in fact growing their business by large amounts,  and

not  necessarily for good reason.   The reason is that they  are

taking market share from local companies.  Local companies today

find  it hard to participate in international tenders.  They  do

not  have  the infrastructure, network, the world-wide  tracking

systems  in  order to do that.  The new types of  businesses  by

computer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>

companies  requiring  them to outsource  and  integrate  various

parts  of their business, from vendors to suppliers to consumers

within  Singapore's hub, make it extremely difficult  for  local

companies  to  participate, unless they  synergise  and  set  up

ventures with other companies.  And this is where I find that we

need to do a lot more to help local companies develop.  Because,

otherwise, the hub will serve the major MNCs and not necessarily

local  companies.  Major MNCs can come and go.  We hope to  have

local  companies who can stay rooted in Singapore,  and  thereby

actually helping Singapore in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect to this problem, Sir, and that is the

problem of technology.  There is this  view that because we  are

in  Singapore, because we are close to our Asian neighbours,  we

are  relevant to our Asian neighbours.  We can closely  navigate

the  intricate channels of moving across barriers to  all  these

countries,  very difficult barriers.  And the fact that  we  are

Asians,  we  are  seen to be better able to  handle  this.   But

technology  has made this very different, because we  no  longer

communicate   through  the  phone  and   all   that.    Personal

relationship  has been replaced by more strategic  relationship.

Communication  is  through  network.   English  becomes  a  more

universal language in this communication.  So what advantage  do

we  have  with a Thai, a Filipino, a Chinese or an Indian,  when

now the communication is through English.  American global MNCs,

for  example,  are better able to position themselves  and  take

advantage  of  the situation.  This is where our  advantage  and

connection with the Asian countries may now become more  than  a

myth and a reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do nothing about it, I am afraid our position as an

international  hub  may  be  terribly  affected.   And  this  is

especially so because a lot of the factors in developing our hub

can  be easily copied by other countries.  As you know, they are

developing their own ports, airports and infrastructure.  And if

you  look  around,  some of the incentive programmes  have  been

offered  by neighbouring countries.  Many Members in this  House

will know that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>

some  of the terms, rules and regulations and incentives offered

are  very familiar.  It is easy to copy incentives.  We can give

whatever  we can give.  And the only hope is that we have  local

companies who can stay in Singapore and develop Singapore  as  a

hub.   This  is  where I hope the Minister will  look  at  other

incentives,  beyond  what  have been announced  in  the  Budget,

specifically to help local companies to take advantage of  these

incentives.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, recently, in its presentation of Industry 21, EDB reiterated the goal that manufacturing and manufacturing-related services should contribute 25% to GDP. This objective

has  been  in  place for some years already.  I agree  with  the

rationale  that  in a sovereign state, it is desirable  to  have

both manufacturing and services, and that both should constitute

the  engines  of growth.  For the last three years,  the  actual

share  of manufacturing has in fact been slightly lower at about

23%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to make is that the achievement of such a

goal needs proactive policy support and policy alignment of  all

agencies concerned.  First, there needs to be an inflow of  high

value  added  manufacturing to replace  the  lower  value  added

manufacturing,  which  is being relocated  to  other  more  cost

effective  destinations.  Hence Industry 21  and  its  focus  on

knowledge-driven industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, industrial land has to be priced appropriately. Even

with  the  recent reductions in JTC and HDB rentals,  industrial

land  is  costly  in Singapore.  Hence, I agree with  the  CSC's

recommendation that the pricing of industrial land needs to take

into  account  cost  competitiveness.  Land Office,  I  believe,

therefore needs to re-examine its pricing of industrial land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, more can be done to maximise the usage of industrial

land.   JTC's Industrial Land Plan 21 is a good start, but  more

needs  to  be  done.   Again, the CSC Report has  some  concrete

recommendations.   One such measure is to increase  the  maximum

allowable  plot ratio in industrial estates beyond  the  present

2.5.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, JTC can, in formulating usage requirements, take into

account  the increasing integration of manufacturing  production

and   manufacturing  related  services,  such  as   design   and

logistics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the goal that manufacturing should contribute 25%

to  GDP needs active policy support from all relevant Government

agencies and an inter-agency approach, including EDB, JTC,  Land

Office and URA.  I would appreciate the Minister's clarification

regarding whether this is indeed the case.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to raise my

concerns  over  the  safety of consumer products  in  our  local

market.   Most  of us assume the constant presence  of  watchdog

bodies  that ensure products sold in Singapore would be free  of

toxic  or  harmful  effects.  I would like to suggest  that  our

assumptions should be upheld and a regulatory body, either under

an  inter-Ministry  body  or MTI control,  should  be  there  to

monitor  all  products and ascertain that they  do  not  contain

hazardous substances.  This must be put in place to protect  the

consumers' interest.  Sir, this is especially important when, in

fact,  the  consumers are our children.  Indeed,  products  that

contain harmful substances, harmful to children, have been found

in the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong last year, according to the environmental group

"Greenpeace",  cancer-causing toxins have  been  found  in  soft

polyvinyl  chloride (PVC) children's toys.   The  warning  about

this  came  after the group commissioned independent  tests  and

found  phthalates in 28 toys bought from seven  stores  in  Hong

Kong.  Toys were not allowed to have more than 3% of phthalates.

These  toys  included a teether, a plastic key, some dolls,  and

some  bath  toys.   Young children chewing  or  sucking  on  the

products  could  ingest the chemicals that  were  used  to  make

plastic  soft and flexible.  Links have been established between

phthalates  and liver as well as kidney cancer.   The  chemicals

can also damage reproductive organs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must beseech the Ministry of Trade and Industry to take

necessary preventive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>

measures  to ensure that any consumer product, whether  imported

or  locally  produced, does not pose hazards to  public  health.

Sir,  whilst  we  do  not  want  to  over  regulate  and  affect

Singapore's pro-business environment, the Ministry of Trade  and

Industry must not neglect this responsibility for anything.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, first, I would like to follow up on Dr

Lily  Neo's point about toy safety standards.  In the early 70s,

the  Consumers Association of Singapore actually created a  toys

safety  standards  authority, which looked into  issues  of  toy

safety and toxins in toys and so on.  We had to close that  work

because  there  were no funds forthcoming.   And  it  is  indeed

something that we hope can change if the Ministry, for  example,

could grant us more money on this project.  We do have a toy and

product testing service currently and, again, that is very  much

hampered  by the lack of funds.  Nonetheless, we would  move  on

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would want to mention another issue which relates to

consumer  protection.  In a Question I filed in  the  House  for

Oral Answer in November 1997, I asked the Minister whether there

are  plans to curb the price fixing practices of monopolies  and

cartels.   As there was no time for an oral reply, the Minister,

in his written reply, said that the Singapore economy is an open

one  and price fixing behaviour by cartels is best prevented  by

open  competition  in the market place.  Where  essentials  like

rice  and  pork are concerned, the Minister said that the  Price

Control Act empowers his Ministry to set prices, but added  that

keen   competition  has  made  this  unnecessary   because   the

Government can stay out of the market if the prices are  set  by

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take this opportunity to raise this issue again as the

problem  of  anti-competitive practices has  not  been  resolved

satisfactorily.   Anti-competitive practices were  in  fact  the

subject  of  a recent furore over telecommunication charges.   I

think  last year, in a well-publicised court, there was  another

form

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>

of  anti-competitive  practice called  the  "recommended  retail

price"  (RRP)  practice.   What  happened  was  that  a  certain

manufacturer  sets the price of the product  they  made  and  by

binding  retailers to this RRP.  Essentially, in this  practice,

retailers who dare to sell below the recommended price, even  if

they  are  able  to  because they have lower  costs  than  other

retailers,  such retailers would be penalised.  The penalty  may

be  damages for a breach of contract or the supplier flexes  his

economic muscle by killing off the retailer's business, such  as

by stopping all supplies to this brave retailer.  Since economic

death  is worse than damages, most of these rebellious retailers

are not taken to court.  They simply capitulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the famous case, the retailer was too big to kill, so the

matter  ended up in court.  Unfortunately, for the  supplier  in

question, the court found no binding contract in existence,  and

so  the  supplier lost.  In the midst of all the media hype,  it

escaped public notice that the supplier would actually have  won

if  the retailer had signed a contract.  This practice of fixing

prices, called Resale Price Maintenance (RPM), is illegal in the

UK  and several other common law jurisdictions, but is well  and

alive and totally legal in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after this famous case, the local supermarket scene

descended  into  a  "price  war",  with  different  supermarkets

competing  to  sell the same goods at as low  a  price  as  they

could.  Ultimately, it was the consumer who benefited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge that there are several cartels in

Singapore  which practise RPM.  Some of them in fact argue  that

because  of free competition, the prices are exactly  the  same.

These are the petrol companies.  How peculiar!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not against manufacturers and wholesalers recommending

a  retail  price.  In many cases, this RRP makes it  easier  for

customers  to  know when his local retailer is profiteering  and

selling way above the market price.  But RRP enforced by pain of

severe penalties does not benefit the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>

consumer.   There are many business cartels in  Singapore.   The

Price Control Act, even if the Minister is willing to apply  it,

does not apply to these trades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would plead with the Minister to make RPM an illegal

practice, because consumers are suffering under prices fixed  in

this rigid way and it should not be allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to my next cut? Twice in the last two years,

in  response to queries which I raised, the Ministry of  Finance

has  assured  the  House  that they are  looking  into  laws  to

regulate  the  unscrupulous practices of soft commodity  trading

firms  and  timeshare companies.  This is why I  actually  filed

this  cut under the Ministry of Finance earlier, but it  appears

that  you,  Sir, prefer that I say my piece to the Minister  for

Trade and Industry.  Perhaps it was due to the impression that I

will be talking about shops selling buckets.  The regulation  of

bucket  shops or soft commodity trading firms is something  that

is necessary.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These firms are called "bucket shops" primarily because of the

suspicion  that  they take money from the public without  making

trades, and actually keeping the money in their tills and  churn

it  round, paying different parties that they pick at random out

of their till or "bucket".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these bucket shops attract new investments by

advertising  for  housewives,  elderly  retirees,  students  and

foreign  workers to apply for high paying part time  jobs  which

require  no  experience  and  training.  All  these  groups  are

vulnerable  in  different  ways.  They are  inexperienced,  less

educated and perhaps more gullible. They are relatively hard  up

financially  and easily enticed by high salaries  and  they  are

unable  to afford lawyers to advise them or to sue if things  go

wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides false job advertisements, such bucket shops also

resort to lies, misleading information, hard sell and intense

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>

psychological pressure to get the job-seekers - who have entered

the  hyena  dens  - to throw in their life savings  in  tens  of

thousands  of  dollars.   They say  this  is  to  gain  "trading

experience"  for the new jobs.  One of the key  lines  given  by

these  shops  to  wary  investors, in fact,  is  something  that

capitalises on the known fact that the MAS is a strict regulator

of  the financial and investment industry. They claim that  they

are not rogues, because if they were, the MAS would have stopped

their activities.  A very simple argument.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Consumers' Association, CASE, and the Commercial

Affairs  Department are at their wits' end to stop  such  unfair

traders.  CASE has also been pushing for a Fair Trading Act,  or

at  least  some kind of law governing representations and  sales

promotion  tactics,  to  stop these  scoundrels  from  operating

untouched by any law.  Such traders give us a bad name and  make

a  mockery  of our systems of law and justice.  An  Act  can  be

drafted  generally enough not to cover specific  commodities  or

investment  schemes.   It can also give  due  force  of  law  to

industry  self-regulating  Codes  like  the  Singapore  Code  of

Advertising Practice.  In this way, they will be wide enough  to

cover the types of scams like those mentioned by Mr Sin Boon Ann

yesterday  in this House (the ostrich and ostrich egg  schemes),

timeshare schemes and soft commodity futures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has said it will introduce laws soon. Sir,

will it be in this millennium?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I share the sentiments

of  Dr  Toh See Kiat when he talked about the control of  bucket

shops.   Like him, I filed this amendment under the Ministry  of

Finance.  I begin to understand that now commodities trading  is

actually governed by the Trade Development Board, which  is  why

my amendment is now being referred to this Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, commodities trading, whether it is of precious metals

like  gold or silver or soft commodities like pork belly or soya

beans,  are all part and parcel of the futures trading activity.

In Singapore, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>

trading  of  rubber  and coffee is regulated  by  the  Commodity

Futures Act, but not other commodities like pork belly and  soya

beans. As a result, gazetting is not required and no licence  is

required to run a soft commodities trading firm.  To me, this is

extremely strange.  As a financial centre, we would expect  that

these activities should be regulated under the Commodity Futures

Act  in  total or part of the Commodity Futures Act.  It is  not

comprehensible  why these firms are allowed to  operate  outside

the ambit of all the laws that we have in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the key features of bucket shops, besides what

Dr  Toh  has mentioned, is that sometimes they do false  trades.

In  other  words, whatever trade is done on behalf of a  client,

the  commodities firm actually first buys and sells it  back  to

the  client to make the money.  This is how they generate a  lot

of  trade  and that is why the client always ends up to  be  the

losing party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a financial centre, it is indeed strange that we today

read  of  bucket  operations still taking  place  in  Singapore.

People are still trading in soya beans and pork bellies and such

things.   These are losses incurred by innocent bystanders.   In

most  cases, we may call them gullible or naive.  But  the  fact

that  we  allow these firms to operate in our strict environment

gives  these  firms  a sense of respectability.   As  a  result,

gullible innocent Singaporeans get trapped into it and they  are

still  thriving.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to explain  why

it is not in our own interest to bring all these firms under the

Commodity  Futures Act.  Alternatively, if we cannot bring  them

under  the Commodity Futures Act, maybe we should prohibit  such

activities in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

whether  the  National  Computer Board or the  Productivity  and

Standards Board could spearhead the establishment of some  basic

standards  in  e-commerce practices.  There  are  some  critical

aspects  of an e-commerce transaction which are often  difficult

or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>

impossible for the web buyer to know, just by assessing what the

vendor  has presented on the web.  Examples of these are whether

an  order  has  been properly transmitted and received,  whether

corrections  can be made to the information that has  been  sent

out,  and  whether  electronic payment has  been  cleared.   If,

however,  there is some form of certification analogous  to  the

ISO  certifications on standards and quality issued by a neutral

body,  this  would help web surfing consumers to  find  reliable

vendors   on-line  and  to  help  reliable  businesses  identify

themselves as such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even hawker and food stalls have a grading system

established  by the Ministry of the Environment to assess  their

hygiene standards.  The grading system does not purport to judge

the  quality of the food sold, but rather the hygiene  standards

of  individual stalls.  It is easily recognisable  and  provides

real  impetus  for hawkers to improve the hygiene  standards  of

their stalls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that businesses on the web, which

meet  the basic minimum requirements, be awarded a certification

seal  which they can display on their web page.  The  seal  will

give  an  indication to the web shoppers of the type and quality

of  service  to  expect.  This certification  body  can  conduct

periodical review of the technical practices of these businesses

and  can use exposure through on-line and off-line publications,

seal   withdrawal  or  Government  referrals  to   impose   real

consequences on non-compliance with the standards established.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the Y2K problem has

caused more than 2,500 websites to spring up, giving tips on how

to  cope  with  the millennium bug.  In fact, extremes  who  are

concerned  over  the potential chaos resulting from  programming

defect lurking in millions of computers has swelled from a  weak

irritation that the video recorder might not work, to panic over

a doomsday scenario of riots, financial crashes and nuclear war.

They  believe  that a computer failure will start an  accidental

release  of  radiation or a nuclear warhead  will  be  fired  by

mistake.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>

Fears  over the reliability of international air travel,  weapon

systems  failure or merely food suppliers are reflected  on  the

Internet.   It  was reported that China is one of the  potential

areas  where the Y2K problem is not adequately solved.   It  was

also  subsequently  reported  that the  Chinese  Government  has

ordered  senior officials to take a flight on the  airplanes  on

31st December to prove that they have tackled the problem and it

is safe to fly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a US senate panel in a recent report cited that Japan,

Mexico and Germany were nine months to two years behind schedule

in  their Y2K fix.  An assessment by the Garner Group, a private

consulting firm that helped prepare that same report,  predicted

a  33%  chance  of a major computer crash in countries  such  as

Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, France and Germany.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question I want to ask is how much of our Y2K

problems  have  been solved.  Are all the Government  ministries

and  statutory  boards  already Y2K  compliant?   Have  all  the

financial  institutions  and  highly computerised  organisations

carried  out  exhaustive tests to validate their Y2K compliance?

What  percentage  of computer installations  in  Singapore  will

still be non-Y2K compliant by the deadline?  In short, Sir,  how

ready are we for the Y2K problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Sir, it is an accepted fact that

technology is now ruling our lives than ever before.  In today's

homes,  office buildings, public places, we have installed  more

and  more  gadgets that use energy.  Some of these  gadgets  are

installed  some  years  ago  and  they  are  no  longer   energy

efficient.  For example, the typical magnetic ballast  used  for

fluorescent  lights  consumes 30% more energy  than  the  latest

electronic  ballast.  The air-conditioning system in  a  10-year

old  building  can be retrofitted with new ones  that  save  50%

energy.   Because  of  this development in  technology,  the  US

Federal  Government  in  1992 passed a law  to  require  Federal

facilities to achieve a minimum of 30% energy saving.  They have

achieved  that  and  many  places  have  actually  reported  60%

savings.  The Berlin

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>

government  subsequently also required 5,000 of their government

buildings to be retrofitted with energy saving devices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not see any concerted effort on the part of

the  Government to promote energy conservation.  In the  private

sector,  some  developers took their own initiative  to  install

these  devices  and, therefore, they reaped  benefits  from  it.

They did not even have to come up with the capital.  Very often,

the  ones  that provide the technology would pay for  it  first.

They usually get their return on investment from a share in  the

energy  saved.  One wonders who has the technology and  who  can

provide such retrofitting services without asking for payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have learnt is this. The companies that can provide the

technology and services are just in our backyards.  Some of them

are  already  being  engaged  by very  big  utilities  companies

overseas  but  somehow they are not recognised here.  Hence,  if

such  a  situation  exists, should our Government  or  the  Town

Councils  or  the  rest  of the people  not  take  this  up?   I

therefore urge the Minister to study this and, if possible, have

an  energy  saving campaign for the whole nation.  In the  short

run,  it can save us some money to reduce the deficit.   In  the

long run, it will increase our competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I move this amendment, not so much on

energy  conservation  but  rather  on  energy  efficiency.   The

difference  is that efficiency is doing more with less,  whereas

conservation suggests that we do nothing or do without. There is

a  great difference between the two terms: energy efficiency  is

an achievement in competitiveness.  It is this change of mindset

that  I  wish  to encourage the Minister to consider  fostering.

Not  with specific technology.  It is not a question of hardware

or  gadgets at this stage, it is a question of mindset change in

the  Government,  first and foremost, and then  in  the  private

sector.   In the Government, when it comes to its own  projects,

its  own  buildings,  and  then  in  the  Government's  role  as

regulator and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>

standard  setter for the private sector.  There are  reasons  of

competitiveness, as I have said, to do this.  There  is  also  a

coming  reason  in terms of international law  and  the  climate

change  convention, which will eventually set the limits to  how

much  each  country  can emit in terms of carbon  emissions  and

other things that relate to energy production.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the primary concerns, besides the change of mindset,

is  the coming privatisation of Singapore Power.  In privatising

Singapore's power companies in future, I would ask the  Minister

to  adopt policies that would encourage these power companies to

promote  efficiency  rather than the sale of  more  power,  more

energy, at more costs and more profits.  In this sense,  Sir,  I

am asking the Minister to consider incentives for efficiency.  I

understand  there  is  a coming inter-agency  report  on  energy

efficiency  and  I  think  in this light  it  would  be  a  very

important document to set about the change of mindset.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the desalination

technology development is, as what the Prime Minister  mentioned

in  his speech to the grassroots leaders during the Chinese  New

Year  reception,  that it is a progress towards  our  advantage.

True  enough,  the  cost of desalination  of  water  has  fallen

tremendously  in the recent year.  According to a recent  tender

called for building an operation by the State of Florida in  the

US,  the  water  from the sea water reverse osmosis  system  was

offered  at a price as low as US67 cents per cubic metre,  which

is about S$1.17 cents per cubic metre for the next 30 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could see that from this tender in the US, the cost of

water  production  by the sea water reverse osmosis  is  reduced

significantly.   It is reduced from what people  believe  to  be

about US$1.15 cents per cubic metre to as low as US67 cents  per

cubic  metre.  From a study reported by Desalination, the  water

reuse magazine,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>

in  March  1998, the estimated cost of water from a  multi-stage

fresh  desalination system, like the one that we  are  going  to

build,  will be about 39% higher than the unit water  cost  from

the reverse osmosis system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one may like to ask why the reverse osmosis water is

so  cheap and yet, we are not so keen in that particular system.

I think the main concern may be the quality of water because the

salinity  of  the  water product would be about  200  parts  per

million.   Since we are self-sufficient for almost half  of  the

water  that we need, the blending of the water from the  reverse

osmosis with the fresh water supply would reduce the salinity of

the  water  to  an extent which is not so objectionable  to  our

people.   Based on the construction cost of less than  US$5  per

gallon  per day, the 30 million gallons per day system we  would

like to build would cost around S$260 million.  There will be  a

significant cost saving also if we consider this kind of system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, based on the significant price reduction in both the

water  cost  per cubic metre and the construction  cost  of  the

internationally called project, we should not rule out  the  sea

water  reverse  osmosis  as  a  cost-effective  alternative   to

desalination  for  Singapore.  We should  consider  the  reverse

osmosis system seriously.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, Singapore ranks sixth in the world

as  the most water-short country.  The rate of increase in water

consumption  has  been  about 5% a year  for  the  past  decade.

Today,  we  need 1.2 million cubic metre of water  daily,  about

half  of  which comes from water catchment areas, and  the  rest

comes  from  Johor.  We all know that the water agreements  with

Johor will expire in the years 2011 and 2061 respectively.   And

the  Government has planned to build three desalination  plants,

the  first  costing $1 billion will be built at  Tuas  and  will

produce 137,000 cubic metres a day when ready.  Assoc. Prof. Low

has already touched upon the various methods of desalination.  I

would  not  go into that.  When all three plants are  completed,

the combined supply will be about 400,000 cubic metres a day.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that Singapore should treasure its supply of

fresh  water.   The  image  of DPM Lee  at  a  press  conference

pointing to a bottle of mineral water, stressing that we  should

treat our tap water as precious as that bottle of mineral water,

has left a very deep impression on my mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, by the same measure, I would also find it very

unconscionable to use the same bottle of mineral water to  flush

our   toilets.   In  fact,  it  would  be  very  environmentally

unfriendly when we consider that large scale desalination  would

consume  a  huge amount of energy which would in turn contribute

to global warming.  If we just focus on desalination as a source

of  fresh water, I think we have not done enough to explore  the

use of recycled water and sea water for flushing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of a pilot project several years ago to use

recycled  water  in  Teban Garden for  flushing.   However,  the

residents had tremendous problems with it.  My concern  is  that

that attempt was a bit half-hearted.  In my view, JTC did not do

a very good job to ensure success in that pilot project, because

recycled water is corrosive and metal components that could  not

stand  the  corrosion were used in that particular  system.   As

such,  I think it was very regrettable because it turned us  off

from the use of alternative water supply for flushing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came across sea water flushing in Hong Kong more than 18

years  ago.   I brought up the subject of sea water flushing  in

this  House in my first term as Member of Parliament,  about  14

years   ago.    Recently,   I  led   a   delegation   of   seven

Parliamentarians to Hong Kong and I learned about the use of sea

water for flushing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Singapore, the demand for water in Hong Kong for the

past  20 years up to 1990 grew by 6% a year.  Their water supply

problems  are  also  largely due to no  appreciable  underground

water;  no sizable lakes or rivers; and lack of catchment areas,

which are very similar to ours.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hong Kong has an advantage. It is part of China and

the province of Guangdong is happy to supply it with water.   By

1996, Guangdong provided about 720 million cubic metres of water

to Hong Kong, about 70% of their total demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with such an assured water supply, Hong Kong has

built  a  separate  system  to supply  sea  water  for  flushing

purposes in urban areas and new towns.  This system was  started

in  the late 1950s, close to 40 years ago.  Though sea water  is

not  treated to the same standard as fresh water, it is supplied

through  a  completely separate system through  pumping  system,

service  reservoirs and water mains, from those used  for  fresh

water.   One of the main concerns I have heard repeatedly  about

dual water system supply is the possibility of accidentally mis-connecting  sea water supply or recycled water to  fresh  water.

Members  may be interested to learn that since its induction  in

Hong  Kong,  there was not a single incidence of mis-connection.

In  fact,  today,  over  70% of Hong  Kong  population  are  now

supplied  with  sea  water for flushing.  In 1995,  the  average

daily  amount  of  sea water supplied was 434,000  cubic  metres

which  is more than the combined total of all the three  of  our

proposed  desalination plants.  As our average of  water  demand

for fresh water was 2.5 million cubic metres in 1995, this means

that  we would have used, say, sea water like what we have  used

in  Hong Kong, it would mean a saving of close to 14.6%.  So you

can look at it as a very substantial alternative supply of fresh

water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is one area that we could learn something

from  Hong Kong and I suggest that the Government seriously look

into this matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh earlier said that

in  seven years there have been no changes to Sentosa.  I beg to

disagree.  There have been changes.  Unfortunately, some of  the

changes have been for the worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think tourism is a major foreign exchange earner in

Singapore, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>

tourism has declined largely because of the economic crisis that

has  impacted Asia.  It is all the more important for us now  to

concentrate on efforts to make sure that our tourist attractions

are  indeed  drawing money for us.  Sentosa is the  gem  in  the

crown jewels of Singapore, and we must pay some attention to it.

In  developing the attractions in Singapore, especially Sentosa,

I  think there are certain principles that I would like to  urge

the Government to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a need to keep astride of international

developments  and  trends in this area, and  especially  of  the

needs  of tourists and locals, what they want to see in  tourist

attractions.  Mr Inderjit Singh has mentioned, for example, that

we  have  already  lost out to Hong Kong in  getting  Disneyland

which is a real big money spinner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is that we must continually update what has

become  obsolete,  even  if  they  had  been  grand  and   great

attractions  in  the past.  For example, in a  recent  visit  to

Sentosa  -  I  do  visit Sentosa too - the  Asian  Village,  for

example, is dead.  Practically everything is closed.  And a  few

pitiful  rides  that are still functioning  have  got  very  few

customers.   I think some of these things need to be  torn  down

and rebuilt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No money.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> If there is no money, I think this is why

the Ministry must put some grants into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third principle, Sir, is that we must not turn people

off.   Visitors who come, especially the locals, they  come  for

something that they want to see and enjoy and they go away  with

this idea that something is wrong, because it is sloppy, because

it  is tacky, because it is not quite tasteful.  For example,  I

took my visitors to Sentosa.  Usually when I go to Sentosa it is

because  I bring visitors from overseas.  I went to this Merlion

that they spent lots of money on.  Ran up right to the top,  one

tiny hole, and a long queue of people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>

waiting  to see through that tiny hole.  And then right  at  the

bottom  of  it, there is this video show on the "Legend  of  the

Merlion".  Sir, I was amazed at the total unconvincing nature of

this legend which is, of course, totally fictional, because  the

Merlion  was invented by the Tourist Promotion Board some  years

ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of sloppiness was in the sign. I saw this

sign  that  says  "To  the  Causeway".   Of  course,  they  were

referring  to the fake tower bridge that links the  mainland  to

Sentosa.  It looks like a tower bridge; it is beautiful.  But it

is  not a causeway because from what I know, a causeway is built

from the bottom of the sea up, and that is a bridge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should stay away from this "instant noodle" sort

of  syndrome  -  something  picked up,  put  water,  and  viola,

tourists would come.  For example, the VolcanoLand is an instant

noodle  volcano.   We do not have volcanoes in  Singapore.   How

sad!  So let us build a VolcanoLand.  There is, of course, as  I

mentioned, the Merlion legend.  If we do not have a real legend,

Sir,   I  think  we  should  stay  away  from  creating  totally

unimaginative ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was visiting China some years back and there was this

official  who actually talked to me about Sentosa's  attractions

and  our  tourist attractions and he said to me, "In  Singapore,

you  have nothing to show tourists.  And yet you have 7  million

of them every year.  In China, we have got so much to show them.

I  think we can beat you one day."  But that was, in a sense,  a

backhand  compliment, Sir.  We have done very  well  to  attract

tourists  but we must not rest on our laurels.  Tourism  is  our

life-line;  we  must develop Sentosa and our  other  attractions

tastefully and sensitively.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b>

Sir,  I  wish  to  thank all Members who have spoken  for  their

views,  suggestions  and  queries as  well  as  their  beguiling

stories  of  Sentosa.  Now that all Members have had their  full

say,  it remains for me and my colleagues to try and answer  all

the  queries  within the next half an hour or so,  plus  another

half an hour tomorrow.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a small point about the causeway to Sentosa. I was

told that it is partly a causeway and a bridge.  Part of it is a

causeway and part of it is a bridge.  So you might want to  call

it  Causeway Bridge, if you like.  But the more important  point

is we must take a re-look at Sentosa, and that is our intention,

to  try and bring in some consultants and take a re-look.   This

is  in  accordance with the recommendations of the Committee  on

Singapore's Competitiveness.  My colleague, Mr Tang  Guan  Seng,

will respond more fully on tourism matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to touch on this issue of our economic

competitiveness.  Dr Lee Tsao Yuan and Mr Tay  Beng  Chuan  have

expressed the need to monitor our business costs closely and  to

put  in  place the necessary machinery to monitor the impact  of

the  cost-cutting  measures  and  the  state  of  the  Singapore

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the other economic agencies have

established  a  comprehensive mechanism to do so.   We  rely  on

regular  meetings  with businessmen, surveys of  companies,  and

various   economic  statistics  such  as  trade  and  industrial

production figures.  This combination of on-the-ground  feedback

and  timely hard data enables the Government to keep close  tabs

on  the  economic situation and the problems faced by businesses

and  Singaporeans.  We will continue to explore ways to  improve

this.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee suggested using the Internet as one efficient and

cost-effective way of obtaining public feedback.  I  agree  with

her.   In  fact,  MTI  and  its statutory  boards  have  already

established links in our Internet home pages to allow members of

the public to e-mail us their feedback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Mr Tay Beng Chuan's question on further

retrenchments which may arise despite the cost-cutting measures,

we  need  to allow time for some cost-cutting measures  to  work

their way through to the economy.  Much depends on the state  of

the  US,  European and our regional economies.  As a  matter  of

fact,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>

even  in normal times when our economy was growing strongly,  we

were experiencing something like 9,000 to 10,000 retrenchments a

year.  So the figure of 20,000 should be seen in that context as

we restructure our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Members that the Government is closely

monitoring  the economy and will not hesitate to take additional

measures if the economic situation warrants them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee made several suggestions to improve our indicators

of  cost  competitiveness.   My Ministry  has  been  pursuing  a

constant  course of refinement.  For example, the Department  of

Statistics will be re-basing the unit business cost index of the

manufacturing  sector  on  the basis of  the  1993  input/output

tables  which  provide the latest available cost and  industrial

structure of the Singapore economy.  This major exercise will be

completed by the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last Parliament sitting, Dr Lee asked for

Government's response to the medium-term recommendations of  the

Committee  on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC).  In total,  the

CSC  made over 300 medium-term recommendations.  Of these,  more

than 200 recommendations have either already been implemented or

are  in  line with the work of the various Government  agencies.

Examples   include  recommendations  to  further   develop   the

financial services sector and the repositioning of the  Ministry

of Labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give Government's response to the remaining 100

over specific medium-term recommendations.  This is shown in the

handout which has already been distributed to Members.  In  view

of   the   time  constraint,  I  will  just  highlight   a   few

recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first page, under "Building World-Class Companies",

Members   will   see  there  are  three  recommendations.    The

Government  has  basically agreed with all of them  and  Temasek

Holdings  is  actively pursuing these ideas,  for  example,  the

possibility of employing expatriate talent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>

to  head  our  GLCs, the possibility of a more generous  use  of

employee  stock  option  plans or performance-based  bonuses  to

attract  and retain talented staff and also for Temasek Holdings

to take a more proactive role in developing our GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same page, No. 6, there is this proposal to study

the tax implications of the employee stock option plan.  This is

something that the Ministry of Finance needs more time  to  look

into.   But  it is something that the CSC has been pushing  very

strongly for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On item 4, there was a proposal to set up a Ministerial

Committee  to oversee the development of technopreneurship.   As

Members  know, we have already done so and there is a  committee

chaired  by  DPM Tony Tan with my colleague, BG George  Yeo,  as

Vice-Chairman.  BG George Yeo will be responding later on to all

the issues concerning R&D and technopreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members were to look at some of the other pages, on page

4,  No. 16, there is this idea that we should reduce the quantum

of  differential  premium payable for increases  in  plot  ratio

above  the  alienated ratio.  This is something  that  has  been

agreed  to in principle and the Ministry of Law is looking  into

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 8, No. 34, Positioning Singapore as the Education

and  Inter-Regional  Training Centre  in  Asia,  again  this  is

something  that  has  been agreed upon  and  the  EDB  has  been

actively  promoting  the setting up of world-class  institutions

here by Insead and other universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 9, No. 45, to review the current concept of Free

Trade Zones to allow FTZs to be designated at the company level,

this is something that has to be studied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item No. 48, Positioning Singapore as the healthcare hub of

Asia,  that  is  a good idea and Government is actively  looking

into this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 10, at the bottom, concerning "Tourism", there are

a  number  of  suggestions that we develop  world-class  tourist

attractions,  we set up a multi-agency committee  to  reposition

Sentosa into a world-class attraction, and so forth.  These  are

all the ideas which we are actively looking into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 13, No. 69, the proposal to allow working from home

using  the Internet, that is also a good idea and I think should

be actively facilitated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 14, No. 74, to set up "business incubator centres"

to  promote  new business concepts, this in fact has  been  done

already for the technology companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one last item. On page 17, No. 102, to provide

additional   funding  for  the  Innovation  Development   Scheme

administered by EDB, additional funds have in fact already  been

provided.     Members   may   want   to   look   through   these

recommendations at leisure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to move to the issues concerning

regionalisation.  Several MPs have asked for further  incentives

to  help  our companies expand into the region and beyond.   The

Government  already provides generous support  in  this  regard.

But  we will see what more we can do.  For example, TDB will  be

organising  more  trade  missions  and  fairs.   TDB  has   also

increased its assistance to participants to cover 50% of  common

expenditure, up from 30% and for the construction of  stands  in

trade  fairs or for office rentals.  TDB overseas trade  offices

also  assist  SMEs  by linking them up with  potential  business

partners.   They  are  able to help our businessmen  with  local

languages and customs should they encounter any problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the export factoring facility provided under the

Local  Enterprise  Finance Scheme, local  enterprises  can  ease

their  cash  flow when exporting overseas. The Productivity  and

Standards  Board  (PSB)  also  operates  the  Business   Connect

programme   to  facilitate  business  alliances  with   overseas

partners as well as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>

the  SG  Connect  Programme  which provides  business  matchings

through  the Internet.  EDB administers the Overseas  Enterprise

Incentive which exempts qualifying income from approved overseas

projects  for  up  to  10 years.  There  is  also  the  Overseas

Investment Incentive, as contrasted with the Overseas Enterprise

Incentive.   This Overseas Investment Incentive  allows  capital

losses  from  approved overseas projects to  be  offset  against

taxable income in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also mentioned the Regionalisation Finance Scheme

which  provides loans to local SMEs for the purchase of  assets,

such  as factory and production equipment, to help them  set  up

overseas  manufacturing plants to support  their  operations  in

Singapore.   The  Government  shares  70%  of  the   risks   and

participating banks, 30%.  The interest rate is 6.25%  or  6.75%

depending on the nature of the loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies can also apply for either the double tax

deduction or the Trade Development Incentive scheme administered

by TDB to help them explore new and emerging markets.  The Trade

Development Incentive (TDI) is a dollar-for-dollar grant scheme.

Besides  covering the setting up of overseas marketing  offices,

TDI  also  covers programmes such as franchising,  branding  and

product designs.  Since the financial year 1996, a total of  250

cases,  amounting to $11 million, have been approved for various

TDI programmes covering markets all over the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, EDB has just introduced a three-pronged

initiative   to   help   local  companies   with   co-investment

collaboration and consolidation.  Under this initiative, a  $100

million  fund  involving  both  Government  and  private  sector

participation  will take short-term equity stakes  in  promising

local  enterprises  to  support the  expansion  plans  of  these

companies.  I will ask the EDB to study whether they  can  apply

this  also  to  PLEs which are making acquisitions overseas,  as

suggested by some Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already in place initiatives to encourage globalisation

while enhancing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>

Singapore's  position as a centre for activities.  For  example,

to  encourage  companies  to  use  Singapore  as  their  trading

headquarters  base,  TDB administers the Approved  International

Traders  and Approved Oil Traders schemes.  Many companies  have

been  attracted  under  these schemes to  anchor  their  trading

functions  in  Singapore  while having  overseas  operations  to

secure  the  supply sources, such as the processing  plants  and

factories  in  cheaper locations.  This is to answer  the  point

raised by Mr Inderjit Singh about giving incentives to the local

operations whilst enabling our companies to go regional.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to respond to the points made by Mr Simon Tay

about the WTO and what is our policy in this regard.  Under  the

WTO's  built-in  agenda, members are already  committed  to  new

negotiations in agriculture and services beginning in Year 2000.

The issue is therefore not whether there will be a new round but

whether the negotiating agenda will be a more comprehensive  one

that  includes  issues  beyond  the  built-in  agenda,  such  as

electronic commerce and industrial tariffs.  A comprehensive new

round will ensure that the interests of all the WTO members  are

taken  into account.  It will also allow for trade-offs  in  the

different  sectors and facilitate negotiations  in  particularly

sensitive  areas,  such as agriculture.   Singapore  supports  a

comprehensive round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WTO should focus on core trade issues and not get distracted

by non-trade issues relating to labour and environment.  This is

not  because  we are shying away from these issues  but  because

they  often  serve as a guise for protectionism, as Mr  Tay  has

mentioned,  and  we  are prepared to discuss these  issues,  for

example,  in  the  International Labour Organisation  where  the

labour issues properly belong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay asked about the help to the least developed countries.

Singapore  is  committed  to maintain  tariffs  at  0%  for  100

products  of export interests to the least developed  countries.

Singapore also conducts training courses to help

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>

developing countries in opening up their markets and  in  coping

with  the  requirements of WTO.  For example, there is a  course

going on right now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will move on to the issues concerning the small and

medium  enterprises.  Here, I would like to inform Members  that

PSB will be conducting a review of the SME masterplan to develop

a  SME  21 blueprint to position our SMEs to meet challenges  of

the  21st  century.  The study will incorporate inputs from  the

private sector and will be launched later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB is the key agency tasked to develop our SMEs. This is in

response to Dr Wang Kai Yuen and a few others who asked  whether

we  should have a central agency.  My own assessment is that PSB

is  the  right body to do it and they are doing their  best,  of

course   with   the  help  of  the  private  sector   and   with

contributions  from  everybody.  Since its  inception  in  April

1996,  the  PSB's First-Stop Centre has rendered  assistance  to

over   11,000   cases  in  such  areas  as  finance,   operation

improvements,  market expansion, IT development  and  technology

development.   PSB has further simplified its application  forms

for  SDF, LEFS and Local Enterprise Technical Assistance  Scheme

(LETAS).  These forms should be available soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh's suggestion to farm out the processing of

assistance schemes to industry bodies is already being done  for

LETAS and can be further extended where appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we are keen to develop our SMEs and local enterprises, I

would  like to reiterate that this should not reduce our efforts

to  continue  to remain relevant to MNCs.  We have  had  a  very

successful  partnership  with  the  MNCs  which  bring  us   the

technology, the market expertise and this is something  that  we

should build on.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members asked whether the SDF can be used for training of

managers and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>

executives.  The answer is yes, if it is, for example, under the

SDF's Total Company Training Plan, where executives can also  be

covered.   SME managers also qualify for SDF support  under  the

SME  Manager Scheme, enjoying a grant level of up to 80%.   This

is  an important area because one of the problems of the SMEs is

the  managerial expertise.  We found, for example, that some  of

the   companies  do  not  place  enough  emphasis  on  financial

management.  They may be selling off products but they  are  not

collecting  the money back or managing their finances  properly.

If through our help here we can improve the level of management,

I think that will be a great help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the Promising Local Enterprises, I would like to

assure  Mr Ahmad Magad that we do not look only at the  turnover

or  the  size of the company.  We also look at their  potential,

whether they have capabilities in niche areas and both the  PSB,

which deals with the smaller companies as well as the EDB, which

deals  with the larger local enterprises, are eager to help  our

companies  to build up, to go regional and hopefully become  our

own MNCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on issues concerning the Local

Enterprise  Finance Scheme (LEFS).  In response to the  economic

crisis, the Government enhanced the LEFS scheme twice last year.

The  enhancements are aimed at helping more SMEs  obtain  short-term  loans to ease their cash flow.  The results show that  the

enhancements are practical and effective.  The take-up rate  for

short-term  loans has increased significantly.   Loan  approvals

for  working capital, for example, increased by more  than  ten-fold  for  the period April 1998 to January 1999 as compared  to

the  same  period in 1997.  Similarly, factoring loans  approved

rose   six-fold  with  about  $200  million  extended  to  local

enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have called for the Government to reduce the

current  interest rate for LEFS.  Members may recall  that  when

the  prime  lending rate was increased to 7.5% last  year,  LEFS

rates  were  not adjusted.  The current LEFS interest  rates  of

6.25% for short and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>

medium-term loans and 6.75% for long-term loans are  still  very

attractive, compared to prevailing interest rates for commercial

loans  to SMEs.  Typically, they may have to pay something  like

10%  for  their  loans if they are able to get  the  money  from

commercial  banks.   So  the  rate of  6.25%  is  actually  very

attractive.   I therefore do not propose to lower  the  interest

rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LEFS is intended to provide funds to SMEs, not to subsidise

their  operations  through lower interest rates.   In  fact,  as

Members  may be aware, Singapore is enjoying some of the  lowest

interest rates at the moment.  The data I have here is from  the

Business  Times  On-Line.   The Singapore  prime  rate  for  the

average  of  12  banks is 5.91%.  So the rate of 6.25%  is  just

fractionally  about the prime rate.  In fact, there  is  no  way

that  SMEs can borrow at the prime rate or at this kind of rates

from other banks.  Our rates compare very favourably with rates,

for  example, in Taipei, 8.8%; Hong Kong, 10%; New  York,  8.5%;

London,  7.25%.  These are all prime rates.  Our rates are  much

lower  than,  say, Bangkok, 14.75%; Manila, 22.9%  and  Jakarta,

28%.   We  are  higher  than the rate in Tokyo  which  is  2.6%;

Zurich,  3.25%  and Frankfurt, 4.5%.  Actually we  are  enjoying

very  low  interest rates at the moment, reflecting the strength

of our currency and the strength of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin spoke about the logistics sector

which is very important and we are putting a lot of emphasis  on

this area to see how we can enhance our role in this area.   The

strategy  is  to enhance our cost competitiveness and  logistics

capabilities    through    the   development    of    integrated

infrastructure and processes, grooming of world-class workforce,

attracting  hub projects and internationalising local companies.

Besides  helping  local companies to grow, we need  and  welcome

foreign participation in this industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board is taking a two-pronged approach to

grow  this sector.  First, to establish Singapore as a logistics

hub  for the region, TDB helps local and international companies

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>

establish  their foothold in the region so that  they  can  also

undertake  the  physical handling in these  regional  locations,

while  continuing to use Singapore as a centre for  control  and

value-added.   Secondly,  to attract international  distributors

and  procurement  houses  to locate  in  Singapore.   This  will

enlarge  the  pool  of  cargo  interest  in  Singapore,  thereby

expanding  networking opportunities for locally-based  logistics

players.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for incentives, this is something we have to look into.

We  already have the Approved International Traders and Approved

Oil  Traders  and other schemes.  We should see whether  we  can

apply some of these to our local companies as well.  I think  in

fact some of the local firms have already qualified, if I am not

mistaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will comment briefly on the question of industrial

land pricing.  In pricing of industrial land, we have adopted  a

market-based  approach so as to ensure efficient allocation  and

usage  of  this  scarce resource.  We have a  policy  of  steady

release  of  industrial land to allow for long-term planning  by

industrialists  as well as to moderate land  prices.   For  this

year, we are proceeding with the industrial land sales but  with

a  reduced  quantum  in view of the current situation  of  ample

supply.   JTC's posted rentals for industrial land and factories

are back to levels of the early 1990s.  We have also taken steps

to   lower   annual   escalation  of  land  rentals.    Wherever

appropriate, industrial developments are allowed to go beyond  a

plot ratio of 2.5.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of subletting, JTC and HDB properties are let

out  to  companies  for them to carry out their  own  industrial

activities.  However, in view of the current economic  slowdown,

JTC  is prepared to consider carefully, on a case-by-case basis,

requests  for subletting beyond the approved limits.  For  FY98,

JTC has so far approved 379 new sublet cases that exceed the 50%

space sublet limit on a temporary basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the increasing integration of manufacturing

production and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>

manufacturing-related   services,   many   manufacturing-related

activities   such  as  product  design  and  testing,   software

development, IT support are already allowed in normal industrial

buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The URA has also announced a further relaxation of

allowable uses within industrial buildings.  Ancillary services,

including office-related activities, are now allowed to take  up

to 40% of the space in an industrial building.  Storage can also

be  included as part of the predominant production space, making

up the other 60%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I just want to comment on this issue of

desalination  raised  by  Prof. Low.   Before  recommending  the

technology for our first 30 million gallons per day desalination

plant,  PUB's  consultants  had  reviewed  comprehensively   all

available technologies.  For the first phase of our desalination

project,   it  is  important  to  use  a  reliable  and   proven

desalination technology.  Distillation technology is a tried and

proven process for large-scale desalination plants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse Osmosis technology has potential for improvements

with  regard to its application in tropical waters where fouling

of  membranes  is a key concern.  In addition,  the  RO  process

requires a higher degree of pre-treatment of raw sea water.   To

better  assess  the suitability of RO for use  in  Singapore,  a

small RO plant of 1 mgd will be built as part of the first phase

of  our desalination project.  Depending on the outcome of tests

on the plant, RO will be considered for subsequent phases of the

desalination project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB is also keeping abreast of the latest developments in

desalination   technology,  including   the   tender   for   the

desalination  plant  to  be  built at  Tampa  Bay,  Florida.   A

decision  on  the  award of the tender is  still  pending  since

bidding  closed  in  December 1997 due to several  issues,  cost

being  one  of  them.  PUB will continue to monitor  the  latest

developments in desalination technologies to assess if these can

be applied in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon</b>

<b>Yeo):</b> Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Zulkifli, Dr Wang Kai Yuen and

Mr  Ong Kian Min spoke on the development of a knowledge economy

in    Singapore,   especially   the   fostering   of   high-tech

entrepreneurship, R&D and e-commerce.  We are grateful for their

detailed  recommendations which MTI and MTI agencies will  study

and carefully consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One crucial area for the development of a knowledge economy

is  the  availability  of talent.  And we,  in  Singapore,  must

appreciate  the  fact  that we are not  Israel,  we  are  not  a

continental nation, we have a small population base, and that if

we can make an achievement in this area, we need many foreigners

to  help us, some living overseas, some living here.  Yesterday,

when  Dr  Tan Cheng Bock said that at a time of economic crisis,

we should think Singapore first, I think we must be careful at a

time  like this not to send wrong signals to our foreign friends

and to our foreign partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we welcome them. They live among us. We work

in  the same offices.  We are neighbours.  We meet in the hawker

centres  and restaurants.  And it is crucial that while  we  are

friends with them in good times, we remain friends with them  in

bad  times.   It  is in a crisis that the true  character  of  a

person comes forth.  Very often, when we assess our friends, the

people  whom we work with, we watch them in a crisis.   Do  they

turn  selfish and inwards?  Do relationships suddenly  sour,  or

will  they  continue  to share and feel a sense  of  solidarity?

Precisely, at a time like this, when we need many foreigners  to

help  us to take our economy to the next phase, we must not send

the  wrong  signals.  Yes, in the short-term, some  Singaporeans

will  be pleased that we are protecting them.  We save them from

foreign competition.  But such an emotional line of attack would

do  great disservice to Singapore and to ourselves in the  long-term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin asked about our efforts to combat the Y2K

bug.    He  cited  the  Garner  Group  report  which  said  that

Singapore's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>

SMEs  were  not very well prepared and that we have  significant

cross-border  problems, meaning that many of our neighbours  are

much  less  prepared than we are.  In fact, we have started  our

planning  for  the  Y2K  problem way in advance  of  many  other

countries.   In  November 1996, NCB launched its Y2K  Conversion

Campaign.  And many of the larger agencies in Singapore, all the

Government  agencies, statutory boards, are well prepared.   Our

SMEs  continue to be less prepared, but I think this is a world-wide  problem, because the problems are of a smaller  scale  and

sometimes it is hard for them to see how the Y2K problem affects

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCB has a Local Enterprise Computerisation Programme which funds

up  to  70% of the consultancy cost for SMEs, but not many  have

taken  up this offer.  But we have got to keep pushing,  and  we

have  got  to work with our regional partners.  So some  of  you

might  have  read in the Straits Times yesterday  that  APEC  is

organising a conference next month which will bring together 300

experts from the region, including experts from the World  Bank,

OECD  and  the Asian Development Bank, and they will  also  talk

about  the  problem of SMEs.  This APEC meeting is sponsored  by

Canada, Japan and Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, on the whole, we should not be unduly alarmed.

What  we  should  do,  we have done.  We  should  not  have  too

apocalyptic a vision of what the Y2K bug can cause.  I  remember

one  day  going  home, my 8-year old son asked  me  whether  his

digimon  will be affected.  I do not know who briefed him  about

the  Y2K bug.  But, obviously, there are a lot of misconceptions

and  misperceptions  of what it means.  So,  we  should  not  be

unduly  alarmed  but,  at  the  same  time,  we  must  take  all

precautions.  Because in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>

the  nature of the problem, it is not what we are aware of which

will trip us up.  It is the things that we are not aware of.  As

the Chinese say, "bu pa yi wan, zhi pa wan yi".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also remember that because the entire world is focused

on  this  problem, there will be herd effects.  Mass  psychology

can  become  important.  If everyone decides not to fly  on  1st

January or 31st December, then maybe half the world's aeroplanes

will not be flying.  And where will they be parked?  Because, at

any  one time, half the world's aeroplanes are flying.  In  some

cities, there may be a panic rush to withdraw money from  banks,

in  which case the money supply will have to be increased.   But

these   are  problems  which  we  should  anticipate.   Scenario

planning,  contingency planning, is being done  by  the  various

agencies,  and I am glad to report that, on the whole, Singapore

should be quite well prepared for the Y2K problem.
