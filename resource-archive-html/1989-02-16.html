   <b>HAWKERS PENALIZED UNDER THE POINTS DEMERIT SYSTEM</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b> asked the Minister for the Environment (a) how many hawkers in food centres have been
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> penalised under the Points Demerit System since its inception up to the latest convenient date; (b) which food centres have the greatest number of offending hawkers; and (c) whether he is satisfied that the scheme has improved the conduct of hawkers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng) (for the Minister for the Environment):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of the Points Demerit System on 14th September 1987, a total of 660 hawkers in hawker centres, 121 stallholders in eating houses, 37 snack bar operators and five restaurant managements have been given demerit points.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, six hawkers and three snack bar operators have had their licences suspended for two weeks. Another six cases involving hawkers are pending suspension.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawker centres with the greatest number of offenders are the Telok Ayer Transit Centre, Cuppage Road Market, Golden Mile Food Centre, Newton Food Centre and Berseh Food Centre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that the scheme has improved the awareness of food vendors in general. They are more conscious of the need to keep their premises clean and to observe proper food and personal hygiene. Standards of cleanliness and hygiene in food centres have generally improved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry takes a serious view against recalcitrant food vendors who are indifferent to hygiene standards. Food vendors must understand their role and responsibilities. The Ministry is currently reviewing the Environmental Public Health (Food Establishment) Regulations and one of the amendments to be made will be to increase the penalties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, stiffer penalties, the risk of losing one's licence or having it suspended, in addition to the adverse publicity generated, would deter restaurant operators and other food vendors from unhygienic practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Sir, will the Senior Parliamentary Secretary list out the names of the five restaurants which have been given demerit points, and also the names of the snack bars whose licences have been suspended? Secondly, can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary explain why an established Mayflower Peking Restaurant was given light penalty by the court recently for its food hygiene violation? And the third supplementary question: can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary assure this House that in future, violation of this nature will be given more severe penalty?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> First, the hon. Mr Chin wants me to list out the five restaurants and the snack bars that have been given demerit points. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I do not have the names of the restaurants and the snack bars. So I cannot provide him the answers. But if he wants, I can arrange to send them to him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question concerns Mayflower Restaurant. Why was this popular restaurant given such a light punishment, so to speak, by the court? Mr Speaker, Sir, first, we have to realize that we have no jurisdiction over the courts as to what they want to do or not want to do, in terms of meting out punishment. Secondly, I agree with him that, in today's context, the fines may not be a sufficient deterrent. But I would go on to say that we have to look at the whole system of punishment and not only one particular aspect of it. We have the demerit points system, we have the fines, we have adverse publicity. However, I cannot recall the case of Mayflower Restaurant as clearly as I can of the Kelong Restaurant. The Kelong committed certain offences in relation to public health regulations. They caused an outbreak of food poisioning. And what happened after that?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I would think that only demerit points or stiffer penalties will deter restaurants such as Mayflower or Kelong from repeating offences like that or prevent them from being callous. But I think the important thing is that we realize many managements of such well-known restaurants are afraid of adverse publicity. And here I would compliment the press for doing their bit in terms of providing the type of publicity so that consumers are aware of the status of each restaurant that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is serving food to them. If the press had not come out with such publicity, I think Mr Chin would not have read about it. He would not have known about it. The fact that it was publicised gave everybody the knowledge that Mayflower, Kelong, well-known restaurants, were in trouble. In fact, when the Kelong case was publicised, we had calls the next day from various consumers, I suppose patrons of the restaurant, asking about the status with regard to Kelong itself. Why? Perhaps they were going to hold functions there or they wanted to hold birthday parties or wedding parties. "Should I go?" So the very fact that people are aware, and are afraid, is sufficient adverse publicity for the restaurants. I would also inform the Member that on several occasions when such things happen, the restaurants will be the first to come and tell us, "Please, if you can, do not give us adverse publicity."

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not think that demerit points alone or a fine is sufficient to deter anybody. I think it is basically the total system that works. And we hope that all the systems that we have will deter restaurants like Kelong, Mayflower, or others who are callous to be more careful with the way they handle food.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is whether I can assure the House that violation of such a nature in future will be more severely punished. Yes, I can assure him. We will certainly ensure that in future we will make sure that people who are callous, and so on and so forth, with food handling practices will be duly punished. At the end of it all, I think the consumers have a part to play. The Government cannot play all this role by itself. Every Singaporean is a consumer, the silent majority. And if every Singaporean makes it a point to demand clean food, good food, then I think that we can together ensure that food sold in Singapore is clean and healthy.

   <b>(Impact and cost to residential customers)</b>

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information what will be the impact on telephone service and the cost of that service to residential customers over the next 5 years
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font>

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Sir, the objective of restructuring Telecoms is to further improve its efficiency and its productivity, and to make the organization more responsive to the needs of its customers. Currently, Telecoms provides a service that is comparable to the best in the world by way of pricing, range of products and services and the sophistication of those products and services. For example, with pricing. In calls to countries all over the world, it is cheaper in a very large number of cases to make the call from Singapore to the other country than to have the call made the other way round. Sir, with your permission, I will ask the Clerk to circulate a short list (Cols. 715 - 716) of some of the rates that Singapore Telecoms charges and compare them with the rates for incoming calls. [Copies of Table circulated to Members.] Sir, the list shows that in a large number of cases, the rates charged by Singapore are much lower. In some cases, Telecoms' rates can be as low as half the rate for the incoming calls.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecoms' pricing philosophy is simple - to provide the best possible service at the lowest possible cost, subject to full recovery of the services provided. With increased efficiency and productivity resulting from this restructuring, we can keep the operation costs down and savings made can then be passed on to the consumers, as had been done over the last 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, is the residential service to the consumers currently being subsidized? Would the reorganization not give Singapore Telecom an exact measure of that subsidy, if it exists?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, it is not possible to say whether the local services are being subsidized by the international services, because of the overlap in the use of the infrastructure provided. For example, the same network of lines between homes in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore is also used for calls from those homes to countries overseas. So it is not possible under our present practice to have a clear partition of all cost factors. These costs are partitioned in a manner that is generally acceptable internationally.

   <b>MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR WIDOWS OF GOVERNMENT PENSIONERS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he will allow the wives of government pensioners to continue enjoying medical benefits after the death of the pensioners.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned before in this House in 1986, medical benefits are extended to the pensioner and his wife because of the continuing relationship between the pensioner and the Government as his former employer by virtue of the pension payable to him. When the pensioner dies, his pension stops and his eligibility for medical benefits for his wife will also cease.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April 1986, all appointments in the Civil Service except those in the Designated Services are made non-pensionable in order to reduce the long-term burden of Government. If we were to provide medical care for the existing number of around 6,500 pensioners' wives for approximately five years, which is the estimated period whereby females might outlive the males, the estimated cost to Government could exceed $40 million. In view of the cost which ultimately must pass on to the taxpayers, there is a limit to which the Government can continue to take care of the welfare of pensioners and their family members. Therefore, the Government is not able to change the long established rule that the wives of Government pensioners do not enjoy medical benefits after the death of the pensioners.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson):</b> Sir, does the Minister have the percentage figure of the additional cost to Government versus the total cost of benefits that are given to the civil service as a whole in a year? If the percentage is very small,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> would the Minister not consider in favour of the pensioners who have served the Government diligently for their whole life?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not have the percentage figure in hand. The principle is not so much whether it is a small percentage or large percentage. As long as we are responsible for the disbursement of public funds, I think we have to draw the line somewhere, the principle being that if we extend on these grounds for one category of requests, it would be very difficult not to do the same for others.

  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Finance has reviewed the question of medical benefits for dependants of female officers and has decided to adopt a liberal approach in granting such benefits to female officers who are sole supporters of their families. This means that female officers who are divorced, widowed or granted a decree of judicial separation will in future be automatically granted medical benefits for their dependants. The benefits would also be granted in other cases where the female officers are the sole supporters of their families, as in cases where the spouses cannot work for health reasons.

  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's assistance schemes to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are comprehensive. They are designed to help local SMEs gain access to financing, fixed capital investments, technology and know-how.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major financial assistance schemes which Members are familiar with include:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Small Industries Finance Scheme (SIFS);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Liberalised Investment Allowance Scheme (LIAS);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Small Industry Technical Assistance Scheme (SITAS);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Business Development Scheme (BDS);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Market Development Assistance Scheme (MDAS);
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Product Development Assistance Scheme (PDAS);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) Design Venture Programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the end of 1988, there were 8,719 cases of direct financial assistance given to local SMEs under the above schemes. This amounted to some $1.38 billion. Details are given in the Table (Cols. 717 - 718) that I have circulated to Members.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1989/19890216/19890216-HA-0520717.htm">Table - SUMMARY TABLE OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (Cols. 717 - 718)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the financial assistance schemes, the Government also provides developmental assistance to local SMEs. These schemes include:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP) which helps SMEs in our supporting industries upgrade, by helping to forge ties between them and multi-national corporations (MNCs) in Singapore. So far, 21 MNCs have teamed up with the EDB to upgrade their local suppliers. Eight of these MNCs have implemented the scheme fully, providing assistance to 58 local SMEs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another developmental assistance scheme is what we call the Technology Adoption and Automation Programmes which include schemes implemented by SISIR such as technology promotion and information services, competence centres for contract R&amp;D, consultancy, testing and technical services, incubator units for technology innovation and quality upgrading services to meet export requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of all these financial and developmental assistance schemes are becoming visible. The participation rate in these schemes is high. By helping to reduce the financial and technological risks, these schemes have raised the confidence of local entrepreneurs. This is reflected in the significant increase in the value of local investment commitments from $295.1 million in 1987 to $347.8 million last year. The number of local enterprises also increased substantially from 64,200 to more than 71,000 over the same period.

And also for 1989, is the Senior Parliamentary Secretary able to inform this House how many possibly will be approved for this year?

  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Sir, the scheme has just started. 18 for 1988 is considered quite good. As to how many will qualify for 1989, I do not have the figures. I do not know who have applied. Maybe at the appropriate time, the Member for Cairnhill may want to ask the same question and I will be too pleased to give him the answer.

My Ministry plans to also extend Medisave to cover the catastrophic illness insurance scheme. My Ministry currently has no plan to further extend the usage of Medisave. We need to be sure that the current 6% Medisave contribution rate could still provide adequate savings to meet the individual's hospitalization needs during his or her old age before considering any further extension on the use of Medisave.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he will agree that allowing the CPF depositors to use their money for annual medical check-ups, is, in fact, a form of preventive medicine, as it may help to alleviate their need for hospitalization in the future?

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, my Ministry recognizes the need for preventive medical care and that is why we have a very comprehensive preventive health education programme which includes encouragement on the use of screening services.

   <b>BETTER RACIAL MIX IN HDB HOUSING ESTATES</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Minister for National Development)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a speech to community leaders on 6th January, I referred to the trend in some HDB estates where concentrations of racial groups are beginning to form. The President, in his Address to Parliament, also highlighted the gravity of this problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House today of the measures that the Government is going to introduce to ensure a better racial mix in HDB estates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set a limit on the maximum proportion allowed for each racial group in each HDB neighbourhood. It will also set a separate limit on the maximum proportion for each block. These limits are set out in Table 1 (Cols. 723 - 726). Some Tables and Annexes have already been distributed to Members. May I ask them to turn to Table 1? I will take them very briefly through this Table. Table 1 sets out the proportions of flats permitted for each race, each neighbourhood and block. You can see from this Table that for Malays who comprise 15% of the population, the permissible proportion of flats in each neighbourhood is 22% and for each block is 25%. For Chinese who comprise 76% of the population, the permissible proportion in each neighbourhood is 84% and in each block is 87%. And for Indians and others who make up about 9% of the population, the permissible proportion for each neighbourhood is 10% and for each block is 13%. These limits will cover the allocation of new flats as well as the sale of resale flats. They will take effect from 1st March 1989.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1989/19890216/19890216-HA-0520723.htm">Table 1 - PROPORTIONS OF FLATS PERMITTED FOR EACH RACE IN EACH NEIGHBOURHOOD AND BLOCK, NEIGHBOURHOODS AFFECTED BY LIMITS SPECIFIED IN TABLE 1 AS AT 15 FEB 89 (Cols. 723 - 726)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to give the assurance that no HDB owner, whether he is Chinese, Malay or Indian will be requested to move from his present flat. The measures that we will be introducing to ensure a good racial mix will only affect
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the allocation of new flats and the resale of flats after 1st March 1989.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain the reasons for the measures and how they will work. I have also distributed to Members three Annexes. (Cols. 719 - 722) May I ask them to refer to these annexes now. Annex I shows the racial distribution of applications for new flats. It shows that proportionately more Chinese applied for flats in Ang Mo Kio/Hougang Zone and proportionately more Malays applied for flats in the Bedok/Tampines Zone. Annex II gives the position for resale flats, applications to buy resale flats. Here Members will note that Malays bought more than half (55%) of the flats in the Bedok/Tampines Zone. In Bedok new town alone, if present trends continue, the proportion of Malays will reach 30% by 1991, and will exceed 40% in 10 years' time.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1989/19890216/19890216-HA-0520719.htm">Annexes - APPLICATIONS FOR NEW FLATS BY RACE AND ZONE, APPLICATIONS FOR RESALE FLATS BY RACE AND ZONE, PURCHASES OF RESALE FLATS BY RACE AND ESTATE IN 1988 (Cols. 719 - 722)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar trends are emerging in other estates, largely through open-market resale of HDB flats. This is illustrated by a more detailed analysis of purchase of resale flats by race and estate, and is shown in Annex III. You can see from Annex III that a high proportion of buyers in Bukit Merah, Redhill and Henderson were Chinese. In Bedok, Eunos, Teban Gardens and Taman Jurong, more than half the buyers were Malays. In parts of Yishun and in Kampong Java, there was a high proportion of Indian purchasers. There are clear signs that racial congregations are re-emerging. Although the problem has not reached crisis proportions, the experience in other multi-racial societies such as the United States shows that while racial groupings start slowly, once a critical point is passed, racial groupings accelerate suddenly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slowing down of HDB's construction of new flats, resale flats will have an increasing influence on the ethnic composition of the HDB estates and new towns. We must therefore introduce open and clear policies early, to stop these trends.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late 50's and early 60's, various sections of our population were gathered
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in different pockets, distinguishable by their race or dialect groups. Older Singaporeans will remember that the Malays were concentrated in Geylang Serai, Eunos and a few other areas. The Indians were found in disproportionate numbers in the Serangoon Road and Naval Base areas. The Chinese gathered in dialect groups: the Cantonese in Kreta Ayer, the Hokkiens in Telok Ayer, the Teochews in the Upper Serangoon and Boat Quay areas, and the Hainanese in the Beach Road/Middle Road areas. Each group was fiercely proud of its own identity and defended its narrow interests stoutly. Each clung to its own race or community for security and mutual assistance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear that something had to be done if we wanted to build a cohesive, stable and harmonious society and a nation. The Government seized the opportunity of the massive public housing programme to mix the population. We made sure that every HDB new town and estate reflected the racial mix of the population as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With few exceptions, we have made each electoral constituency representative of the racial and social mix of Singapore. Each HDB new town has a cross-section of Singaporeans. Each has its share of talent and community leaders. Each MP is familiar with the problems of every ethnic, social and economic group in Singapore. Grassroots leaders too are familiar with these problems and can therefore play a more effective community development role among their residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, each racial group has developed an understanding of the other racial groups that make up our nation. This explains how we have been able to forge a consensus on social issues and carry the population with us. Mixing the various communities in proportions that approximate the general population has given us racial tolerance and harmony for the last 20 years and more. To allow them to regroup now will be to go back to the pre-1965 period when conditions bred distrust and misunderstanding among the various races and when there were even racial riots.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, therefore, set limits on the maximum proportions of each racial group allowed in each HDB neighbourhood. These are, as I have already explained, set out in Table 1. These proportions take into account the existing racial composition of our population and the projected demand for HDB flats by each racial group. The projected demand is based on the rate of formation of new households as well as recent trends in applications. We have chosen the HDB neighbourhood as our basic unit to apply the racial proportions because the neighbourhood is a distinct entity with a well-defined physical boundary. A neighbourhood comprises an average of 50 blocks with about 5,000 flats. Every HDB new town is made up of a number of neighbourhoods, each designed around a neighbourhood centre, which is a focal point for community activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbourhood limits set out in the table will ensure that each neighbourhood has a good racial mix of residents. In addition, the limits on individual blocks will prevent any single block from developing a concentration of a single racial group. The limits on blocks are set three percentage points higher than the limits for neighbourhoods. This is to allow some variation of ethnic proportions from block to block. For example, you can see from the table that while Chinese can occupy 87% of the flats in a block, they may not exceed 84% of the flats in a neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sale of new flats, the HDB will use these proportions as a guide to allocate the flats and will as far as possible follow the existing first-come-first-served policy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to explain how these proportions will apply in the resale of flats. If the existing proportions in a neighbourhood or block are within the limits set in Table 1, there will be no restrictions. Anyone can sell his flat to any buyer, regardless of race. The operative limit is the neighbourhood limit. As long as the neighbourhood limit is below that which we have set out in the table, transactions can take place freely, until such time as the permissible limit for anyone of the racial or ethnic groups has been reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now illustrate how these proportions will work in different contexts. For example, let us assume that Malays already occupy 22% of the flats in a neighbourhood, the Malay proportion will therefore have reached the limit set for Malays. A Malay in this neighbourhood may sell his flat to a buyer of any ethnic group, because by doing so, he will not be increasing the proportion of Malays in the neighbourhood. If he sells to a Malay the proportion will remain the same. If he sells to a non-Malay the proportion will come down. A non-Malay, however, who intends to sell his flat will have to sell his flat only to a non-Malay. He cannot sell to a Malay because if he does so, the proportion of Malays in the neighbourhood will go beyond the 22%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, suppose in a neighbourhood the Chinese occupy 90% of the flats and thus exceed the neighbourhood limit for Chinese which, Members will remember, is 84%. A non-Chinese in this neighbourhood may only sell his flat to another non-Chinese because if he were to sell to a Chinese he will cause the proportion of Chinese in the neighbourhood to go up even further. A Chinese, however, is free to sell his flat to a buyer of any ethnic group. If a Chinese sells his flat to a non-Chinese, the proportion occupied by Chinese in the neighbourhood will come down. The proportion will not be allowed to go back to 90% as this exceeds the limit that we have set. So we will allow the proportions to come down as and when a Chinese sells to a non-Chinese, and we will not allow the proportions to go back to the 90%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a third example. Suppose the proportion of Chinese in a neighbourhood is 80%, ie, below the limit set for the neighbourhood for Chinese, but there is a block in the neighbourhood with 95% Chinese, much higher than the block limit for Chinese. Then a non-Chinese owning a flat in that block will only be allowed to sell it to another non-Chinese, whereas a Chinese can sell it to anybody. From this example, it will be clear that an HDB owner can sell his flat freely as long as the buyer is of the same ethnic group. Similarly, someone looking to buy a flat in the resale market can buy one freely as long as the seller is of the same ethnic group. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> permissible limits only arise when the buyer and seller are of different ethnic groups and they are in neighbourhoods where the limits are already higher than the limit set out in the table.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way we will contain the problem. Where the limits have already been exceeded, our measures will prevent the situation from deteriorating. However, these measures will not force the proportions down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the 125 HDB neighbourhoods, the HDB has identified 35 neighbourhoods which will be immediately affected by these measures. Table 2 shows where these neighbourhoods are. These are the neighbourhoods where the owners have already occupied the flats for more than five years and are thus free to sell in the open market, and these are neighbourhoods where the existing levels or proportions for any one of the three ethnic groups exceeds what we have set out in the table. But it does not follow of course that everybody who lives in these neighbourhoods will be affected immediately or even in the long run. It will only affect those who own and want to sell their flats. Only such people will be affected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resale statistics show that most HDB owners who sold their flats sold their flats to buyers of the same ethnic group. Based on this trend, the HDB estimates that fewer than 1,200 owners in these 35 neighbourhoods will be affected in the next 12 months if they want to sell their flats, say, in the next year. In other words, if these measures that we will be introducing had taken effect one year ago, there would have been about 1,200 transactions that could not have taken place. If as a result of this policy to ensure a balanced racial mix in HDB estates, anyone finds it difficult to sell his flat in the open market, the HDB is prepared, as a last resort, to buy back the flat at prevailing posted price.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat the assurance that no one will be asked to move from his present flat. Where the present proportions exceed the limits, we will allow time and redevelopment of the area to bring the proportions down and to achieve a better racial mix.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our multi-racial policies must continue if we are to develop a more cohesive, better integrated society. Singapore's racial harmony, long-term stability, and even viability as a nation depend on it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Pock Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Pock Too (Nee Soon Central):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two questions. First, he mentioned in his statement that the new measures will immediately affect 35 neighbourhoods. As the control is by neighbourhood and block, are there blocks outside these 35 neighbourhoods which have exceeded the permissible proportions, and will they be similarly affected by the new measures?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister said that the proportions will act as a guide to allocate new and resale flats within the current first-come-first-served policy. How will these new measures affect the first-come-first-served policy which, I would like to remind him, has all along been the basis universally accepted as a fair allocation principle?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take the questions as they come up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true there are blocks outside these 35 neighbourhoods where the limits already exceed those that I have set out in Table 1. But the transactions that are likely to be affected, if we go by past experience, would be very few. We estimate that about 18% of the blocks outside these 35 neighbourhoods will be affected. But if we go by past experience, out of a total transactions of 8,000 or more, only 500 would have been affected by these measures. Therefore, I did not mention these figures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the first-come-first-served policy, as I mentioned, HDB will try as far as possible to follow this policy. In the first instance, in the allocation of new flats, HDB will allocate according to the first-come-first-served policy until the proportion for any one of the ethnic groups is reached. Then, allocation for that ethnic group will be stopped and we will go on to the other ethnic groups. So, in effect, there will be four lists. One is the normal list all applications starting from 1, and running in consecutive order. And then there will be another one for each one of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> groups - Chinese, Malays, Indians and others. The first list will form the basis for allocation as a start. Once a particular race or ethnic group has reached the proportion set, then they will skip and go on to the other ethnic groups. So there will be a change in the policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> , Mr Speaker, Sir, I have several questions for clarification by the Minister. My question actually relates to Table 1 which gives the proportion of flats permitted for each race in each neighbourhood and for each block. If you look at the second column, that is, the permissible proportion of flats in each neighbourhood versus the percentage in population, you will notice that for Malays, 22% is 5 percentage points beyond 15%; and for Chinese, 84% is 8 percentage points above 76%; and for Indians, 10 percentage is only 1 percentage point above 8.9%. Perhaps the Minister can give us a better understanding as to how this number is arrived at. For instance, I would imagine that it might be better to say that for the Indians, being half the percentage shown in terms of population, the variation would be half of that permissible for Malays. So 3.5% might be a better figure, judging from this Table.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 2 also relates to this Table. These percentages are based on current percentages in population. Would these percentages, in terms of permissible proportions, be reviewed from time to time if the population shifts in future?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for this opportunity to clarify Table 1. As I mentioned in my statement, these permissible proportions are based on a number of factors. The racial composition of the population is only one of the factors. The more important factors are the rate at which new households are being formed in each one of the racial groups and the present composition of applications. Applications for HDB flats at present do not reflect the racial composition in Singapore as a whole. If you look at the applications, Malays accounted for about 19% of the applications; Chinese accounted for 74% of the applications; and Indians and Others as a group accounted for 7% of the applications. Because of the greater unmet demand from Malays, the present applications are higher than the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> proportion of the population. So we took this into account and fixed the proportions accordingly and allowed some variation. So if you just compare the composition of the population by race to these figures, of course it appears that we have allowed more latitude for one group and less for others. But if we take into account the composition of the applications and our estimates of the rate at which new households are being formed, then I think this will work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is what happens if there is a change in the composition of population. Of course, we will have to review from time to time and bring these permissible proportions in line with such changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the problem of racial congregation in separate enclaves, I have two questions to ask the Minister. First, as it stands today, we have not seen any sign of any racial disharmony among the people in the Housing Board estates. So I feel that the measures mentioned by the Minister would be a kind of restriction on some of the people. Is this kind of restriction necessary, and will this be feasible?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: I would like to ask the Minister whether he would consider using the existing technological system and technique such as telephone, electronic communication and teleview or employing well-trained enquiry counter officers so as to minimize the inconvenience caused to residents when they resell their flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I take the second point first whether HDB can use all the available new technology to inform HDB residents of the proportions in each neighbourhood block. Yes, I will certainly ask HDB to look into how they can most effectively and best inform HDB residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the first point, I think it may be useful, Mr Speaker, Sir, if some of the points that I made could be re-stated because the Member has asked whether these measures are, in fact, necessary. I would like to have it re-stated in Mandarin for the benefit of the Chinese press and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> others who speak Mandarin. So I will ask my Minister of State to answer this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Peter Sung (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Peter Sung):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): The Minister for National Development has already explained the measures in detail. I will briefly summarise the main points.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few decades ago, various racial groups congregated in ethnic enclaves. The Malays were concentrated in Geylang Serai and Eunos. The Indians were found in Serangoon Road. Among the Chinese: the Cantonese in Kreta Ayer, the Hokkiens in Telok Ayer, the Teochews in Boat Quay, and the Hainanese in Beach Road and Middle Road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they congregate together? It is because they felt that by so doing they could promote their own security and could better look after their own welfare and interests. This is good. But their attitude towards other races is sometimes different. This sometimes led to misunderstandings and undesirable consequences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the allocation of flats under the public housing programme over the last two decades, the Government took the opportunity to redistribute the population so that every HDB estate reflected the racial mix of the population. As a result:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Every racial group is represented in each constituency. Each Member of Parliament developed better understanding of the living habits, the economic conditions and social/political positions of his residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Each racial group has developed mutual understanding with the other racial groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) We have forged racial tolerance and harmony. For more than 20 years, we did not have serious racial problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the last few years, there were some undesirable developments. While the various ethnic groups were properly distributed during the allocation of new HDB flats, there was no restriction on the resale of flats. There was a tendency for the various ethnic groups to again
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> congregate through the process of resale. For example:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) more Chinese prefer flats in Ang Mo Kio and Hougang
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) more Malays prefer flats in Bedok, Tampines, and Eunos
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) more Indians prefer flats in Kampong Java.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are clear signs that racial congregations are re-emerging. Up to now the problem is not very serious. But if we do not prevent this now, we may lose control in future. In some other multi-racial societies, this phenomenon is already beyond control and had created uneasiness among the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid such undesirable consequences, the Government will introduce measures to ensure ethnic balance in HDB estates. My Minister has already distributed figures showing details of these measures; it is not necessary for me to repeat them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new policy will take effect from 1st March 1989.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) But the government assures that existing HDB residents will not be forced to move from or sell their present flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The new policy will apply to the allocation of new flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The new policy will also apply to the resale of flats from 1st March 1989. For example, if the Malay community in a HDB block has already reached or exceeded the permissible limit, a Chinese who wants to resell his flat cannot sell it to a Malay. If the Chinese cannot find a buyer because of this restriction, the HDB is prepared to buy his flat from him at the prevailing HDB posted prices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to repeat the Government's assurance that no one will be required to sell his present flat. The Government has no need to force anyone to do so, because after a certain period following the introduction of this new policy, ethnic balance will again be restored and all races will again be adequately represented in the various HDB neighbourhoods. Singapore will be able to retain its present position where the various races continue to live in racial harmony.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Siglap):</b> Sir, I would appreciate it if the Minister could clarify some points. (1) In the event of the HDB having to buy back a flat, can the Minister consider paying the market rate instead of the posted rate, as the latter will always be lower than the former? The posted price can be used when the HDB resells. (2) How will the lessee's difficulty in selling flats be determined, and by whom? (3) Will HDB in tandem with the new policy ensure that facilities, services and goods available in neighbourhoods be similarly dispersed so that it would be easier for everyone? Because one of the reasons for the people's reluctance to live in certain neighbourhoods is the difficulty in having access to facilities, goods and services peculiar to them. Lastly, has the HDB or the Ministry looked into any other methods prior to this?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of whether HDB should buy back at prevailing posted prices or market prices, it is true that the market prices are higher than posted prices in many areas. But the market prices vary, not only from block to block but from flat to flat and it is very difficult to establish what exactly is the market price. In fact, the premiums paid by people are such that in an analysis of the prices of HDB flats, we have not been able to really establish quite clearly a pattern, either by race or by area. There are instances where Chinese pay a premium; there are instances where Malays pay a premium for the same type of flat in the same area. This may be due not only to differences in the internal finishes of flats but people's own assessment as to what they are prepared to pay for something that they want. So if HDB were to try and pay market prices, I do not think it will be able to determine what exactly is the market price. Of course, we may be able to determine a price which is in the ball-park, which will not leave many people satisfied. My own assessment is that while a few may not be able to get exactly the maximum that they expect, they would still be able to get, with these new measures, prices well above the posted prices. At the same time, as I have mentioned in various statements in the past, the HDB itself intends to move its posted prices closer and closer to market prices. So this gap will narrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will difficulty be determined? Well, when an HDB flat owner sells his flat and moves to another flat or to a private apartment or a house, he has a certain period within which he has to sell his flat. If he cannot sell it within that period, that means he has difficulty in selling it and he can sell it back to the HDB. If, as a result of these measures to bring about a better racial mix, a slightly longer period is required, the HDB can consider that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is a good point. If you want to have a better mix of the various ethnic groups in all HDB estates and new towns, then the kind of facilities that will attract the different ethnic groups should also be spread. HDB is aware of it and will take action to ensure that the facilities and services required will be well spread. This will require, of course, that some facilities will have to be put in there early, earlier than necessary, in order to attract an ethnic group into that estate. And that is being considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we have considered any other method, the method that we have followed all along has been in the initial allocation of new flats. We have tried in the past, in the allocation of new flats, to follow some sort of ethnic distribution which will reflect the general population. It was easy to do it in the past when we were building at a very high rate and when the waiting list was very long and when people were prepared to take up flats immediately anywhere. But as we began to meet the demand and the waiting list became shorter, and as more and more flats began to come on to the resale market, it has become difficult to only use initial allocation as a basis to bring about a good mix of the different ethnic groups. And that is why we have now embarked on this new open policy of ensuring that there is a good racial mix in each HDB estate and new town.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have three questions for the Minister. Firstly, with reference to Table 1. He has explained column 2. I would like to seek his explanation or clarification of column 3 where he adds 3% on to column 2. How did he reach this figure of 3%, and will it not actually be fairer to give a range for a block?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Minister has stated that the proposed solution will only contain the problem so that it will not deteriorate. I congratulate the Minister on this because the manner of implementation is not only fair but it also results in minimal disruption. However, will the Minister also consider giving priority to redevelopment in constituencies which are already affected by this problem of ethnic distribution? And will it be possible to do this in the next 3-5 years?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, what criteria will the HDB use to define a sale of last resort?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no mathematical magic in column 3. We tried, in the first instance, to focus on the neighbourhood and gave some allowance to the neighbourhood in comparison with the present application list. And that is how column 2 was determined. For column 3 which is the block limit, we just gave a margin of 3% flat for every group. As to whether we could give a range, we could have. But in a policy like this, it is very important to make it very clear in the implementation that we are absolutely fair to everybody. If we give a range, then that means that the limit will vary from place to place and this can give rise to a lot of suspicion and misunderstanding. We thought it is better to just fix a specific limit and use that for all the ethnic groups in all areas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned that where the existing proportions exceed the limits that we have set out in Table 1, we will allow time and redevelopment to bring about a better mix. So we will certainly give priority in redeveloping areas where the ethnic mix is well beyond what we have set out in the table and use the allocation of the new flats to bring the mix more to the levels that we have set out in the table. This, of course, cannot all be done within a few years but we will be starting on such a programme and I hope that within 3-5 years, the programme will be well under way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the criteria for sale of last resort, I thought that is pretty simple. If you cannot sell, you go to HDB.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Sir, it is not so clear. If the criteria is time span, that means you go to the HDB if you cannot sell it within 2-3 months. Or does a person have to advertise 5 to 10 times before it can be considered?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are already existing time limits for HDB owners to sell their flats or move out of their flats because they upgrade to another HDB flat or move out to a private house or apartment. There is a time limit within which they have to sell their flat. And that time limit will apply. Whether they advertise or use agents, it is entirely up to them. And as I mentioned, if necessary, we can make the time limit a little more flexible for such cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like to ask the Minister how do the measures he announced in his Ministerial statement reconcile with the Government's policy in promoting Geylang Serai, Little India and Chinatown.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, I do not think there is anything to reconcile. These three areas Geylang Serai, Little India and Chinatown are basically centres of commercial activity. They do not necessarily reflect the composition of the races living in these areas. Take Little India for example. Going through Serangoon Road, one would get the impression that 90% of the people who live there are Indians. But that is not so. It is a place where Indians from all over Singapore go to do their shopping. Similarly, Geylang Serai; and similarly with Chinatown. So I do not think there is any contradiction. We will still promote these as commercial and cultural areas for the three main ethnic groups. But where it comes to residences we will apply these proportions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson):</b> Sir, I have two questions for the Minister. I support the policy in principle, that it is good to have a better mix of races in the housing estates. I would like to ask the Minister whether he has any view or opinion as to how this new policy or rule will affect the market price mechanism in the transfer of flats. Because now there is an additional restriction in the transfer of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> flats from the householder to the potential buyer, will this not have a very great dampening effect on the price of a flat that person can get if there is no such restriction?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether there is any control over a person who wants to sell his flat to a relative or a friend under some special arrangement rather than under the market mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I mentioned that the vast majority of transactions in the HDB resale market are among people of the same ethnic group. In other words, the seller and buyer are of the same ethnic group. In fact, that will determine more or less the general price in the market. So I do not anticipate a great dampening effect. But there will be from time to time, specific cases of people who may think that if they are able to sell to a Chinese or Malay they could have got a higher price. I think that is a small price we must be prepared to pay in order to ensure that we do build a cohesive, better integrated society in Singapore. I do not expect a great dampening effect because the resale between different ethnic groups is not the major part of the HDB resale market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to selling to a relative or friend, I have already mentioned that where the transactions are between two persons of the same ethnic group there will be no restrictions at all. So if the relative or friend is of the same ethnic group there should be no problem. And I would assume in the case of relatives, in most cases that would be the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two questions. (1) Is the problem more serious than what is revealed through the figures because of possible differences in the household sizes of various ethnic groups. (2) The proposed measures seem to be preventive in nature. Would the Minister consider any form of incentive to encourage a better mix of ethnic groups in the housing estates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that when I mentioned, for example, that certain HDB housing estates have so
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> many percent Malays, and so many percent Chinese, they do not necessarily reflect that the number of Chinese or Malays are of the same percentage. We all know from the various population figures that we have been given that, for example, Malay households tend to be bigger, Indian households somewhat smaller and the Chinese households tend to be the smallest. We are aware of it. So if you look at it purely in terms of numbers of the various ethnic groups, the number of persons, yes, the racial congregations or groupings are somewhat greater than would be reflected by the number of flats occupied by any ethnic group.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the measures are preventive and we need to consider incentives. And the first incentive, of course, which I have already mentioned, is to create conditions which will attract people to go to areas which they do not go to now. For example, if Malays are not attracted to Pasir Ris, then we ought to do something in Pasir Ris which will attract them there. If Chinese are not prepared to go to Bedok or Woodlands, then we ought to consider how we can attract them to go there. So when it comes to services and facilities, we will try and make it more attractive. If we spread the services and facilities for all the ethnic groups, then I think we will get a better spread of the ethnic groups and a better mix.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for financial incentives, we have not thought of that now. For the moment I think we will try these measures and I am confident that they will work.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether the same intention applies with regard to the allocation of rental flats in the housing estates? I am aware that we are referring now to the sale and resale of flats but what about the rental tenants? Will it be similarly applied to them?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since rental flats are reducing as a proportion of the total number of HDB flats, it is not a serious problem, but we will apply it also to rental flats. Obviously, we will have to apply it to rental flats.

  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the existing priority schemes of various types, resettlement, multi-tier, as well as for community leaders and so on, affect the allocation of new flats. And these proportions will apply. In the allocation of flats, we will have to take into account these proportions.

  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, I just want to say that I also support the new policy. I think it is a good policy, but I have a question for the Minister. I would like to ask whether there is some form of flexibility for special cases. For example, how do you classify a family of a mixed race marriage. For example, the husband may be a Chinese, the wife may be an Indian. Do you classify the family as Indian or Chinese? Let us assume that you follow the husband's race and classify them as Chinese. If the mother-in-law, for example, happens to leave the house upon death to the family and they happen to be in a neighbourhood which is already above the limit for Chinese, then would the HDB say, "No. You must sell it to a non-Chinese family. If not, sell it back to HDB."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will have noted that in grouping the various ethnic groups we use Chinese, Malays, Indians and Others. In the case of Malays, Indians and Others, there is already now an established way of identifying who are such people because we have in the law, for example, in the GRCs, how they should be identified. There will be not many cases which are very specific, very peculiar to that particular person. We do have a special committee in HDB already to look into such cases and flexibility is always exercised. So whether a person wants to call himself Indian or Chinese, and whether the HDB is prepared to accept that can be looked into. But I do not think this will account for the a large number of cases.

   <b>BUILDING CONTROL BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>1.52 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building Control Bill seeks to revise and strengthen the law in respect of building control. This includes:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) enhancing the powers of the Building Authority in relation to regulation of building works and safety of buildings;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) implementing a system of independent checking of structural plans by accredited checkers;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) requiring construction supervision by qualified persons and site supervisors;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) requiring certain tests to be carried out under the supervision of a structural engineer;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) requiring mandatory inspection of buildings at regular intervals by structural engineers; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) providing for enhanced penalties in respect of offences under the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three important new aspects in the Bill which will change the present practice in the building industry. The first concerns the independent checking of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> structural design plans before the commencement of building works. The second new aspect is in bringing the main contractor and clerks-of-works within the ambit of the law. The third new feature of the Bill is the requirement for mandatory structural inspection of buildings at regular intervals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I moved this Bill before the House in March 1988, in the Sixth Parliament, it was resolved that the Bill be committed to a Select Committee so that the building industry and members of the public would be given an opportunity to make representations. This was to ensure that the Bill meets all our requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee received 18 written representations on the Bill from various professional groups, individuals and other groups. These representations made some very pertinent and constructive comments on the Bill. Having studied all the written representations and having heard oral evidence from some representatives, the Select Committee recommended some substantive amendments to the Bill. The proposed amendments and the reasons for these amendments are contained in the Select Committee's Report which was circulated in August 1988 to the House. Before the debate on the Third Reading of the Bill could be heard, Parliament was dissolved and the Bill lapsed. It has therefore become necessary now to present the Bill afresh to Parliament. The new Bill incorporates the recommendations of the Select Committee as well as some further improvements by the Ministry. I will now highlight the key features of the Bill, including the changes to the original Bill as a result of the recommendations by the Select Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the design stage of a building the Bill requires that all structural plans and calculations are checked by an accredited checker who has no professional or financial interests in the project. This checking of plans will be done before they are submitted to the Building Authority for approval. It includes major renovation works, additions and alterations to buildings. This will ensure that all structural plans and calculations are subjected to a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> system of independent checks. It will also prevent a situation where the design of the structures is carried out by an unqualified person, such as a draughtsman under the supervision of an irresponsible engineer, as happened in the case of the Hotel New World. This provision was in the original Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that there is proper supervision of the construction work, the Bill stipulates that the appointment of a qualified person and site supervisor must be done before a permit to carry out construction building works will be issued. It requires all building works to be supervised by a qualified person and under the continual supervision of a site supervisor. The qualified person is required to maintain proper records, site records, test reports and other documents on the site for examination or checking by the Building Authority. He is also to carry out various structural tests during the construction stage. This will help prevent incidents like the Cheng Hong Mansion where lapses during construction by the supervisor resulted in the erection of sub-standard and unsafe concrete structures. This provision again was in the original Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important change to the Bill as compared to the original Bill is that concerning the role and responsibility of the contractor. It was the general view of the various representors to the Select Committee that contractors play a crucial role in ensuring that a building is built safely and constructed in accordance with the approved building plans and building regulations. As such, it is important that contractors be brought under the ambit of the law. The Select Committee agreed with these representations and several clauses in the Bill have been amended to achieve this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new term 'builder' has been inserted in clause 2 of the Bill. The 'builder' as defined, refers to the main contractor who carries out building works for the developer. It excludes sub-contractors. A builder can be a person, a partnership, a company or a body corporate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new clause 11 has been included to spell out the duties of the builder. It requires the builder to build in accordance with the requirements of the building regulations and the approved plans of the building. For example, the builder must ensure that the actual concrete strength achieves the designed value and all reinforcement bars are placed in accordance with the approved building plans. Upon the completion of the building works, the builder has also to certify that the building has been built in accordance with the approved plans. The builder must also inform the Building Authority if he ceases to be the builder and the developer must appoint another builder in place of the first builder, and this second builder will then become responsible under the law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties imposed on the builder for offences under the Bill are similar to those prescribed for the qualified person in respect of analogous offences. Where a convicted builder is a body corporate or partnership, every director or person occupying an executive and managerial position in the organization will be personally guilty, unless he can prove that he has exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Role and Responsibility of Site Supervisors</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Role and responsibility of site supervisors is also an important aspect of the Bill. This provision in the Bill before the House is the same as in the original Bill. The new law will make it mandatory to appoint a full-time site supervisor to supervise the construction of structural works of the buildings. The duties of site supervisors are spelt out in clause 10 of the Bill. Supervisors could either be graduate engineers or clerks-of-works. All clerks-of-works will require to be properly trained and certified to carry out their duties and responsibilities. Today there are not enough certified clerks-of-works. Training is being conducted for supervisors to be certified. Therefore we intend to enforce the requirement of proper qualification of clerks-of-works in three years' time, ie, 1992. This will give enough time
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for CIDB to conduct courses so that all clerks-of-works who are now working in the industry without certification will have an opportunity to attend courses and take the examinations and be certified.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Permits to carry out Building Works</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Select Committee's recommendations, the provision on the permits to carry out building works has been amended in clause 7 of the Bill to require the builder as well as the developer and qualified person to be a joint applicant for the permit. The previous practice was to issue such building permits to the developers only. The new practice will ensure that there is proper and distinct assignment of duties and responsibilities between the qualified person, the developer and the builder.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Periodical Inspection of Buildings</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will require mandatory inspection of buildings at regular intervals by structural engineers, ie, every 10 years for residential buildings and every five years for non-residential or commercial buildings. The original Bill did not explicitly make provisions for structural checking of buildings which are both commercial as well as residential components, like condominiums. Clause 26 has been amended to take this into account. Any residential building which does not have more than 10% of its floor area being used for commercial purposes will be subjected to mandatory inspection every 10 years; in other words, such a building will be construed to be a residential building although there are commercial components in such a building. But the commercial component cannot exceed 10% of the floor area.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Independence of Structural Engineer</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 has also been amended to spell out the duties of the structural engineer carrying out building inspections and the penalty for failing in his duties of inspection. A new clause 29 has been introduced to ensure the independence of the structural engineer appointed to carry out such inspections. It is important that the structural engineer must not have any professional or financial interest in the building to ensure that the performance of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> his duties is fair, impartial and unprejudiced.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Exemption of Government Buildings from the Bill</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 in the original Bill was included to make it clear that Government buildings and building works carried out by Government for its own use are not bound by the provisions of the Act. This clause has been deleted now as it is unnecessary to reiterate what is already provided in section 55 of the Interpretation Act. However, I would like to emphasize that Government buildings will still have to be subject to the structural, health and safety provisions of the Building Control Regulations. For example, on the requirement of independent checking of structural designs, the PWD has instituted a system of internal checking of structural designs. Structural designs undertaken by one division are checked by structural engineers of another division. Designs undertaken by statutory bodies, which are exempted from submission of building plans to the Building Control Division, will have similar internal checking system. The Building Control Division (BCD) will conduct an annual audit on such statutory boards to ensure that the Building Control Regulations are complied with.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Additional Amendments</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the Select Committee Report, some additional amendments were introduced as a result of a review of the draft Building Control Regulations. There will be regulations made under the Act. When we drafted the Regulations, we found that some parts of the Bill had to be amended to make sure that the draft Regulations do not exceed the ambit of the Building Control Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Revocation of Permit to Carry out Building Works</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect public safety during the construction phase, the new sub-clause 7(3) has been inserted to empower the Building Authority to revoke the permit to carry out building works if it is deemed to endanger public safety or to cause damage or adversely affect the structural stability of surrounding buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Powers to Take Samples</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also amended clause 34 to empower the Building Authority to take, without compensation, reasonable samples of building materials for analysis in ascertaining whether there has been a contravention of the Act or of the Building Regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Exclusion of temporary Buildings and Minor Building Works</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause 4 in the Bill has been inserted to specifically exclude temporary buildings and minor building works specified in the Schedule from the requirement of building plan approvals and permits to carry out building works. We would not insist that every type of building work will require submission of building plans and application to commence building works. Minor works can proceed without such a procedure. These minor building works include internal lightweight partitions, stall or shed of lightweight construction, simple awning, low boundary walls, minor replacement works of floor, ceilings, and so on. These are very minor works which do not have a significant impact on the structural integrity of a building.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Need for Immediate Supervision</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires all structural works to be executed under the full-time supervision of a qualified person or the site supervisor. However, for minor building works, there is a need for "immediate supervision" or, in the language of the construction industry, "standing supervision" only for the critical structural works. In other words, for minor building works it is not necessary to have a full-time supervisor for all the works that have to be carried out. It is only necessary for the very significant and critical structural works. Clause 8(1) has therefore been amended to require that critical structural works such as concreting, piling or pre-stressing are carried out under the immediate supervision of a qualified person or a site supervisor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Bill are consequential amendments and amendments of a technical or drafting nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Building Control Regulations</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations will be promulgated to put into effect the new control measures introduced in the Bill. The new Regulations have been drafted and sent to professional bodies for their comments before they are completed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Building Control Bill, together with the new Building Control Regulations, when enacted, would be a very complete and comprehensive piece of legislation to ensure the structural safety of buildings in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Implementation</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building Control Division is ready to implement the Act when it is passed. The BCD has shortlisted more than 60 accredited checkers to whom building plans could be sent for checking. A list of buildings has also been drawn up for maintenance checks over the next two years. Internally, the BCD has built up a strong team of structural engineers to carry out structural checking during design and construction and to conduct structural inspection of buildings. So the delay in the passage of this Bill has given an opportunity to the BCD to prepare itself for immediate implementation of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation to the many people who have contributed to the preparation and drafting of this legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, following the collapse of the Hotel New World and other buildings with problems of structural defects, the general public have become very concerned about the safety of buildings. Dangerous buildings not only threaten the safety of life but also cause the loss of life-long savings of purchasers which would be a very heavy blow to them. The passing of this Bill is very timely as it will ensure the safety of future buildings as well as enhance the confidence of purchasers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill clearly spells out the duties and obligations of the developer, the builder and the professionals respectively and the penalties they may face. The professionals are subjected to double control. Should they commit any offence under the Act, they will be punished under it. Moreover, the Professional Engineers Board and the Board of Architects will also take appropriate disciplinary procedures against them according to the severity of the case. Lighter offences could be suspension of practice for one or two years and heavier offences could even be a life-ban from practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, any errant builder, clerk-of-works and site supervisor would merely be fined a sum of money as penalty. To big builders, a $50,000 fine is a small sum compared with a project costing tens of millions of dollars. To them, such a fine may not have a deterrent effect. If the Building Control Authority would blacklist those habitually errant builders, clerks-of-works and supervisors and suspend them from practice for a definite period under this Bill, I feel this would be more effective than monetary fines and would also ensure the safety of buildings and protect public interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take local concrete buildings for example. The building materials are generally mixed by suppliers before delivery to the building worksite. Besides the correct planning by the structural engineer and the correct execution of work by the builder, the safety of a building depends more importantly on the correct standard and quality of materials. Under the Bill, the responsibility for the right quality and standard of materials rests on the builder while no mention is made of the supplier of materials. Should a supplier be irresponsible and supplies sub-standard or below quality materials, such as a higher water content, wrong timing after adding water, or wrong quantity of cement, and so on, the usual penalty is to reject such materials at the worksite, there being no other more severe penalty. I would like to ask the Minister whether there are other Acts which can effectively be applied to prevent those irresponsible suppliers from such wrongdoings?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out a possibility. When there is a serious shortage of materials, lack of plain water, not enough supply of sand and granite, adventurous and irresponsible suppliers might be tempted to substitute sea water for plain water, sea-sand for granite-sand, whose concrete mixing components might meet the stipulated standard proportions. But because of the corrosive nature of the saline components, the life of a structure would therefore be greatly shortened, and a firm and solid building structure would after a period of time become a dangerous building. We have to take preventive measures against such happenings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Bill to be effective, the independence of the professionals plays a key and fundamental role. At present, in the United States and Japan, there is a popular building construction practice called "turnkey project". The method of operation is for the designer and the builder to join up together to tender for a project from the developer and carry out the designing and construction work. I understand that some local building projects have been completed under this "turnkey project" method. One result of this "turnkey project" operation is that the professional independence of the designer may perhaps diminish gradually under the pressure of his financially powerful partner of the same company. If the Building Control Authority would allow the "turnkey project" system to be put into practice, for the sake of the interest of the public all relevant authorities or organizations should formulate strict regulations to ensure the professional independence of building professionals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the inspection of private apartment builiding every ten years by a qualified structural engineer to ensure the safety of the building. I would like to ask the Minister whether the HDB flats are also required to be inspected once every ten years, if so, by which organization or authority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this motion.
  <br>2.19 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill fulfills a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> very urgent and real need and we in the Workers' Party fully support it. We also applaud the Government for replacing the old law with the new proposed Building Control Act. If this Bill had been enacted earlier, probably it might well have averted the tragedy of the collapse of Hotel New World with loss of so many lives. Now we hear that other than Cheng Hong Mansion there are also quite a number of structural defects in many buildings which have not yet been publicly made known. Because of our limited land area, high-rise buildings are inevitable. And it is very important that public safety must be ensured. After all, we know that many people come along to Singapore, many people stay inside these buildings, many people work inside these buildings including our Ministers nowadays. Therefore, I think their safety is important for all of us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The putting up of high-rise buildings is a very complex process and many people are involved. I am very glad that the Minister has already indicated the responsibility in the various stages that he has just mentioned. At any stage in the construction, the urge to minimize cost and maximize the margin of profits on the part of a developer or contractor is great. Any dereliction of duty or negligence on the part of those responsible for the planning, structural design or construction supervision could lead to the most serious consequences for the safety of the public. And the new provisions for the supervision of the building, mandatory inspection and tests as well as checking in clauses 8 to 12 and 15 to 17 are absolutely essential.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are one or two aspects of the Bill which the Government could well look into, in spite of all the explanations that I have heard, and perhaps further improved on, if not today, at least sometime in the future. Originally, the Bill was supposed to affect only private buildings. I learn from the Minister that PWD and other Government buildings will also be checked. This is imperative because one can never tell when defective work creeps in. Now I also see that the contractor's responsibility has been somewhat defined, though not very clearly. But what about the developer? There are owner developers, as in the case of the Hotel New World, who
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> could cause some trouble as regards safety of high-rise buildings. Therefore, the responsibility of the owner developer has also to be clearly defined and apportioned, if possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point on which I want to stress today and which has already been touched upon a little while ago is that many high-rise buildings cost tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, vast sums of money. And defective works, especially those that involve the key structural elements, could easily affect the safety of the buildings and cause disasters leading to great loss of life and property. These are very serious crimes, unlike ordinary theft or being an illegal immigrant worker or even a bookie or touting. The penalty of a maximum of $50,000 fine is really laughable. It is chicken-feed for people who deal in millions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is proposed that any person who organizes or assists in organizing any assembly or procession a very minor offence can be liable to a fine of $10,000, I see no reason why such a serious crime in construction works should be liable to a fine of only a paltry $50,000. I propose that the fine to be imposed on persons responsible for construction defects in high-rise buildings be increased, at least five- or six-fold plus prison terms, if necessary. A small fine would only encourage defective works.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, I would support the suggestion given in the Select Cmmittee that the penalty be related to the size and value of the project. In this instance, the punishment should be made to fit the crime.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must also stress that the human factor be not overlooked. Those who are responsible for the supervision, checking and testing of construction works in high-rise buildings, to my mind, should be paid adequately. I understand many of them have big complaints that they are not being paid adequatgely. Perhaps the Government could help indicate to those people involved in the construction industry that this matter is intimately related to and connected with the slogan "Safety First" in high-rise buildings.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I also rise in support of this Bill. I have only one or two queries to make. Apparently there is a heavy shortage of site supervisors and the Government is taking steps to train these people. I am just wondering in the past who have been supervising our massive building jobs all this while. No wonder we had the collapse of the Hotel New World!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under a new amendment for minor works as listed in the Schedule, I notice that under paragraph 2 (f) any dog kennel not exceeding an area of 5 square metres need not have a licence. Sir, you will remember that the former Minister for National Development said that he did not trust me even to build a dog kennel! I had to apply for a licence then if I wanted to. But now I need not. So I can just go ahead and build one.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Upgraded.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, on a more serious note, you are aware that I am the Chairman of the Potong Pasir Town Council. I would just like to know what are the liabilities of the town council in relation to this new Act. I notice that under the definition of "occupier", the town council is caught by this definition which says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"occupier", in relation to any building, means the person in occupation of the building or having the charge, management or control thereof, ...' We are in charge. The Potong Pasir Town Council is in charge, it manages and control Potong Pasir Town.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under Miscellaneous, clause 32 says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where an offence under this Act or the building regulations has been committed by a body corporate ... any person who at the time of the commission of the offence was a director, manager, partner, secretary or other similar officer ... purporting to act in any such capacity, shall also be guilty ...' The town council is a body corporate under the Town Councils Act 1988. But as I look at clause 33 which is the next clause, there seems to be a contradiction. It says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No liability shall lie against the Government or any public officer by reason of the fact that any building works are carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Act ...'
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Under the Town Councils Act, officers of the town councils are designated public officers. So are we liable? Perhaps the Minister could clarify.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I want to thank all the Members for supporting this Bill. They made some useful points to which I would like to respond. The first point I want to make, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that while this Bill and the Government bodies involved in implementing the provisions of the Bill have an important role to play, there are other parties involved who must also exercise their own responsibility in order to ensure that our buildings are built safe. Other parties involved are what we call qualified persons, the architects, the engineers, and the professionals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important party involved here is the buyer. The one reason why we have not had as good buildings as we should have is because buyers have not been discriminating. They never ask: who is the builder, who is the architect, who is the developer? During the boom years people were just interested in putting a deposit to book a flat or an office space in the hope that they could turn around in three or six months and sell it for more than what they paid for it. This is the reason why during the boom years many buildings were built, I would say, not structurally unsafe, they are structurally sound but with many defects which caused complaints from occupants as well as subsequent buyers. So all parties must play their role.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will ensure that the plans are properly drawn up, the building is properly constructed and the people who build it will be responsible and that the building after it is built is maintained by regular periodic inspection; in the case of commercial buildings every five years, and in the case of non-commercial buildings, residential buildings, every 10 years. But I must emphasize that buyers must exercise their part of the responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of points have been made that the penalties under the Act are not sufficiently harsh. The penalties for poor construction which result in danger or damage to the structure of a building can be attributed to the qualified person, that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is the architect or engineer, the builder or the developer in most cases, either the qualified person or the builder. The penalties stipulated in the Act, $50,000, $10,000 and so on, basically apply to actions that they have taken which do not comply with the Act. It does not necessarily mean that such non-compliance will immediately result in a danger to the structural safety of a building. But we must enforce the procedures and make people take these procedures seriously, which is why we have those provisions. But if a structure collapses because of criminal negligence on the part of any of the parties involved, there are of course other recourses, and I think the Member for Potong Pasir knows this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a qualified person,the architect or engineer, he is liable not just during the period of construction and until the construction is completed. He is liable virtually for life, as long as he is practising. And if we can prove that he was criminally negligent in the manner in which he carried out his responsibility, then the professional body concerned will be able to strike him off. In other words, he will not be able to practise his profession anymore. And that is a very serious deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a builder and developer it is a little more difficult to take up the suggestion that they should be barred from further participation in the industry. Because these are corporations. They are not natural persons, not individuals, and they can always close down one firm and start another. But what we ought to do and I will ask the CIDB to do this is to ask for particulars of directors and key officials of all developers and make this available publicly. Then when a particular developer has carried out works which result in, say, a poor structure or a structure that is a danger to the occupants or to those living around that building, then we ought to publicize those involved by name, so that even if they turn up under the guise of another company, people will know who are those involved in the operation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point was made that turn-key projects will undermine the independence of the professionals. We do not have many turn-key projects. In fact, in Singapore the practice is still to separate the developer,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> builder and the professionals. But there are, as Dr Lee has pointed out, developers who are also builders. And I would agree entirely that we ought to be specially careful about such developers. In fact, in the case of residential buildings, developers have to get permission to sell their buildings to the public. They have to obtain a special licence to do so. My own approach would be that where the developer is also a builder we would not allow him to sell until the whole building is completed, so that the buyer can see what he is buying. This will, of course, cut down the extent to which the developer-builder, because he plays both roles, compromises standards as well as quality.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in countries which practise the system of turn-key projects, like Japan, they have been able to maintain standards both of finishes as well as of structural safety. I would not rule out the emergence of this type of activity in Singapore where a developer wants to have a building constructed and he does not want to employ an architect. He may employ a firm to do a turn-key project and the firm would design the building, build the building according to the developers requirements. I would not rule out such an approach because countries which do have this approach seem to have enough regulations to ensure that safety and quality are not compromised. But it is still not the major practice in Singapore and, if my understanding is correct, the professional has to be quite separate from the builder.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point was made that such turn-key building should be regularly inspected. As I mentioned, under the law, all buildings regardless of how they are built by a developer-builder or turn-key or any other method will have to be regularly inspected, and in the case of residential buildings, once in 10 years. The only buildings that are exempted are terrace houses, bungalows and other similar single storey structures. But even a single storey structure like a commercial building, a warehouse, will have to be inspected every five years. So there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that buildings are regularly inspected and the inspection procedure is such that if there is anything wrong with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the building and it becomes apparent that structures are cracking, then the Building Authority can take action.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said what I said about penalties, I am certainly prepared to look further into this. As Dr Lee has suggested, perhaps we should increase the penalty to make it proportionate to the size of the job. Well, that is one way of doing it. This can be considered in future.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question regarding Town Councils. I think there is a misunderstanding. I will have to get, of course, legal opinion on this. But the town council is not the occupier. The town council carries out work as an agent to maintain the buildings. It is not an occupier. The occupier is one who rents and occupies the building. So we differentiate between the owner and the occupier. That is why the whole Bill covers owners and occupiers in the sense that someone who is in occupation of a building, if he discovers something is wrong and he asks the owner to do it, and if the owner does not, he can do it and charge the owner. Or if the owner can show that he was not aware that the occupier was doing things although he had exercised due diligence, then he will be free from liability. It is that kind of situation that is envisaged under the Bill. But if the town council rents a building from the HDB for its own offices, then it is an occupier of that building. But it is not an occupier of the estate as a whole. It is just merely an agent carrying out the function of maintaining and making sure that the place is clean, the rubbish is collected, the place is painted periodically and so on. It is not an occupier under the terms of this Act. If it is not clear, I am prepared to make it clear. That is certainly not the intention. A town council is only an occupier under the terms of the Act if it happens to rent the place. The town council is not an occupier of the other areas. Regarding Sections 32 and 33, as far as the town councils are concerned, in their function as an agent to maintain the estate, this Bill does not cover them. But if somebody in the town, a flat owner, wants to make amendments to his flat, say, he wants to knock down a wall or do something, it is not the town council that has to deal with that. It is the owner, the HDB, the lessor, which will have to deal with that matter because HDB is the lessor of the building. I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hope that point is clear. If he wants an assurance that the town council is not covered within the ambit of the Act in the sense that he means, I am prepared to give that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I rise to get further clarifications. Sir, perhaps what the Minister has said is the intention of his Ministry. But unfortunately, in this legislation the words do not preclude the town council, because it is very clear. If you interpret the ordinary meaning of this definition section of "occupier", the town council would be caught. "Occupier" in relation to any building means the person in occupation of the building or having the charge, management or control thereof. We are caught. Sir, I do not know. Maybe it needs an amendment to that effect, or an additional section to say that town councils are precluded from this Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think such an amendment is needed. I think you have got to read the Act and take these words in the context of the Act. I do not see how a town council can be considered to be the occupier or in control of the area in the sense that a tenant is. Just because we use the term that the town councils manage an estate, it does not mean that it has this meaning. I do not think so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> How do you interpret laws? It is the ordinary and general meaning of the words.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Yes, within the context of the law. Here, it must be within the context of this particular law. I am not a lawyer and I am sure that well, my colleague is not here but there are other Members here who can bear me out. But because we use the term that town councils manage an estate, it does not mean that they are managers in the sense that is meant here. They are not occupiers either. But I can give you this assurance that town councils are not involved in this Bill. But if the town council rents premises from the HDB, then of course that is a different position.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

   <b>MINOR OFFENCES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>2.45 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Minor Offences Act mainly to deal with the problem of touting. The opportunity is taken also to amend certain provisions concerning noise pollution, assemblies and processions and to revise the penalties prescribed for the offences covered by the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of touting has existed in Singapore for many years. It is not a new problem. However, it has recently escalated and become a serious problem especially in areas frequented by tourists, such as along Orchard Road. The main reason for this upsurge is due to the sale of counterfeit goods by some shopkeepers. These shopkeepers employ touts to solicit and importune tourists to buy their goods. To counter this problem, Police has been conducting regular enforcement actions against touts. From July to December 1988, 157 touts were arrested and charged in court. For the month of January 1989, 76 persons have been arrested and charged in court. Those arrested have been dealt with under the existing provisions of the law. Presently, the Minor Offences Act defines the offence of touting only in relation to activities connected with the court and government departments. Touting, unconnected with such public offices, is not an offence at present. Those arrested can only be charged under the Penal Code for causing a public nuisance for which the maximum penalty is only a fine of $200. Our experience has shown clearly that existing laws are inadequate in controlling the problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the profits from the sale of counterfeit goods are high, such small fines as $200 under the Penal Code obviously can-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> not act as effective deterrents. In fact, touts are becoming bolder, more brazen and even openly resorting to lawlessness. Sir, I have here a collection of letters that were written by tourists and Singaporeans to complain against the activities of touts. I would like, with your permission, just to read some extracts from three of these letters to put into proper perspective this problem of touting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first letter is from a Swiss tourist to Singapore. It starts off by saying that he was very impressed with the friendliness, efficiency and the economic development in Singapore. Then he went on, and here I quote, Sir:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'From the tourist point of view, there is however a black spot which may eventually impair your country still excellent reputation.' He then went on to describe his encounters with touts. And here I quote again:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It was even sometimes difficult to keep these gangs at bay as we were almost physically assaulted by them.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second letter came from an English tourist. This was addressed to the Minister of Tourism Government of Singapore. And here I quote, Sir:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'However, I believe I have a valid criticism to put forward. My bride and myself [the tourist was here on his honeymoon] enjoyed our 7 days in Singapore. It was spoilt every time we ventured out in and around Orchard Road to be accosted every 20 yards by a young gentleman saying, "Do you want a copy watch?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I wish to quote an extract from a letter written by a Singaporean who had a close encounter of a "tout" kind. This young Singaporean had brought some Japanese business friends to a popular food centre. And I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We encountered imitation watch touts. Two of them harassed my friend and me. And when I told my friend not to buy from them, they threatened to beat me and threw cigarette butts at me.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more recently the Police arrested three touts for causing a public nuisance. They were charged in court and convicted. After their conviction, on the way out of the court house, they chased a press photographer around the premises of the Subordinate Courts. They intimidated the press photographer wanting to get hold of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the roll of film. The press photographer had taken some pictures of these touts. Of course, these three touts were promptly rearrested by the Police and they were charged for criminal intimidation. They were found guilty and fined $2,000 each. Despite the fine, one of them resumed his touting activity the very same day. Sir, these examples show that touts have no respect for the law and are totally unrepentant about their unlawful activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that we must take action against the touts? Why not just let them be? The answer lies in the kind of letters that the Tourist Promotion Board and Police have been receiving from tourists and from Singaporeans. Touts give Singapore a bad name. And if the problem is not checked, tourists will eventually avoid Singapore. Secondly, even Singaporeans find them a nuisance, not only Singaporeans who are accompanying foreign visitors. Many of our Singapore Indians walking along Orchard Road have been mistaken to be well-heeled tourists from Delhi and are accosted by touts; similarly, Chinese and Malay Singaporeans who have the slightest resemblance to tourists are fair targets for harassment by the touts. Thirdly, their tactics are a clear breach of the law, not only because they sell counterfeit goods but in their persistent harassing, including physical manhandling of pedestrians and shoppers. Fourthly, their tactics put nearby law-abiding shopkeepers who are conducting their business properly in a serious disadvantage - tourists who might have been customers of these law-abiding shopkeepers are scared off by the aggressive, abusive and almost threatening tactics used by the touts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to make touting in any public road, public place or place of public resort an offence. More deterrent penalties are also needed for Police to act effectively against the touts. With this amendment, the penalties for offenders will be brought up to a fine ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to six months or both fine and imprisonment. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction, the offence will carry a fine ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 or imprisonment which may extend to one year or both fine and imprisonment. Sir, I believe
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that these penalties will make persons involved in touting stop their activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the provisions relating to noise pollution. The provisions in the Minor Offences Act are outdated for today's circumstances. They are also inadequate to deter people from making excessive noise. I need not elaborate on the problem of noise pollution as Members have raised the issue in Parliament on a number of occasions in the past. Most of us, as Members of Parliament, have at one time or another been asked by our constituents to intervene in cases of noise nuisance caused by inconsiderate people in the HDB estates. This Bill therefore seeks to enhance the penalty for noise pollution to a fine of up to $1,000 and to allow victims of such nuisance to complain directly to a Magistrate's Court about noise nuisance. The Bill also empowers the Magistrate to issue an Order against the person responsible for the nuisance. Such Order will require the offender to abate the nuisance or prohibit him from repeating the offence. Any contravention of the Order will result in a fine of up to $2,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the amendments relating to provisions covering assemblies and processions. Let me stress that most (nearly all) of these provisions can be found in the existing Act. Police have to regulate assemblies and processions because we live in a densely populated country. Our streets are crowded with people and vehicular traffic. Regulation is solely to ensure that public order is maintained and to prevent congestion and annoyance caused by assemblies and processions held by all kinds of groups and organizations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1986 there were only seven illegal processions. In 1987 the number rose to 16 illegal processions. And last year 1988, there were 32 illegal processions. This situation cannot be allowed to deteriorate further. Under the existing Act, only the organizers or those assisting in any illegal assembly or procession are liable for prosecution. This Bill only enhances the penalties for those who organize any illegal assembly or procession. It also pro-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> vides for a new offence for those who knowingly participate in such illegal assemblies or processions. Participants will now also be liable to prosecution. The enhanced penalties and new provision are necessary to curb the increase in illegal assemblies and processions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also seeks to raise the penalties for all offences in the Act. Most of the penalties which range from $20 to $2,000 have not been revised for more than a quarter century. It is necessary to revise these penalties upward to ensure that they continue to deter would-be offenders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to update certain obsolete terms and repealed some obsolete provisions in the existing Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, the short title of the Act will be changed to the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Eunos GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill and welcome the amendment to provide the enforcement authorities with more teeth in dealing with the touting problem which, if not checked, will certainly mar the international reputation of Singapore as a popular tourist destination.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the statistics just disclosed by the Hon. Senior Minister of State may not appear to be alarming, the trend is obvious. Because of the inadequacy of existing penalties, touting in public places is now a growing menace and that an increasing number of touts are those with secret society connections. It is thus appropriate for stiffer penalties to be introduced to arrest this problem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note the proposed amendments, inter alia, spell out more specifically of what could constitute to be "minor offences" and "public places" and also give wider powers to the enforcement agencies. As such, some clarifications are needed as I foresee the proposed measures will cause anxiety to those in the sales industry who fear that their rice bowl may be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Hon. Senior Minister of State the following questions:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether activities conducted by sales promoters and sales personnel in authorized public places (for example, departmental stores) are considered as touting since it involves approaching members of the public in order to solicit sales of their company's products?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) whether door-to-door salesmen, some of whom adopt what may be regarded as aggressive sales tactics, will not be allowed to engage in this trade with the passage of the Bill; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) whether the enhanced enforcement measures incorporated in the Bill are sufficient to tackle the touting menace, in that it will effectively curb the number of repeat offenders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I once again support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much publicity has been given to offences of touting in the press. And the Minister has taken almost a full speech to tell us what a serious offence touting is. He even brought up letters from tourists to buttress his arguments. Let me say that all these are red herrings. He wants to turn us into a fish market so that we can see only red herrings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touting is a comparatively unimportant and minor offence. There are other provisions which he just glossed over, provisions which the Government has intended to smuggle in together with other offences. These provisions are of an entirely different nature. They are political and have to be read together with the recent amendments to the ISA and to the Constitution which have been passed by the House and also with the proposed Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill yet to be passed. All these amendments, Sir, together form a general tightening of control of dissenting views and of the Opposition. It would appear that the new style of government of the PAP is but a refurbished version of the old style, a mere instance of putting new wine into old bottles. Big brother here wants tighter and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> more absolute control in this more and more brazen police state of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill fly in the face of the provisions in Part IV of the Constitution. Article 14(1)(b) of the Constitution states:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'all citizens ... have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms;' This is a constitutional right. Article 14(2)(b) states that this right can only be taken away if such assembly threatens the security of Singapore. The Bill now before the House, however, proposes to give blanket powers to the Government to restrain the exercise of that constitutional right by the people, a right given to them by Article 14 of the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill gives the Minister power to prohibit any assembly or procession. Therefore, Parliament is now being asked to enact a law which conflicts with specific provisions of the Constitution. Again, under section 5 of the present Act, it is the police who make rules to regulate and prohibit assemblies or processions. The present Bill proposes to give this power to the Minister. Why? Under the old Act, powers were given to the police so that they would only exercise it, if necessary, for the purpose of facilitating traffic flow, ensuring no obstruction or annoyance to other people. Now the Minister is being charged with this function. Why? Is the Minister going to look into matters which are essentially matters for the police just free flow of traffic, obstruction, etc? Has the Minister not got enough work to do that he should take on what are essentially police functions?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason, Sir, for these provisions is not because they are outdated as stated by the Minister. The reason, to us, is quite obvious. The proposed amendments are directed against political opposition and others who may wish to show their disagreement with Government policies by the holding of peaceful demonstrations and assemblies. The law that was meant to regulate traffic and to prevent obstruction on the road is now being used blatantly for political purposes, to control not traffic but political opposition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote an example, I understand from the Secretary-General of the Workers'
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Party that every application of the party for a licence under the Public Entertainments Licensing Act to hold a rally has been sent to the Minister for a decision, when under the Act, the decision should be made by a civil servant. The power now given for the purpose of regulating meetings is being misused by the Government for the harassment and oppression of political parties that are in the Opposition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance, Sir, three members of the Workers' Party were arrested outside the Istana at the end of May 1987 for peacefully demonstrating against the arrest of detainees. They were arrested, roughly handled and kept in the police station for six hours before they were released. And then they were charged with promoting an unlawful assembly. The members were however acquitted when the court saw on the evidence that there were only three members and the law requires five members before it can become an unlawful assembly. The law was used in that case quite purposely to harass and even to intimidate the opposition party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the real reasons for the transference of power from the police to the Minister? Is it that the Commissioner of Police has refused to allow himself to be used as an instrument of oppression against political parties and others who may wish to protest peacefully against Government decisions? In Singapore, the police are under the Government Ministers whereas in other countries that practise parliamentary democracy, the police act independently under the powers given to them by the law. I would remind the House of what the British Prime Minister said not so very long ago. She said that it would be a sad day for the whole of Britain if the government were to give orders to the police.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have sad days and sad days. The PAP calls this political stability. What an irony of the use of words. In Britain, for a long time, the police act quite independently of the government under the powers given to them by the law. And they are unanswerable in court for wrongful exercise of their powers. But Singapore has long been a police state, although they may want to deny it, with the Government
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> misusing the police as an instrument of oppression against critics, political opponents and other people. Such is political stability in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look at clause 11, Sir. After this Bill becomes law, in spite of the explanation given by the Minister, any police officer however junior he may be can enter into the house of any of our people on the ground that someone had complained to him that some noise or other in the house has caused a nuisance. So if an occupier of a house plays, for example, the Workers' Party's song, "Make It Right for Singapore", and either a Minister or a PAP sympathizer should hear the song and complains to a policeman that the song is annoying him, the policeman can enter the house and remove the cassette player and the tape. Is this not evidence of a police state in Singapore? Why is the Government doing all this? Is the Government really so frightened of the people that it must terrorize them by giving these powers to the police force?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the inordinately gross increase in the fines provided. The Minister has said that he has changed the name of the Bill. Anyway, it is a misnomer. It is not a Minor Offences Bill. It is a major offences Bill as far as I can see! Under section 5 of the present law, the fine is just $200. The proposed Bill increases it to $5,000 and $10,000 whereas builders who cause the death of many many people are fined only $50,000. And any person who organizes or assists in any assembly is fined $5,000 and $10,000. It is 25-50 times the original sum. This is not updating. Updating means at the most twice the sum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the Government doing all this I must ask? Why is the Government so afraid of the people, in spite of all the powers that they have in their hands? They can arrest people any time they like, put them in chinks and forget about them, for 22 years. We would like to get a very clear answer from the Prime Minister since he is here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the Government have to use threats instead of persuasion to rule in Singapore? Is it also intended to disqualify Opposition leaders as election candidates or MPs if they should infringe any of the
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br> regulations in the what is the name of the new Bill? It is not the Minor Offences Bill any more.

And the day may not be that distant when the same will happen in Singapore. Therefore, Sir, if the Government really want to tell us that they are only putting in a Bill for touting, we ask them to tell that to the marines.

  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touting in the sale of counterfeit goods used to be a very popular occupation. Right in the centre of the Orchard Road tourist belt, as mentioned by the Minister just now, many touts used to brandish their copy goods, copy watches, copy bags, and copy T-shirts for sale by the side walks, in hotel lobbies and at shopping centres. They will harass the tourists and jostle them to buy some of the fake products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ever since the First Reading of this Minor Offences Bill in Parliament on 19th January 1989, touting has dropped substantially. I have checked with members of the Singapore Retail Merchant Association and was told that touting activities in places like Lucky Plaza, Far East Plaza and C.K. Tang have dropped by more than 50%. Perhaps if the NCMP were to take a walk along Orchard Road today and dress himself as a tourist, he will be less accosted by touts and will agree that the added fine of $5,000 is certainly a bigger deterrent to touts than the original fine of $200. It shows that the tough action by the Government as specified in clauses 17 and 18 of this Bill is effective and will be effective in curtailing illegal activities in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to reduce touting and sales of counterfeit goods to a minimum, I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hope the Government will also amend the Trademarks Act as the current penalties under this Act are insufficient to deter countfeiters from faking branded products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. In particular, I would like to speak briefly on Part VI of the Bill, ie, touting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touting has been going on in Singapore for a long time. The so-called pimps who prey on the tourists are touts of the worst kind. I think most of them are gangsters. Enhancing the fines and jail sentences for touting is most welcome. Unscrupulous touts do not take no for an answer from the tourists. They are so persistent that some of them go to the extreme of being abusive to the tourists. If touting in the tourist belt, especially along the Orchard Road shopping complexes, is not eradicated, Singapore's image as a shopping paradise will surely be badly tarnished. The touts often harass the tourists into buying from them counterfeit watches and other imitation goods. They will try every trick to fleece the unwary tourists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a great part of our earnings is derived from tourism and many people in Singapore are depending on the industry for their livelihood. We must not let the touts or any others to undermine the STPB's efforts to attract more tourists into our country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some days ago it was reported in the New Paper that touting has now spread to Changi Airport but in a different form. Sir, the illegal touting activities pose a threat to the security and safety of aircraft and passengers. Changi Airport with a reputation of being the best airport in the world must not allow the presence of touts within its premises. Hence the passing of this Amendment Bill is timely to deter the touts from pursuing their illegal activities. I hope more police enforcement action will be taken against these touts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I would have supported this Bill if it had been two separate Bills.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the problem is touting, there should be a different Bill. Perhaps if we can call it the Anti-Touting Bill, I would support it all the way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has seen beggars on the streets which are not very flattering of Singapore. They have been removed and it is a good thing. At this stage, the problem is touting. I am all for removing the touts from our streets. Sir, of course, we want more tourists to come because tourism is a big foreign exchange earner for Singapore. So not only the authorities should make Singapore a most welcome place for our visitors but I think every citizen has a role to play. In fact, in certain countries private citizens welcome visitors to their homes. I hope the Singapore people will start such a precedent, inviting visitors to their homes to see our Asian way of life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to increase the penalties for offences of so-called unlawful assemblies and processions, I think we in the Opposition are very apprehensive. How do you define an assembly, and how do you define a procession? Sir, I have personal experience of this. Whenever we have a function in our Constituency, whether it is a variety show or whether it is a dinner or any social function, sometimes we get a spontaneous support from the ground in the form of "kompang" groups. They say, "We will welcome you". They start at 50 metres from the point of assembly to welcome you. Strictly, in law, it can be defined as a procession to welcome an MP towards the place where they are having dinner or whether they are having some kind of a variety show. So do we need to get a licence for this kind of a function? Or even in a big field, in a stadium, sometimes we get welcoming groups at the entrance to lead us in. Technically it is an assembly. If the authorities want to be nasty they could arrest us and put us in the police station for questioning, and detain us there for two to three hours, and at the end of the day they will say, "All right, we will let you off." But the damage has already been done.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Well, I am speaking from experience. Unfortunately you were not at the receiving end.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, like the previous Bill, I would say that there should be a schedule to exempt certain types of so-called assemblies from this Act. For example, at a dinner or a social function, where the main guest is received 20 yards away from the main function, it should not be necessary for them to get a permit for that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again, I think the penalties are really too harsh. The Government knows that and so they quietly change the name from the Minor Offences Act to a different name. Because once you slap a fine of $2,000 and above, it is no longer a minor offence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am all for order, especially we in Singapore are living in a crowded place. In fact, in Japan one of the objects of the education system is to teach their citizens to live in crowded places. They always have to think of their neighbours. I have had two Japanese families who were my neighbours, and I can verify that. They were most considerate. I do not know whether it was out of thrift or out of consideration for their neighbours but I notice that their air-conditioning unit which was close to our premises was always switched off at an early hour. It could be in consideration of their neighbours.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think Singaporeans should be taught to be aware that there are neighbours, people around them. They must be constantly made aware of that fact. Therefore, I am all for reducing noise. Especially in private estates where one prevalent noise nuisance is from uncontrolled dogs. They bark at every movement. Therefore, if the section on assembly were to be removed from the Bill, I would support all the provisions in respect of anti-touting. But in respect of assembly and in respect of procession, I think we in the Opposition are certainly very apprehensive. Therefore, regrettably, Sir, I am unable to support this Bill.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, I rise to support this amendment and I want to speak particularly on one or two points with regard to touting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From feedback and personal observations, touting along the shopping belt has become, first, a public nuisance. Whether you are a tourist or Singaporean, such pesterings by touts are very disturbing to your otherwise pleasant walk. Second, touting has become a danger to personal safety. Touts are usually well organized and as an individual there is no way you can fight them on your own. Shopping should be free from fears of such dangers. The third point is that touting has a negative aspect to the tourist trade. I have always reminded myself and I think I want to remind Singaporeans as well that we do not have exotic beaches and undulating and pleasant countryside that can attract tourists. Shopping is one of the main attractions. Shopping is an artificial yet fragile creation of our economic imagination. We have done well in the tourist trade and it took us years to build up to this lucrative stage. It would only take us a short time to destroy it. Touting is one element which can destroy it. I am convinced that this amendment is a wise move in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill. Sir, there are three main aspects to this Bill. Firstly, touting; secondly, assembly and, thirdly, that of noise pollution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about touting and the figures just go to show how important it is that we maintain Singapore as a safe tourist destination. Tourism contributes about 15% to our gross domestic product. That goes to say a lot.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to the right of assembly. Much has been said about this. The Senior Minister of State has given us statistics to show the seriousness of the problem arising from seven in 1986, to 16 in 1987 and to 22 in 1988. What is important for us to realize is the tential for mus to realize is the potential for mischief in an assembly. So it is perfectly correct that the Minister should be vested with this authority. No one is prevented from having assemblies. All he needs to do is to apply for a permit and it will be duly processed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would next like to turn to the problem of noise pollution. Sir, in a densely populated country like Singapore, it is important that we learn to live considerately. Noise pollution is now becoming an increasing nuisance. Inconsiderate noise, whether from expensive hi-fi sets or construction sites, is equally disturbing. It affects our children's study and, of course, rest for all of us. Section 13(b) now provides for an additional recourse for the person who is suffering from noise nuisance. He can take out a Magistrate's Court order to make sure that he does not have to repeatedly suffer this offence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to ask some questions of the Minister? These statistics have been repeated by the Member for Fengshan. I believe he says that there were seven illegal processions in 1986, in 1987 there were 16, and in 1988 there were 22. I want to know from the Minister how many permits for procession or assembly had been applied during these three years. He has given us arbitrary figures of seven, 16, 22. But we actually want to know the percentage out of the total number of applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must, first of all, thank all the Members who rose in support, unqualified support, of this Bill. Some of them have raised questions. I will try to answer these questions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli asked whether the Bill will affect sales promoters in department stores and door-to-door salesmen. It is not the intention of this amendment to act against door-to-door salesmen or in-store promoters. The offence of touting only relates to soliciting in a public road, public place or place of public resort, as spelt out in the Act. It would not affect legitimate bona fide businessman or salesman carrying out his business in his own private premises, making sales approaches to his customers in his premises. It will certainly not affect promoters in department stores. Will it affect door-to-door salesmen? It is also not the intention to deal with door-to-door salesmen. Because in most instances if a householder feels that a door-to-door
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> salesman is getting too aggressive, he can easily close the door and therein the matter ends. But, of course, if you come across one of those cartoon strip-type of salesman who is indeed very nasty and persistent and is carrying out his activities on a public road, then the law can be applied. But I should say that this will be very rare.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli also asked whether enhanced penalties are sufficient. I think, to a large extent, Dr Wong Kwei Cheong has provided the answer in the sense that since the Bill was first read in Parliament on the 19th January and publicized the following day, there has been a significant decline in the number of touting incidents along Orchard Road, in particular. Police have told me that between 1st and the 19th January, there were 80 touts arrested. But from 20th January to 7th February, that is after the Bill was first read in Parliament and then publicized, the number dropped to 10 only. So it would seem that this enhanced penalty has a deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wong asked whether Government will amend the Trade Marks Act to deter vendors of counterfeit goods. In my reply to his question for oral answer, I assured him that this matter is indeed being looked into. The Ministry of Law is indeed looking into amending the Trade Marks Act to enhance the penalty for people who sell counterfeit goods or make these counterfeit goods.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the Non-Constituency Member, Dr Lee Siew-Choh. I am afraid Dr Lee Siew-Choh has spent the better part of his speech touting counterfeit ideas. And indeed if he is not careful about his practice of touting such counterfeit ideas, he may well end up facing heavier penalties out there on the street, instead of in this Chamber. Why is he touting counterfeit ideas? He says that the Government is trying to smuggle in provisions to restrict, to suppress Opposition political parties. I have already said in my Second Reading speech that nearly all the provisions in this amendment Bill concerning assemblies and provisions are not new. They are all in the existing Minor Offences Act. The only new provision is the creation of an offence for people who knowingly participate in an
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> illegal assembly or procession. So there is no question of trying to smuggle in something under the guise of taking action against touts. It is merely to update the provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that this Bill is against the Constitution, citing Article 14 of the Constitution - the rights of Singaporeans to participate in an assembly. I think Dr Lee is being unfair to Members of this House. He has not read out the entire Article 14 for the Members of this House. He did say, yes, restriction only for matters of national security. But if he had only read further down the particular Article, he would have discovered what I have said in my Second Reading speech as the reason for acting against organizers and participants of illegal assemblies and processions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to refer Members to Article 14 of the Constitution. Article 14(1)(b) says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms;' But Article 14(2)(a) says very clearly, unambiguously:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(2) Parliament may by law impose
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) on the rights conferred by paragraph (a) of clause (1), such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament ...'.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Constitution has clearly stated that Parliament may impose restriction on this right to assemble taking into account the necessity to maintain public order. So where is this contradiction with the Constitution? I think Dr Lee should apologize for saying that the Government is trying to enact a law which is unconstitutional. It is clearly not the case.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he went on to say that under the existing Minor Offences Act, the Police have the power to make rules and regulations regarding assemblies and processions, and now the power is given to the Minister and there is a political intention behind it. It is another example of how he is trying to mislead Members in this House. Because if he reads the appropriate section of the existing Minor Offences Act, he would have seen very clearly that Part II
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> governing general rules for assemblies and processions states very clearly, Sir, and I quote section 5(1):
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Commissioner of Police may, subject to the approval of the Minister, make general rules ... [governing assemblies and processions]' The Commissioner of Police does not make rules in isolation, on his own. He does not have the absolute discretion that Dr Lee is talking about. All along, since this Act was enacted more than 30 years ago, the Minister has the power to make rules. It was only delegated to the Commissioner of Police to make the rules with the approval of the Minister. So there is no additional powers being given to the Minister and there are no additional powers being smuggled into our legal system under the guise of acting against touts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave another example of Singapore as a police state by saying that with the amendment, any police officer, including a junior police officer, can enter into premises to remove equipment causing noise nuisance. I would like to ask Dr Lee whether he has read the existing Minor Offences Act. Because this is nothing new. It has been all along in the Minor Offences Act that any police officer has this power; nothing new. We are not giving the police any more powers than they already have under the current Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Lee and Mr Chiam have said that the penalties are too harsh. Penalties have been arrived at with the idea of trying to deter would-be offenders. You must have penalties that are sufficiently severe to deter people. You look at the numbers of illegal processions that had been carried out in the last three years. Obviously, existing penalties are inadequate. So we have to revise these penalties. Penalties are fixed to deter offenders. You cannot just fix penalties on the basis of cost of living and adjust it accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to clarify my question. I am not talking about reduction of the value of money. You have quoted us certain figures and I want to know what is the percentage of the actual applications. It may be only 2% or even 0.1%. So where is the nuisance? There is hardly any nuisance at all. You
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cannot give an arbitrary figure of just 22 out of nowhere. You must have a comparison, isn't it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have given the House the number of illegal processions. There had been a lot of other processions or assemblies including rallies, some of which were organized by the Member for Potong Pasir's political party. All these would have been approved. What is the percentage, I do not have the figures on the number of approval in the last three years. But let me say, Sir, that it is not important what this percentage is today. What is important is that any illegal assembly or procession results in unnecessary congestion, annoyance and disruption to the life of the community. Is the Member for Potong Pasir suggesting that we do nothing about the penalties, We do nothing about these rules and wait until a situation where our roads are completely choked and the normal community life cannot proceed as a result of all these illegal assemblies and processions before we do anything? I do not subscribe to that idea. I think we have to act before the situation deteriorates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I be allowed to clarify?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you sit down, please. The Minister is not giving way.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I would like to take up this point made by both Dr Lee and Mr Chiam. Why do you want to regulate assemblies and processions? Mr Chiam says that there is no harm done. A spontaneous procession was organized to welcome him. A kompang group arrived from some distant place by a lorry spontaneously to welcome him and lead him in a procession of 40-50 metres. If it is a procession, it is a procession. Whether it is spontaneous or planned in advance is irrelevant. All the law requires is that if you want to have a procession, put in an application. The police will consider. If indeed your procession is going to be 50 metres into a stadium entrance and is not going to result in any inconvenience or annoyance to the public, the police can consider. All it requires is that you apply. Is that so onerous?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition political parties have held many processions, rallies and forums with the approval of the police. And at some of these forums and rallies, speakers have spoken up in strong criticism against the Government, sometimes using rather vitriolic language. This has not stopped the police from approving such applications. The Member says that this is a measure to suppress Opposition political activities. But let me remind Members of this House that these rules on assemblies and processions are applied equally to both Government MPs and also Opposition MPs. There have been cases in the past where organizations supported by the PAP MPs have applied for permits to hold processions and these applications have been rejected. If the Member for Potong Pasir doubts my word, he has only to consult Mr Chandra Das, the Member for Cheng San GRC. Mr Das can tell him his experience of having had some of his applications rejected. If Mr Chiam still has any doubts, he may want to consult Dr Richard Hu, the Minister for Finance. He also has had experience when some applications of his grassroots organizations were rejected. So there is nothing in the Bill which says that the police will only grant permits to Government MPs. They are all treated fairly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rules that they have formulated, may I remind the Member that these rules were formulated since the 1960s. They will use these rules to assess the merits of the application. And if it complies with the police requirements, permits can be given.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, I would say that this Bill, despite what Dr Lee has said, is directed at this problem of touting. The other changes are updating changes and there are no new powers given to the Minister or to the Government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Sir, may I point out to the Minister the misinformation he has given to the House? He says that there is nothing new in the provisions. I just want to remind him, in clause 6, what was previously written down as "Commissioner of Police and the Deputy Commissioner of Police", the word is now "Minister". Therefore, there is a big difference. A Minister deals with political
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> affairs whereas the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner of Police deal with ordinary administrative affairs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is that he says I must apologize for the interpretation of Article 4. Who is he to say that. Is he a judge? These kinds of things can only be interpreted by a judge. I say there is a violation. He says no. Let it be. Let the judge decide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again he says there is no change. The whole of this old section has been deleted and they have put in a new section. Previously, the section says "Deputy Commissioner of Police" who could make an order. Now it says "any police officer". Therefore, all these are new things which are different from what they were before. And he has not been giving us the correct information. I just want to point that out.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if Dr Lee has any doubt as to the constitutionality of this Bill, he can always test it. If he wants a judge to judge it, he can always bring it to a test and he knows how to bring it to a test.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said before, the existing Act is very clear. All the rules governing assemblies and processions are made by the Commissioner of Police with the approval of the Minister. And this, I hope Dr Lee will read this in the proper context, must mean that everything else has to meet with the approval of the Minister. Therefore, nothing is new in this Bill except for those areas where I have touched on creation of new offences, replacement of an entire section with a new section to create this offence of touting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

If his party branch or his party headquarters is open to free access to the members of the public at any time, then of course it is a public place. But if members of the public do not have free access to his party branch or his party HQ, then I would say it does not fall under the ambit of this definition.

   <b>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>3.55 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roles and responsibilities of the Economic Development Board (EDB) have broadened substantially since the Economic Development Board Act was last amended in April 1975. In 1986, the Economic Committee identified the services sector as an important and key growth sector for Singapore. The responsibility for promoting internationally tradeable ser-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> vices has been assigned to the EDB. In addition, EDB has also taken on the responsibility of promoting the development of local small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide EDB with the additional mandate to promote the services sector as well as to develop SMEs, the Bill proposes to:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) amend section 17 of the Act to include a broader definition of "services" which is not covered under the existing Act; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to replace the term "industrial enterprise or enterprises" wherever it appears with "business enterprise or enterprises", as defined in the amended section 2.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes a new section 5A to specify the Board's functions which were not defined previously.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to make the following amendments to streamline the Board's operations and to provide administrative flexibility, as well as to bring them in line with the practices of other major statutory boards:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Section 5 of the Act is amended:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) for the Board to comprise the Chairman and not less than 4 and not more than 11 other members instead of the present provisions for the Board to comprise the Chairman and Director and not less than 4 and not more than 10 other members; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to allow the Board to meet at such times and places as it may determine instead of the present provision for monthly meetings;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Sections 7 and 11 are amended to give the Board the discretion to determine the designation, duties and responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Sections 23, 24 and 25 are amended and a new Schedule inserted to incorporate model provisions on matters of audit laid down by the Auditor-General which all statutory boards are required to comply with.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Sir, I have just two clarifications to seek from the Minister of State. I agree with him that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the EDB has come a long way since it was set up in the early 60's. Its traditional role of promoting manufacturing investments in Singapore has taken on a new dimension in the last few years when it started to promote Singapore as a total business centre. Its functions described under a new section 5A are laudable. The Board is now asked to promote the services industry. I think there is nothing wrong. In fact, it is a step in the right direction by the Government to promote the services industry. My fear is: will the expanded role of the EDB impinge on the traditional role of the Trade Development Board, which is essentially to promote the export of our local products and services?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern, Sir, is of our scarce resources. I think we must try to avoid duplication of functions and resources by our statutory boards in promoting economic development. Perhaps the Minister may wish to clarify on this observation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clarification pertains to the appointment or the creation of a CEO post in the EDB. I think the Minister of State did not quite explain this. I just want to know why is this move necessary, since the Board has been run sucessfully in the past by an Executive Director and now by an Executive Chairman and a General Manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may respond to the first point made by the Member.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that in view of our scarce resources it would not be a good idea for EDB and TDB to impinge upon each other's territory. I would like to reassure the Member that this is not going to be the intention. In fact, the EDB has made it very clear that it seeks to have a cooperative effort in all its promotion endeavours. In this particular case it is cooperating actively with the Trade Development Board in the promotion of exportable services. This is what I mentioned in my Second Reading speech that the EDB is primarily concerned with the tradable exportable services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the second clarification that was sought by the Member, the creation of a CEO post, this is actually a streamlining of the organizational structure within the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> EDB and it does not have any further repercussions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. [Mr Mah Bow Tan].
