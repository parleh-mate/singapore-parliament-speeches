<div align="center"><b>LIFT UPGRADING PROGRAMME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development, if the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP)'s main

objective  is  to  provide barrier  free  access  to  all

residents  in  light of our ageing population,  will  his

Ministry consider (a) extending the Programme to all  HDB

blocks  without  the  need to  vote;  (b)  if  voting  is

insisted  upon,  setting it at a simple  majority  rather

than  the current "YES" vote of 75%; and (c) if  the  75%

"YES"  vote  is insisted upon, conducting  a  re-poll  of

those  blocks  with lower than 75% as this may  not  have

been  reached not because of "NO" votes but because  some

residents have not voted.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Lift Upgrading

Programme  (LUP) was introduced in 2001 to provide  flats

in  high-rise  HDB blocks built before 1990  with  direct

access  to  a  lift,  as long as it  is  technically  and

economically feasible.  It was implemented in response to

requests from Members of Parliament for more and  earlier

lift  upgrading  works to provide greater convenience  to

the residents, especially the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lift upgrading is very costly and heavily

subsidised by the Government, one of the requirements  is

that  all benefitting residents must vote and co-pay  for

the programme.  This is to give HDB residents a sense  of

ownership  of  the programme and ensure  that  those  who

stand  to  benefit consider carefully  the  need  or  the

desirability for the upgrading works in their block.  The

same  principles have been successfully  applied  to  the

Main Upgrading Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the Government has a clear

mandate from those who benefit and have to co-pay  before

proceeding  with the upgrading works.  Under the  Housing

and Development Act, the legal requirement is to have  at

least  75% of those who are eligible to vote to agree  to

the  lift upgrading works before they can be carried out.

This  is clearly indicated in the LUP brochures given  to

eligible  households.  As every single vote is important,

all eligible HDB residents are encouraged to come forward

to  vote  during the LUP polling.  Those  who  cannot  be

personally  present during the exercise  can  cast  their

votes through a proxy.  However, those who choose not  to

vote,  even  though they are advised to do  so  prior  to

polling, will have their votes registered as a "No" vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a polling falls short of the 75%

mark,  the  outcome  of  the  polling  exercise  must  be

respected and safeguarded.  There are no legal provisions

under the Act to allow for a re-poll.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, is the main

objective of LUP not to provide 100% barrier-free  access

for our residents

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>



in  view  of  the  fact  that our population  is  ageing?

Therefore, if that is the main reason, is there really  a

need  to  have  75%  support or "Yes"  vote?   Would  the

Ministry  consider lowering this requirement because,  at

the  end of the day, what we want is 100% lift access for

our population which is ageing?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, there are actually two

points.   Let  us  deal with the first point  about  100%

barrier-free access.  In my earlier reply, I said that we

would  aim  to  provide convenient  access  where  it  is

technically and economically feasible.  I do not  believe

it  is  tenable to aim for 100% access at all  costs  and

disregarding  the  technical  aspects  and   indeed   the

preferences  of  the residents in any  particular  block.

You  must understand that HDB blocks have been built with

a  variety of housing forms.  Not all blocks are standard

blocks  with  common corridors.  There  are  blocks  with

staggered configurations, in which at the time they  were

built the priority was given to privacy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a simple exercise of saying that there

will be 100% access for everybody at all costs regardless

of the preferences.  There are still residents in some of

these  blocks  who prefer not to have a new  lift  shaft.

Some  of them claim that it obstructs their view and some

of  them do not feel that it is an essential item.  It is

a convenience and not something which they are willing to

pay that amount for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next figure, which is the second point, is the

75%  level.   I think we can argue whether it  should  be

51%,  65%, 75%, 90% or 100%.  But the point is that  once

Parliament has passed a law, in effect, setting a certain

threshold,  then that threshold has to be respected.   If

you  say that we should make it 74.5%, then you set a new

threshold.   But  once that new threshold  is  set,  that

threshold has to be implemented and implemented  exactly,

fairly and transparently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I empathise with the residents in the block

concerned.  But there are clear legal principles involved

here which I think should be best adhered to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, as I see it, LUP and MUP are

quite different.  Under MUP, we add in extra rooms,  etc,

so  as to enhance the value of the flat.  But under  LUP,

for  those  blocks  of  flats which are  technically  and

economically feasible, should not MND consider looking at

the  policy to see whether there is a need to set a "Yes"

vote  at  75%,  because the objective  of  LUP  is  quite

different  from MUP?  The objective of LUP is to  improve

accessibility.   So  for  blocks  of  flats   which   are

technically  and economically feasible,  maybe  a  simple

majority would be good enough for LUP.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in both

MUP and LUP, we have set a 75% threshold.  So there is no

difference  in that respect.  I think it is important  to

understand why we have set a 75% threshold.  Once a  poll

is  conducted  successfully, even those who  are  not  in

favour of upgrading, whether it is MUP or LUP, will  have

to  pay  for  it.   This is not a trivial  exercise.   We

believe  that  there  should  be  polling  so  that  this

reflects  the desire of the vast majority and  they  will

then  have  a  sense  of ownership and  a  stake  in  the

decisions which are being made by the community.  I think

this is the correct direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, you want to ensure that that

majority   is   a  significant  majority  because   their

decisions  will have a financial impact on  the  minority

who  may  not  be  in  favour of  upgrading.   For  those

reasons, I think it is safe and reasonable to set it at a

significantly  high  level and 75%,  as  far  as  we  are

concerned, is the right level at this point in time.

<div align="center"><b>LABOUR SUPPLIERS OF FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Deployment)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  (a)  whether  labour suppliers  who  have  been

permitted to bring in foreign workers for one job can  be

permitted  to deploy them for another; (b) if  deployment

is  not  permitted,  how  many  such  breaches  have  his

Ministry dealt with in the past three years; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>



(c)  are  there  plans  to  step up  enforcement  actions

against such breaches.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, work permits are issued to foreign  workers

to  work  for  the  employers stated in the  application.

Employers  of  work  permit holders are  not  allowed  to

deploy   their  foreign  workers  to  work  for   another

employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who breach this work permit condition will

be  prosecuted  under the Employment of  Foreign  Workers

Act.   In the last 3 years, we have prosecuted about  730

employers  or individuals who have illegally deployed  or

abetted in the illegal deployment of work permit holders.

We  take  a  serious view of such breaches  of  the  work

permit  conditions and will continue to take  enforcement

actions against such employers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask  the Minister what are the key reasons that  these

employers cited for redeploying these workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, if the Member is referring

to  those  who  were  prosecuted for illegally  deploying

their work permit holders, the main motivation is to  get

around the work permit regulation.  They have brought  in

workers  supposedly for their own jobs and  perhaps  they

have  brought in more workers than they need.  They  have

overstated their demand or after bringing in the  foreign

workers  they find that they may not have jobs that  last

long  enough to keep them fully employed.  There may well

also  be  a  demand  from the illegal employers  of  such

redeployed  workers  who  hope  to  get  illegal  workers

without  having to pay for the levy because they can  get

the  original employer to palm off these workers  to  the

establishment without having to pay the work permit  levy

for such foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are many reasons why people try to

get  around this provision but we will continue with  our

enforcement  action  against  those  who  are  trying  to

illegally deploy their work permit holders.  We will also

remind employers that they can employ a foreign worker if

they have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>



applied  for  a  work  permit for  the  foreigner.   Just

because  a  foreigner holds a work permit does  not  mean

that  he  is  entitled to work for anybody in  Singapore.

The work permit is specifically issued to a foreigner  to

work for a particular employer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I understand that these

foreign  workers had to  incur a very high cost  to  come

over  here for employment.  If our employers are not sure

that  they  can  get jobs that can last  long  enough  to

fulfil the two-year employment period, then something has

to be done, to be fair to these workers who have come all

the  way  from  their  home  country  to  work  here  and

contribute  to  our economy.  I think the figure  of  730

employers being prosecuted is quite a big number.   Would

the  Ministry consider enhancing the penalty so that  the

employers would not abuse the system?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the Work Permit Department

has  introduced  criteria such as the value  of  work  on

hand, particularly for the construction sector, and  also

the  duration of the available project.  For instance,  a

contractor who applies for non-traditional source workers

must  have at least six months of contract work available

before the application will be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look into the current regulation to see how

we  can  further tighten the procedure to prevent  abuses

and  to  minimise  exploitation of the  foreign  workers.

Enhancing  the  penalty is certainly one of  the  options

that we will consider.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  (a) how does his Ministry ensure that employers

provide decent and reasonable living conditions for their

foreign workers and (b) in the past three years how  many

cases  of  employers, who failed to provide the  required

accommodation, have been investigated and dealt with.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the

conditions  for the issue of work permits, all  employers

of   non-traditional  source  workers  have  to   provide

accommodation  and maintain their foreign workers  during

their  stay  in Singapore.  However, some employers  have

resorted  to housing their foreign workers in overcrowded

and   unsafe   living   conditions.    The   problem   is

particularly pronounced in the construction sector  which

is also the largest employer of non-traditional source of

foreign workers in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To arrest this problem, the Government has announced

in  June  this  year that construction companies  housing

their  foreign workers off-site would have to house  them

in  approved and purpose-built dormitories.   From  2004,

this  will  be  spelt out as a work permit condition.   I

understand  that the BCA is currently working on  setting

basic   living   standards  for   on-site   housing   for

construction workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the new work permit requirement will only

be  imposed  in 2004, construction companies should  take

immediate  steps to regularise the housing condition  for

their  foreign workers.  During the interim  period,  the

URA  will conduct inspections to detect workers  who  are

not  housed in approved premises.  Construction companies

caught  housing  their foreign workers in  such  premises

will  be  warned  to take remedial action.   Recalcitrant

employers  who  continue to house their  foreign  workers

improperly  will  not be allowed to recruit  new  foreign

workers.  Since June this year, 26 construction companies

have  been  caught  housing  their  foreign  workers   in

unapproved premises and were issued with warning letters.

<div align="center"><b>INCREASE IN GST RATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Budget

Statement  in May this year, I announced tax  changes  to

support our economic restructuring and to secure economic

growth.   We  must  bring  down  direct  taxes  to   stay

internationally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



competitive, attract investments and create jobs.  And to

make  up  part of the loss in revenue, we have  to  raise

indirect taxes; in other words, the GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cut corporate and top personal income tax

rates to 22% for the Year of Assessment 2003, and we will

lower  them  further to 20% within three years.   At  the

same  time, we announced that we would raise the GST rate

from 3% to 5% on 1st January 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help Singaporeans adjust to the higher GST, the

Government  implemented a comprehensive  offset  package.

This  includes  the Economic Restructuring Shares  (ERS),

rebates  on  rental  and  service &  conservancy  charges

(S&CC), plus full absorption by the Government of GST for

subsidised  healthcare and state  education  charges.   A

full  listing of all the assistance measures is  provided

to   Members  as  an  Annex  (Cols.  1987-1988)  to  this

statement.   I have left copies on your seats.   And  you

can  see that the offset package costs $4.1 billion,  and

is  enough  to offset the additional tax that nearly  all

Singaporeans have to pay for at least five years and,  in

many cases, 10 years.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20021205/20021205-HA-0751987.htm">Annex - GST Offset Package</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the Budget Statement, expectations

were that the US economy would pick up this year, and the

Singapore  economy would also complete its recovery  from

the  sharp downturn in 2001.  As events have turned  out,

both  the  US and the Singapore economies have done  less

well  than expected.  The US economic recovery  has  been

weak  and  below  expectations, even though  the  US  has

avoided  entering a second recession.  As Alan  Greenspan

recently said, the US economy was "going through  a  soft

spot".   Likewise, the Singapore economy is now projected

to  grow  only by 2-2.5% for 2002 as a whole, at the  low

end of the 2-4% that we had projected in May.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, prospects for 2003 are still

uncertain.   The  risks are not only economic,  but  also

security  and political, eg, the impact of another  major

terrorist attack, or of a war in Iraq.  The EU and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



Japanese  economies are slowing down.  In  the  US,  most

analysts  expect a gradual recovery, supported by  steady

growth in consumer spending and a more substantial  pick-up  in  corporate investment in the second half of  2003.

In  recent  weeks, US economic indicators have  improved,

and  the mood has become more optimistic.  However,  some

respected  analysts still worry that  the  US  could  yet

experience a second recession next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been affected not only by the slow US

recovery,  but  also by the problems in  Southeast  Asia,

including  the  terrorist  attack  in  Bali.   Hence  the

downward  revision of this year's growth estimate  to  2-2.5%.   However, early indications are that we will enjoy

positive growth in the fourth quarter. Our exports to key

markets  are  growing, albeit slowly.   Non-oil  domestic

exports  rose by 6% in October, and improved  further  in

November, according to preliminary estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector has also continued to grow.

Output  rose  by 12% in October, similar to  the  11%  in

September,  driven  by  an increase  in  semi-conductors,

petrochemicals  and pharmaceuticals.  On a month-on-month

basis, manufacturing output increased by 1.3%, the  first

increase since May 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2003, MTI has forecast growth of 2-5%, although

we cannot yet be certain how things will turn out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a fiscal point of view, the tax changes

announced  in  May  remain appropriate despite  the  less

vibrant  economic conditions today.  We should  not  hold

back  on  our  restructuring on account  of  the  adverse

climate; indeed, this makes it even more important for us

to  press  on  and  strengthen  our  competitiveness  and

resilience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To individuals, because of the ERS and other

rebates,  the GST increase should not cause  hardship  to

any  Singaporean, or result in consumers cutting back  on

spending.   To the Government, the combination of  direct

tax cuts to 22% and a GST

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



increase  to 5% plus the first tranche of the ERS  shares

together result in a revenue loss of $1.2 billion in  the

first  year (2003). Therefore, the overall effect of  the

tax  changes  and offsets on the economy is expansionary,

rather than contractionary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested that the Government should defer

the GST increase completely for 12 months or longer.  But

this   approach   risks  leaving  the   Government   with

insufficient  funds  for  urgent  needs,  especially   in

education, healthcare and defence.  And if later we  have

to  defer the increase again, the Government may wind  up

with  a  structural  deficit, which  would  have  serious

consequences  for the exchange rate, for  inflation,  and

for  the  value  of Singaporeans' CPF  savings.   I  have

therefore decided against deferring the GST increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am also mindful of the current mood of

apprehension and uncertainty among Singaporeans,  because

of  the  economic  troubles this year  and  the  security

concerns in the region.  MTI's recent downgrading of this

year's  growth estimate, and the NWC's recommendation  to

extend  the  wage  freeze for another  six  months,  also

contribute to the sense that things are not yet  back  to

normal.  We do not want to add to the burdens and worries

of  Singaporeans at a difficult time.  The  psychological

impact  of  the  GST increase could result  in  consumers

cutting  back  on  spending  and  business  putting   off

investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertainty over economic prospects for next

year, as to whether and how soon the US and the Singapore

economies will recover, reinforces the need for  caution.

Although,  on balance, another downturn does  not  appear

likely, the possibility of one occurring still cannot  be

ruled out and it would be prudent to be cautious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to phase in the increase of

the  GST  rate, and implement it in two steps instead  of

one.   The  GST rate will go up from 3% to  4%  from  1st

January 2003, and then from 4% to 5%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>



from 1st January 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a phased introduction will have more

impact than proceeding with the full tax increase  to  5%

and  enhancing the offset package. Many Singaporeans have

not  made the link between the benefits they will receive

from  the offsets, and the additional GST they will  have

to pay.  Phasing in the tax increase is a more direct and

easily understood signal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the phased introduction of the GST, I have

decided   to   maintain  unchanged  the  offset   package

announced  in  Budget 2002.  I am happy to announce  that

Singaporeans will receive the original amount of Economic

Restructuring  Shares  in  January  2003,  and  the  same

schedule of rental and S&CC rebates as announced earlier.

I  have  also  decided that the increase  in  the  Public

Assistance  rates  and the Singapore  Allowance  paid  to

Government pensioners will proceed in January 2003 by the

full  amounts  originally planned. The  details  will  be

announced next week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower GST increase will cost the Government $163

million   in   FY2002   and  $488  million   in   FY2003.

Effectively, the Government will be putting an additional

$650  million  into  the  hands of  Singaporeans.   As  a

result,  the Government is not likely to have any  budget

surplus  in  FY2003.  At best, we will be  able  just  to

balance the budget. All Ministries will have to economise

on spending and trim back on non-essential programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the phasing in of the GST will lessen the

burden  on  Singaporeans, and help  them  cope  with  the

uncertainties that we are now facing.  This change  is  a

fine-tuning to the original tax restructuring plans.  The

Government  is making a tactical course correction  while

still  heading  for  the  same  destination.   We  remain

committed  to bringing down top direct tax rates  to  20%

within  three  years,  and  to offer  a  more  attractive

business  environment to bring talent and investments  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am now submitting an amendment to

the GST (Amendment) Bill, to provide for the GST rate  to

be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>



raised in two steps, from 3% to 4% from 1st January  2003

and  from 4% to 5% from 1st January 2004.  I will ask the

House to consider the amendment in the Committee Stage of

the Bill later this afternoon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  very pleased to hear from the  Deputy  Prime

Minister and Minister for Finance that he has decided  to

phase-in the increase in GST from 3% to 4%, and after one

year,  from  4% to 5%.  I believe this decision  will  be

well  received by the people and this House.   Even  with

this  phased-in approach of a 1% increase, may I ask  the

DPM whether it would still have a dampening effect on the

economy,  in view of the fact that the economic prospects

are  currently uncertain.  I am very concerned whether  a

GST increase would have a further dampening effect on the

economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is with regard to the point made

by  DPM  that  there  will  be deficit  budgets  for  the

following  two  years.  I think that was  what  he  said.

Would  it also impact the Government's coffers,  and  how

does  the  Government  intend to deal  with  the  deficit

budget?  Is it going to come from the national reserves?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask a question that I asked

previously  in  this House, whether the Government  would

consider  reintroducing  the  Economic  Downturn   Relief

Scheme  that  had  been stopped at the end  of  November.

This   scheme  is  useful  because  with  the  continuing

economic   downturn,   more   people   will   be   facing

unemployment.  With the scheme re-introduced, there would

be some form of relief for them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong Horn

Kee asked whether this 1% increase in GST will still be a

dampener.   I do not believe so because, if you  look  at

the  sums,  it  is quite clear that, in  fact,  far  from

dampening  the  economy,  we are  administering  a  major

stimulus to the economy.  First of all, the reduction  in

personal and corporate income taxes is going to pump $1.3

billion into the economy.  This will be offset by the GST

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>



increase, which will now only raise $650 million.  On the

other hand, we are going to put into the economy, through

the  Economic  Restructuring Shares on 1st January  2003,

about $1.2 billion.  So, actually on a net effect, if you

add  up these sums, we are putting $1.8-1.9 billion  into

the  economy next year.  Far from dampening the  economy,

the   overall   impact   is   highly   expansionary   and

stimulative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we have a deficit, how would it be

funded?   I  think,  best of all, it is  not  to  have  a

deficit,  then we do not have to worry about funding  it.

I  did  not say that we would have a deficit.  I said  we

are not likely to have a budget surplus and, at best,  we

would be able to just balance the budget, and we will try

hard to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, should we re-introduce the EDRS? The EDRS

was   introduced  last  year  as  a  one-year   programme

specifically  to  deal  with  the  very  sharp   economic

downturn.   People were out of work.  They  needed  help.

It  was  something of an emergency.  We had a package  to

deal  with  that.   As Members know, over  the  last  few

months,   applications  to  the  EDRS  have  tailed   off

significantly.   I  think  the  most  urgent  cases  have

already  been seen to, and people have other  sources  of

assistance  available to them - from the CCCs,  CDCs  and

welfare organisations.  So the EDRS demand has tailed off

and  we  decided,  at the end of the  one-year,  that  we

should  let it lapse.  Because if we do not let emergency

programmes lapse, when emergencies pass, the next time we

have   an  emergency,  we  have  to  pile  on  additional

programmes,  and  eventually end up with  more  and  more

items meant to deal with previous problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the position stands now, we are not in a

recession.  Our economy is growing.  It has been  growing

in  the second quarter and third quarter.  I think it  is

growing  in  the  fourth quarter, and  people  are  being

looked  after.   Going  forward,  we  will  monitor   the

situation.   If  we have another sharp downturn,  another

economic  crisis, we will look at the need for  an  EDRS.

But, as of now, I do not believe that we need one.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first

I  think  the new announcement would be most welcomed  by

the people and the business sector, and I believe this is

a  very clear and unmistakable signal that the Government

is  hearing  the voice of the people, and addressing  the

people's concern.  Not only is the phasing in of GST,  it

is  also having the offset package remaining.  I think it

is  a double blessing, and I believe it will boost public

confidence  and  market confidence as  well.   We  should

congratulate the Government for making such a  bold  move

and  I  would ask whether the Deputy Prime Minister would

continue   to  monitor  the  situation  and  adjust,   if

necessary,  with  other measures  to  move  the  business

sector, and have more money in circulation in the market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will

continue  to track the state of the economy very closely.

This is a time of considerable uncertainty.  It does  not

mean  that all the signals are black.  Two or three weeks

ago,  I  think, the mood was significantly gloomier,  but

looking  at  what  has been coming  out,  the  data,  the

indicators  from  America, there has been  a  significant

pick  up  in performance and in sentiments, and similarly

in  Singapore,  from  our own indicators.   How  it  goes

forward  next year it is very difficult to say.  Normally

when  the  Ministry  of  Trade and  Industry  puts  up  a

forecast for next year they plus or minus 1% and you more

or less know where it will arrive.  This year, they set 2-5%,  which means it is really a very wide uncertainty and

it  is  an  educated guess of how things will  turn  out,

because  it  just does not depend on the economic  trend,

but   also   on  the  security  situation  and  political

developments.   So  we  will keep  on  tracking  what  is

happening  very closely, and if there is a need  to  make

further adjustments, you can be sure that we will not  be

slow in noticing it and doing so.

<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first allow me to applaud the Government's decision

to  stagger  the GST increase.  In fact,  the  views  and

concerns  of workers have been adequately addressed.   At

the same time, I am also glad that the ERS shares will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>



paid  accordingly as announced earlier.  But I  have  one

other request, which is that the Government will consider

and monitor the economic conditions.  And, if there is  a

need,  make a further review whether there is a  need  to

introduce  GST further to 5% in 2004, but definitely  the

economic  condition in 2003 has to be taken into account.

I  am  also glad that the workers' views and points  have

been carefully considered by the Government and I do  not

think  they have been put aside by the Government.   They

are  very  happy and I wish to thank, on  behalf  of  all

workers, the Government's decision and to bring  about  a

relief to workers during these difficult times.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr

Nithiah  Nandan for his full support for this move.  Next

year  is 12 months from now, but we have to plan  on  the

basis  that we are going to proceed with the second phase

of  the  increase  because next year the  increase  would

already  be  twelve months late.  But  I  understand  his

concerns.  We will track what is happening in the economy

next  year,  very closely, and if need be, we  will  make

many adjustments to the economy to keep it on track.  But

the GST programme, we have made rephasing, and we have to

be  very  careful that the rephasing does not  become  an

indefinite postponement, which would cause us  a  lot  of

trouble.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first  I would like to congratulate Deputy Prime Minister

Lee  for having taken this approach.  In fact, there  was

some betting going on that, knowing the character of  the

Government,  it  would be quite out of question  for  the

Government  to  actually  consider  any  relent  of   the

decision  already  taken.  But the very  fact  that  this

phase-in  had come in, I think that for some  people  who

have  gone on to this bet, some are going to win and some

are  going to lose.  The phase-in only demonstrates  that

we  are really remaking Singapore and that we are mindful

that  the audience is a very different audience, and  the

Government is actually putting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>



the ears to the ground to really respond to the needs and

calls of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I am very happy to note that the

full  package of the enhancement will be implemented with

effect  from  2003.   But if the economy  does  not  turn

around for the better, say, in 2004 and the other 1%  has

to  be  phased  in,  and  there  are  cries  for  another

enhancement package to offset the additional increase  of

1%, would the Government consider the request?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

I would not advise anybody to bet against the Government.

Secondly, on the hypothetical question, we will  have  to

wait  and  see.  We are not magicians who  can  show  you

empty  pockets and put our hands in it and  produce  more

money, but we will have to wait and see what the state of

the   economy  is  next  year.   As  always,  making   an

adjustment to the GST increase would be our last  choice.

We  will  try  to  do many other things first  before  we

consider that.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I just have two questions in  relation  to

this  revised package.  There was a story in  the  papers

about  the  VWOs  and  how GST is imposed  on  the  funds

raised.   I  would  like  to know how,  since  1999,  the

Government grant has stopped to offset such GST hikes  on

the  donations  raised  by the  VWOs.   In  this  current

climate when I think the charity dollar is stretched even

more,  how can the VWOs be helped where GST is concerned?

Secondly,  is it possible, perhaps in the year  2004,  to

consider  splitting the GST into taxes on essentials  and

non-essentials, similar to what is practised in  Britain?

I  am also looking at the offset package grant to CCCs  - $15 million spread over five years, which means about  $3

million - for quite a number of people.  There is already

a  lot  of generosity, but I still wonder whether in  the

current climate it is perhaps still not too sufficient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

VWOs  is  a separate issue.  The transitional arrangement

was made for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



them  when  we  first introduced GST and this  transition

arrangement  is phasing out.  If we need  to  assist  the

VWOs  it  is  best  for us to assist them  directly  with

grants and other forms of assistance, rather than putting

it  into the tax system of the GST.  That is what we have

done  with  the foreign worker levy because  we  used  to

exempt  them from the foreign worker levy, now we subject

them  to the levy but we give them a grant, and it is  up

to  them whether they want to employ a foreign worker  or

they  want  to get a labour-saving equipment, or  whether

they  want to find a Singaporean and do double the  work,

it is up to them.  So I think that should be our approach

to VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether to split between essentials and non-essentials, this is an issue which we have discussed many

times when we first introduced the GST and again when  we

raised the issue of GST this year.  And we have taken the

approach  of  having the GST applied to all  products  in

Singapore,  whether  essentials,  non-essentials,  goods,

services, high-end, low-end, everything.  And there is  a

reason for this.  The reason is that we want to find  the

best way to help the lower income people bear the tax and

to  make  ends meet in Singapore.  We impose the GST,  it

imposes  a burden on them.  What is the best way to  help

them  ease this burden?  It is to identify who the  lower

income groups are and target the assistance at them.   So

the  ERS,  the S&CC package, plus the rental package,  if

you  add  it all together, in fact, the people living  in

the one and two-room flats get the most, three-room a bit

less, and four-room, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentials are not just bought by poor people.

Everybody buys essentials.  Let us say food.  Poor people

buy food, middle income people buy more food, rich people

buy even more food.  So if you decide to exempt food, for

every  one dollar which helps the lower income, you  have

to  spend nine dollars helping the non-lower income.   So

the  expense of this tax expenditure is much more and the

result is that revenues are less, and the result of  that

is  to keep your revenues even, we will have to push  the

GST rate, instead of being 5%, it will have to be 6%, 7%,

8%, or if you take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>



the  British  example, because you said the British  have

such exemption, 17% GST.  So it is not a good way to help

lower income people.  Therefore, we have decided we  will

have  a GST which covers everything and if we have target

groups  which need assistance, let us help them directly.

I think that is the best way to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema says why not be a little bit more

generous.   ERS is good, more is better.  Well,  more  is

always  better  but, in fact, we have been  quite  a  lot

better already because although we say ERS is five years'

worth  of GST for everyone, actually for the lower income

it  is, in many cases, 9-10 years' worth of GST.  So,  in

fact,  you are well looked after, and if you are  an  old

person,  10 years is a long time.  So, this is  something

which  we  have  already seen to.  If  it  is  still  not

sufficient because conditions are very hard, I  think  we

can  do more, but we should target it specifically rather

than go on the basis of essentials and non-essentials.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to take the

opportunity to applaud the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lee,

for  this  phased increase in GST.  I had actually  hoped

for a full deferment until the economy recovers or for at

least  one  year but, as the saying goes, "if you  cannot

get  a big fish, at least ikan bilis is still better than

nothing."  In a sense, it is better than a full  increase

of  2%,  and  I  think many Singaporeans will  appreciate

that, especially those from the retail sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to say also that we from the

Opposition  do not mean that we are always  opposing  for

the  sake of opposing, and in this case if the Government

had  actually listened to the people and deferred it,  we

would  be  very  appreciative and  support  it.   If  the

economy  turns  for the worse next year,  and  if  things

become  worse,  I hope that the Minister  would  consider

cutting the increase back to 3% or even lower, or to have

additional  off-budget measures to help  Singaporeans  to

tide over the difficult period next year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just

thank  Mr Steve Chia for his support for my $650  million

ikan bilis.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me

join  my  other colleagues in thanking the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  and Minister for Finance and the Government  of

Singapore  for listening to the voices of the  people  in

asking  the  Government  to take into  consideration  the

current economic downturn and the hardship that they  are

faced with.  I can quite agree that it is not really ikan

bilis,  it is a lot of money that the Government  has  to

forgo  in  terms  of the budget as a result  of  this  1%

increase.   I  would  like to ask,  and  I  am  sure,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that the small businesses, the  retailers,

are  the people who would be very happy because now, with

the smaller increase, their sense of consumers not buying

enough would be somewhat abated.  But I would like to ask

the  Government to continue to look into this area:   how

to  help  the  small businesses and retailers.   And,  in

particular, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister for Finance that for those who  are  having

transactions  with  the Government, or  who  provide  the

Government  with goods or services, or  do  any  form  of

construction  or  public works for  the  Government,  the

Government  could also consider expediting  payments  for

them,  for  instance.  I am not suggesting that  payments

are  slow  but,  I think, many are faced with  cash  flow

problems  and  for those dealing with the Government,  if

the  payments  are  made much more  promptly,  that  will

certainly help them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, can I suggest that we take all

the questions at one shot?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

had said previously in the House that one of the ways for

the  Government  to  ensure that the Budget  is  properly

balanced is not merely to increase tax, but also to watch

out  for  its expenditure.  I was heartened to hear  from

the  Deputy  Prime Minister earlier that  he  would  take

steps to ensure that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>



expenditure is properly controlled.  But I think it takes

more than reassuring words from the Deputy Prime Minister

to  ensure  that this is carried out.  I am  afraid  that

years  of  strong  economic growth and  years  of  strong

surpluses  may  have set the free and easy  mentality  in

some  of our Ministries.  I do not wish to repeat what  I

said during the Budget debate because I have no new seven

wonders to reveal today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was quite taken aback, like many other

Singaporeans,  when  we  heard that  the  Land  Transport

Authority was building a $500 million headquarters and  I

think because of the public ruckus, the whole project has

been  shelved.  But I was also very concerned last  month

when  I  read  that for the opening of  the  Esplanade  - Theatres on the Bay, we spent something like $13  million

and was all blown away in 23 days.  And yet, on the other

hand,  the Government announced the increases in hospital

charges, raising more money from the sick to the tune  of

$12 million a year.  So I want to ask: sometimes have  we

got  our priorities correct?  Therefore, I would like  to

ask  the Deputy Prime Minister, in spite of what  he  has

told  us  and his reassurance to the House, what concrete

steps  can  really be taken by the Government  to  ensure

that  the cost of Government is well controlled  and,  if

not  in  a  crisis,  can  it  be  reduced  even  further?

Because,  like  all businesses, when we are  faced  in  a

difficult   situation,  one  of  the  things   that   all

businessmen do is to cut back on expenses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I respond

first  to Mdm Halimah.  She talked about the problems  of

small  businesses and retailers.  We are very much  aware

of  it.   I  think  it  is not just because  of  the  GST

increase.  Even this year, without any GST increase, they

have been having quite a slow and difficult time.  It  is

partly a structural problem because there are too many of

the  businesses which are in HDB estates, ie,  there  are

whole  rows  and many of them are selling similar  goods.

It  is partly a matter of change in habits and customs of

our  younger  generation.  Instead of  people  with  two-income households, instead of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>



shopping in the wet market every day, they will shop once

a  week  in  the  supermarket and put the  stuff  in  the

freezer,  and  they  are going for a different  range  of

goods and different range of services.  Or they may  even

go  to  JB, or some place, to shop instead.  So it  is  a

structural  problem and it is one which is being  studied

by  one  of the Economic Review Committee working groups.

They have some ideas to ameliorate the difficulties.  But

I  do  not think there is any quick solution to make  the

sector bloom and prosper again overnight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for transactions with the Government and

expediting payment, I agree with Mdm Halimah that  it  is

important  that Government be a prompt paymaster.   I  am

not  aware of any complaint that the Government has  been

slow.   If  Mdm  Halimah, or any of  the  Members,  comes

across any such cases, please let me know and I will look

into  it.   It  is  our  practice to administer  and  pay

promptly.  It is most important to our reputation that we

do  because, if we start paying slowly, then  whoever  is

providing the services will start factoring in  that  and

the interest cost in his next tender to us.  Then we will

have  a  problem.  I was just discussing  with  my  staff

yesterday evening and they told me that in fact  many  of

the  companies prefer to do business with the Government,

precisely because of this reason, they can be sure to pay

you  and they would not drag the matter.  Whereas if  you

do  business  with the private partner, if he  runs  into

financial  difficulties, you have a  problem.   And  they

have  confidence that the Government will  not  run  into

financial difficulties, and it is my job to make sure the

Government  does  not  run  into financial  difficulties,

which  is why we are proceeding with the GST increase  to

four percentage points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree completely with what Mr Tan said, that it is

not just what I said, but also how we practise it and how

the  civil  servants  internalise with  the  need  to  be

parsimony and to be careful with money, and to  spend  as

if  it  is effortless for MOF to produce the next dollar,

and  we are in different circumstances and we have to  be

very careful.  As I said, we are going to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>



have a very tight Budget next year and the Ministries are

going to cut back both on substantive programmes as  well

as  on frills.  On education, for example, they have been

planning on a certain percentage of GDP to spend.  But we

have also been expecting a certain rate of growth of GDP,

that  if  you  have  5-6%  growth  per  year,  therefore,

education  will  have 5-6% more to spend per  year,  plus

extra  percentage  on that because we  think  this  is  a

priority  area.  Now, our base has shrunk.   The  GDP  is

growing  less rapidly.  Educational need has not  shrunk.

Your   children  still  need  good  schools,   computers,

laboratories.   You  still want  more  people  to  go  to

university  and  more people can benefit  from  going  to

university.  All these cost a lot of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we afford as much of this as possible while

living  within our means?  They will have to cut  and  it

will  be  things like travel and perks, and non-essential

things, that is, when you renew your computer, and so on,

every  two  years, it may be every three or three  and  a

half  years.  When you are renewing your school building,

instead of 20 years, it may be 25 years.  We will have to

live  within our means.  These are adjustments  which  we

have  to  make.  When they opened the Esplanade building,

they also have to live within their means and decide what

they  are  going  to  do.  The Esplanade,  which  Mr  Tan

raised, is an issue.  Before we had the opening ceremony,

we  considered this matter and we discussed it  carefully

with  MITA because, in fact, we are doing this at a  time

when  the economy is down, the mood is down.  We  do  not

want  to  be  extravagant because we  cannot  afford  the

money.   Anyway,  it is a wrong signal  to  send  to  the

people.  And MITA understood this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, they said, "We are making a very

big step.  We spent a lot of money building it.  It is  a

long  term  investment.   The purpose  is  not  just  for

Singaporeans    but   really   to   register    ourselves

internationally."  So we become one of  the  spots  where

people   believe  and  know  that  there   are   cultural

activities and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>



it  is  a  place  which people want to come  to  perform.

Therefore,  you  need a series of events  to  launch  the

theatre as well as the concert hall and to make ourselves

known  to Singaporeans and internationally, and it  costs

money.   The  fireworks cost money, yes.   I  would  have

preferred  far  fewer  fireworks.   But  it  is  not  the

fireworks  which are the most expensive  thing.   If  you

want  to  have Jose Carreras here, that costs money.   If

you  want orchestra here, that costs money.  A lot of  it

is  sponsored,  but some of it are operating  cost.   And

that  is  why  it  costs a certain  amount  to  have  the

festival  which  went to the opening  ceremony.   But  Mr

Tan's  point is well taken and it is a message which  the

Ministry   of   Finance  reiterated  to  all  Ministries,

including  ourselves,  regularly, and  especially  before

next year's Budget.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will amend the Goods and Services Tax Act

to give legislative effect to the following measures:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) To change the GST rate;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) To provide for the transition from the existing

GST rate to the new rate on 1st January 2003;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) To zero-rate co-location web-hosting services

and managed services; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) To make explicit the Comptroller's powers to

obtain  information and records kept in electronic format

or alternative media.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now explain the main amendments in the

Bill.

<br><br><i>Increase in GST Rate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have earlier stated the Government's intent to

amend  clause  3 of the Bill to effect the  amendment  to

section 16 of the Act to increase the GST rate from 3% to

4% for the year 2003, and from 4% to 5% for the year 2004

and subsequent years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now explain the more technical points in the

Bill.

<br><br><i>Transition to Higher GST Rate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the increase in GST rate, there is a need

to  provide transitional rules to prevent businesses from

circumventing the time of supply rules.  Under  the  time

of  supply rules, businesses may account for GST  at  the

lower GST rate of 3% by issuing tax invoices to customers

before  the GST rate increase, even though the goods  are

delivered or the services are performed or the payment is

made only after the GST rate has been increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, clause 5 amends section 39 of the Act to

provide  for  the circumstances in which a  tax  invoice,

issued  before  the  date a change  in  rate  comes  into

operation,  ceases  to have effect.  Businesses  will  be

required   to   issue  a  new  tax   invoice   in   these

circumstances.

<br><br><i>Zero-rating of Co-location Web-hosting Services and Managed Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a co-location arrangement, a service provider

will  generally require the customers to bring  in  their

own  server  platforms and place them at his  facilities.

Where  a local service provider provides web-hosting  and

managed  services to an overseas customer in such  a  co-location arrangement, the services are standard-rated  if

the  server belonging to the overseas customer is located

in   Singapore,   and  zero-rated  if   located   outside

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero-rating the entire web-hosting services and

managed   services   provided  to  an  overseas   person,

regardless  of where the server is located, will  promote

Singapore as an e-commerce hub.  Hence, clause  4  amends

section 21 of the Act to provide for zero-rating  of  the

supply  of services to an overseas person in relation  to

computer server equipment belonging to that person  which

is co-located in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Clarification of Comptrollers' Powers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, business transaction information and

data  are stored in computers, electronic media and other

alternative media.  However, the Comptroller of Goods and

Services  Tax's  powers  to  access  and  to  seize  such

electronic   records  may  be  limited   based   on   the

interpretation  of  the current legislation.   Therefore,

clause  7  amends section 84 of the Act  to  clarify  the

powers vested in the Comptroller to access and seize such

records kept in electronic and other alternative media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I would like to put on

record  my  support for the Government on  the  phased-in

approach to the GST implementation.  This phased approach

to  increase from 3% to 4%, and then from 4% to 5%,  will

lessen  the impact on the lower income group and  lighten

their burden - the so-called psychological impact on  the

people.   It also took into account the changing economic

conditions  and reflects the Government's sensitivity  to

our people's plight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to join the other hon. Members who

have spoken earlier in congratulating the Government  and

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  adopting  this  phased

approach.   I  see  great value in  the  sensitivity  and

financial   prudence   of  the  Government.    It   gives

confidence  to  the people when dealing  with  Government

bodies.  In particular, I like very much the Deputy Prime

Minister's message that Government bodies would  have  to

cut  back  on their spending, so that the Government  can

maintain a balanced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>



Budget.  This financially prudent policy of living within

our means is an excellent one to adopt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very clear signal of the style of the

Government:  that  it is a level-headed and  clear-minded

one which is at the same time sensitive to the worries of

the  people.  It will strengthen the public's  confidence

in  the  Government.  At the same time, the  decision  to

retain  the entire relief package, while only phasing  in

the  GST increase, shows that the Government is also very

generous in this instance to retain the measures to  help

the  poorer people. Therefore, the Government has a  feel

for the poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by reiterating my

support for the proposed amendment and the choice of  the

Government  to  adopt the phased-in GST approach.   I  am

very gratified to note with pride that we have a rational

and responsive Government in charge which is also closely

attuned to the plight and worries of the people.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

let  me  first,  like other hon. Members of  this  House,

thank the Minister for Finance for having listened to the

people and modifying the planned GST hike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, like education and many other

issues before this House, the GST hike, which is what the

Bill  is  concerned with, is, in my view,  not  "if"  but

"when" and "how".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "if", the Minister for Finance has already

given  this  House  and the people of  Singapore  several

reasons  for the need to raise GST, such as the  need  to

attract  and retain talent, as well as the fact  that  we

are increasingly facing an ageing population and that the

tax  base  will  diminish concurrently as the  burden  on

public  finances  to  fund  health  care  rises.    These

factors,  coupled  with the anticipated  slower  economic

growth in the medium term, produce compelling reasons why

Singapore  needs  to broaden its tax  base  and  increase

indirect taxes like GST whilst reducing direct taxes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to note that with the

increase  in GST from 3% to 5%, our rate remains  one  of

the  lowest among nations that have implemented GST.  For

instance, the standard GST or VAT rate is 17 1/2% in  the

UK,  12  1/2%  in  New Zealand, 10% in  Korea,  5-10%  in

Taiwan, 5% in Japan, and 7% in Thailand.  The hike to  5%

is, thus, not misaligned from this perspective.  In fact,

it is clear that almost all agree that the GST rate would

have to go up.  No question about this.  The question  is

when.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "when", coming after a series of price hikes

in  transport fares, utilities, parking charges and  even

garbage collection fees, the ground feel is naturally one

of consternation, sharply heightened by the poor economic

conditions  and the spectre of even more unemployment  in

the  streets.  Although the Government has said that  the

offset  package will more than cover the increase in  GST

and  that  it  will  be expansionary,  many  Singaporeans

remain unconvinced, as the Minister for Finance has noted

earlier.   One Singaporean, in an unpublished  letter  to

the  press,  noted that whilst more than  a  million  CPF

account   holders  have  withdrawn  their  New  Singapore

Shares,  stallholders have at the same  time  reported  a

drastic  drop in businesses by up to 80%.  Hence,  he  is

sceptical that the offset package will be expansionary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have had quite a number of residents who

have asked me to appeal to the Town Council and Singapore

Power,  amongst others, to ask for deferment  of  payment

until  they  have encashed their NSS or ERS.  Thus,  many

lower income residents are in fact using the NSS and  ERS

as  a lifeline to tide over their financial difficulties,

and  pay  for essential household bills, school fees  and

textbooks.   The  expansionary impact of the  GST  offset

package is thus likely to be less than expected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the oft-cited view that there is never a good

time  to  raise taxes.  Indeed, they say that  death  and

taxes are the only two certainties in life.  One argument

for  a  2003  hike  is that foreign investors  will  lose

confidence in the Government's ability to keep its  word,

since the hike was already

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



announced  in  the 2002 Budget Statement  as  part  of  a

package  of  measures  to  restructure  our  tax  regime.

Therefore,   any   delay  could  be  construed   by   the

international community as succumbing to people  pressure

against  the  long-term interest  of  the  country.   And

because  the Government is not populist, we will have  to

do  what we say we will do.  Sir, this Government is  not

one that reneges on its word.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am proud to note that when the GST was first

introduced in 1993, this Government promised to hold  the

GST  rate  at  3%  for five years and  it  has  kept  its

promise.   On the other hand, breaking a similar  promise

now,  ie, deferring the planned hike, would be easier  to

do  because of the political backlash of being a promise-keeper.   Nonetheless, Sir, I am delighted,  and  so  are

many  other  Singaporeans, that after  habitually  saying

"The  answer is no" and "The answer is still no" on  many

occasions, this Government is now finally saying "Let  us

consider  because  of  the  changed  circumstances"  and,

indeed, it has modified the planned hike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that this means the Government is

bowing  to populist pressure.  Rather, it shows that  the

Government is not afraid to bend, if it is satisfied that

there  are  good reasons to do so and, indeed, there  are

good reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the votes - and, as Mdm Ho noted

earlier,  the bets - were split as to which  of  the  two

options was preferred.  Nonetheless, I feel - and I think

the  Government feels that too - that there  could  be  a

tilt towards the phased-in scheme, which I am pleased the

Minister  for  Finance has announced the  Government  has

opted for.  Phasing in shows that the Government is  firm

in its policy, yet flexible in responding to the economic

and  political  environment.   Most  would  welcome  some

reprieve,  real  or imagined, from the full  increase  in

rate.  As one retailer noted, "every bit helps".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to highlight that some

businessmen, particularly those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



who are not registered for GST, feel that due to the poor

economic conditions and strong competition, they  may  be

forced  to  absorb the 1% increase in GST,  thus  further

squeezing  their  already razor-thin  margins,  as  their

clients  would  say,  "Since it is only  1%,  you  should

absorb it."  In fact, a few businessmen actually told  me

that  their preference was for the Government to increase

the  rate to 5% straightaway, and then provide additional

help  to those in need.  They feel that there is not much

difference between a 1% and 2% hike, and we might as well

take  the  pain straight and face up to the realities  of

the  harsh economic conditions and aggressive competition

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the option of increasing the GST to the full 5%,

but  with more help to low income families, could have  a

higher  political cost, since there would be  groups  who

will  not  benefit  significantly or  directly  from  any

offset package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the current experience has shown that

even though theoretically many individuals should not  be

worse off due to the two-percentage point GST increase as

the  relief  package should cushion the  blow,  many  are

still upset as they perceive this to be yet another hike.

Many  also  tend  to  divorce the  GST  hike  and  relief

package,  and feel that the two are separate matters.   I

am  pleased to note that the Government has taken heed of

these sentiments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "how", as the Government has chosen the

phased-in  scheme, I urge the Government to give  careful

thought to mitigating the pain, especially on two groups:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) smaller businesses which do not benefit from the

lower direct tax regime and will find themselves squeezed

by consumers because of weak demand to absorb all or part

of the increase; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) lower income groups struggling to eke out an

existence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must continue to find ways to help

small businesses to lower their costs, as many which  are

yet to be profitable would not benefit from the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>



corporate  tax  cuts, while those who are struggling  and

making   marginal   profits   will   also   not   benefit

significantly  from the new tax regime.  Rental  rebates,

lower   property   taxes,  grants   for   upgrading   the

businesses, or even attractive financing packages,  could

be   further  extended  to  such  businesses  which   are

struggling in the current economic conditions  but  which

are otherwise fundamentally sound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower income group is struggling due to the poor

economic  conditions as well as the structural change  in

the  employment  landscape which  renders  many  who  are

unskilled  redundant  in the labour  market.   They  will

continue  to  need  help as long as the economic  outlook

remains bleak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted earlier, many are in fact using their NSS

and  ERS  as  lifelines to tide them over  the  financial

difficulties.   We need to continue to  help  this  group

remain  employable through retraining as well as  through

job creation.

At  the end of the day, Sir, the groundswell against  the

GST hike stems most acutely from the fact that we are  in

the  midst of a recession, and the livelihood of ordinary

citizens are at risk.  There is really never a good  time

to  raise taxes, but the people of Singapore will need to

take  a  calm  and  rational look at  the  grim  economic

realities  affecting the long-term future of our  country

that is at the core of the Government's tax policy.   But

the immediate pain, though alleviated through the phased-in  approach, still cannot be lightly dismissed.  I would

urge  the  Government  to consider additional  off-Budget

relief measures to help Singaporeans and businesses  tide

over their cash flow difficulties if the economy worsens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying the when and how of the GST implementation

would  clearly help to restore the people's faith in  the

Government  and,  barring  any  other  Government  policy

announcements, will be a good note on which  to  end  the

year.   It  will  certainly add cheer to  the  Hari  Raya

festive season tomorrow.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, there has been a great deal of  debate  by

the   people  of  Singapore  and  politicians  about  the

proposed increase in the Goods and Services Tax  from  3%

to  5%  as proposed in clause 3 of the Goods and Services

Tax  (Amendment) Bill which seeks to amend section 16  of

the  Goods  and Services Tax Act.  The Hon. Deputy  Prime

Minister has kindly proposed an amendment which I am sure

is most welcomed by this House and the people residing in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original proposal of an increase to 5% is

substantially  more  than 66% increase  and  the  general

sentiment   coming  from  our  citizenry   is   that   of

unhappiness.    Now,   it  is   an   increase   of   33%.

Unfortunately, the economic climate in the  recent  past,

present  and  in  the  immediate  future  is  bleak   and

therefore the difficulty in being able to support such  a

proposal.  In a recent local radio survey, around 80%  of

the  listeners were against the increase in GST  at  this

time.    Only   20%  supported  such  a  proposal.    The

psychological impact of the proposed increase is  one  of

hopelessness on the part of citizens once the  Government

decides  to  go  ahead with an increase in  any  form  of

taxation.   The  spirit of the people and the  nation  is

down  and our Government must take serious note  of  this

and  not just pay lip service to it, as perceived by many

people.   Today,  as  a  result  of  the  amendment,  the

Government would be perceived to be more caring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political leadership must be compassionate and

must feel for the sentiments of its people and not be too

logical  and pragmatic all the time.  Even a logical  and

pragmatic  Government,  as  seen  today,  may  not,  when

analysed  in future, turn out to be correct and  accurate

in  their  decisions.  The Government's main argument  in

support of the proposed increase in GST is that it  needs

to  balance the budget.  It is easy and convenient to say

that the budget of the nation needs to be balanced.   The

issue  is  whether that is a top priority when times  are

bad.   This  move  may  cause the budgets  of  the  other

sectors  of  our  society, namely, that of  lay  persons,

retailers, manufacturers, service providers, etc, to have

difficulty in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>



balancing  their respective budgets.  Which  then  is  to

prevail?   Only the Cabinet can decide this.   They  have

the  power  to do so, not the citizenry. Cabinet  members

would  have,  hopefully,  given serious  and  independent

thoughts to this proposed increase, be it 1% or 2%.   Was

it  an  unanimous decision or were there differing  views

amongst Cabinet Ministers and even senior civil servants?

It  would be interesting to get a revelation of the minds

of  different  Cabinet Ministers on  this  topic  of  GST

increase.   It may not be the practice to give individual

Cabinet  members'  views but such  a  practice  could  be

revealed  to see how the Cabinet works and how they  came

to  the  conclusion  that there should  be  an  increase,

albeit  it is now in two phases of 4% in 2003 and  5%  in

2004 and subsequent years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government may want to balance the national

budget  purely  to have a clean record  of  never  having

failed  to  have balanced budgets these past  few  years.

However,  it  may  be preferable not to have  a  balanced

budget  in  a  year  where  the nation  has  fared  badly

economically.   Citizens generally are taking  home  less

this  year.  So should not the State too take home  less?

It  would assist the spirit of the citizens for  them  to

know  that  our  Government  does  care  and  is  not   a

government   that   is  purely  and   coldly   efficient,

especially  during poor economic times. We  must  give  a

boost  to  our national spirit and not create unhappiness

with  more  taxes when there is sadness and gloom  facing

our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cabinet has decided, the people and Members of

Parliament can debate in detail all the pros and cons  of

an increase in GST.  However, it makes little difference.

All  I  can do is register my point for what it is worth.

I propose that the clause proposing an increase in GST be

deleted  from the proposed amendment and let there  be  a

review  of  an increase in GST only if times are  better,

and only in the second half of 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this reservation, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the  other proposed amendments, namely, clauses 2,  4,  6

and 7.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Second

Reading  of this GST (Amendment) Bill was postponed  last

week,  I,  like  many  others, felt  that  something  was

brewing.  While I would say that there were some  of  us,

including myself, who were hoping that the increase of 2%

would  be  fully deferred for at least six  months  to  a

year, I must say that the change in plans to increase  it

by  only  1% next year and another 1% in 2004 come  as  a

pleasant surprise to us.  While I would not say that what

the Government is forgoing is ikan bilis, I would like to

say that perhaps we should be grateful for little mercies

that do come our way sometimes from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot has changed since the Government first

announced  the  GST  increase during the  Budget  debate.

Unemployment has now reached an all time high of 4.8% and

this  is  expected to rise to as much as 5.5% very  soon.

There  are  therefore now more Singaporeans without  jobs

than in March.  Without jobs means without any source  of

income.  Like  every  one else, all the  people  who  are

unemployed have to face the other increases such  as  the

bus and MRT fares, hospital charges, utilities bills, car

park charges, etc, that we have to put up with this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the employed are of course not much better off.

If  they are not already faced with uncertainty of losing

their  jobs tomorrow, they have now been told by the  NWC

and  the  NTUC to be prepared for further wage  cuts.  We

still do not know what the economic outlook will be  like

next  year.   Our forecasts for economic  growth  are  as

reliable  as  the  weatherman's, and had  to  be  revised

several  times  this  year.  Singaporeans  are  therefore

tightening  their  belts and they want to  save  whatever

money  they  can save for a rainy day and for some,  that

rainy day has probably arrived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a bit concerned whether in fact there will

be a kind of retraction of the economy even though we are

told  that the Government is pumping in more money during

this  difficult  period.  We must not under-estimate  the

impact  of  a negative multiplier effect on the  economy.

Our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>



retail  sector  has  already been suffering  for  several

years.  Whether you are a big store in one of our Orchard

Road  shopping  malls or a shop in an  HDB  estate  or  a

market  stall, you would, in all probability,  have  been

suffering from a declining business.  If we just  take  a

look at the frequent changes in the tenants of shops,  we

can  get  a  feel of how difficult it must  be  for  each

previous tenant.  If Singaporeans now tighten their purse

strings further, the situation is likely to worsen in the

months ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make the point that one million

people  have already cashed in their New Singapore Shares

and  they  did so in spite of knowing that they would  be

forgoing  an  annual  3% Government-guaranteed  dividend,

even  more if there is strong economic growth.   This  to

me,  Sir, is a pity.  We can empathise with them because,

if  what  we know on the ground is correct, many  did  so

because  they  need the money today to pay for  household

expenses  or  to  settle  their  arrears  such  as  their

utilities  bills and other expenses, in other  words,  to

pay  for  very  basic needs.  It is a reflection  of  how

tough  life  must be for them.  A lot of the money  which

was given out would eventually go back to Government,  in

fact, very quickly.  So I am really concerned whether  in

fact  there  would  be  any expansionary  effect  on  the

economy in spite of the Government giving away the amount

that it has announced that it is giving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would urge the Government to consider

again reinstating the EDRS very quickly, in spite of what

the  Deputy  Prime Minister told us that in  a  difficult

situation, we need to give out such schemes, but  if  the

emergency  is  no longer there, we need to  withdraw  the

scheme  and  reinstate it at a later  date.   What  I  am

concerned is the fact that we do have 100,000-odd  people

who are unemployed now and there is no guarantee that the

employment  situation is improving.   I  would  therefore

strongly urge the Government to consider reinstating  the

EDRS because I am sure that there will still be a lot  of

unemployed people who will be coming to MPs during  their

meet-the-people sessions looking for help.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> I do not have very much to

add other than to just expand on a few points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the DPM for what he has spoken about as far

as  the  amendment in the Bill is concerned.   Like  some

Members  of the House, it would have been good  to  defer

the  2% and review the whole thing in the year 2004,  the

reason  being that for quite a number of us, we  are  not

savvy enough to totally understand how increasing GST  by

2% can improve the economy or help to balance the budget,

and why that becomes very pertinent.  Perhaps, there is a

greater  need  to  try and be more communicative  to  the

population at large so that they can be in sync with what

Government's intentions are and understand why the 2%  is

important, and now the reduced rate of 1%.  I know it has

been said many times but I think I am quite naive in this

area of money matters and I am sure there are many others

out  there  like me.  It would be good to have a  greater

and clearer explanation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the point that I raised earlier on

the  VWOs,  I appeal that we do reconsider the  situation

where  they are concerned, especially when they have  big

item  expenditures  and  are no longer  entitled  to  the

Ministry of Finance's grant to offset the GST.  From 1994

to  1999, they have been receiving a $2.7 million  grant.

This  has  helped  about  42 to  60  VWOs.   What  a  GST

imposition really means is that for recovering $7 million

in terms of donations, it can come up to $200,000 in GST,

which  can  stall quite a number of their  programmes  as

well  as  plans.  So I appeal that we do not  forget  the

VWOs in this instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that, as I mentioned earlier, it

is  not  that  I  am asking for a more generous  package.

There  are  quite a number of people in crisis.   I  have

asked earlier in the House about the number of people who

are  receiving  aid for the period from April  2000-March

2001.  The figure that was given - thanks to the Ministry

of Community Development and Sports - was 5,265.  For the

same  period, April 2001-March 2002, it has already  gone

up to 14,950.  For that year, about 15,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>



people  have  received  $15  million  in  different   aid

packages.   It  is  good that they are already  receiving

quite  a  lot of help. Nevertheless, add into this,  like

what  Mr Tan has mentioned, 100,000 people are unemployed

who are not sure when they are going to get the next job,

I  think these are the people in crisis.  Although it  is

an  increase of only 1% and in, real terms, it may not be

very  much,  I  think  we need to monitor  how  they  are

affected,  and to work out how the criteria schemes  that

we  use  currently to help these people  can  perhaps  be

broadened and to monitor the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some programmes on the ground such as IUP,

etc,  that  are  perhaps imminent in some constituencies.

In  this present situation, I think people will be  quite

perturbed to have new initiatives coming where they  have

to  take money out of the pocket and perhaps have to face

the  GST  hike  which  will  be  incorporated  into  such

programmes.   Perhaps it is also a good  time  to  review

whether it is necessary to go ahead with such programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, it is wonderful that institutions like NTUC

Fairprice  will absorb the GST, but it also begs  another

question.  What about the small-time retailers in the HDB

heartlands?  They may not be in a situation to absorb the

GST hike.  Maybe we need to keep an eye and also see that

they too can survive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

said  earlier, I applaud DPM Lee for the steps  taken  to

phase  in  this GST increase.  However, I would  like  to

state again that I still believe that the GST should  not

be increased totally, not even by 1%.  But, as I said, it

is still better than a 2% increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the efforts and plans to cut

Government expenditure and spend wisely.  I think this is

a very good move and a great emphasis has to be done.  As

DPM  Lee  had said earlier, the economic recovery outlook

was fair when this idea was first proposed and debated in

May.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>



The  assumption was that the ERS and offset packages will

more  than neutralise this GST increase of 2%.   However,

instead  of looking brighter, the economy may be  turning

for  the  worse and getting uncertain.  This is  probably

the  worst  economic  period we are going  to  see  since

independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is affected by this economic slowdown.

But,  like what Mdm Halimah said earlier, the groups that

are  most  affected are the SMEs, the retailers  and  the

small business owners, and their continued survival  will

impact  on the level of unemployment and wealth  creation

in  this  society.  With a drastic decline in consumption

power  and  still  very high business  cost,  the  retail

industry  is  the  worst  off and  hardest  hit  in  this

instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I appreciate the Government's plan not to

increase  the  GST fully to 5% now.  The  upturn  in  the

NODEX  does  not indicate a change of business  sentiment

for   the   better.   Even  as  we  speak,  the  economic

indicators  in the US are beginning to turn  down  again.

On  balance,  the Government has not put  additional  and

undue burden of 2% increase at this difficult time on our

small  retailers.  I can only hope that this 1%  increase

in  GST  will  not be the straw that breaks  the  camel's

back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This additional cost of doing business will have to

be  absorbed most likely by the small businesses that are

not  GST-registered.  This may cause some of these  small

businesses,  especially some of the new businesses  which

are already suffering, to consider closing down and cause

higher unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate DPM Lee's understanding of the problems

in the retail sector.  The retail sector is very fragile.

Consumer  confidence  is very fragile.   There  are  many

retailers  still  struggling  to  survive  and  many  are

seriously thinking of closing shop.  If forced to survive

in  this harsh environment, many will be forced to review

the  one  area of expenditure over which they  have  some

measure  of control, and that is labour cost.   With  the

retail sector employing more than 75,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>



workers,  any untimely increase of the GST to  2%  during

this period of economic recession will definitely lead to

further job losses and cause more unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe to the Government and civil servants, this is

just  an  increase in the statistics.  But to the  person

who   is   retrenched,  it  means  job  loss,   financial

insecurity and lots of bills will go unpaid.  It  affects

not  just  the  employee  but his  immediate  family  and

friends  who will then pull back and tighten their  belts

even  further.  And, irrationally, the retrenched  worker

will  remember that he is jobless because the company  is

forced  to  cut costs, because times are bad and  GST  is

still  increased.  But, now, I am happy to say  that  the

Government  has listened to the cries of the people.   My

only hope is that the GST rate will stay at the 4% level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the economy and save jobs, demand should be

stimulated  in  this difficult time.  Thus,  keeping  the

offset packages and giving out the ERS shares is one step

in  this  right direction.  It is expansionary  and  will

help   to  boost  the  economy.   The  priority  in  this

uncertain time should be, first, saving existing jobs and

then creating more of others.  I thank the Government for

not forgetting that this is what it pledged to the people

at the November elections last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not help that the economic tax restructuring

may  create some new high-tech jobs but, in the  process,

cause many more traditional jobs especially in retail, to

be  lost.   As  it is, there is already a high  job/skill

mismatch  in  Singapore.  Let us not  make  it  worse  by

causing   more   traditional  jobs   to   be   lost   for

Singaporeans, while more foreign workers are employed  to

fill the high-tech new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though not completely satisfied or ideal, I

will  reluctantly support the Government  in  phasing  in

this GST increase and hope that it will be reviewed after

one year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir,

for allowing me to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not here when the Minister for Finance

announced that the full 2%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



increase  in GST will not be implemented, but  rather  to

phase  in 1% increase first, and the other one percentage

point I do not know when.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 2004.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Anyway, with the 1% increase, I

still  think that the majority of Singaporeans  shall  be

entering  the New Year with long faces.  If there  is  no

increase, then it will be a big welcome for the New Year.

Even   now,   many  Singaporeans  are  already  suffering

hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious thing is that if the Government is not

very certain whether to increase it by 2% or 1%, why does

it  want  to  go  on  with  the  increase  at  all?   The

Government complains that it would lose revenue.  I think

it  is something like $1.3 billion from the reduction  in

corporate and personal income tax.  But now, probably  it

has changed its mind and said that it can absorb some  of

the  losses.   Therefore, not a 2% increase but  only  1%

increase in GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the Government has got huge surpluses

and  it is definitely not in deficit.  But as Jennie Tay,

President  of the Retailers' Association, has  said,  the

people  and  businesses  in  Singapore  are  already   in

deficit.  In  fact,  during my meet-the-people  sessions,

many of the residents have come to tell me that they have

lost their jobs and that they cannot pay their children's

school  fees  and their utilities bills.   As  a  result,

their lights and water supply were cut off.  I am certain

that  there  must be many others with a similar  fate  in

other  constituencies.  Those families, with  lights  and

water  supply cut off, are not living in the first world,

as  the PAP has touted.  But they are still living in the

third  world  without  the  benefit  of  electricity  and

running  water from the taps in their homes.   At  least,

when  Singapore  was in the third world, residents  could

still  go to the roadside standpipe to take water.  These

days,  there is no public water supply.  They must go  to

their neighbours for water which can be very embarrassing

to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy, of course, that the 2% GST increase

has not been implemented,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



but  only  1%.   Still,  1% is 1%  more  than  is  really

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in Singapore have lost their jobs. It

was  reported  in  the papers that about  4.8%  or  about

100,000  of  our workers are unemployed and the  economic

situation  does  not look good and the situation  is  not

improving.  There is talk of double dip this  year.   The

war   in  Iraq  is  looming  and  oil  prices  may   rise

drastically, which does not help the US economy  at  all,

and  which is not good for us because our businesses  are

dependent on the US economy.  The economies of the region

are  also in dire straits and, in the circumstances, they

do not help us either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have written to the press and say that

this  GST increase does not help us at all.  In fact,  in

this  difficult  time, the people must be  encouraged  to

spend  and  not  save.   And  if  the  GST  increase   is

implemented  in  full,  there will  definitely  be  price

increases  in  goods and services.  With higher  consumer

prices, of course, people will spend less.  In these hard

economic  times, people should be encouraged to spend  so

as  to  revive  the economy, and not to spend  less.   It

would appear that if the GST were to be increased by  1%,

the  Government is, in fact, making things worse and  not

better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all of our retailers, from statistics taken

by  the  Straits Times in a recent poll, complained  that

businesses  are  poor  and the  rentals  are  high.   The

Government, being the biggest land owner in Singapore, is

not  setting  an example of lowering rentals of  business

premises.  In fact, the Government's policy appears to me

to be just to accumulate wealth for itself.  The question

is:   what  is  the point of accumulating so much  wealth

when  it  does not use it in time of need for the people?

The  people are definitely in need of assistance now  and

the Government should show some care and compassion.  And

I  would  advocate that the Government not only continues

with the various relief programmes, pay out the ERS,  and

as announced now, it has put on hold 1% of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



the  GST  increase, something of course  is  better  than

completely nothing, so 1% is some improvement on  the  2%

increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if the 2% implementation of the GST

was  postponed for one year, it would definitely help the

economy,  and  especially  the  retailers  will  be   the

happiest  people  in  Singapore.   If  there  is  a  hike

restraint, to a certain extent it will ease the  flow  of

Singaporeans to Johor Bahru to do their shopping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent the Government has heeded the plea of

the  people  this  time, but the point  I  think  I  made

earlier  is  that if the Government is unsure of  itself,

why does it want to increase the GST at all?

<br>2.18 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Members for their contributions.  May I now pick out some

of the points which they raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor talked about small businesses and the

need  to  give them rental rebates.  I agree.  These  are

things  which  are  being done by JTC  and  HDB.   It  is

separate from the GST package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan talked about why balance the

budget.  I think this is quite a fundamental point.   Why

do  we  need  to  live within our means  to  balance  the

budget?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's fiscal stance is one which we have

to   fit  to  the  state  of  the  economy  and  to   our

circumstances.  We can live beyond our means for a   time

or in an emergency, but eventually the chickens come home

to roost and we have to pay for what we have spent.  When

the  economy  is  in a recession, and there  is  a  major

downturn, then it is right for us to run a budget deficit

because  you cannot raise the same amount of  taxes,  you

are  going  to squeeze businesses, you need to  stimulate

the economy, get it going again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the economy is at an even keel, it is not in a

recession,  if  you routinely run a budget  deficit,  you

will have a very serious problem because soon you will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>



borrowing  money, your credit will not be worth  what  it

says  it  is,  and  as I have explained  just  now,  your

Singapore dollar will go down, inflation will go up, your

savings,  the value will go too, because your CPF  is  in

Singapore  dollars, and if the dollars  are  worth  less,

your  savings will be worth less.  So when we live within

our  means, and try and maintain a balanced budget,  say,

next year, it is because we think that is about the right

level   to   manage  the  economy  and  to  provide   the

stimulation which is needed, not more, not less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we are not running a surplus, contrary to

what  Mr Chiam said.  We are running a deficit this year.

We also ran a deficit last year.  But next year, I think,

at  best, we can do a balanced budget, if you have  heard

what I said.  I said I do not think we are going to get a

surplus, at best, we aim for a balanced budget.  We  try,

but we will have to see the circumstances in order to  do

it.   If we go on the basis that we can spend because  we

have  reserves, I think the reserves will soon  be  gone,

and Singaporeans will be much the sadder for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we do have to be sympathetic and we have to feel

with  our hearts as well as think with our minds, but  it

is necessary to be logical and pragmatic and I am sure Mr

Chandra Mohan, as a lawyer, will agree that logic is  not

irrelevant, and that is why we have to work out a package

which  makes sense, which is what we have proposed  -  to

phase in the increase but not to postpone it altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon was generally supportive of the

change we made and I am grateful to him for skipping many

pages of his speech.  We too know how to be grateful  for

small  mercies.  I should like to correct one point which

Mr Tan made which was that unemployment is up 4.8%, it is

a record, and it is 100,000 people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is not a record because we have

been  more than 4.8% before, for example, in the  1985/86

recession, we went all the way up to 6%.  Secondly, it is

not  100,000 unemployed.  It is 72,000 people unemployed.

4.8% is a seasonally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



adjusted  percentage, but the actual number of people  is

72,000 unemployed.  Mr Chiam also quoted 100,000.  72,000

is  more  than we would like to have, but we  should  not

exaggerate  the extent of our problem and talk  ourselves

into a gloom and a funk.  The saving grace for us is that

even  though  people are unemployed, the  work  is  still

available,  jobs  are  still available.   We  still  have

foreign workers here because employers are unable to find

Singaporeans to go and do the jobs.  And particularly the

smaller  and  medium enterprises who  would  like  to  do

business on a small scale, they find it very hard to  get

Singaporeans  to go and work for them.  Maybe  the  hours

are  a bit irregular, maybe the wages are a bit low,  but

if  you  are  unemployed, and a job  is  available,  then

better  to have the job rather than not to do it at  all.

And  I  think our solution for the unemployment  problem,

while we have to help those who are in a desperate state,

at  the same time, we have to encourage all of the people

who  are out of work to look for work and to take up  the

jobs which are available and some of them which they  can

do, even if it is not ideal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So although Mr Tan talked about reinstating the

EDRS, as I had explained earlier, I think that we do  not

need  to  do it for now because we have enough  means  to

help the unemployed and the people who need help.  But if

there  is  another crisis we will examine  the  situation

and, if it is necessary, we will re-introduce the EDRS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema talked about reviewing the HDB upgrading

programme because that would be additional expenditure by

people  at this time.  I think it is something which  the

Minister for National Development will be considering and

which  many MPs will be considering when the propositions

are put to them because finally to do the upgrading, main

upgrading or lift upgrading, the residents have  to  vote

for  it and have to agree to want it.  And if they do not

want  it, it does not proceed.  If the MP says it is  not

necessary  even to put it to the residents,  you  do  not

proceed.   But some residents still want it, and  if  you

will remember

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>



earlier  this  afternoon,  we  were  talking  about  lift

upgrading  and some MPs were pressing us to proceed  even

though  the  residents did not vote for it.  So  I  think

there  are  contradictory pushes in different directions,

but overall we will have to see how many of the upgrading

programmes  we  can afford because it is not  just  money

from the people, it is money from the Government, and  in

tough times we have to consider how many we can afford.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema, Steve Chia and other MPs talked about the

small retailers and their problems.  I think Dr Amy  Khor

also  made  the same point.  As I had explained  earlier,

they  do  have a structural problem which will take  some

time  to  be worked out.  The Members are concerned  that

the  extra  one percentage point on the GST  will  affect

them.   I think it may, to some extent, but on the  other

hand,  they are not totally negatively affected.  Let  me

explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1% applies to all businesses - big and small.

The  big  ones have to pay, the small ones have  to  pay,

most of it, but not all of it.  And the reason is because

the small ones whose turnover is less than $1 million  do

not  pay  GST on their own part of their business.   They

are GST exempt.  So in fact when you raise the GST by one

percentage point the big shops are affected more severely

than  the  small shops.  So, relatively speaking,  it  is

better  off for the small shops than before.  Of  course,

everybody  would feel happier if we did not  have  to  do

this  at  all.  But if we do have to do it, in fact,  the

burden on the small shop is less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not quite sure how Dr Amy Khor intended me to

respond  when she said that 1% they cannot  pass  on,  2%

they can pass on.  Does that mean she prefer to have a 2%

increase and that would solve the retailers' problem?   I

do not think so.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Some businessmen prefer

that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Some businessmen prefer that!

Well,  if she thinks that is a better solution,  when  we

move the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>



amendment in the Committee stage I think we can look into

the  matter.  She might want to express her views  again.

We could even take a vote.  But I think 1% is better than

2%.   There is some inconvenience.  The businessmen  have

also  expressed  it,  that  they  have  to  adjust  their

settings, their pricings, twice, but it cannot be helped.

These are trade-offs they have to accept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chiam talked about showing care and

compassion  and how the poor in Singapore are not  living

in  the  first  world.  I think Mr Chiam will  know  that

while   we  need  to  improve  the  conditions  for   all

Singaporeans,   and  especially  for  poor  Singaporeans,

somebody living in Singapore, however poor, is in a much,

much  better position than somebody living in China poor,

or in Indonesia poor, or in India poor, or poor in nearly

any  better part of the world, including in America.   We

have  gone  into  this before.  You  may  not  have  your

running  water every day if you do not pay,  but  you  do

have  your running water available.  You do have a  house

over  your head.  Your children have schools.   You  have

medical  care provided for you.  You have a  Medifund  if

you  cannot afford hospital charges.  Your MP looks after

you and come New Year, the MPs and the residents arrange,

and  you  have hong baos and hampers, and I  am  sure  Mr

Chiam  also arranges those.  We have a community in which

the poor are part of our community and we look after them

and  we carry them along with us and help them to upgrade

as the rest of Singapore upgrades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we say that this system has failed, I think

we  should  look  at the reality and do a  reality  check

rather  than  just read off some speech  which  does  not

correspond to what is happening on the ground.   We  have

made  a  significant move to phase out the GST - 4%  this

year, 5% on 1st January 2004.  I would not hold out hopes

to  Members  that come 1st January 2004 we are  going  to

have  a  rethink and reconsider again.   I  am  sure  the

subject will be discussed, but I should put down my cards

clearly  to Members so that there is no misunderstanding.

This is an adjustment which we are making this time so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>



that  we will take it in small steps.  1% is a small step

next year.  1% in 2004 is another small step.  We have to

do  it.  We will have to adjust other things if there are

difficulties  in the economy next year,  but  this  is  a

structural change which will help us to get out  of  this

problem,  which  will help us to create  more  jobs,  and

which  will  help us to recover and to grow in  the  long

term.   That is why I ask Members to support this  policy

and to support the amendment I am going to propose.

<div align="center"><b>REGISTRATION OF CRIMINALS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Registration of Criminals

Act   to  establish  a  Deoxyribonucleic  Acid  (or  DNA)

database  of  criminals.   The Bill  also  makes  several

amendments to update the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registration of Criminals Act provides for the

registration of criminals.  The Act enables the Police to

record   into  the  Register  of  Criminals,  registrable

particulars  such as the photograph, finger  impressions,

and  conviction records of persons convicted  of  serious

crimes  like  robbery,  assault and  housebreaking.   The

Register  of Criminals is a very useful tool  which  aids

Police  investigations.  The registrable particulars  are

especially  useful  in  helping the  Police  to  identify

suspects.   For example, finger impressions  lifted  from

crime  scenes  are  matched  against  finger  impressions

recorded  in  the Register, thus helping  the  Police  to

narrow  down the list of suspects.  The court also  makes

use  of  these criminal records when sentencing a  repeat

offender.

<br><br><i>Setting up of DNA Database</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we want to set up a DNA database? Sir, the

setting  up  of a DNA database of criminals will  greatly

enhance  the  Police's investigative  capabilities.   The

probability of two persons having identical DNA  profiles

is  extremely low, and could be as remote  as  one  in  a

billion,  depending  on the race  of  the  person.   Body

samples,  such as blood, semen and tissue samples,  found

at the crime scenes can be used to profile the DNA of the

person  to whom the body sample belongs.  Through  a  DNA

database  of criminals, Police will be able to  determine

if a body sample found at the crime scene belongs to an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



ex-criminal.   When  a  suspect is found,  it  will  also

enable  the Police to match the DNA profile with that  of

the  suspect  to  help  narrow down  the  list  of  crime

suspects.   This  is especially useful  in  investigating

crimes with very few leads for the Police to work on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of DNA profiling to enhance forensic

capability  in  solving crime is not  new.   Foreign  law

enforcement  agencies, such as those in the  US,  UK  and

Australia,  have been using DNA profiling for many  years

and DNA databases have been set up in these countries  to

aid police investigations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill gives effect to the

establishment of the DNA database and the taking of  body

samples for the purpose of DNA profiling.  Clause 5  also

specifies  the  purposes  for  which  the  collected  DNA

information may be used, namely, for forensic  comparison

with  other  DNA information and for any proceedings  for

any offence.

<br><br><i>Definition of Body Sample</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a body sample? Sir, a body sample is

defined as a sample of blood, head hair with follicle and

a  swab  taken from a person's mouth.  Clause 5  empowers

the  Minister to prescribe the taking of any  other  body

samples, such as saliva and skin cells.  This is to cater

for  instances where it is not possible to obtain any one

of  the three types of body samples from a person because

the  person  is a haemophiliac and suffering from  severe

mouth  ulcers or is bald.  However, there would  be  very

few  cases where we would not be able to take any one  of

the three types of body samples from a person.

<br><br><i>Persons whom Body Samples may be taken from</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can Police take body samples from? Clause 5

also  empowers  the Police to take a body sample  from  a

person  who is arrested and accused of a crime  specified

in the Act.  This ensures that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



Police  is  able  to  compare the  accused  person's  DNA

information with the DNA evidence found at the scene of a

crime.  A body sample may also be taken from a person who

is  convicted  of  a  crime or is  currently  serving  an

imprisonment  term.   However, those who  have  completed

their  sentences when the Act comes into  operation  will

not be included as the Act will not apply retrospectively

to this group of criminals.

<br><br><i>Who can give a Body Sample Voluntarily?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 also provides for persons who were at the

scene  of  a crime, or are being questioned in connection

with  the investigation of a crime, to give body  samples

voluntarily.   In  practice, this provision  would  apply

mostly to Police investigators who work at the scene of a

crime and is intended to eliminate their DNA from the DNA

found  at  the  scene.  The DNA from Police investigators

would  also be stored in the DNA database even after  the

case  is  closed.   This is because Police  investigators

would invariably investigate new cases and it is not cost

efficient  or  effective  to re-take  body  samples  from

Police investigators for DNA profiling.

<br><br><i>Who can take Body Samples?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 also provides that only trained persons,

such   as  a  registered  medical  practitioner   or   an

authorised officer, who have received training in  taking

body  samples,  can  do  so.   In  practice,  all  Police

officers  would be trained on the proper and safe  taking

of  body samples.  For example, Police officers would ask

a  person whether he is suffering from any blood disorder

or  blood-related  disease.  If the  person  informs  the

Police  officer  that he is a haemophiliac  or  suffering

from  other  blood-related disease,  the  Police  officer

would take either a sample of the head hair with follicle

or  a  swab from the person's mouth, rather than a  blood

sample.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Act makes it a duty for every person

legally  bound  to  submit to having his  photograph  and

finger impression taken to do so.  Any such person who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>



refuses  to  have  his photograph and  finger  impression

taken  shall  be  guilty  of an offence.   The  Act  also

empowers the Police to use necessary force to obtain  the

photograph and finger impression.  Clause 5 extends these

provisions to make them applicable to the taking of  body

samples as well.

<br><br><i>Consent for the taking of Blood Samples</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must consent be sought before the taking of blood

samples?   Yes, consent must first be obtained  before  a

blood  sample may be taken from a person who is  arrested

and  accused of a crime.  However, there is no  need  for

consent to be obtained before head hair with follicle  or

a  swab from a person's mouth is taken for the purpose of

DNA  profiling.  The difference in treatment  is  because

the  taking of blood from a person is more intrusive than

taking  of a head hair or a swab from the person's mouth.

If  a person refuses to give consent for his blood to  be

taken  and  offers  no good reason for the  refusal,  the

court may order the person to give the blood sample.  The

court may also draw inferences from the refusal and treat

the   refusal   as   corroboration,   or   amounting   to

corroboration, of any evidence against him.

<br><br><i>Persons Acquitted or Discharged</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to the body samples of persons

acquitted or discharged?  Currently, the Act requires the

Registrar  of  Criminals to destroy  the  photograph  and

finger  impression  of a person acquitted  or  discharged

within  three  months  from  the  date  of  acquittal  or

discharge.  Similarly, clause 5 requires the Registrar to

remove  the  DNA  information of a person  from  the  DNA

database   within  three  months  of  his  acquittal   or

discharge.    As  the  DNA  information  is   stored   in

electronic  form  in  the DNA database,  removal  of  the

information  from  the  database  is  equivalent  to  the

destruction of a physical record like a photograph.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the other amendments to

fine-tune and to update the Act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Other Amendments relating to the Keeping of Records</i>

<br><br><i>New Definitions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill introduces several new

definitions,   namely   "authorised   officer",    "other

particulars" and "photograph". Currently, only police and

customs  officers may exercise the powers under the  Act.

This  arrangement is not satisfactory because immigration

officers  have  to  seek  Police's  assistance  to   take

registrable   particulars   of   immigration    offenders

arrested.  Also, as the Health Sciences Authority will be

commissioned  to operate the DNA database, officers  from

the  Health  Sciences Authority must also be  allowed  to

take  body  samples.  The new definition  of  "authorised

officer"  has  thus  been amended to  cover  the  police,

immigration, customs and other law enforcement  officers,

and  a person so appointed by the Commissioner of Police.

While the power to take registrable particulars and  body

samples would be extended to all immigration officers and

officers from the Health Sciences Authority, in practice,

only  those  officers tasked with the  responsibility  to

take  registrable particulars and who have  received  the

proper training will be allowed to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, "registrable particulars" means the

particulars  of  any  conviction,  sentence,  banishment,

expulsion  or  deportation, and  any  name,  description,

photograph,  or  finger  impression  of  any  person   so

convicted, sentenced, banished, expelled or deported,  as

the  case may be.  However, the Act also empowers prisons

officers  to  record a more detailed description  of  the

prisoner  convicted of a crime, such as his sex,  age  or

apparent  age,  bodily  appearance,  height,  distinctive

marks  on  his  body and any other available  information

that helps to identify the prisoner.  Such information is

very  helpful in identifying a person, especially when  a

victim  is  trying  to identify the  culprit.   For  this

reason,  a  new  definition  of  "other  particulars"  is

proposed  to  enable  the authorised officers  to  record

information   other  than  the  registrable  particulars.

Also, a new definition of "photograph" is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>



proposed  to  enable  the  authorised  officers  to  take

photographs, including distinguishable body  marks,  such

as  tattoos  and  scars, which would be very  useful  for

identifying criminals.

<br><br><i>Upgrading of Automated Fingerprint Identification System</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police is upgrading the Automated Fingerprint

Identification  System, or AFIS in short,  to  allow  for

electronic   capturing  of  finger   impressions.    When

upgraded,  the new AFIS will enable Police to search  and

match   finger  impressions  more  quickly.    Currently,

sections  8,  9 and 10 of the Act make reference  to  the

sheet  of paper upon which the finger impression is made.

When the new AFIS is implemented, finger impressions will

be  captured electronically, instead of onto a  sheet  of

paper.  Clause 3 repeals and re-enacts sections 8, 9  and

10  to  do away with the reference to the sheet of  paper

upon which the finger impression is made.

<br><br><i>Increase  in penalty for refusal to submit to  taking  of photograph and finger impression</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current penalty for refusing, without

reasonable  excuse, to submit to the taking of photograph

and  finger impression is a fine not exceeding $250 or  a

maximum  imprisonment term of one month.   This  has  not

been  changed since 1949 when the Act was first  enacted.

Clause  4  therefore increases the fine to a  maximum  of

$1,000 to take into account rises in income level and  to

maintain the deterrent effect.  No change is proposed for

the imprisonment term.

<br><br><i>Removal  of registrable particulars of persons  aged  100 years or more</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Registrar would remove the

registrable  particulars  of  persons  whose   death   is

registered  under the Registration of Births  and  Deaths

Act.   However,  as  foreign offenders  who  die  do  not

register under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act,

the Register still

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>



contains  records of foreign persons who may have  passed

away.   For example, the Register now holds 18  names  of

foreign persons who are over 100 years old but the police

is  not  able to determine if these foreigners are  still

alive.   Clause  6  therefore empowers the  Registrar  to

remove  the registrable particulars from the register  of

criminals  and DNA information from the DNA  database  of

any  person  aged 100 years or older or whose  death  has

been  registered  under the Registration  of  Births  and

Deaths Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, technology advancements have opened new ways

for  us  to  fight crime.  The police must harness  these

technological  advances to enhance  its  capabilities  to

stay  ahead  of  criminals.  The  DNA  database  and  the

upgrading of the AFIS will go a long way in improving the

police's ability to fight and solve crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, this proposed Bill, as the Minister stated, seeks to

amend  the Registration of Criminals Act.  That seems  to

be an innocuous enough Bill.  But the proposed amendments

in the Bill actually go beyond mere registration.  It has

provisions that affect those who may be only suspected of

a  crime,  but  not yet charged, tried or convicted.   It

involves criminal procedures to obtain blood samples  and

other  body  samples  from  suspects,  as  distinct  from

convicted persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the application of the provisions to suspects,

the title of the Act is somewhat misleading.  My reaction

to  this is one of unease, because in provisions relating

to criminal procedure, it has always been the practice to

enact  those  provisions in the Criminal Procedure  Code,

where  there is a comprehensive code covering all aspects

of criminal procedure and investigation.  It is therefore

somewhat   inappropriate  to  find  matters  of  criminal

procedure  dealing in an Act which has a  very  innocuous

title called Registration of Criminals.  In any case,  if

someone asked what does that suggest to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>

a   layman,   it   suggests  registration  of   convicted

criminals,  not  of  suspects.   So,  I  hope  that   the

opportunity will be taken to re-enact such provisions and

to  take them out of the Registration of Criminals Act in

due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, naturally I would want to express my support

in  the setting up of this new DNA database as a means to

combat crime.  I think it is a good idea.  But there  are

a  couple  of  concerns  that I  hope  the  Minister  can

address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Minister has already explained

that in the case of blood and body samples, which involve

an  invasive  procedure in obtaining  such  samples,  the

consent of the suspect must be obtained.  But, of course,

he  then  went  on  to  say that if the  consent  is  not

forthcoming,  the  suspect  can  then  be  taken   to   a

magistrate and, there, the court can order the sample  to

be taken.  With that I have no objections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is the additional sanction provided

in  the Act which is that if the suspect did not consent,

adverse inferences could be drawn against him in terms of

his liability or his guilt relating to the taking of such

samples.   In  the  past, drawing of adverse  inferences,

especially  those  laid  down in the  Criminal  Procedure

Code, requires a warning to be given to the suspect  that

if  he did not give an explanation or a good reason,  the

court  may draw adverse inferences against him.   But  in

this  particular  proposed amendment, there  is  no  such

warning enacted, as can be found, eg, in the CPC (section

122).   Therefore, a suspect may not really know what  is

going  on.  There would be no means of putting him  in  a

position to be informed that adverse inferences could  be

drawn against him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that in the enacting, not so much of this

Bill,  but  in the enacting of the rules concerning  this

Bill,  the  Minister  would take the  chance  to  put  in

provisions  relating to warning, as far as  this  consent

element is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to raise a matter which I hope would

have been dealt with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Bill but which has not so far materialised.   In

the  Budget  debate earlier this year, a number  of  hon.

Members,  including  myself, had  brought  up  the  issue

whether  people who are convicted of minor crimes  should

not,  after  a  period  of time, have  their  particulars

removed  from the Register of Criminals.  The  reason  is

that  there  have always been problems for  them  finding

jobs,  and  they were hardly given a chance by  employers

and who are always, it seems to me, adversely affected by

the stigma of having been convicted of a crime, no matter

how minor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister had explained that the removal of

particulars  from  the Register today in  the  Bill  only

relates  to those 100 years and above, and do not  really

take  into account this category of persons who have just

been convicted of minor offences.  I hope the opportunity

will be taken to amend the Act relating to this group  in

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with those concerns, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill introduces the

deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tests into the criminal  law.

The  DNA information, ie, the genetic information derived

from  the forensic DNA analysis of a body sample is being

introduced to assist the law enforcement agencies and the

prosecuting   authorities  to  investigate   and   obtain

evidence  against  accused  persons.   There  is  also  a

provision  in the proposed section, ie, section  13(C)(3)

which provides as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where it is shown that the appropriate consent

required under subsection (1) for the taking of a  sample

of  blood  from a person was refused without good  cause,

the court, in determining -

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether to commit that person for trial in

connection  with  the crime of which  he  is  accused  of

committing;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether there is a case to answer against that

person; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether that person is guilty of the crime with

which he has been charged,

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

may  draw  such inference from the refusal as  it  thinks

proper  and,  based  on  such inference,  may  treat  the

refusal as corroboration or amounting to corroboration of

any relevant evidence against that person."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I am in agreement with Assoc. Prof.

Chin  Tet  Yung who made the observation that this  is  a

matter of concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore the introduction here of an

almost  or close to the concept of "presumption of guilt"

in  a  sense, if the accused does not cooperate in giving

his DNA sample.  Because of these powers being conferred,

the  enforcement and prosecuting authorities must  ensure

there  are  enough  safeguards  and  proper  checks   and

balances  so  that there is no opportunity for  potential

abuse  to the detriment of accused persons, and to ensure

that  there is proper administration of justice according

to the rule of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be prudent that proper warnings

of  adverse inference be administered to the arrested  or

accused person along the lines of section 122(6)  of  the

Criminal Procedure Code about adverse inference  and,  in

this  case, with the appropriate modifications of course.

Section 122(6) provides as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where any person is charged with an offence or

officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it,  he

shall be served with a notice in writing, which shall  be

explained to him to the following effect:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You have been charged with/informed that you may be

prosecuted for ...' and the charge is set out."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the question will be asked:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you wish to say anything in answer to the

charge?  If there is any fact on which you intend to rely

in  your defence in court, you are advised to mention  it

now.   If  you  hold it back till you go to  court,  your

evidence  may be less likely to be believed and this  may

have  a bad effect on your case in general.  If you  wish

to  mention  any fact now, and you would like it  written

down, this will be done."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a precautionary measure that is very

useful,  and  the courts would take into cognisance  this

fact whether the accused did give his defence or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 3 relating to

section  10(b)  of  the Act could  also  be  modified  as

follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(b) the Registrar shall cause the finger

impressions, photographs and registrable particulars that

he  had  received in respect of that person under section

8(c) to be destroyed ..."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>



and I would add these words:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... and the Registrar shall notify in writing to

that person within 14 days".

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to ensure fairness to that person who has

been  acquitted or discharged without a conviction  being

recorded   against  him.   It  is  also  to  ensure   the

efficiency of the Registrar of the Register of Criminals,

and  to  ensure that he complies expeditiously  with  the

duties under this Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest, as an alternative, that a

provision be added to require the Registrar to return the

record   of   photographs  and  finger  impressions   and

registrable particulars to the person concerned.   If  he

or  she  does  not  want them, then the  Registrar  shall

destroy them.  This was the case when the Registration of

Criminals  Act  was  passed in 1949  in  the  Legislative

Council of the Colony of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 gives far-reaching powers to the

"authorised  officer in charge" to take body  samples  of

persons arrested and accused of a crime, or convicted  of

a  crime,  or  is  serving his term  of  imprisonment  in

connection  with a crime of which he has been  convicted.

These are provided for in the proposed section 13B of the

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accuracy of the DNA tests and the proper and

competent  management  of  the  samples  taken  must   be

observed carefully, and it is the responsibility  of  the

relevant  Government authorities that there is absolutely

no  abuse.   Are  we absolutely sure that DNA  tests  are

accurate  enough?  Do we have enough competent  officers,

both  scientific and law enforcement officers,  to  carry

out these tasks?  There must be proper training for these

officers,  so that the system is respected.   I  do  hope

that  investigating authorities would still rely  on  the

age-old tool of proper and thorough investigation in  any

case, big or small, to arrive at the truth of any case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now refer to clause 6 (section

13H), which provides as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Registrar shall remove from the register and

from the DNA database the registrable particulars and DNA

information of any person -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whose death has been registered under the

Registration of Births and Deaths Act (Cap. 267); or

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) who, the Registrar is satisfied, has attained

100 years of age."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

This  so-called concession is really of very little value

to  the  person  whose  registrable particulars  and  DNA

information  are  kept by the said  Registrar.   I  would

propose  that  for  the  details about  the  "registrable

particulars" the age should be reduced from 100 years to,

say,  55, or use a different criterion, namely, to remove

the "registrable particulars" 10 years after the date  of

conviction by a court of law (for non-custodial cases) or

10  years from release from prison.  Most human beings do

not live beyond 80 years of age and, therefore, 100 years

is not a practical age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal I am suggesting will give a more

realistic  approach to wanting to give a clean  slate  to

the  convicted  person and to remove the stigma  and  bad

image  that is connected to any form of criminal  record.

Everyone  deserves a second chance in life and  hopefully

through  such  amendments,  the  State  is  seen  to   be

compassionate  and caring to its citizens  who  may  have

committed some crime at a younger age.

<div align="center"><h4>REGISTRATION OF CRIMINALS (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the issues

raised by Prof. Chin Tet Yung and Mr Chandra Mohan can be

classified into the following areas:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is whether it is more appropriate to have this

procedure  to take body samples or even other particulars

like  finger impression and photograph in the  CPC.   The

second  is  whether  when consent is  not  given  by  the

person,   then   should   an   appropriate   warning   be

administered.   The  third is whether we  have  competent

persons  to  handle this and whether the  procedures  are

tight to make sure that there will be no abuses and  that

proper  procedures are followed.  The fourth is regarding

the  purging  of records of people who are registered  on

the  Register  of  Criminals.  Let  me  deal  with  these

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the procedure part of it, what we are doing now

is  not  different from what is provided for in the  Act.

For  example,  in  the  case  of  finger  impression  and

photograph,   these  are  clearly   laid   out   in   the

Registration of Criminals Act.  What we have added in the

Bill is the taking of body samples.  By body samples,  it

could  be  head  hair follicle or a buckle  swab  in  the

mouth.   For these two body samples, they do not  require

the  consent of the person.  The Police could just do it,

just  like  what  they do now for finger  impression  and

photograph.  It is only when the Police want  to  take  a

body  sample, like a blood sample, then consent  must  be

sought because we consider taking of blood samples to  be

a  bit more intrusive.  But, in practice, it is not  like

the  case where you need to see a doctor, and he  puts  a

syringe into your vein and takes out whatever millilitres

of  blood.   It  is  just  like what  you  do  for  blood

grouping, where the nurse uses a little needle  to  prick

your  finger and take a little sample of blood.  That  is

all that is to do it.  It is not that bad.  For those who

do  blood grouping, and I am sure many of them would have

done so, this is not going to hurt them a lot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the suspect refuses to give that consent, he

can  be  brought to court and the court may order him  to

provide  the  blood sample.  And if he still refuses,  of

course,  appropriate warning will be given and inferences

will  be  drawn by the court for his refusal  to  provide

that blood sample.  But if the blood sample is not taken,

there  are two other methods, for example, the head  hair

follicle or the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>

buckle  swab,  or if not, it could be saliva.   It  could

also  be  skin  cells.   So let me settle  this  question

first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is whether the procedures are tight enough. The

procedures  will certainly be very tight.   For  example,

for  the  taking of a blood sample, it will  be  properly

recorded.   It is sealed in a box and it will  be  stored

properly and brought to HSA.  Only HSA officers have  the

key  to  open that box and they will compare the list  of

blood  samples with the names provided by the  Police  as

recorded  by  the  Police.  As I have said  earlier,  the

people who need to take the samples will be trained.   It

is not a very difficult thing to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the purging of records, I have said before

that  we are reviewing the Registration of Criminals  Act

to  see how we can consider some records as spent.   Then

the  court  may  no longer take cognisance  of  them  and

Police  may not use them.  But this is still under review

and therefore I will not be able to give an answer today.

But at an appropriate time, when the review is completed,

I will share more of that review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to returning the record of persons who are

subsequently  acquitted, as raised by Mr  Chandra  Mohan,

this  need  not  be  done.  The  records  are  stored  by

electronic means.  So, the only way is to delete them.  I

do  not  see  how they can be returned.  The Police  will

take  action  to  delete the record when  the  person  is

acquitted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was also asked by Mr Mohan whether DNA

test  is a good test.  I have already explained that  DNA

test provides the probability of an identical DNA only in

the  case of one in a billion.  In fact, depending on the

number  of  multiple markers used, it can be one  in  250

billion.   It will be much more accurate than that  of  a

finger impression.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC EXPANSION INCENTIVES (RELIEF FROM INCOME</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>TAX) (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the Economic Expansion

Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act, or the EEI  Act,

in  short.  The Bill gives legislative effect to two  tax

changes   which  were  announced  in  the   2002   Budget

Statement,   as  well  as  the  implementation   of   the

Technopreneur Investment Incentive Scheme.  It will  also

make  consequential amendments arising from other changes

to the Income Tax Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes serve to enhance the attractiveness of

existing  tax incentives, and make them more flexible  to

better  meet  the  needs of businesses.  They  will  also

support the development of the technopreneurial sector in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now describe each of the proposed amendments

in turn.

<br><br><i>Amendment  to  Development and  Expansion  Incentive  Tax Rates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 6 of the Bill amends the relevant

section  of the EEI Act to reduce the tax rate under  the

Development  and Expansion Incentive (or  DEI  in  short)

from not less than the current 10%, to not less than  5%.

The  DEI  was  introduced in 1996 to  replace  the  post-pioneer  incentive.  Currently, a company that  qualifies

for  the DEI is taxed at a rate of not less than  10%  on

income derived from qualifying activities.  The reduction

of  the  DEI rate to 5% would allow our economic agencies

greater flexibility in administering the DEI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a company may currently have a mix of

DEI  and Pioneer incentives for different projects at 10%

and 0% tax rates respectively.  The company may now

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>



apply to EDB to convert its current incentives granted on

the  project basis to a single tax rate of, say, 5%  DEI,

on  a  company  basis  instead, for  all  its  qualifying

activities.   This will obviate the need for the  company

to   keep  separate  accounts  for  different  incentives

awarded  for  each qualifying activity, thereby  reducing

the  compliance  costs  for  businesses.   It  will  also

provide  the  company  with  greater  certainty  of   the

benefits when it invests in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Unlimited Flow-Through of Tax-Exempt Dividends</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clauses 2, 4, 7 through 10 and 13 of the

Bill  amend  the  EEI Act to provide for unlimited  flow-through  of  tax-exempt dividends for incentives  granted

under the EEI Act to the final shareholders, without  any

minimum   shareholding  requirements.    Currently,   for

example,  a company receiving tax-exempt dividend  income

under  the EEI Act is able to pay an exempt dividend  out

of such income to its shareholders only if:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it holds not less than 50% of the shares of the

dividend  paying  company (unless a  lower  threshold  is

approved); and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the exempt dividend is paid on shares of a non-preferential nature.

In  most instances, the second tier holding company would

not  be  able  to  flow  through  the  exemption  to  its

shareholders.   With the tax change, such dividend  would

now  flow through as tax-exempt dividend to all tiers  of

shareholders, regardless of shareholding level.  This tax

change  enhances  the  tax benefits available  under  the

various  incentive schemes and simplifies the  compliance

requirements  under  the schemes.   The  unlimited  flow-through  of  exempt  dividends  applies  to  all   credit

balances in the exempt dividend account of companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above unlimited flow-through of tax-exempt dividends, these clauses also treat payment of

exempt  dividends  as  having  been  distributed  to  the

shareholders in accordance with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>



proportion  of  their shareholdings in a  company.   They

also   provide  for  dividends  paid  on  shares   of   a

preferential nature, to be deemed as interest  income  in

the  hands of shareholders and, in certain circumstances,

as interest expense in the hands of a company.

<br><br><i>Technopreneurship Investment Incentive Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to clause 14 of the Bill. It inserts

a  new  Part XIIIC, comprising sections 97S to 97Z, which

give   legal   effect  to  the  implementation   of   the

Technopreneur Investment Incentive (TII).  The TII  eases

the  difficulty faced by high-tech start-ups in obtaining

capital  investment in their initial phase of growth,  by

providing  investors  of qualifying  start-ups  with  tax

write-offs  for  qualifying losses  incurred.   Qualified

technopreneur start-ups which are accorded TII status may

allot  shares  to their investors, so long as  the  total

amount  paid to the company for all qualifying shares  by

eligible  investors  does not exceed  $3  million.   When

eligible  investors incur a loss from selling  qualifying

shares or from the liquidation of the start-up within the

eligibility  period, they are entitled  to  deduct  their

loss  amount  against their taxable  income,  subject  to

terms and conditions.

<br><br><i>Consequential Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill seeks to make consequential

amendments  to  the EEI Act arising from changes  to  the

Income  Tax  Act.   Clauses 3, 5 and  12  relate  to  the

amendments to sections 37, 37B and 37C of the Income  Tax

Act.  Clause 11 relates to the amendments to sections 13H

and  43P  of the Income tax Act.  The above consequential

amendments are to provide for the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) allowing the carry forward of unabsorbed

donations;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) extending the application of the adjustment

factor  under section 37B of the Income Tax Act to income

of the company subject to tax at different tax rates; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) expanding the definition of "concessionary

income"   under   the  provisions  governing   investment

allowances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in all, the above EEI Act

amendments  will  enhance our tax incentive  regime,  and

make   Singapore  a  more  attractive  place  for   doing

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.  -  [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>3.37 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make amendments to the Medical

Registration  Act  (Chapter  174  of  the  1998   Revised

Edition).

Background

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Registration Act provides for the

establishment of the Singapore Medical Council  (SMC)  to

register and regulate medical practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Act are needed to set the

requirements   for  continuing  medical  education   when

doctors  renew their practising certificates, to  address

the  limitations  that the SMC faces in its  disciplinary

processes   and   to   keep   pace   with   international

developments in professional regulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the major

amendments that are being introduced in this Bill.

<br><br><i>Compulsory Continuing Medical Education (CME)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of change in the practice of medicine is

rapid, driven mainly by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>



dramatic  advances in biomedical research and technology.

At the same time, there is greater acceptance of evidence-based  medicine, ie, medical practices that are supported

by  rigorous  and comprehensive analyses of the  relevant

body  of  clinical  research or trial data.   This  helps

doctors  to  ensure that the care given  to  patients  is

necessary, beneficial and of good quality.  Our  patients

and  the  general  public  also have  high,  and  rising,

expectations  of  the  quality of  healthcare  that  they

receive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative, therefore, for all doctors to

maintain the currency of their professional knowledge and

to  stay  abreast of developments in medical science  and

practice.  Continuing Medical Education (CME) is a  well-accepted  mechanism to achieve this.   There  is  a  long

history  and  tradition of CME within our  local  medical

community.   Two years ago, the SMC launched  an  on-line

CME  system for all registered medical practitioners  and

worked with the College of Family Physicians, the Academy

of  Medicine  and  the Singapore Medical Association,  to

establish a voluntary national CME system so as to better

meet  the  needs  of  the  different  groups  of  medical

practitioners through the provision of a diverse  variety

of accredited CME activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all doctors have demonstrated

participation   to   a   satisfactory   level   of   CME.

Notifications  by  medical  practitioners  to  the  SMC's

voluntary  CME system showed that only 39% fulfilled  the

minimum  CME requirements of 25 points per year in  2000.

The situation improved to 49.5% participation rate in the

year 2001.  It is likely that there were some doctors who

participated  in CME but failed to notify.   Nonetheless,

the    voluntary   participation   rate   is   far   from

satisfactory.   Many developed countries, in  fact,  have

made  CME  compulsory  in their jurisdictions,  eg,  most

states in the USA, some states in Australia, New Zealand,

the  Netherlands and Hong Kong.  Canada and  the  UK  are

actively  looking  into  doing  so  as  well.   We   have

therefore decided to make CME compulsory for all  medical

practitioners from 2003.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes an amendment that allows the SMC

to  prescribe conditions for the grant and renewal  of  a

doctor's   practising  certificate,  including  mandatory

participation in CME.  The SMC has decided  that  doctors

should  accumulate at least 50 CME points within a 2-year

cycle    before   they   can   renew   their   practising

certificates.

<br><br><i>Strengthening of SMC's Disciplinary Procedures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the SMC plays a critical role in

the  regulation  of  medical  professionals  and  medical

practice  in Singapore.  SMC has established  an  Ethical

Code  and  Ethical Guidelines that set the  standards  of

professionalism  expected of all  doctors  in  Singapore.

SMC also has a well-established disciplinary procedure to

assess and to deal with doctors who have been referred to

the  SMC.  In the main, these procedures are working well

and  have  allowed the SMC to maintain high standards  of

medical professionalism in Singapore.  However, there are

a number of limitations that the SMC faces in its current

disciplinary processes.  These will be addressed  in  the

amendments to this Act so that SMC will be able to  carry

out   its   regulatory   duties  more   efficiently   and

effectively.

<br><br><i>Interim Orders Committee (IOC)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the complexities of medical practice

issues and the time required to gather and review all the

relevant  evidence,  inquiries into disciplinary  matters

may  take up to two years to complete.  During that time,

the doctor under investigation is still able to practise.

In  some  situations, there may be compelling reasons  to

suspend a doctor from practising, even before the outcome

of his disciplinary enquiry is known, in the interests of

public safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore propose that a new provision be created

to  allow  for  the  establishment of an  Interim  Orders

Committee  (IOC).  The IOC will be vested with the  power

to  summarily  suspend or restrict  a  doctor's  practice

before  the outcome of an inquiry is known.  This inquiry

could be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>



held  either  by  the Disciplinary Committee  (DC)  which

looks into the professional conduct of the doctor or  the

Health  Committee (HC) which considers the  physical  and

mental fitness of the doctor to practise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that cases will

only  be  referred  to the IOC when there  is  compelling

evidence  that  the doctor's continued practice  poses  a

threat  to  public safety.  Such evidence  could  include

psychiatric reports and court convictions.  Based on  the

experience  of the IOC in the UK, examples of cases  that

could  be  referred to the IOC would include  cases  like

failures  of care that indicate a serious lack  of  basic

medical  knowledge  or  skills; or doctors  with  serious

health  problems  that  would  affect  their  ability  to

practise   medicine,  such  as  severe  mental   illness,

alcoholism or drug addiction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight that a number of

provisions have been built into the Act to safeguard  the

rights  of the doctor who has been referred to  the  IOC.

For example:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The members of the IOC will not participate as

members  of  any  other committee  that  is  involved  in

looking into the complaint against that doctor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No interim order shall be made by the IOC

unless  the  doctor  in  question  has  been  given   the

opportunity to appear before the IOC and be heard  as  to

whether  such an order should be made in his  case.   The

doctor  also  has  the right to be represented  by  legal

counsel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Any doctor whose registration has been

suspended or made subject to conditions by the  IOC  will

have a right of appeal to the High Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The IOC is required to review its interim order

after  6  months to determine if it should be revoked  or

amended.   After this first review, the order is  subject

to  further review every three months until the matter is

settled,  or the IOC decides that the order is no  longer

necessary,  or 18 months after the initial issue  of  the

order.  Any extension of the order beyond

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>

18 months will require approval by the High Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments to establish the IOC and to provide

safeguards  for  the  rights of the doctors  are  closely

modelled on the current legislation and system in the UK.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight some other amendments to the

Act   that   are  intended  to  strengthen  the   current

disciplinary  process.   We will empower  the  Complaints

Committee to inquire into matters of professional conduct

that were discovered in the course of investigations, but

did  not  form  part  of  the  original  complaint.   The

Complaints Committee will also be allowed to continue  an

investigation  even  if a complaint had  been  withdrawn.

This  is consistent with the powers vested in the Inquiry

Committees under the Legal Profession Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMC will be authorised to refer, by its own

volition,   any   information  regarding   the   criminal

conviction  of a registered medical practitioner  to  the

SMC's Complaints Panel, without first having to receive a

formal complaint against this practitioner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim, could you pause for a while to

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I was saying,

we  will allow the SMC to refer any information regarding

the criminal conviction of a registered medical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>



practitioner to the SMC's Complaints Panel, without first

having  to  receive  a  formal  complaint  regarding  the

practitioner.   This will ensure that  doctors  who  have

been convicted of offences in the criminal court are also

reviewed  by the SMC to determine if there had also  been

breaches in professional conduct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of a specialist is currently not protected

by  law.  A new amendment will allow the SMC to institute

disciplinary proceedings against doctors who falsely hold

themselves out to be specialists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the amendments

in  this  Bill  that seek to streamline the  registration

processes of the SMC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, currently, any Singapore medical degree

holder  is  entitled  to full registration.   A  proposed

amendment  will ensure that only those who have completed

their  housemanship satisfactorily can progress  to  full

registration.   If  the  SMC  is  of  the  view  that   a

particular doctor has not fulfilled the requirements  for

full   registration  but  is  safe  to   practise   under

supervision,  the  SMC will be given  the  discretion  to

award conditional registration for such cases.  Singapore

degree  holders who complete their housemanship  overseas

would  also  be granted conditional registration  in  the

first instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, foreign degree holders seeking registration

will  be  required to either complete their  housemanship

locally  or produce a certificate of experience  that  is

recognised  by  the  SMC  as  evidence  that  they   have

satisfactorily  completed  their  housemanship  overseas.

The  SMC will also be allowed to impose conditions on the

restoration  of  a  doctor who has been  struck  off  the

register,   such   as   placing  him  under   conditional

registration   rather   than  restoring   him   to   full

registration right away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment is to allow the SMC to release

information   to   prescribed   persons   or   Government

organisations  for  policy planning and  other  purposes.

Such  information includes names and biodata, information

on professional qualifications,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>



as  well as employment data.  This is consistent with the

provisions  made  in  the Private Hospitals  and  Medical

Clinics Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

take this opportunity to touch on two related matters:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Schedule of the Medical Registration

Act, which lists the basic medical degrees recognised for

registration  in Singapore, and secondly,  the  one-third

quota  placed on the female medical student  intake  into

the National University of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked for these two policies to

be reviewed.  I am happy to announce that the Ministry of

Health  has  decided to expand the Schedule, which  lists

the   foreign  universities  and  medical  schools  whose

medical  degrees  are  recognised  for  registration   in

Singapore.   Also, the one-third quota on the  intake  of

female medical students into NUS will also be lifted with

effect from academic year 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Members who have raised this,

including Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Dr Lily Neo, and to  thank

them  also  for  their patience when  raising  these  two

issues for review.  Good things come to those who wait.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed

amendments  to the Medical Registration Act  would  allow

the  Singapore  Medical  Council  to  maintain  the  high

professional  standards  of  the  doctors  practising  in

Singapore.  This will help ensure that Singaporeans  will

continue to enjoy a good quality of medical care  and  to

continue to have full confidence and trust in the doctors

whom they consult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to declare that I am a General Practitioner  and  I

stand  to  speak  in support of the Medical  Registration

(Amendment) Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I must say that I welcome the good

news  that  the quota on the admission of female  medical

students to our university is to be removed at long last.

The  public and many Members of Parliament in this House,

myself  included,  had spoken for the  regulation  to  be

rescinded.    Sir,  I  am  indeed  heartened   that   our

Government  has responded to the people's wish  and  that

the  Backbenchers in this House had not spoken  in  vain.

Today's  announcement removes the quota  of  33%  on  the

admission of female students into the Faculty of Medicine

which NUS introduced in 1979.  The reason for introducing

the  quota  for  female  medical students  was  that  the

attrition  rate for female doctors then was  16-19%.   Of

course,   this  reasoning  is  not  valid   anymore   as,

currently,  the attrition rate for male doctors  is  2.8%

and  for female doctors is 4.2%.  This announcement  thus

removes this rejection of entry to qualify people on  the

basis  of  gender,  and will go a long  way  towards  our

vision  of  making NUS a "first world" university.   Sir,

Singapore  prides itself on being a meritocratic  society

and  the long overdue removal of this quota is definitely

a right step forward for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1993 policy of not recognising the degrees from

over  176 previously recognised foreign universities will

be  reversed.   However,  I  believe  that  not  all  the

previously recognised universities will be reinstated for

recognition.   Why is the Ministry of Health half-hearted

in  reversing  this policy?  As Singapore is  emphasising

the importance of life-sciences, and as we will need many

doctor-researchers,  would it not facilitate  our  future

needs   better  by  recognising  all  of  the  previously

recognised medical schools?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health's projections for ideal

numbers  of  doctors have been less than satisfactory  so

far.   How  sure are we that the Ministry of  Health  has

better  projections  now to take into  consideration  our

changing needs and trends?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a known fact that there has been a shortage of

doctors  in  the  public sector for many years  and  this

policy change will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>



certainly help solve this urgent problem.  Not  only  can

we  have the chance to get those Singaporean doctors  who

have  graduated from these foreign universities  to  come

home,  we  can  also  very  likely  attract  other   non-Singaporean   doctors  from  these   reputable   overseas

universities.   This is especially significant  when  the

cost to train a doctor in Singapore is so much higher  in

comparison   to  medical  schools  overseas.    Yes,   it

apparently  costs at least $400,000 here as  compared  to

about $170,000 to $250,000 at the universities of Sydney,

Oxford and Cambridge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Ministry of Health be circumspect in

assessing the shortage of doctors and solving the problem

at the root cause of the shortage?  Finding and attending

to the reasons for shortages would be more effective than

merely  increasing the numbers of doctors.  There is  now

an  uneven distribution of doctors, with an abundance  of

doctors  in the private sector and a shortage, especially

of  junior doctors, in the public sector.  Junior  public

doctors  have  been  facing problems like  unsatisfactory

work-terms,  long  and  tedious working  hours  and  poor

career  path developments.  Sir, their morale is low  and

they  often leave for private practice as a last  resort.

And,  even  if  we  increase their numbers,  more  junior

doctors in the public sector will still leave in spite of

poorer   prospects  outside  if  these  causes  are   not

addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that, with the new policy in

place, our public hospitals should stop employing doctors

from non-traditional sources like Burma, Indonesia, China

and so on, whose medical degrees were never recognised in

the  past.  Singapore is known for its medical excellence

and  this  had been built upon through years of excellent

training  of  our  doctors from the best  centres.   This

prestige status must be preserved at all costs.   To  me,

public  hospital's reflex response to recruit doctors  in

the last few years from these non-traditional sources and

to  save  costs is not acceptable.  Sir, may  I  ask  the

Minister for Health whether the hundreds of doctors  from

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>



non-traditional sources presently in our public hospitals

are being tracked and monitored continuously in terms  of

their performance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the new regulation concerning Compulsory

Continuing   Medical   Education,  most   physicians   in

Singapore  are  in general concurrence that  the  desired

goal  of  CME  is essential to improve medical  practice.

But  many  grouse that this has to come in  the  form  of

compulsion.   The proportion of doctors who  are  already

keeping themselves updated is definitely higher than  the

quoted  figure  of  49.5% for the year  2001  of  doctors

obtaining the minimum CME points.  This figure refers  to

those who have officially documented their CME activities

with  the  Singapore Medical Council.  The CME  programme

has  up till now been entirely voluntary and, hence, many

doctors do not formally record or report their efforts in

CME  to the Singapore Medical Council.  The fact is  that

continued  medical  education is part  and  parcel  of  a

doctor's life, and when one takes up medicine, continuous

learning becomes an inherent life-long practice.  I  dare

say  that  all  doctors do practise CME in some  form  or

other and in varying degrees as a matter of necessity  in

the course of their clinical practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we want medical excellence amongst our medical

profession  but  we  must still  retain  some  degree  of

respect   and  compassion  for  human  expectations   and

limitations.  For doctors in the public institutions, the

CME  requirement is fairly easy to achieve.  However, for

some  private  practitioners,  especially  the  solo  HDB

doctors  who  work  long hours on days  and  nights,  the

timing  and  format of CME become an issue.  We  have  to

spare a thought and cater for their difficult situations.

I  hope  the  Ministry of Health can  be  the  body  that

facilitates and formulates CME for them and ensures  that

professional bodies cater to their needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also beseech the Ministry of Health to ensure

that  the  implementation of this  programme  on  CME  is

flexible, realistic and achievable.  Formal CME  lectures

may  not  be  as  effective as it  was  believed  to  be.

Interactive CME sessions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>



that   enhance  participant  activity  and  provide   the

opportunity  to  practise skills may be  more  useful  to

effect  change in professional practices.   High  quality

professional  learning  opportunities  online  should  be

readily   available  for  self-directed  learning.    CME

programmes  to  meet the needs of the  nation  should  be

incorporated.   For  example,  in  view  of  our   ageing

population,  there should be programmes to  better  equip

the  medical profession here for the care of the  elderly

in  the  community and, in their own homes, so  that  the

elderly  can  avoid  tertiary  institution  as  much   as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask whether the Ministry of Health will set a

certain  budget  for  this Continuing  Medical  Education

yearly?   At the end of the day, the quality of CME  will

depend   on   the   resources  put  in.    Although   the

pharmaceutical industry may be very willing  to  generate

goodwill  by helping the providers of CME with the  costs

of educational programmes, the curriculum content and the

educational  event  are  often-times  influenced  by  the

financial support and the quality and value of  such  CME

activities may thus be closely linked with the  marketing

of a particular pharmaceutical product.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister if there is a provision for

doctors  who,  due  to  unforeseen circumstances,  cannot

fulfil the required points of CME in the prescribed time?

Will  the Minister elaborate on the circumstances allowed

in such cases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Interim Orders Committee (IOC)

amendment  seeks  to put in place an IOC  to  suspend  or

order  a  restricted  registration  for  a  doctor  under

investigation.   This amendment applies  to  a  situation

when   the   Complaints   Panel,  Complaints   Committee,

Disciplinary  Committee or Health  Committee  refers  the

matter  to  the  IOC.  However, it does not  address  the

issue  as to under what circumstances the matter  can  be

referred to IOC.  Furthermore, there can be a possibility

that  the doctor in question had been suspended  but  the

eventual  finding  of  the Complaints  Panel,  Complaints

Committee, Disciplinary Committee or Health Committee  is

in the negative.  On the other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>



hand,  as  suspension or orders had been granted  by  the

IOC,   the   Complaints   Panel,  Complaints   Committee,

Disciplinary Committee or Health Committee may  be  under

pressure  to make a positive finding.  As such orders  to

be  dished out by the IOC have grave implications on  the

doctor  in  question - being seen guilty even before  the

finding has been concluded, standing to lose patients and

practice and living with the stigma attached to the order

-  such  a  provision ought not to be introduced  in  the

first place.  The truth is that the circumstances on  the

charge  may  be difficult to ascertain and controversial.

For  example,  a doctor that is accused of repeated  poor

performance  may  not be entirely at fault.   It  may  be

because the doctor was frequently getting bad cases  that

were not curable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that such a drastic suspension measure

has  to  be taken by the complainant, the matter  can  be

referred to the High Court for an injunction against  the

doctor  in  question.   An  injunction  will  attract  an

undertaking  from the complainant to pay damages  to  the

doctor  in  question, if the Complaints Panel, Complaints

Committee,  Disciplinary Committee or  Health  Committee,

after  its  investigation, arrives at  the  finding  that

there is no misconduct or incompetence on the part of the

doctor  in question.  This will ensure that there  is  no

frivolous application for injunction, or suspension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As per the amendment, the IOC majority vote will be

sufficient  to make an order.  This may not be  equitable

given the grave implications.  If the IOC is to vote  for

an  order,  it should be by way of an unanimous decision.

The  amendment also gives the IOC the power to  vary  the

order  if  the  Complaints Panel,  Complaints  Committee,

Disciplinary Committee or Health Committee recommends the

same.   This  again  seems  to  be  inequitable.   If   a

variation  is required, the matter ought to be  moved  to

the  High Court for a decision and not remain within  the

IOC  Complaints Panel, Complaints Committee, Disciplinary

Committee or Health Committee level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to section 20 (clause 7) proposes to amend

that only those who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>



have  completed their housemanship satisfactorily can  be

granted full registration.  Sir, under what circumstances

would  housemanship be deemed unsatisfactory?  This could

be very subjective and there are assessors with different

expectations  and standards to demand of their  housemen.

In  any  case, I would have expected that doctors  coming

out  of  NUS, deemed a world class medical school,  would

have  produced high quality doctors.  There  is  also  no

stipulated    maximum   period   for   this   conditional

registration.   So housemen can be forever  in  the  same

position  for as long as his seniors think they  are  not

satisfactory  in their performances.  By  the  way,  will

hospitals  that  are  short  of  doctors  now  use   this

regulation  to tie these doctors to ease their  shortage?

How  will the Ministry of Health ensure the avoidance  of

such  high-handed unfair practice?  What kind of recourse

can these housemen seek?  Furthermore, the amendments  do

not address how the Medical Council is going to decide on

the procedure of granting conditional registration.  Will

there be a committee?  Who will be on the committee?   Is

it   the  whole  Medical  Council?   Will  a  meeting  be

convened?   There  are lots of uncertainties  as  to  the

procedure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that Singapore Medical Council is to be

given  sweeping powers, we must ensure that  there  is  a

fair  representation of doctors from both the public  and

private  sectors and from as many disciplines and groups.

We  must also ensure that the members of the Council  are

of  a high calibre.  Could the Minister elaborate on  how

this is being ensured?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of my concerns and I hope that

the Minister for Health would address them in this House.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, I did

not  give notice to speak.  But having heard the Minister

and also Dr Lily Neo, I thought I want to say something.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am very concerned about CME. I

remember 20-odd years ago, when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>



I  was in the College of General Practitioners, we mooted

this  idea  of CME.  I am indeed glad that  it  has  been

adopted  now.   20 years is a long time.   But,  at  that

time,  we set out the format for doctors to undergo  this

CME  training.   It  is  true that  doctors  should  stay

abreast of science and also the practice of medicine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can see some problems now because many

practising doctors, especially general practitioners, are

trying  to  find  time to attend all these  lectures  and

talks.  At the moment, I notice that there are also  drug

companies  trying to participate in these CME  exercises,

and  I remember this has stretched as far as 20 years ago

when  we  started  this,  where they  invited  a  lot  of

practitioners to attend the talks that were given by drug

companies  and  the lectures were given  by  doctors  and

specialists.  I thought that was very good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, as stated by the Minister, 39%

managed  to fulfil the 25-point requirement, and  in  the

year 2001, 49.5% fulfilled.  I hope that the Ministry, or

the people who are in charge of this CME, would find some

easier   format   for  the  hardworking   doctors,   both

practitioners outside and also in the institution, to  be

given  the time to participate in this CME exercise.   In

other  words,  like Dr Neo said, it must be flexible  and

achievable.   I am sure the Minister would take  note  of

that and make those recommendations to the people who are

formulating all these CME exercises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first read the Bill, there is one particular

clause  that  caught my attention and, that is,  the  new

sections 49A and 49B which actually call for the  interim

suspension  order.  And like Dr Neo, I was a  little  bit

worried because we might be actually prejudging a  doctor

and subjecting him to some sentence before he is actually

found  guilty.  But having heard the Minister, I am quite

comforted  now.   He  said that this  particular  interim

order   will  only  be  used  when  there  is  compelling

evidence.   And  he also cited compelling  evidence  like

doctors who may be of unsound mind.  After some time,  we

doctors, through years of practice and ageing, may also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>



have undergone mental changes.  Some of them may also  be

a  bit of schizophrenic.  When you get all those cases, I

would agree with the Minister that you had better suspend

these  doctors  first  before  you  put  them  back  into

practice,  or  even wait for the lengthy  procedure  that

usually takes place when we investigate a doctor  who  is

subjected  to disciplinary procedures.  He also mentioned

about the safeguards for the rights of doctors, and I  do

not want to elaborate on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point was this full registration of

doctors or housemen who are Singapore degree holders.   I

honestly  do  not see much change.  In the past,  it  was

also the same.  The doctor who has completed six years of

medical school, goes through one year of housemanship and

then  he  gets  registered.  Of course, he  must  subject

himself to a review by his peers to make sure that he  is

fully  qualified  because passing an examination  is  one

thing,   but  doing  the  practical  aspects  of  medical

practice  is another thing.  Therefore, I agree with  the

Minister too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that he also mentioned that there

will  be  more women being allowed to enrol into  medical

school.  I know that the original reason why they did not

allow  was that many women, who took up medical  studies,

finally  did not end up practising, and that  is  a  sure

waste of manpower.  I remember also in the old House,  we

had  a lot of discussions on why women, who want to  take

up  medicine,  should have a little less  priority.   But

through the hard work of Dr Lily Neo and many Members  in

the House, the Minister has changed this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is enlarging the list of overseas

medical  colleges and universities.  Yes, we had actually

many  cases  of  very bright students who could  not  get

places  in  the universities here and they had gone  into

some  of the overseas universities which were very  good.

But,   unfortunately,  they  did  not  get   recognition.

Dublin,   Adelaide,   for   example,   are   very    good

universities.  But they did not fall into that  list  and

the  students  who graduated from those good universities

failed to get registration.  And that is a pity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>



So  I hope that list would include such good universities

too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Members  for  their comments.  Let me  respond  to  them.

First,  on  the schedule for recognising the universities

and the medical colleges.  Dr Lily Neo asked why not just

recognise all 176 universities in the pre-1993 list.   It

is  already 10 years since 1993, and we have asked SMC to

take a look at all the universities from a fresh approach

and  recommend  to  the Ministry which  universities  and

medical  colleges  should be put into  the  schedule  for

recognition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to it. One is the quality of

the  medical schools and the universities.  And  secondly

is  the compatibility of their training and curriculum to

our  practice  here.  So not being on the list  does  not

mean  that the universities are not good.  They could  be

good,  but we also want the way they teach their students

and  the  way  they  organise  their  curriculum  to   be

reasonably compatible to ours.  There is really  no  need

to  have such a long list, because our projection is that

we  would need to supplement our local output of  doctors

by between 50-80 doctors who are foreign-trained, whether

Singaporeans or foreigners.  We really do not need such a

long  list  of universities.  If we look at the  pre-1993

list, the bulk in the list are American universities.  We

do  not  really  get  many graduates  from  the  American

universities.  SMC should look at the list  and  identify

those  universities  and medical  colleges  that  we  are

likely to have Singaporeans or where we are likely to  be

able to recruit foreign talent.  So, it is with a clearer

objective in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shortage of junior doctors, I agree with Dr

Lily  Neo that we should look at the root causes  of  the

shortage  of junior doctors.  I think the way to approach

it  is  really  to restructure the whole process  in  the

hospitals and in our clinics.  In the past, our hospitals

and clinics had got used to using junior medical doctors,

because they were bonded to us for a number of years and,

when the numbers fluctuate,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>



then the establishment is not filled.  We have asked  the

hospitals to actually look at the processes and  to  look

at  employing experienced medical officers and  not  just

use  these people who are with us for the period  of  the

bond, but use experienced doctors who may not want to  go

on  to  a  specialty but who are quite happy  to  have  a

career  working  in  the hospitals  as  very  experienced

medical officers.  So, they have done so and they have  a

resident  physician  scheme  and  it  is  becoming  quite

attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the hospitals have recruited

doctors  from  some non-traditional sources.   They  have

been very careful to make sure that these doctors are  of

very  high  quality, and all these doctors are practising

in  an institutional set-up.  They are closely supervised

and  monitored,  and  they add value  to  our  healthcare

system.  So, it is not just a matter of cost and lowering

cost.   I  know Dr Lily Neo says we must preserve quality

at  all  costs.  But I am sure the next time I come  here

and  ask  for a fee increase, she would be the  first  to

jump up and argue against a fee increase.  So, we have to

be  quite  clear.   It is not just a matter  of  lowering

cost;  it  is  complementing the range of  expertise  and

experience that we have in the hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CME, I take both Dr Lily Neo and Dr Tan Cheng

Bock's  comments.   We  have tried this  on  a  voluntary

basis.  Other countries and jurisdictions have gone on to

make it compulsory.  I think we should follow suit.   Our

requirements are not that stringent.  50 points over  two

years  is  not an overly difficult hurdle  to  cross.   I

recognise   that   those  working  in  the   restructured

hospitals  or  institutions will find it easier,  whereas

those  who  are  operating  solo  practices  out  in  the

heartlands will find it more difficult.  And that is  the

reason  why we have worked very closely with the  College

of   Family   Physicians   and  the   Singapore   Medical

Association to work out mechanisms, whether it is  online

or  self-directed, to make sure that the  private  sector

general practitioner can have access to CME.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the clusters have extended schemes to the

private sector general practitioner under the partnership

scheme,  where  GPs actually work with  the  clusters  as

partners,  referring to the specialist clinics  and  vice

versa.   Therefore, this link-up will allow the  private-sector GPs to attend the CME classes run by the clusters.

But I must say that in the end the private-sector GP must

make  an effort.  We do run these classes in the evenings

and  on weekends, but they must make the effort.  My view

is  that 50 CME points over two years is not that big  an

effort  to make.  But I take the comments of Dr Lily  Neo

and  Dr Tan Cheng Bock that we should make sure that this

is  flexible, realistic and achievable, and that we  will

work together with the various professional organisations

to make sure that this is so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the professional organisations must run

CME  on  their  own budget.  The Ministry of  Health  has

given  them  a  transitional budget to help  set  up  the

online processes, working out the curriculum.  But it  is

not  our intention that this fiscal support should be  in

the  long  term.  So, beyond the transitional grant  that

the  Ministry of Health has given them, our intention  is

that the medical profession must stand on its own feet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the points made on the Interim Orders Committee,

as  I  explained  in my speech, we know this  is  a  very

delicate balance.  We need to protect public safety.   At

the  same  time, we need to recognise the rights  of  the

doctors.   Therefore,  if  we ever  have  this  order  to

suspend a doctor's practice, I can assure the House  that

this would be done very, very selectively and, when there

are compelling reasons in order to protect public safety.

We have modelled this after the UK.  Let us try this out.

We have put in all the safeguards that we have researched

on.   But I think we need to strike a balance.  We cannot

just  give  the doctors a blank cheque to say  they  must

practise, whatever the circumstances.  At the same  time,

there are issues of public safety involved, especially if

the  doctor  is  a very severe alcoholic or  has  a  drug

addiction  problem  or  a  very  severe  mental   illness

problem.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I assure the House we will do this very

selectively, and only when there are compelling reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the registration of housemen, today graduates

from  our local universities go for housemanship and,  at

the   end   of   housemanship,  they   are   given   full

registration.  But in one, two or three cases every year,

the  panel  of  assessors and the Dean  would  have  been

happier  if  the  doctor underwent  a  longer  period  of

supervision.   The  system here  is  that  we  allow  the

doctor,  after  the  one-year  housemanship,  to  go  and

practise solo.  This is a very high burden.  If I may use

the  analogy of a private pilot's licence.  You may  know

the theory of how to fly a plane.  You may be able to fly

a  plane with the instructor next to you, to land and  to

take  off.  But to fly solo, you need a certain  exposure

to  the different circumstances that may arise.  You need

experience  and judgement.  In a few of these cases,  the

panel  of  assessors and the Dean would rather  that  the

doctors not go solo in the HDB heartlands, but that  they

spend  another three months, six months or  another  year

under  supervision.   Then, I  think,  we  will  be  more

confident  that  the  doctor can  fly  solo  in  the  HDB

heartland clinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision is to allow the panel of assessors

and  the  Dean  to  have  this  flexibility  of  awarding

conditional  registration,  so  that  the  doctor   still

continues  to  practise, but practise under  supervision.

Then,  after  a  period  of review,  when  the  panel  is

confident,  then  the doctor is given full  registration.

Again,  I  will assure the House that when  we  implement

this, there will be proper checks and balances, as we  do

whenever we assess the capabilities of the doctors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the representation of the SMC, the Act allows for

the   SMC  to  be  constituted,  some  appointed  by  the

Minister, for which we have certain criteria to make sure

we  have  a  cross-section from the  private  and  public

sectors, people from different specialties.  But the bulk

is  elected  by  the  doctors themselves.   This  is  the

essence of self-regulation by the SMC.  Here, I think, we

would expect the doctors to exercise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>



good  judgement in electing a professional body  to  look

after  their professional interests and who  will  be  in

charge  of  regulating them.  So far it has worked  well.

We  will continue to monitor the SMC.  Over the years, it

has built up a strong reputation.  It has the support  of

all the doctors and I am confident it will continue to do

so.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek

a point of clarification.  The Minister did not answer my

points  on whether there is a provision for doctors  who,

due   to  unforeseen  circumstances,  cannot  fulfil  the

required CME points within the prescribed time.  Will  he

elaborate  on  the circumstances allowed in  such  cases?

Also, is there any recourse for a houseman to take?   The

Minister said earlier that the non-traditional sources of

doctors  are of high quality.  Is he implying that  there

is no need to recruit doctors from reputable universities

now,  and that there is no necessity to send our  doctors

to  the  reputable universities and the best  centres  to

train?  Where is our medical health heading then?  Is  he

not   risking  throwing  away  the  prestige  of  medical

excellence  that  we have painfully  built  up  over  the

years?   What kind of confidence can we get from our  own

Singaporean  patients  and foreign  patients,  especially

from the region?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned

just  now, 50 points over two years should not be such  a

difficult  hurdle  to cross.  Many of  these  points  are

accumulated  just  by self-reading, answering  questions.

We  are talking about 50 CME points over two years.  I do

not see that being difficult to achieve.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> No, should the doctor be hospitalised,

for example, due to unforeseen circumstances.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If the doctor is immobilised for

two  years, then I am sure the SMC would take  that  into

account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On recourse by junior doctors for the housemanship,

this  is  the usual process: we have interviews with  the

housemen, they go through three supervisors and are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>



supervised by the Dean.  So, there are a lot of  feedback

channels  for the housemen, if they think that they  have

not  been  properly  assessed.  The Director  of  Medical

Services  takes  a  very personal  interest  in  all  the

housemen.  This year, for example, one houseman  came  to

my office and asked to see me, and I saw her.  We keep  a

fairly open-office policy in the Ministry of Health.  So,

I  think  there is enough recourse.  Of course,  if  they

find  all these unsatisfactory, they will make a  beeline

to see her!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quality of doctors, I think we are still

maintaining  the very high quality of our  doctors.   The

main  strategy is really our Health Manpower  Development

Programme (HMDP).  This has been on for many years.   Our

doctors go to the best and most reputable centres  around

the world, funded by the Government.  This is how we keep

up  with  the latest.  The HMDP programme is our  key  in

keeping this quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we do face a shortage of doctors.

With  the expansion of the schedule, we will be  able  to

recruit both Singaporean as well as foreign doctors  from

the  foreign universities.  After 1993, when the list was

restricted  to  28  and  then, now  24,  our  avenues  of

recruitment were limited.  So, with the expansion of  the

schedule,  obviously we have more choices.  But  I  would

not  rule out completely and insist that our clusters are

not allowed to recruit from universities not on the list.

Why  do we want to constrain them?  As long as they  make

the  assessment  that  these  doctors  meet  the  quality

standards   and  these  doctors  practise   under   close

supervision,  they add to our capability.   And  many  of

these doctors may later on continue to take up specialist

courses  and join our system.  Why do we want to restrict

ourselves  and  restrict recruitment from some  of  these

good universities, even though they may not appear on the

schedule?   They  come, work for us  for  two  years,  we

assess  them and, if they are good, we encourage them  to

go for specialist training.  They add to our talent pool.

I do not see why we should cut them off.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Now that the Minister condones such a

practice,  I  am sure our public community hospitals  and

even the private hospitals will take in more doctors from

the  cheaper non-traditional sources for the  benefit  of

saving  costs, but not necessarily to the benefit of  the

patients and the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to register one more

point  to  my disappointment over this response from  the

Minister, because I feel that this is definitely  a  soft

option   and  not  preserving  the  prestige  of  medical

excellence in Singapore, and changing the position of our

healthcare service.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I just seek

a point of clarification from the Minister?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter concerning CME and registration.

Must a person be a practising doctor before he can do his

CME?   For instance, there are quite a number of  doctors

here  in  this House, eg, Dr Balaji Sadasivan, Dr  Vivian

Balakrishnan,  who are no longer practising.   They  also

need  registration  but they are non-practising  doctors.

Can  they  get  registration also, without having  to  go

through,  say,  the  CME,  because  they  are   in   this

particular  position, and let them take  the  CME  later,

say,  when they have finished their political career  and

they want to go ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have made your point, Dr Tan. Mr

Lim.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> You mean, to get registered?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Right. I hope you get what I am

trying  to  say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When the doctor comes up for the renewal of his practising certificate, he must demonstrate that he has at least 50 points over the last preceding two years. If they do not want to practise and they are not seeking a renewal of their practising certificates, they are temporarily exempted from doing the CME. But if they want to practise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>



at  some point in time, if they want to renew, then  they

must take the CME.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
