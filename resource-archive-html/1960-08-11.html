<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on

Question [10th August, 1960],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed

to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore,  express  our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered on

behalf  of  the  Government at the opening  of  the

present  session  of  this Assembly.".'-(The  Prime

Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I first touch on two matters upon

which  the  Member for Cairnhill laboured  the  day

before yesterday?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the deregistration of the four

federations.  There is a lot of  smoke  over  this.

Sir, as a result of the Member for Hong Lim and the

Member  for  Cairnhill being on the  same  side  in

wishing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



generate smoke. Obviously, something must have gone

wrong. Otherwise how could a Government register  a

federation and a few days later deregister it along

with the other federations? Suffice it to say, Sir,

that this was not unconnected with the issue of  an

entry  visa  for a Communist Russian representative

to  come  to  Singapore. From  time  to  time,  the

Singapore  Government is queried  by  the  Internal

Security Council for not taking the advice  of  the

Singapore  Government's own  Intelligence  section.

The  Intelligence  section had recommended  against

the  issue  of  a  visa  for  a  Russian  communist

representative  to  come to  Singapore  for  trade.

However,  the  Minister for Finance, together  with

the  Minister for Home Affairs, had over-ruled this

objection and had allowed the visa. Meanwhile,  the

same   Intelligence  department  of  the  Singapore

Government had given advice that a certain  general

employees' union should not be allowed to  register

with a federation unless their rues were changed to

comply with the new Trade Unions Ordinance and they

had first divested themselves of those sections  of

their membership not qualified to be members of the

union  under the new trade union laws. This  advice

was  endorsed by the Minister for Home Affairs but,

unfortunately,  it was overlooked by  the  Minister

for Labour and Law, for he had allowed a federation

which  included this particular general  employees'

union  to  be  registered on the' promise  of  this

union that when the new laws came into effect  they

would comply with them. The question that had  been

raised  in the Internal Security Council  was  over

the  visa  for  a  Russian  representative  on  the

principle that the Singapore Government had  on  an

important  matter ignored advice from the Singapore

Government's own Intelligence department. The  view

of  the  Singapore Government was that it  had  the

right  to  over-rule advice from  its  Intelligence

section  where  it  deemed it  was  in  the  public

interest, and where it considered no grave security

risk was involved. But in the case of the advice on

the  registration  of the federation,  this  advice

from the Singapore Government's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>





own  Intelligence department was  endorsed  by  the

Minister for Home Affairs, and a non-observance  of

this  advice was difficult to defend on  principle.

Therefore, for reasons of security arising  out  of

an  issue  of  principle in the  Internal  Security

Council,   the  Singapore  Government  decided   to

rectify  the  mistake  made  in  the  case  of  the

registration of the federation. It was  decided  to

deregister all the federations and allow them to re-register  after the new trade union laws  had  come

into force. The new trade union laws would make  it

incumbent  on general unions to comply  first  with

the  19 categories laid down in the Schedule before

they can register as federations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just

received a note to remind me that we are now multi-lingual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the visa for the Russian

representative, the Member for Cairnhill made great

play of what could or could not be discussed in the

Internal Security Council. I am glad that he  stood

up  for  the  right of the Singapore Government  to

decide  what  was  right or  wrong  in  matters  of

internal  self-government. Questions of  trade  and

immigration, Sir, are matters within the competence

of   the  Singapore  Government,  but  because,  in

exercising its competency in a particular instance,

the  Singapore Government had over-ruled the  views

of   its  own  Intelligence  branch,  the  Internal

Security  Council  had  made  an  issue  of   this.

However, the Member for Cairnhill raised another by-issue on this, for he wanted to make capital out of

a  denial  by the Minister for Culture. I  did  not

hear  him  say this, Sir, the day before yesterday,

but  it  was reported in the Straits Times that  he

had  said these words: "Then Mr Lee issued another

statement   verifying   the   Tunku's   claim   was

materially correct." [Interruption] Sir, I am  glad

that  the  Member for Cairnhill has  denied  making

that  statement, because he was so reported to have

said  it. What happened was this. The Minister  for

Finance, immediately after the issue was raised  by

the  Federation Government in the Press  and  after

the  Minister for Culture had issued his statement,

wrote  to  his counterpart in Kuala Lumpur  setting

out  the facts. If I  may just refer to the relevant

parts of that letter which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



was  subsequently released to the Press  and  whose

contents were made known in Kuala Lumpur. Sir, I do

not  wish to waste the time of the House by reading

the  full letter. All I wish to point out  is  that

the  view of the Singapore Government was that  the

Russian delegation to the E.C.A.F.E. Conference  on

small-scale industries did not constitute a Russian

trade   delegation,  and  that  one  representative

coming  here did not constitute a trade delegation,

particularly  as  he  had come  in  here  with  the

specific   purpose  of  attending   an   E.C.A.F.E.

Conference  on small-scale industries. I  can  only

add  that the Minister for Culture had no intention

at  any time to state other than what he personally

knew to be the truth and that, in fact, in his  and

in  the Government's view of the matter, there  was

no Russian trade delegation as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more concerned, however, with the

mendacious  line that has been taken by the  Member

for Cairnhill when he suggested that the P.A.P. was

Communist-infiltrated  and Communist-dominated.  He

suggested, Sir, by insinuation that we were keeping

in   our   membership   a   number   of   Communist

sympathisers and activists. Sir, as someone who has

been  intimately connected with the organs  of  the

State, the hon. Member must know what stupidity  it

is  to  make  so  dangerous  an  allegation  of   a

Government in power. The fact that we did not,  and

do not still, take a hysterical anti-Communist line

is   quite   a  different  matter  from  harbouring

Communists  and others who are insincere  in  their

loyalty  to  the aims and objectives of the  P.A.P.

Otherwise,   how  on  earth  can  we  govern   with

effectiveness and firmness? It is a pity,  Sir,  to

hear  this  dangerous drivel emanating from  people

whose  former positions should at least have  given

them  a  sense  of responsibility, or  should  have

imparted in them some wisdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill denied that

Communist  forces had gone underground  before  the

last elections. I do not know what he was inferring

by  that. If what he stated is true, then  what  he

is,  in fact, saying is that his two purges - one  in

1956  and  one in 1957 - were completely ineffective.

That, Sir, to my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



mind  is a foolish statement. The fact that  fringe

elements  were left out of the purge - and they  were

left out for a definite purpose - because it was wise

policy  not to treat fringe elements as Communists,

and  the fact that the bulk of the Chinese-speaking

was  so  convinced that the last Government  was  a

corrupt force, anti Chinese language, education and

culture  that  they  set out actively  to  work  to

destroy  the hon. Member in the last elections,  do

not  make them Communists, Sir. Whatever the  price

the  last Government paid for losing the propaganda

battle  and the battle for the minds of the Chinese

in the two purges, they succeeded in disrupting the

efficacy of the Communist open front organisers and

the   rest  of  them  did  go  under  cover - to  his

knowledge.  Whether he was wise in  taking  on  the

fight on his own behalf when the challenge was,  in

fact,  to  be  met  ultimately by  the  British  is

another matter which I shall deal with later on  in

my  speech.  But I feel sad, Sir, that an  ex-Chief

Minister  should  make  a  half-hearted  call   for

general  elections. It is only a  gesture  to  show

that  he  is  not a spent political force.  For  4½

years,  his  Labour Fronters clung on to  power  in

this   Assembly  upon  the  strength  of  nominated

Members,  and  jobs  for  every  one.  Here  is   a

Government  determined to govern within the  limits

of its power, invested with the power and the right

to  govern,  and the hon. Member calls for  general

elections!  Sir, let me add that he  may  find  his

wish  fulfilled  earlier than  he  expects  if  the

eventuality  should  arise in which  the  Left-wing

adventurers find themselves not just taking on  the

Singapore Government but also "the referee", as the

Member   for  Cairnhill  has  called  the  Internal

Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I leave the other minor points in the

speech  of the Member for Cairnhill, may I  correct

some  of  the more obvious mistakes made in  either

the  speech  or  the report of his  speech  in  the

Straits  Times?  May  I mention incidentally,  Sir,

that  to deny and refute every untruth, every half-truth and every half-lie made in this Chamber would

be an extremely tedious and a time-wasting process?

So far as we are concerned,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  any  allegation made in this Chamber,  unless

admitted, is denied and traversed generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ha, ha, ha!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the hon. Member has said

that I had told him that he was fishing in troubled

waters  and  that  I  had expressed  to  him  great

confidence  in my then colleague the  Minister  for

National  Development. Sir, this  was  supposed  to

have  taken  place  in  March  this  year,  to   my

recollection,  when I warned him  not  to  fish  in

troubled waters. But what I did tell him was not to

fish  in  troubled  waters, and  I  said  no  more,

because  by March this year the weaknesses  in  the

former   Minister  for  National  Development   had

already  become  apparent. And I  could  go  on  ad

infinitum,    all   these   little   misquotations,

misreferences,  that  I had called  people  "little

boys"  and all the rest of it; things that  I  have

not  said are imputed to me. I would like it to  be

put on record that nothing is admitted unless it is

specifically admitted, and that anything else which

is  not  admitted  is  specifically  traversed  and

denied. As a pleader, my learned friend should know

that  that  is  an economical way of  dealing  with

mendacious opponents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I turn to what to me

is  a sad and painful thing, to have to denounce  a

man  who  has  been a colleague for many  years,  a

person  who, through one phase of the struggle  for

freedom, we thought shared with us a common  cause.

We  knew he had his weaknesses; we did not realise,

however,   how  much  power  was  to  enlarge   and

accentuate his weaknesses to reach breaking  point.

The  trouble with the Member for Hong Lim, Sir,  is

that  he  is  more a plotter and a schemer  than  a

thinker  and  a  planner. It is all right  shouting

slogans,  working out cunning little lines  on  the

details after the broad policy has been settled by

a  team  of  thinkers. How is  he  going  to  fight

colonialism  in  this phase of the  battle?  He  no

longer  believes in the programme or the  political

analysis of the P.A.P. What is his alternative? How

is he going to bring about merger? How is he going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



to   bring  about  independence  for  Singapore  by

itself? These are abiding issues of great political

import.  I hope from now onwards we will from  time

to  time  divert  ourselves from our  more  mundane

duties   to   pay  attention  to  these   long-term

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me first point out to him some of

the  rather  obvious absurdities and contradictions

of   this   propaganda  line - the   Lee   Kuan   Yew

Government.  Sir, everybody is a nice  man,  except

me.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You are nicer!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I said yesterday when

explaining the definition of "people", it is always

useful  to  start off with one opponent first.  The

rest are the "people". You fight that opponent and,

after  you have destroyed him, you go on  with  the

process of elimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you are a fine gentleman. I do not know the

distinction between a fine and an unfine gentleman;

obviously there must be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the Minister for Culture is all right; he

is  a  reasonable chap. So is Mr Byrne except when

he  loses his temper. The Minister for Home Affairs

is a nice man, quiet and peace-loving. And Dr Toh,

who  unfortunately  is  away  today  attending   to

multifarious other duties and trying  to  clear  up

some mess left behind by a former colleague, he  is

also all right. But I forced the Assemblymen - 40  of

them,  Sir - to sign statements against him. I packed

a  gun  and surrounded all of them with Sten  guns,

and  my  henchmen pulled them in.  Sir,  the  whole

Cabinet,  the  whole  Central Executive  Committee,

consist of weak, vacillating puppets. Is this not a

little bit too obvious? May I suggest that a little

bit more balance, less accentuation of simple black

and  white, would make his line a little  bit  more

effective? Does he realise that these are  men  not

so  completely  devoid  of self-respect  as  to  be

humoured  in  this  amateurish  manner?  Are   they

stooges of the Secretary-General? If I am the  evil

man  who  manipulates the puppets, and I am strong-willed, ambitious and powerful how does this square

up  with  the  other  line of  the  stooge  of  the

English - me,  a  stooge  of  Blades.  Meadows,   and

Thomson?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the projection of a dictator with wild

ambitions,  determined and obviously successful  in

manipulating   all  the  Central   Executive,   the

Cabinet,  the  Party Secretariat, the officials  in

the  Party - is  this not a process of projection  of

one's  own  motives, one's own plotting, one's  own

thinking  and  methods, which failed so  miserably?

Sir,  on  the one hand I am a stooge, weak,  feeble

and  docile,  and  I am, in fact,  run  by  Blades.

Thomson  and  Meadows - they run  me, they  run  the

Government, they run the P.A.P. On the other  hand,

I  am  a  powerful  character  who  manipulates  my

colleagues  by  terror and with  bribes,  guns  and

jobs,  and  perks.  Sir, I do  not  pretend  to  be

suffering  from  any psychiatric disorders  at  the

moment,  and I hope I never will. I think those  of

us  who have been in this Chamber for the last five

years will know that from time to time we get  this

malady in this Chamber. In fact, I was thinking the

other  day  that it was absolutely  vital  that  we

should  amend  our  Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections  Ordinance, because it is  out  of  date.

There should be a clause there to say that a doctor

must certify an Assemblyman compos mentis before he

makes a major speech in the Assembly. We have  seen

it enacted before in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am no `Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde'. Does the

Member  for Hong Lim believe that Dr Toh, whom  he

denounced anonymously in the name of his Hong  Lim

Branch Committee, was guilty of what he called  the

Chairman's  undemocratic conduct? Does  he  believe

that Dr Toh is a stooge?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Deputy Prime Minister, Sir - a

research  scientist,  with  no  personal  political

ambitions of greatness. Why should he be a  stooge,

Sir?  I  am  not  looking after the  funds  of  the

University   to  supply  him  with   expenses   and

equipment  for his laboratory tests; unless  he  is

carrying  out  tests  on some mysterious  creatures

which I am providing him with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Beetle!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And the Member for Crawford,

the  Member  for Kampong Glam, and the  Member  for

Telok  Ayer.  I am glad, Sir, that he did  not  say

that the Member for Sembawang was a nice gentleman,

because  he has been going around telling  all  the

Malay Assemblymen here what a nasty fellow be  [the

Member for Sembawang] was, and that he was a stooge

of the Secretary-General. It is a good thing he did

not  have  the audacity to say so, for I  think  he

knows that the Member for Sembawang is a man likely

to take him out and tear him to strips.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us get on to the facts, Sir.

Allegations and counter-allegations - very  wise  and

judicious, in the opinion of the Member for  Farrer

Park, because they leave him very much in the dark.

Let  us first get these three bogey-men out of  the

way:   Mr  George  Thomson,  former  Director   of

Information, a powerful man in the old days and, to

the  Member  for  Hong Lim, an even  more  powerful

individual  now. What were his duties in  the  last

Government,  Sir?  For the last  few  years  before

1959,  he gave the political line and the political

content, and he was the propaganda machine for  the

Chief  Minister. He did the political thinking  for

the  Chief  Minister's  Ministerial  colleagues,  a

thing which they did not do for themselves. And  we

denounced  them  because  they  did  not  have  the

ideological substance to do their own speeches.  We

denounced them for just mouthing the speeches of an

expatriate  officer. It is not to say  we  did  not

recognise  Mr Thomson's ability and usefulness  to

us  for a particular job. We had to re-educate  our

civil servants on the problems which confronted  us

and  which  he, as Director of Information,  should

have  known something about, and because it is  our

business to make the civil servants more alive  and

alert  to  the  dangers  and  difficulties  of  the

revolution  in  Asia. Is the Member  for  Hong  Lim

prepared  or  intellectually  equipped  to  do  the

lectures and to teach the civil servants? His  only

contribution to political thinking in all his years

in the P.A.P. has been one article in this Souvenir

number to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



which he had pledged his loyalty and support. It is

entitled  "Since  I  became  the  First  Mayor   of

Singapore".  Is  he  going  to  educate  the  civil

service with this? Fortunately, Sir, the P.A.P. is

not  altogether devoid of leaders who can undertake

the  intellectual  task  of making  an  ideological

exposition of democratic socialism. Let us get this

clear.  Mr George Thomson is a functionary in  the

Political  Study Centre. He arranges  the  lectures

and   the  discussions.  The  political  line,  the

policies,  the  programmes of this Political  Study

Centre were laid down and are still being laid down

by  a  Committee  under  the  chairmanship  of  the

Minister  for Culture, consisting, amongst  others,

of  Mr James Puthucheary, Mr Devan Nair, Mr  Jek

Yuen Thong, Mr S. Woodhull, and Inche Rahim Ishak.

Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and  Political

Secretaries, Sir, personally go there from time  to

time to conduct discussions and lectures. The only

Minister  who  has  not done so and  has  not  been

invited  to  do so was the ex-Minister, the  Member

for  Hong  Lim, because it would not have done  the

political  leadership any good to put up a  slogan-shouter in the Study Centre, or put him forward  as

a  serious  thinker. Sir, he should  have  attended

these  lectures given by Mr Devan Nair, Mr  James

Puthucheary and others. Then perhaps he might  have

acquired some ideological knowledge to coin some of

the new slogans which he must now forge if he wants

to survive politically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, is Mr Blades, this evil man. Whom

does he manipulate? Does he manipulate the Minister

for  Home Affairs? Sir, on the one hand, I am being

accused of complete control and manipulation of the

Police  Force. On the other hand, I am told I  have

been manipulated by Mr Blades. The Member for Hong

Lim  has to make up his mind. A propaganda line has

to  be clear, simple, lucid, and not contradictory.

Either  I  am  strong  and I  manipulate  both  the

Minister  for Home Affairs and the Commissioner  of

Police; or the Commissioner of Police is strong and

manipulates  both  me  and the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs. The Member for Hong Lim thinks that by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



glossing over all this, he has prevented injury  to

the  personality of the Minister for Home  Affairs,

who   is   an   important   Party   functionary - the

Organising  Secretary  in  charge  of   the   Party

apparatus.  Does he not know that,  by  saying  all

this,  what  he is, in fact, saying is  either  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs is  my  stooge  or  Mr

Blades is his stooge, or Mr Blades is a stooge  of

both?  And  he  thinks that that is a clever  line!

Sir, has he forgotten how seriously we thought over

this  problem  of  the Police  Force,  and  how  we

strongly  pressed  for the promotion  of  the  most

senior  local  officer  as Deputy  Commissioner  of

Police,  and are pressing for arrangements  whereby

those  local  officers can prepare  themselves  for

their  new and vigorous responsibilities?  Sir,  no

one knows better than these officers themselves how

inadequately the colonial government  of  the  past

had  equipped them as officers to take over the top

jobs of the civil service in the Police Force.  And

they   themselves   had  told  the   Malayanisation

Commission  that for several years  to  come,  they

would not be ready to take over the top jobs in the

Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim, now that he is

deprived  of power, is only interested in  bringing

the  house down. We are not going to allow that  to

happen.  We are here to see that the State and  the

machinery of the State functions, and no amount  of

challenge, either insidious or otherwise, by  Left-wing adventurers or whoever else is going to put us

into a false position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in extremis, one could get a situation like

the  Congo  Army, where a Serjeant  major  suddenly

finds  himself as general in charge of an  army  of

all  corporals  and no privates,  because  all  the

privates have been promoted to corporals. I do  not

believe  the  situation  in Singapore  is  anywhere

remotely  near  that, but it  is  our  business  to

ensure  that  the efficiency of the organs  of  the

State is maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Meadows - this man on Intelligence duties.

The  Member for Hong Lim wanted to keep Mr Meadows

in his Ministry to help him. When he found that Mr

Meadows was unwilling to be his personal minion, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



sent  him  out  to the Southern Islands.  When  Mr

Meadows  came  back from the Southern  Islands,  he

found that the walls of his office, which had  been

put  up on the orders of the ex-Minister, had  been

knocked down, and the air-conditioner removed.  And

this  Intelligence duties man reacted in  a  manner

unbecoming of an Intelligence agent. He did a human

thing.  He wanted to resign, to give up his job  of

spying.  Then, Sir, the ex-Minister again  wavered.

He swung to the other side of the pendulum, because

Mr  Meadows  was doing a good job of his  Southern

Islands  task. But you cannot humiliate a  man  one

day, pat him on the back the next, and tell him  to

forget  that  you kicked him in the teeth  the  day

before.  I did not plan to have Mr Meadows  in  my

Ministry.  He was to have been transferred  to  the

Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  or  the  Ministry   of

Finance.  But the Member for Hong Lim  started  his

smear  campaign, and so I asked for Mr Meadows  to

be  transferred to my Ministry. It  is  one  of  my

duties  to  put my foot down on what I know  to  be

wrong  and vicious. I allotted Mr Meadows  a  task

which he should have performed for the Minister for

National  Development, namely, that of distributing

the departments of the City Council and integrating

them  with the Government Ministries - a job  he  was

never  permitted  to perform when  he  was  in  the

Ministry of National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these three bogey men are supposed to be

occupying more powerful positions than before.  The

truth  of  these  allegations, if  left  unrefuted,

however wild and scandalous they may be, might find

some  takers. Therefore, it is my business,  and  I

hope  the House will bear with me if I go into some

detail, to go through all these wild allegations on

Malayanisation   and  expatriate  officers   making

stooges of the Ministers of this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, Mr Owen - the famous Mr Owen.

Some  people have greatness thrust upon  them.  Mr

Owen  got  fame and glory overnight. He was  sacked

from  the  City  Council.  Three  expatriates   who

retired were asked to return by me. The Member  for

Hong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



Lim   says  I  am  a  stooge  man,  Sir;  a   weak,

vacillating character, and could not do without  my

expatriate masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that Mr Estrop, a local electrical

engineer, was going to be promoted for a big job in

the electricity power station at Pasir Panjang, but

he  was  thwarted  by  wicked,  evil  me.  Let  us

confront the Member for Hong Lim with these facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Malayanisation of the City Council. Sir, I

do  not want to run through these names. It is very

tedious.  There are a lot of details. Those  of  us

who  have' leisure time might browse through  them.

They might find considerable interest in them. So I

propose to table these lists for the delectation of

both  the  hon. Members of this Assembly  and  such

members  of  the  Press  as may  be  interested  in

checking  the  veracity of my statement.  The  City

Council  Malayanisation policy was introduced  into

the City Council and passed by the Member for Hong

Lim, as the then Mayor, on the 30th June, 1958. And

there  is a verbatim report of the ordinary general

meeting  held on that day which has been placed  in

the records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ex-Mayor proposed that of the 71

expatriate officers then in the City Council,  only

8 were to be malayanised immediately, leaving 63 to

be malayanised as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 guaranteed employment until retirement;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 until 1st June, 1959, or retirement at 55,

or optional retirement at 50;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 until 1st January, 1964, or retirement at 55, or optional retirement at 50;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 until 1st January, 1962,



<br><br>a  total  of  63  from all departments - technicians,

technocrats in the Electricity, Architects,  Water,

Analysts, Chemical, Gas and other Departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us turn to Mr Estrop - the local man whom

I  was  alleged to have thwarted. He is a qualified

electrical engineer, Sir. He was posted  by  a  man

called Lui Boon Poh. I think it was mentioned  that

he had a peculiar habit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



of  waking  up at 5 o'clock in the morning - that  is

about his only virtue, I think. He was in charge at

one  time  of  cleansing.  Then  he  became  Deputy

Administrator. He posted Mr Estrop to be No. 2  in

charge  of the Pasir Panjang Power Station  without

Mr    Estrop    having   the    necessary    legal

qualifications for the job - a requirement laid  down

by   the   Machinery  Ordinance   and   the   Rules

thereunder.   I  know  that  in  the   process   of

revolution  one  could ignore the niceties  of  the

law.  But when it came to my notice that a man  who

did    not    have    the   necessary    mechanical

qualifications  was  put  in  charge  of  a   power

station,  it left me aghast. It says here  in  this

Factories  (Persons-in-Charge)  Regulations,  1960.

Regulation 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person shall be in charge of any boiler,

steam  engine or internal combustion engine, except

as provided in these regulations.'



<br><br>And it says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(7) Where the heating surface of a steam boiler

or  the  aggregate heating surface of steam boilers

connected  to a common range exceeds five  thousand

square feet a first grade steam engineer shall... be

in  charge... to ensure that there shall not be  more

than two steam boilers to each attendant.'



<br><br>Mr Estrop was not a first grade steam engineer. He was  put  back  to  what he was qualified  to  do - a

distribution engineer. I am sorry, Sir, Mr  Estrop

is a serving officer. There is nothing against him.

But I would like to mention that I have had to make

reference  to him purely because he was brought  up

as  an  issue. But he had no mechanical engineering

experience  or steam experience. The  man  who  did

this  hazardous and, in my view, completely  stupid

piece  of  posting  was Lui Boon Poh,  then  Deputy

Administrator  in  charge of the  three  mechanical

trading departments of Gas, Water and Electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lui Boon Poh was educated at Batu Pahat where he attained Standard VIII. He had previously been a

salesman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,

Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before we

posted  Mr  Estrop  to  the  Pasir  Panjang  Power

Station,  we  had  a  meeting  with  four  or  five

qualified   local  engineers  in  the   Electricity

Department. The meeting was held in the Ministry of

National Development. It continued for 2 or 3 days.

It  was agreed among us that Mr Estrop was  a  fit

and   proper   person   to   be   deputy   to   the

Superintendent of the Pasir Panjang Power  Station.

After  we  had made the decision, I instructed  the

Administrator to carry it out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am obliged for all these

further  details, and that there  were  some  minds

brought to bear on this problem. But there is  just

one simple point. Wisdom accumulated over years  of

manipulating this dangerous equipment has laid down

that  there should be a man with a certain kind  of

training to look after this kind of machinery,  and

our   law  enacted  by  this  Legislature,  through

subsidiary  legislation,  has  so  specified.   Mr

Estrop  was  unqualified.  He  did  not  have  that

particular  qualification,  and  the  posting   was

illegal. It was contrary to the law. That is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go back to Mr Lui Boon Poh - obviously he

was a stooge man, it did not matter - who was told to

do  it. He was not really responsible for this.  He

was educated -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Prime Minister is

satisfied that this man, Lui Boon Poh, is a  stooge

of  a group of people, as he has mentioned, then is

it  fair now to go into details about the character

and  the  career  of this man?  I  know  the  Prime

Minister is protected by freedom of speech in  this

Assembly,  but perhaps he would think twice  before

he carries on this line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am sorry you should

anticipate evil motive when there is none, Sir. The

whole thing is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the Prime Minister

does  not  say  that  the Chair  has  imputed  evil

motive. I am just indicating -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Anticipating.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am just indicating that the Member

for  Hong  Lim has pointed out to this  House  that

this particular decision was not a decision of this

man  Lui  Boon  Poh. If the Prime  Minister  thinks

that,  in  spite of that, he wishes to continue  in

`this line of speech, then of course he may do  so.

I  cannot  stop him. There is freedom of speech  in

this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker. I do not propose

to  waste the time of this House more than  I  can

help  it over this sordid matter. It does no credit

to  us, because we are responsible collectively for

this misdemeanour - more so me as primus inter pares.

I    want    to   get   certain   facts   straight.

Malayanisation   is   the   issue.   If   this   is

Malayanisation,  then  I  say  I   fight   it.   My

colleague,  the Minister for Labour  and  Law,  has

referred  to  Batu Pahatisation. This  is  just  an

instance. It is important because it is a  question

of   principle,  an  indication  of  the  type   of

mentality that operated this policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Lui Boon Poh was educated at Batu Pahat

where  he  passed Standard VIII. He had  previously

been  a  salesman with Fissions Chemicals,  selling

patent  medicines  amongst  other  things.  He  was

appointed  first as Superintendent, City  Cleansing

Department and then as Deputy Administrator (Public

Utilities). He was not dismissed immediately  after

I  took  over.  He was given three months  to  show

that, despite the fact that his past experience and

qualifications  were somewhat not in  keeping  with

the   job  he  was  holding,  he  is  an  extremely

competent administrator. Unfortunately, after three

months,  our high hopes and expectations  were  not

realised. He is now back in the Federation,  having

been   refused  re-employment  as  a  salesman   by

Fissions Chemicals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other character - also on Malayanisation, this

time  in  the S.I.T. - is his brother, Mr  Lui  Boon

Phor.  He  was appointed first as Chief Development

Officer  of the S.I.T. I will come to him  when  we

deal with the S.I.T. Mr Lui



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



Boon  Poh  has also a friend, a fellow salesman  in

Fissions Chemicals. His name is Mr Low Chye Chuan.

He  was first appointed as Labour Officer - obviously

he  was  very good in human relations - and  then  as

Superintendent. Cleansing Department, City Council.

When  Mr  Lui  Boon  Poh was  promoted  to  Deputy

Administrator  (Public  Utilities),  Mr  Low  Chye

Chuan  took  over  the Cleansing Department,  as  a

result of which the incinerator was closed down  in

the  interest of economy. There is a touch  of  the

comic  about these things. The only reason  why  we

can  afford to laugh about this is that we have put

it  right quickly. I wish Mr Low the best of luck.

He  is  now  back  selling medicines  for  Fissions

Chemicals



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, Mr Owen - J. I. Owen, age 27, born in

1933. This is his career from the official records,

and  I think no more justice can be done to a  man

than  to have the truth told about him. In October,

1950, age 17, till October 1951, he was a clerk  in

Rennie  Lowick & Co., Singapore. In March 1952,  he

entered  the University of Adelaide. From  November

1954  to March 1955, an accountant clerk in  Broken

Hill  Associated Smelters, South Australia. On  4th

of  April,  1956,  he  was awarded  the  degree  of

Bachelor  of  Economics, Adelaide. On the  18th  of

September, 1956, he became a member of the  Society

of   Accountants,  which  is  not  a   professional

qualification  in Singapore. On the 29th  of  June,

1957,  in  the  wicked City Council  of  which  the

Member for Farrer Park was a component part, he was

employed in the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The only part?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Component part. I think there

were 32 altogether. I am not sure. Sir, I think you

were also a component part in that year before  you

came  to  this Chamber. I do not know whether  that

thought was out of the mind of the Member for  Hong

Lim  when  he referred to you as a fine  gentleman.

But perhaps you have repented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

ought not to involve the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, he joined the City

Council  on  the  27th of June, 1957.  He  was  not

qualified to be an accountant, so he could  not  go

into  the Assistant Treasurer's Department. He  was

employed as a temporary technical assistant.  Then,

at  long  last,  on the 30th of October,  1957,  he

became a qualified accountant. On 1st July, 1959, I

think, he became an efficiency expert for the  City

Council   Administrator.  He  became  Acting   City

Treasurer  on 12th September, 1957 ($200 per  month

extra)  and Deputy Administrator on 17th September,

1959.  Sir, less than one year and 11 months  after

he  had  qualified as an accountant, he was put  in

charge  of  $121  million  worth  of  public  funds

annually. We have all heard about the Belgian Congo

sergeant major who became a general, Sir. But I  do

not  think  Mr  Owen was very far off  that  rapid

promotion.  He  is now working as an accountant  in

Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make this point. Immediately

preceding  his  appointment as City Treasurer,  Mr

Owen  was  number 6 in seniority in the department.

There  were Mr Scales, Mr Loveday, Mr  Tan  Beng

Lay, Mr Tan Hoay Gie. They all resigned, Sir,  and

that   left  him  as  City  Treasurer  and   Deputy

Administrator.  They had run away  because  of  his

Batu  Pahatisation. They took their Provident  Fund

benefits and fled. Sir, of these officers,  two  of

them were local officers, Mr Tan Beng Lay and  Mr

Tan  Hoay Gie, and three were expatriates  who  had

been  asked by the ex-Mayor to stay - one till  1962.

and  the  two others till 1964. Sir, I  am  charged

with  being a colonial stooge for not allowing $121

million  worth of public expenditure to be  in  the

hands  of  an accountant 27 years old who had  just

qualified two years ago. Mr Owen tried to  make  a

political  issue out of it and started making  some

noises.  I am sorry to say that we had to slap  him

in  the  face publicly. I may also add that he  had

only  one  qualification (with  distinction)  which

qualified  him for his job. It was that  he  worked

into the 1960 Budget of the City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



Council,  in  his short time there as  Acting  City

Treasurer, an extra $5 million for the use  of  the

Minister for National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an Acting City Treasurer, Mr Owen drew up

a $5 million, deficit budget, despite the stringent

economies  which  was  then  the  policy   of   the

Government.  It  is significant,  Sir,  that  those

departments  in the City Council whose  expenditure

was  boosted  were those which had been transferred

to  the Ministry of National Development. The  City

Engineers   Department - estimated  expenditure   $28

million  as  against $19 million in  1959  and  $18

million  in  1958.  Sir, the Minister  for  Finance

appointed Mr Hibberd - remember the geographer, Sir,

who could not multiply very well. He was sent there

to have a look at the treasury millions, to unravel

the  budget,  and put up a balanced budget  in  its

place.  And  he  did so, Sir. The  $5  million  was

stripped  off. Sir, Mr Owen, who has an Australian

wife, has gone back to Australia. He probably saw a

better  future for his family there. And there  the

matter ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that someone, who would have been

happier  not to have been mentioned in this  august

Chamber, was brought in by the Member for Hong  Lim

just to be one of his issues - Malayanisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussion with the Minister for Finance, I

decided  that Mr Scales, Mr Embley, Mr Lam,  Mr

Tan  Hoay  Gie  and  all those in  the  Treasurer's

Department who had resigned were to be offered  re-employment.  Sir, it is quite simple.  If  the  ex-Mayor   thought  that  it  was  right  that   these

expatriates  should stay till 1962,  or  1964,  and

they  had gone in 1959, leaving a 27-year-old chap,

it   is  right,  now  that  the  cause  for  their

unhappiness  was no longer there,  that  I  offered

them   re-employment.  Two   of   the   expatriates

returned, Sir. One did not. Unfortunately,  of  the

two local men who left, only one, Mr Tan Beng Lay,

returned. The other, Mr Tan Hoay Gie, had  already

committed  himself to another job. Sir,  I  do  not

want to labour this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



point,   but  this  startling  business   of   Batu

Pahatisation,  not  Malayanisation,  led   to   the

resignation  of  38  local  senior  officers,   not

expatriates - I  will come to the expatriates  later.

They  took  their provident fund and left,  because

they thought the ex-Minister was the boss man,  the

supreme authority, and, indeed, that they were  all

going  to  be  Barn Pahatised. Sir, I have  a  list

here * . I  have

left  copies for Members of both sides of the House

too.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Very well, Sir. I only want

to  mention one point. In the Remarks column it  is

shown  that some of them resigned on dates after  I

have  taken charge of the City Council. But in  all

those  cases they had already sent in their  papers

and had resigned before I took over.. It was just a

matter   of  taking  leave  before  retiring   from

service.

Government service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will

come  to  that by and by. How would the Member  for

Hong  Lim  explain the people who returned  to  the

City Council service after he was no longer able to

terrorise them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also a list here of officers whom we

have  re-engaged+. They  are  local  officers   and

expatriate  officers, and I so table them.  I  only

have   this   to   add.  That  the   City   Council

Malayanisation   policy  moved  by   the   ex-Mayor

provided for 63 expatriates to stay. Only  13  have

stayed.   Because   we  offered  re-employment   to

three-two in the Treasurer's Department and one  in

the Electricity Department-the total left is 16.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one last point about this Malayanisation. I

think we will begin to hear less about Mr Owen  if

I  deal  with it. First of all, it is something  so

wild  and fantastic that people do not believe  it.

But  it  is  being  repeated..  In  case  it  gains

credence, the best thing to do is to nail the facts

down.  So  I hope you will bear with me if  I  just

wind up this particular aspect of the argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one further point is that of the many

appointments made by the Member for Hong Lim,  many

were temporary appointments on contract, which is a

device  to  avoid reference to the  Public  Service

Commission  and  circumvent the provisions  of  the

Public  Service Commission Ordinance. Also a chosen

few  who  were  awarded new contracts had  salaries

with built-in variable allowances, so avoiding  the

cuts  which the permanent service had to bear. Sir,

of   course   those  who  received  this   favoured

treatment  must have received it for  very  special

reasons.  It gives me no pleasure, Sir, to  recount

all these things, but I am prepared to recount them

publicly   because  each  and  everyone  of   these

misdemeanour has been put right. Every one  of  the

officers  who  were improperly appointed  has  been

dismissed and the proper officers re-engaged. I  am

sorry, Sir, that a colleague gone drunken mad  with

power was for a few months able to do these things.

On  behalf  of my colleagues and myself,  I  accept

full  responsibility. After the event, I can safely

say  that  we did what was necessary and  held  the

administration firmly and effectively together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the same sad story can be repeated in the

S.I.T.  In  four  months, during which  the  former

Minister  for  National Development  made  himself,

first  Chairman and then Manager of the  Trust,  he

reduced it to near paralysis, unable to handle  any

housing  or  planning projects of any  consequence.

The   manager,  architects,  planners,   financial,

estates  and other officers all left. The  position

is  something  like  this,  Sir.  Eight  expatriate

officers  resigned  and,  of  these,  the  Minister

wanted  to  retain two. He told me that personally.

He said he wanted two of them. They did not want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



stay.   Ten  were  retrenched.  Two  senior   local

officers resigned, one was retrenched, and 58 local

junior  officers  were retrenched.  Sir,  in  their

places    came    a   whole   host   of    personal

appointees - some qualified, many unqualified. Twenty-two  others  who  took  the  place  of  the  junior

retrenched  officers  were  either  unqualified  or

under-qualified. An example is Mr Lui  Boon  Phor,

the brother of the man who was told to send someone

to the Pasir Panjang Power Station. Sir, he is also

from   Batu   Pahat.   He  was   appointed   Chief

Development  Officer.  On  20th  August  1959,  his

salary was $450 per month as Lettings Officer. Then

he  was  promoted.  On 1st of  October,  1959,  his

salary  was  $670. Sir, apart from just  being  the

brother  of  Mr Lui Boon Poh - he had a  few  other

things to commend him. One of these is that he  was

un-qualified. He was a part-time teacher  in  adult

education. But he was, of course, put in charge  of

all the lettings in the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these misappointments have been

rectified  and  the  right people  with  the  right

qualifications have been put into the  right  jobs.

In  the  process, Sir, some 30 P.A.P. members  who

were  under-qualified  or not  qualified  had  been

employed  on the personal instructions of  the  ex-Minister  for National Development. They  have  had

their services terminated by the Housing Authority.

The  Member  for Hong Lim, Sir, believed  that  he

could  buy  support in the Party  by  giving  Party

officials  jobs which by-passed the Public  Service

Commission. Sir, we smacked this nonsense down. May

I say, for the benefit of the Member for Cairnhill

who  alleges  that it is "P.A.P.-isation",  that  I

think  he  should look into the facts  and  figures

before   he   makes  these  scandalous  allegations

against the P.A.P. as such? Jobs for the boys, Sir,

was  one form of political corruption by the Member

for  Hong  Lim,  in  conspiracy  with  an  expelled

Assistant  Organising Secretary of the  Party,  Mr

Tan  Gak  Eng,  designed to build up  his  personal

empire  in the Government and the Party. It failed,

unfortunately for him, and even those who  were  to

have  been  his  grateful Party supporters  through

jobs and patronage have turned against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



him  when they discovered what the game was  about.

Sir,  let  me  add  that only a political  innocent

would  still  be shouting the same  old  slogan  of

"Down with white officers - Malayanisation!" They are

already  politically down, and we can get them  out

any  time  we want to. Our problem is not a  simple

one  of  dislodging  expatriate officers  who  were

entrenched in deciding questions of policy, but who

are  now  pure  implementers  of  our  policy.  The

problem  now is how to find sufficient  numbers  of

local  men with the ability and the skill,  capable

and efficient, to learn quickly enough to carry out

the   functions  of  the  State  and  maintain  the

efficiency of the administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to table a statement* of the

position   of  Malayanisation  in  the   Government

Ministries which shows very clearly how  far  ahead

we are now of the Malayanisation plans. They can be

circulated after the speech, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the half-witted, Sir, shout slogans after

the  position  has altered and the slogans  are  no

longer valid. Sir, "Malayanisation, and down  with

expatriate officers" was a slogan which  we  coined

and  shouted  to  meet a situation when  expatriate

officers were settling the destinies of the  people

of Singapore. They no longer are, and no stretching

of  half-truths can prove that they are.  Sir,  the

easiest thing in the world today is to shout  anti-colonial slogans and to pretend to be a fierce anti-colonial hero. There is no risk of personal  injury

in  doing  this, because you are denouncing  people

who are no longer dangerously in a position to hurt

you.  Sir, the British have been driven to the wall

in  Asia. Abuse and denunciation by the peoples  of

Asia - nearly  all of which they deserve - is  part  of

their daily bread. But, Sir, when we denounced  the

British in the early 1950's, that was the time when

it  was  politically risky to do so,  because  then

they  were  fighting. Sir, we  fought  the  British

administration and nearly brought the machinery  of

government  to a standstill in 1953 by  working  in

the unions and amongst the Government servants.  Of

course,  the Member for Hong Lim was not  there  at

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



time.  He finds all this very painful. We took  him

into  the  Party  in 1955. He did not  say  a  word

publicly  until the Tanjong Pagar by  elections  in

July 1957. We trained him up as a slogan-shouter to

project  the Party's thoughts and shout the Party's

slogans.  But he forgets that without an  apparatus

and   an  outfit  to  think  out  the  slogans  for

him - slogans   based  on  political   analysis   and

thinking - it  would  not be  long  before  he  comes

unstuck and the mass turns sour upon him. Sir, does

he  believe that we can be intimidated  by  a  mass

meeting? Let me tell his associate, the Member  for

Aljunied,  that  we are a Party  that  learned  and

demonstrated how to work the mass movement and mass

sentiments, and that it was in the P.A.P. that  he

was  taught  and he learned how to  do  it.  If  he

thinks  we cannot expose him and fight him  in  the

hearts  and minds of the workers, the taxi-drivers,

the  trisha-riders, the poor, the dispossessed  and

the  small shop-keepers - never forget that  whenever

one  defends  the poor and the dispossessed - then  I

say that he has a rude awakening coming to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Secretary-General of my Party, I was

alleged   to  have  issued  cards  to  non-members,

presumably - it  was  not said  but  the  implication

was - to get the Member for Hong Lim voted out of the

Party in August 1957. Sir, he denies by implication

that  it  was  the Left-wing adventurers  (who  had

since   been  detained)  who  had  picked  up   the

admission  cards  sent to other members,  who  were

missing or had otherwise gone away, at addresses in

the unions, who had organised to vote him out. Sir,

he has forgotten one non-Party member, like Mr Lim

Ching Joo - he is still under detention, Sir, - who  is

a  brother  of a Political Secretary  and  who  had

turned  up  at the Party conference in August  1957

with a card which had been sent to somebody else in

the  Shop  and Factory Workers Union. He  organised

the  opposition and got the Member for Hong Lim out

of  the  Central  Committee. Sir, the  hon.  Member

refers to these men whom he hated and feared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 587</b></font><br><br>



as his comrades who are still in gaol. Sir, this is

what Mr Lim Ching Joo wrote to me on 22nd December

last year. It is a long letter and I do not propose

to  read  it through. This is, in fact, a political

exercise   expressing  his  political   views   and

convictions,   but  he  thought  it  necessary   to

establish  first his relationship by reminding  and

admitting his role in August 1957:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dear Prime Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I have been for some time desirous to

furnish   you  with  some  explanations  regarding

certain  matters,  amongst them  the  August  1957

issue  in  the Singapore Badminton Hall, I  regret

having  had  no  opportunity  to  be  granted  the

favour of an interview with you. Now the time  has

come  that  I should write to you without  further

delay.  [I have seen him and discussed in  greater

detail the goings-on of the past few years].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am aware, I feel you have greatly

misunderstood me over a certain matter and  it  is

not  unlikely that you are still in that mood even

today.   I  refer  to  the  incident,  the  P.A.P.

Central  Committee election crisis, which appeared

in  August  1957. You too are aware  that  it  was

rather  unfortunate for me to be involved  in  the

matter  and  that  the attitude I then  maintained

was  no  different from what was adopted by  those

who  disputed against you. And it was  because  of

these  people and their refusal to budge in  their

stand that the issue became worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have pondered over the matter and the

relevant facts, I am beginning to feel that  those

people  were as wrong as they were harmful in  the

attitude  they adopted. No one can deny  that  the

August  1957 incident was virtually a  battle  for

power  sufficiently indicating  that  the  Leftist

adventurers   involved  were  both  childish   and

unscrupulous in their acts -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Hon. the Prime Minister

knows,  of course, that we are debating the  policy

speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. May I remind

him of Standing Order No. 13 which says - I have read

this before and I might as well read it again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Debate [on the speech] shall be confined to the

policy  of the Government as outlined in the speech

and on amendments (if any) moved ...'.



<br><br>I  suppose all these details could be touched on in

passing,  but  when  more  and  more  details   are

mentioned,  I think perhaps we are going  a  little

too far from the motion itself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry. I have not

as  yet woven all these threads into a pattern.  If

at  the  end of this speech, Sir, I have failed  to

bring  to  your mind and the minds of the public  a

pattern, then I will have wasted the time  of  this

Assembly  in  reading  trivialities.  There  is   a

definite  pattern:  August 1957 and  July  1960 - the

same  pattern, the same adventurers, the same risky

careering  that will take us, if we are  not  firm,

back  to the trials and tribulations of 1955.  That

is all I want to establish, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is perfectly

in order, but it seems to me that perhaps the Prime

Minister  is  labouring  the  point  which  he  has

already made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I, with greater

assiduity and, I hope, with obviousness, weave  the

threads  more closely together? The letter goes  on

to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No one can deny that the August 1957 incident

was  virtually  a  battle  for  power  sufficiently

indicating  that the Leftist adventurers  involved

were  both childish and unscrupulous in their  acts

and  I  feel penitent about all the wrongs  I  have

committed while involved in the incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one point that I must explain

to  you, that I was involved in the incident should

by  no  means be interpreted as meaning that I  was

myself  politically ambitious. I  was,  of  course,

somewhat  opposed  to  the P.A.P. because  of  its

political platform but other than that I  have  not

the  political maturity to remain firm in my stand.

As  a  result,  sentimental circumstances  got  the

better of me.'



<br><br>And  they  organised and picked up these cards  and

disposed  of a person who was a colleague of  mine,

who had the same mind as they had - a plotter - and who

supplied  us  with what we simple,  straightforward

and honest souls did not have - the skill to match  a

plot for a plot, a conspiracy for a conspiracy. And

so  they  fixed  him. I was the contestant  in  the

arena,  but they knew that the Member for Hong  Lim

was  our plotter. Therefore, they disposed of  him.

Now, Sir, the positions are turned. The Member  for

Hong  Lim says that they are his comrades in  gaol.

They are not, Sir,I can produce letters which will

go into even more detail and which may one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



day  make an excellent political dissertation.  But

what is important is this. The hon. Member seems to

have  forgotten  that at that Party  conference  in

August  1957  we learned our lesson.  Firstly,  the

party   card  with  photograph  thereafter   became

essential; and, secondly, never to allow people  to

become members of the Party just by filling  up  an

application form, paying $4 and attending the Party

conference to decide on policy and discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim agreed with the

Central   Executive  Committee,  when   introducing

amendments  to the Party Constitution in  1958,  to

ensure  that  thereafter only Party  cadre  members

tried  and found loyal to the Party principles  and

policies  were to be entrusted with the control  of

policies and the execution of Party discipline.  Is

it  not  because  he lost out in  the  inner  Party

struggle,  knocked out in spite of  trying  to  buy

over Party members with jobs in his Ministry and in

his  statute corporation, the Singapore Improvement

Trust,  that  he  wanted to go  back  to  the  1954

revolutionary  spirit  so that  he  could  get  his

friends  to  pay  $4  each  and  go  to  the  Party

conference and vote for him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately before we took office, we

obtained  the  release of all those men  intimately

connected with the Party leadership. The other were

mostly not our comrades, Sir, but because they were

detained at the same time as our comrades, we  had,

on a matter of principle and as a matter of honour,

agreed  to press for their release. The Member  for

Hong  Lim said that he had made his stand clear  in

the Internal Security Council on 28th August, 1959,

and  that  thereafter he was not allowed to  speak.

Sir, who did not allow him to speak in the Internal

Security Council? I do not like the British, Sir; I

think  they are a lot of so-and-so's. But there  is

one  thing that they do allow - and they have  learnt

that  with  some  wisdom - and that  is  to  speak,

particularly when it is in private. Sir,  has  this

fierce   anti-colonialist  been  intimidated   from

speaking his mind after the 28th August, 1959? Were

there  people with guns surrounding him? Was he  so

frightened that he quietly acquiesced? I think the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



U.K. Commissioner, the noble lord, had not yet then

taken  the chair. The Member for Hong Lim only  had

to   deal  with  Sir  William  Goode.  He  did  not

intimidate the P.A.P. for many years, and we had to

deal  with him from time to time. We turned up  and

demanded that we should hold protest meetings which

he  from time to time found it difficult to  accede

to.  I do not remember the Member for Hong Lim, who

used to accompany the Chairman of the Party or  me,

being intimidated from speaking. I want to ask  him

this:  were  there  guns at the  meeting  when  the

statement  entitled  "Security  and  the  Communist

Challenge" was discussed, and subsequently read  by

Dr  Toh in this Assembly in October 1959? Sir,  he

is  not scared of the British any more, because  he

knows that the British will no longer lock up noisy

but  harmless  slogan-shouters  like  him.  But  he

knows,  and has had personal experience with  them,

that these Left-wing adventurers are pastmasters in

the  art of smear and intimidation. Let me tell him

this:  today it requires courage, not to  stand  up

and    denounce   the   British   and   colonialist

imperialists in Malaya, but to stand up to the Left-wing  adventurers, just as it required  courage  in

the  old days to denounce the British, because  you

would be denouncing people who have the capacity to

harm you. Why does he not admit that? He hates  the

Communist Left-wing adventurers for what  they  had

done  to him in August 1957, and he wanted  to  fix

them;  but  he  lacked  the  red  blood  corpuscles

necessary for the task. And now, Sir, he  hopes  to

solicit their support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim made a whole series of

fabulous   and   fantastic,   wild   and    untrue,

statements. It is not my business to tire the House

down.  He  says that I forced all of them to  sign - they are all here, Sir. All I can say is that he is

being exposed as an unprincipled, petty plotter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon.

Member  for Hong Lim,, as a Member of the Assembly,

can  be  called  "an unprincipled, petty  plotter".

Perhaps the Prime Minister would like to withdraw

that expression.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, in so far as the

expression refers to him as an hon. Member of  this

Assembly, I withdraw. But in so far as it refers to

an  official of the P.A.P., Sir, I cannot think  of

words more kind and understated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not concerned with the Member for

Hong  Lim as such, because he lacks an organisation

and  he  lacks political principles. One can  never

have  an organisation without political principles.

It is a different kettle of fish with the Left-wing

adventurers,  Sir. Some of them  are  fanatical  in

their   misguided  beliefs,  and  have  a  reckless

disregard not only for their own lives but for  the

lives and property of their fellow countrymen,  and

an  equal  and complete disregard for  hard  facts.

Sir,  they are the people whom we have to  counter,

not the Member for Hong Lim and his two associates.

And  in full knowledge of the extent of their cadre

strength on the ground, we tell them that  we  will

join  issue  with them every time they  take  up  a

stand  that is against the interests of the  people

and against the policy and programme of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the brazen opportunism which the Left-wing

adventurers  attempted over this little  affair  in

the Party has decided us more than anything else to

join  issue with them now and forthwith.  Sir,  the

Left-wing adventurers in the M.C.P. have made  many

mistakes in the past, to their great loss. If  they

misjudge   our   resolution  or  miscalculate   our

strength,  they may yet add another sad episode  to

their  blunders  of the past. The  biggest  mistake

that they are committing in Singapore is to believe

that  they  can use Singapore as a base, a  "Yenan"

from which to liberate the rest of Malaya. Here, in

a  predominantly Chinese State, they are  going  to

shout  anti-colonial slogans to bring the situation

to a boil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the top leaders of the M.C.P. know that the

independence  of  Singapore  can  only  come   with

merger.  The only argument in the P.A.P. analysis,

"The New Phase After Merdeka" published in November

1958,   stands   unrefuted - after  two   years   of

dialectical arguments. We say that the task is  not

to  build up tension and strife, If merger  is  the

road to independence, then the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



foundation  for  merger  and  independence  is, no

longer the simple and straight-forward business  of

fighting  the British. All these attempts to  swing

the  political  line back to the  fluid,  confused,

uncertain position of 1955 can never succeed  until

these  Left-wing adventurers can find the arguments

to counter the logic and the realism upon which our

analysis  is founded. And for two years  they  have

not found the answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is just one point I would like to make

here, because my colleagues have drawn my attention

to  the  fact that, reading just the English  Press

and  the  banner headlines, one gets the impression

that  a serious emergency has already arisen.  With

sensational   banner  headlines,  they   create   a

completely   false  picture  of  what  I   actually

said - the  real  position - and even  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park  believes that Rome is  burning.  Sir,

Rome  is not burning, may I assure him? What I drew

attention to is that the smouldering fires  of  the

old  revolution, which started in  1948  and  which

have  never  been  quite put out,  are  smouldering

again;  and it is not a watering-can that  we  have

standing by, but a fire brigade. What is happening,

Sir, is not an immediately dangerous position,  but

a  position which, if left unchecked, would  create

an  extremely dangerous situation perhaps by  1962,

or maybe even 1963, but certainly by 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to take the point, which was vaguely

insinuated by the Member for Cairnhill,  about  the

appointment  of  these  Political  Secretaries.  He

attempted  to  make out that this  was  a  bit  of

political   opportunism  on   the   part   of   the

P.A.P. - either to silence them or to discredit them.

The  trouble with all these people who  give  these

reasons  is that they always project their  thought

processes. That is what they would have done. More,

the reason why they would have done it. But that is

not the reason, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> What is a good one?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If they will bear with me, I

will tell them. Sir, five persons closely connected

with  the Party leadership, who were in prison  for

2½ years from 1956-9, were released at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



behest of the P.A.P. on 4th June, 1959. They issued

their  political manifesto to the Press.  They  are

Mr  S. Woodhull, Mr Fong Swee Suan, Mr Lim Ching

Siong, Mr Devan Nair, and Mr Chan Chiaw Thor. The

Member  for Hong Lim should bear with me and listen

to  this document with more care, because they gave

2½  years of sober and somewhat enforced reflection

on  the problems of the revolution in Malaya. It is

entitled The Ends and Means of Malayan Socialism" - a

statement  of our stand on the aims and methods  of

the  P.A.P.  by the five signatories.  It  begins,

Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In this article we hope to Set out, clearly and

briefly,  what  we  consider  to  be  the   primary

problems  which confront democratic  socialists  in

Malaya,  the ends we should keep in view,  and  the

means  we  should  adopt in order to  secure  those

ends.  We do this because we consider it essential,

in the interests of the socialist solidarity of the

P.A.P. and the united and efficient implementation

of  the  P.A.P.'s  programme, to establish,  beyond

possibility  of  misinterpretation  or  doubt,  our

considered  stand  on  these  important  issues  of

principle and practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basic Political Standpoint



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, at the outset, affirm our unqualified

endorsement of the P.A.P.'s objective - "The creation

of  an  independent, democratic, non-communist  and

socialist Malaya".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to immediate tasks, particularly in

the  new  phase since the achievement of  political

independence by the Federation of Malaya, -'



<br><br>that  is  the  key,  the turning point,  which  the

Member  for  Hong Lim still does not see.  He  goes

back  to  the  1954  slogans.  The  situation  has

altered  since  then.  This  is  what  these   five

gentlemen,  who spent 2½ years thinking  about  it,

are  saying  and they have a thinking apparatus  of

some  considerable dimension put together (five  of

them) as against the Member for Hong Lim's.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- we endorse the stand taken by the P.A.P. in the

document "The New Phase After Merdeka - Our Tasks and

Policy" published in the 1958 annual souvenir issue

of the Party.'



<br><br>That is basic and fundamental, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The rigid text-book approach to Malayan problems

is not only unrewarding but positively harmful. For

the  problems  that  face  Malayan  socialists  are

unique.   In   most   other  countries,   socialist

programmes rest on an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



already  given historical foundation of an  unitary

national  consciousness  and  solidarity.   Indian,

British or Indonesian socialists, for instance,  do

not have the task of creating an Indian, British or

Indonesian  national  consciousness   as   a   pre-condition   for   the  achievement   of   socialist

societies in their respective countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to struggle not only for socialism, but

for  the nationalist basis of socialism. Thus,  our

most  pressing  initial problem today  is  that  of

nation-building in a multiracial society.'



<br><br>Not slogan-shouting, back to 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The real struggle for socialism in Malaya can

only  begin  when our people, Malays,  Chinese  and

Indians are able to transcend the communal cultural

and  linguistic  barriers and  loyalties  which  at

present  divide them, and embrace a common  Malayan

loyalty    and   cultivate   a   common    national

consciousness.'



<br><br>Sir,  I  propose to table this*  also in this House,

and  I only wish to read two short extracts. It  is

cogent, coherent and completely in accord with  the

aims, objectives and analysis of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Copy placed in the Assembly Library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Once the problem of linguistic and cultural

unity  is  on the way to being resolved, fears  and

suspicions will fade away."'



<br><br>The  five  gentlemen read the Anniversary  Souvenir

and  quoted  it  with  their  approval.  Upon  this

Anniversary  Souvenir, the working  basis  for  any

political  co-operation between  Left-wingers  must

rest. And they stated this, quoting from our P.A.P.

document.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Once the problem of linguistic and cultural

unity  is  on the way to being resolved, fears  and

suspicions will fade away. We must face the  facts.

So   long   as   the  fight  was  against   British

colonialism, the differences between the peoples of

Malaya  were  muted and dulled  in  the  desire  to

achieve  the  common  goal  of  freedom  by  common

effort. Now that this freedom has been won in  the

Federation all the differences come back into their

own.  They  can  and must be resolved.  And  we  in

Singapore can set the way to the solution of  these

important differences in language and culture. That

is  what  we can and must do in this next phase  of

our   struggle   for  freedom,  the  struggle   for

merger."'



<br><br>And they went on to say in their own words, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It was not the might of British arms which

defeated  the armed revolt led by the M.C.P.,  but

the failure of the M.C.P. to establish itself as  a

nationally  based  movement. And  thereby  hangs  a

lesson  which  Malayan socialists  will  ignore  at

their own peril.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



And  I  want  to add here, `Left-wing  adventurers,

please watch out.' And it ends up:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For us, democratic socialism is a dynamic

philosophy of positive social and political  action

directed  towards revolutionary social and economic

goals.'



<br><br>`Genuine democratic socialists'. You see, there  is

this  problem of language which I think the  Member

for  Farrer Park does not quite appreciate, because

he  does  not  spend time listening to what  others

are   saying.  They  call  themselves  "democratic

socialists"  also.  So you have to  specify,  `Yes,

genuine democratic socialists'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Genuine democratic socialists have no time to be

negatively   and   hysterically   anti-anybody   or

anything.'



<br><br>That is a question of emphasis, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They will have their hands full being positively

pro-socialist. But they will oppose-'



<br><br>This is the operative word, Sir, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`they will oppose, positively and on the basis of

principle,  all  those who attempt  to  negate  and

destroy  either the ends or the means of democratic

socialism in Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the achievement of political independence by

the  Federation of Malaya, a new phase  has  begun.

And  the most important task of socialists in  this

new  phase  is  to achieve complete  identification

with  the ideal of a united Malayan nation, and  to

struggle by peaceful, democratic and constitutional

means  for  the  enduring objective of  an  united,

independent,    democratic,    non-communist    and

socialist Malaya.'



<br><br>Sir, this was a declaration of political faith  and

principles,  in complete accord with  the  policies

and  programmes of the P.A.P. which they made  when

they  were  released. On this  political  stand  we

appointed  four  of them as Political  Secretaries,

Needless to say, Sir, if any deviation is made from

this stand, then the working basis is gone. We  are

going  to harbour no one who is not sincerely  with

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them, Mr Devan Nair, has resigned his

position   some  time  in  March  this   year.   My

colleagues and I are sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



that  he  is  completely sincere to  the  aims  and

objectives of the P.A.P. and has not deviated  from

his   stand.  He  had  personal  reasons  for   his

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-mortems are valuable in so far as we can

draw  lessons  from  them  Does  the  former  Chief

Minister now know how he was out-manoeuvred and out-propagandaed by the. C.P. in October 1956? He  held

himself  out  as  the defender  of  the  democratic

system  in  Singapore. In the defence of democracy,

he  had  to purge the Chinese High School  and  the

Chung  Cheng High School. The fatal thing  was  the

interpretation in the minds of the Chinese that  he

was  purging  not a few Communist students  in  the

high  schools  but  was purging  Chinese  culture,

education  and  civilisation, and, of  course,  the

accompanying  working up of popular sentiment  led

by  C.P. activists broke up in riots. When rioting

took  place,  it was not the former Chief  Minister

who  restored  law and order. It  was  the  supreme

authority and the ultimate source of power, namely,

the  British army, which quashed the riots and  re-established  order.  In the minds  of  the  people

during  those  few  days  of  rioting,  the   Chief

Minister, far from being the defender of democracy,

appeared a tool of the British, whose General  took

over  command  of  the Operations Room,  and  whose

troops   were  out  on  every  bridge  and   every

important, intersection in town. Hence he lost  out

in  the hearts and minds of the Chinese population.

He  lost out in the propaganda battle. He went  in

hoping  to  pick  the leaders. The leaders  wrapped

themselves  up  in  Chinese culture,  language  and

education, and he lost them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Farrer Park is dead right. We

are  the source of power now - the open authority - and

therefore  the challenge, if made, would apparently

at first be made against us. But ultimately it is a

challenge against the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



supreme   authority  here - the  British  army.   The

question  which the Left-wing adventurers  have  to

face, if such a similar situation were to arise, is

this:  how  to  find a reason for saying  that  the

present  Government  are  stooges?  They  found   a

multitude of reasons to say why the last Government

were  stooges, and some of them unfortunately  were

true.  The  former Minister for Education  let  his

side  down,  and all kinds of other foolish  things

were  done.  These  things stuck.  But  this  is  a

different  proposition  for  them  to  deal   with.

Nobody - even the Member for Hong Lim - even  in  a  mo

ment  of  madness,  can accuse this  Government  of

being  corrupt.  That  is  basic  and  fundamental,

because  once  that forte is gone, then  you  drift

with the winds. Sir, I do not want to be immodest.

But  as a statement of fact, the $3,050 that I  get

for  my  duties - I think the Member for Farrer  Park

will  bear  me  out - is what I could  earn,  as  any

reasonably proficient lawyer could earn, in a  long

working  week-end in the Federation or  in  Borneo,

and  not  altogether an unpleasant working  weekend

either. Therefore, they must find a motive for  our

being stooges. I will tell them why they will  fail

if  they cannot find this motive. Because  if  you

embark  on a smear, you can create what the  C.I.D.

call  a  "miasma of dubiety", such as befogged  the

Member for Farrer Park. He was not quite sure which

side was telling the truth, he said. But if at  the

end  of  it  all you have not got one  salient  and

cogent  fact upon which you can rest and say  that,

that  is  the  truth, then the whole smear  floats

down-stream and is washed up. I say to them that at

the  end  of it, in this battle which, if they  are

foolhardy enough to start before they are  prepared

for  it,  I am pretty sure they will find  what  we

shall  prove to the people, that we are stooges  of

our  own convictions, our belief that the salvation

of  our people and Malaya depends upon the creation

of a united people, based on one common language



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



and  one  common  loyalty,  despite  its  divergent

races,  and on the creation of a socialist society.

I  am not afraid to stand here or anywhere else  to

say  that  this is what my colleagues and  I  stand

for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill alleged yesterday

that  the P.A.P. is playing a double game, one game

with  the British and one game with the Communists.

The  Member for Tanglin said that the PAP,  intends

to  do  something dishonourable, for we  have  said

that  if  there  is a collision between  these  two

opposing  forces, then the P.A.P. would  duck.  The

Member  for  Cairnhill,  in  one  of  his  brighter

moments  of  punning and clowning, said  that  when

these two forces clash, the P.A.P. might well  turn

into   a   dead   duck.  Speaking   from   personal

experience,  I  give him full marks for  confirming

that  that  was what happened when  the  collision

took place and he was in between. Sir, he never saw

the  inter-play of the different contending  forces

fighting  for  supremacy, and he died  politically,

not  in May 1959, when the election took place, but

in October 1956, when the stooge image was built up

in  the minds of the people. He saw himself on  one

side  of  the ring - this was his exposition - fighting

for   democracy,  and  on  the  other   side,   the

Communists   fighting   for   totalitarianism   and

Communism. And he still believes that that  is  the

correct analysis, and that we, now that we are  the

Government, do our duty in that corner of the  ring

which  is fighting for democracy. Sir, he does  not

understand  that  there are three  main  contending

forces  in a three-cornered fight. There are  three

boxers  in  the ring. We are neither  fighting  the

Communists alone nor the British alone. That is the

point. The Member for Tanglin will remember that  I

quoted  him something from 1957, that there  was  a

three-cornered  fight, and how one corner  got  the

two  other corners to weaken and then he triumphed.

But  not  to be in between, or he would  have  been

squashed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put this question to the Member for Cairnhill,

and  if  he  looks  back over the  years,  he  will

confirm  that  this is true. He will remember  that

the  Tunku, when he fought the Communists, took  an

anti-Communist line only after he was sure that  he

was  given  Merdeka. Once Merdeka was obtained  and

the British forces were out of the: political ring,

then  it became a straight fight between the Tunku,

on  behalf  of those who want a democratic  system,

and  the  M.C.P., on behalf of the Communists.  The

point   is  that  this  is  not  the  position   in

Singapore. We are not an independent State and  are

not likely to be one until we get merger. And there

are  still three forces contending in the political

arena.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was intrigued by the Member for Cairnhill's

reference  to  the  role of the  Internal  Security

Council.  After quoting the relevant provisions  of

the   Report   of   the  Constitution   Commission,

paragraph 32, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Internal Security Council is there to be a

referee  in a game between the Communists  and  the

Singapore  Government, and that they (the  referee)

would only exert their authority in two situations.

First,  if  either the Government turns out  to  be

weak and vacillating, or, second, if it refuses  to

discharge  its  responsibilities  and  protect  the

interest of the people and is a bad Government.'



<br><br>Sir,  I  do not know who thought out this political

profundity   for   him.  But  he  is   propounding,

wittingly   or  unwittingly,  a  false   piece   of

political  analysis.  If he wants  to  compare  the

I.S.C. to a referee, may I say that it is more  the

kind  of  referee  one  finds in  all-in  wrestling

matches  where,  far  from  being  just  a  referee

between  two  contestants, very often  the  referee

goes  and  wallops one contender to the  floor  and

beats  him  up? Let us never forget this.  Ultimate

power  rests  not  on  section  65  or  66  of  the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



but  in the reality of the forces whose  will

can   prevail.  Any  challenge  made  to   ultimate

authority  will  be  made, in  fact,  not  to  the

Singapore  Government,  whose  force  is  not   the

supreme  one  in  Singapore,  but  to  the  British

Government, whose dictum is final. Therefore, to go

and stand in front of the British armed forces when

a collision is going to take place between them and

the  forces of violent revolution on the other side

is,  in my submission, political foolhardiness. But

let  me  add  that  that is not  to  say  that  the

Singapore Government intends to abdicate and abjure

authority under the Constitution. Within the limits

of  our jurisdiction, we accept our responsibility;

and  within  the constitutional framework  where  a

challenge  is  made  to our authority,  it  is  the

business  and  the intention of the  Government  to

assert  its  authority. But it is idle  to  believe

that  there  may  not  again  be  a  challenge  by

unconstitutional and violent methods to overawe and

overthrow  authority.  The  only  answer  to  these

methods  of  violent revolution is  force.  In  the

three-cornered  fight  which  still  continues   in

Singapore,  it  is the business of a  non-Communist

socialist  Government  to  make  use  of  the  time

between now and ultimate merger and independence in

consolidating    the    democratic    system,    in

consolidating   the  strength  of  the   democratic

forces, and to see that we are not used as somebody

else's pawns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just mention that my

friend  and colleague, the Minister for Labour  and

Law,  has taken a great deal of care to investigate

the  various  allegations made by  the  Member  for

Farrer Park. They are found not to be so simple  as

he  made them out to be, but I think we could issue

this as a statement at a subsequent date.
