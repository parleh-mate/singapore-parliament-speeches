  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>: To ask the Minister for Health (a) how many medical officers resigned from the Civil Service in 1977; (b) how many medical officers were attached to the various hospitals as at 30th November, 1977, and whether the number of medical officers in each hospital was sufficient to cope with the workload; and (c) what are the average working hours per week and the number of off days per month for medical officers and housemen, and, if it is not possible for them to work within the required working hours and take their off days weekly, whether he will consider making an alternative arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy.

  <b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Question No. 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have distributed to Members of the House figures (Cols. 299 - 300) to Question 1(a) and 1(b). I will therefore not repeat them here.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1978/19780131/19780131-HA-0370299.htm">figures - APPENDIX TO ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1(Cols. 203-205)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to Question 1(c), I would like to explain that the hours of work of doctors vary according to the posting. Normally doctors who are working in Outpatient Departments, for example, work office hours and they have a normal week of 42 hours. Those in the hospitals, besides their normal week of 42 hours, are required to perform night duties. If they have a night duty once a week, it will add 15 1/2 hours to the normal 42 hours quota, and if they do have two night-duty performances in a week, it will work out to about 72 hours in a normal week. In the Accidents and Emergency Department the doctors work on shifts and, therefore, they have a 42-hour week but they are given time off for night duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is a very vexing one because night duties are not necessarily applicable to all doctors working in hospitals. In our system we find that housemen and medical officers are asked to perform night duties. This means that they must be within the hospital precincts. Senior doctors, however, are on call which means that they can go home, attend to their family life or attend to their social life, but they have a bleeper and, if necessary, they can be called to the hospital. Sir, I am in sympathy with those who have to perform as many as two night duties in a week, especially those who are in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. As Members of the House are aware, babies do not tell doctors what time they are supposed to come out into the world. We therefore find that most doctors posted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, including the Registrars and Senior Registrars, have a higher mean rate of weekly hours. They range from 68 hours for Registrars and Senior Registrars, 55 hours for Consultants, 78 and 79 hours for medical officers and housemen respectively. The problem, of course, really depends upon manpower. If there are more doctors available who can be rostered for night duty, then the number of hours per week worked by each doctor can be reduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must point out the distinction between hours of work and productivity. During the night, patients do not require much attention as most of them have been treated and attended to during the day. So during the night it is necessary to have only a small number of doctors for emergency calls. That is why they are asked to be within the hospital precincts. In the case of housemen, it has been a tradition that to be on night duty is part of their training. While we can permutate the roster, I am afraid that as of this moment it is not possible to reduce the number of night duties which are already allocated because of the existing staff position. If doctors are unable to perform night duty on a particular day, arrangements can be made for them to have substitutes. I think that is not a problem at all. However, I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> do hope to make an in-depth study into this problem, and I do admit that it is an unsatisfactory position.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Zealand medical doctors of all grades are on call and this means that they must be within the precincts of the hospital. It is only the Consultants who are allowed to stay away from the hospital. That would be an excellent pattern for us to follow. So we will have to take some time to work out a re-arrangement of the night duty roster, and if we can have more manpower pitching in, I think the burden will be less both for the medical officers and housemen.

   <b>(Development since hijacking incident)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether there has been any further development in our relations with the Vietnamese Government since the hijacking incident in October 1977.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, relations between Singapore and Vietnam had developed normally, prior to the hijacking incident in October 1977. As Members will recollect, the Vietnamese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Phan Hien, came to Singapore in July 1976. A delegation from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce visited Vietnam in April 1977, and this was followed by an economic delegation organised by INTRACO in August. So things were developing smoothly until the hijacking incident which created differences between Singapore and Vietnam.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we have our respective views on the question of jurisdiction over the hijackers. We, that is, Singapore, still hold to our views and I presume the Vietnamese to theirs. The hijackers have been tried and sentenced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, I think relations between Singapore and Vietnam are normal. Direct telephone and telex services between Singapore and Ho Chi Minh City, broken off
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> since April 1975, were resumed on 1st December, 1977. The office of the Import and Export Corporation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in Singapore has continued with its routine activities. Our diplomatic representatives in Third World countries maintain regular contact with each other. I expect relations between the two countries to develop along constructive lines in the coming months.

Member that permanent residents should have no difficulty in obtaining work permits, as it has been the policy to issue work permits to these persons most liberally. The work permits issued are for two years. The present procedure of applying for work permits is simple and is not troublesome for an employer as it only involves the employer at the initial stage of the application by having to complete one part of the application form. The application is processed promptly by the Work Permit Department and the employer, together with the applicant, will normally be informed of the outcome of the application within a week from the date of receipt of the application.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work permits for permanent residents are granted easily. The system gives the Government useful data on the work characteristics of non-citizen workers, including permanent residents. It is useful to continue with the present practice.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Work Permit Scheme for foreign workers is designed to meet our manpower requirements in our effort to sustain continued economic development. Under the policy, applications for work permits from technicians and skilled workers are invariably approved. For those who have acceptable training qualifications or have been certified as skilled by the Industrial Training Board, they will be issued with a 3-year work permit. These 3-year work permit holders will be eligible for permanent residence if they have completed at least two years of employment in Singapore. They may eventually be granted citizenship after satisfying the 10-year residential qualification.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for work permits from unskilled or semi-skilled workers will also be given if they are for jobs which will further the economic development of the Republic. Thus, applications for jobs in manufacturing factories, shipbuilding and repairing and construction industries will be favourably considered. Our work permit policy must be based more on our industrial and manpower needs than on considerations of family ties of the applicant.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at 9.34 a.m. on 17th January, 1978, a 120 megawatt generator at the Jurong Power Station developed vibration at one of its bearings, and its protective relays tripped it off the system. The resulting system instability caused another 120 megawatt generator, also at the Jurong Power Station, to trip out. The disconnection of these two generating units from the system activated the operation of system automatic under-frequency relays, cutting off power to Toa Payoh, Aljunied, Kallang Basin and Siglap areas. By 10.30 a.m. power had been restored to 50% of the affected areas, and by 11.34 a.m. the situation had returned to normal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of Members, under frequency relays are protective devices installed in the system to automatically disconnect loads in pre-selected steps when there is a certain loss of generating capacity

  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications (a) why so many roads have deteriorated during the recent heavy rains and what are the causes of the deterioration; (b) whether he is satisfied that road surfacing is carried out with proper technique and under adequate supervision; (c) how much money has been spent on the recent road repairs: and (d) whether and what steps he intends to take to minimise damage to the roads during heavy rains in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, damage to road pavements occur mainly in bus lanes, bus stops, intersections and tight bends. Observations indicate that oil spillage over a period softens and dissolves the asphalt in road pavements resulting in loss of its
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> binding quality. With heavy rainfall, water easily penetrates the asphalt film surrounding the stone aggregate, stripping them from the road pavement thus aggravating the damage. In tight bends, the pavement surfaces are highly stressed by turning vehicles and tend to deteriorate faster than straight road sections. In all instances, heavy vehicles and high traffic volumes tend to hasten the deterioration of road pavements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department exercises rigid quality control over the materials used for road surfacing and also undertakes strict supervision of the laying of the premixed asphalt concrete. Samples of materials used at every site are taken and sent to the PWD's engineering laboratory for testing. Sub-standard materials are rejected. Financial penalties are imposed for minor departures from the qualities specified. During road resurfacing works, PWD officers maintain standing supervision to ensure that compaction is adequate and the hot mix asphalt concrete has cooled down sufficiently before the road is opened to traffic. Premature opening to traffic will result in some loosening of the surface materials and subsequent deterioration of the road surface.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period April to October 1977, the average monthly expenditure on road patching was approximately $85,000. For November 1977, this rose to $113,000 and could be attributed to the heavy rainfall at that time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976, the PWD reviewed the existing asphalt concrete mix design used and experimented with various mix designs with the aim of improving on the asphalt concrete mix that will be used for future road surfacing. Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, an improved mix has been in use. A stiffer grade of bitumen has also been specified. The PWD is in correspondence with various research and highway authorities in other countries, obtaining useful information on how the problem can be solved. The Department has, in addition, initiated systematic scientific studies to determine precisely the factors affecting road surface deterioration.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the work of our cultural, recreational, religious and other charitable bodies is important to HDB and non-HDB residents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In HDB estates, sites and premises are provided for such bodies to promote their activities. For example, sites are reserved for religious bodies to build their churches, mosques and temples and premises are offered at concessional rentals to associations affected by development programmes in the central area or elsewhere, to enable them to continue their work. Premises at concessional rentals are also offered to organisations of social value which are interested in extending their activities in HDB estates.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, it is obvious that criteria must be exercised in the selection of these registered organisations. Since the number of premises is limited in any
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> housing estates, consideration for priority will be based on the need or the urgency of resettlement cases, or on the requirements in terms of greater and better usage to a particular housing estate. I am in no position to give the Hon. Member the different criteria exercised. But each case goes before the Allocations Committee and finally it has to get the approval of the HDB.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, in my question, I have also asked what criteria will be used to ensure orderly integration. I have received requests from a number of organisations, in particular, constituencies like Kampong Kembangan and Kampong Ubi, and they have been there for more than 20 years. But perhaps because of lack of clearcut policies, these organisations have not been told very clearly whether or not they will be given sites in HDB estates; if so, when will they be given and what will be the terms. I needed clarification on the criteria because should the representatives of these organisations see me again I would be in a better position to explain to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already indicated that there are criteria but each case must be assessed on its own merits. Let me give Members a specific example. I have mentioned the availability of sites for religious organisations. That must be an indication to Members that there are difficulties in allocating sites for priority cases. If a site is available for religious bodies, then a non-resettlement case could tender for the site. The same system is also applicable to other social or cultural organisations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to exactly when a particular case could be resettled or to be considered for priority consideration, the details must be made known to the relevant authority. While it is easy to suggest that there must be clearcut criteria, in pragmatic terms it is difficult to exercise clearcut criteria. What we have is a general overall policy with certain general criteria for consideration. Each particular case is assessed according to its own merit and it goes before the Allocations

  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications if it is proposed to widen Lorong Chuan particularly from Braddell Road/Lorong Chuan junction to Lorong Kinchir in order to relieve the congestion along that stretch of road.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, peak hour congestion along Lorong Chuan, particularly the stretch between Avenue 1, Ang Mo Kio, and Braddell Road is caused primarily by traffic from Ang Mo Kio New Town and the many private housing estates off Lorong Chuan and Yio Chu Kang Road. This will be alleviated soon by: -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the extension of Avenue 1, Ang Mo Kio, from Lorong Chuan to Boundary Road and construction of a new link road from Upper Paya Lebar Road to Plantation Avenue. These two roads would provide an alternative more direct route for traffic from Yio Chu Kang Road and Ang Mo Kio New Town to Upper Paya Lebar Road. City-bound traffic can therefore be expected to be partly diverted to these new roads. The projects are expected to be completed by December 1979;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The construction of the North-South Arterial Road between Thomson Road and Avenue 1, Ang Mo Kio, currently is scheduled to be completed by October 1979. When completed, an alternative high capacity road will be available linking Ang Mo Kio New Town with Thomson Road. Some of the traffic from Ang Mo Kio now using Lorong Chuan can be expected to divert to this new road.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, there are no proposals to widen Lorong Chuan.

  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I have given the reasons for rejecting requests for change of use. While we appreciate the economic contributions from a particular sector, consideration is normally given. For example, extension of time is allowed for a person to move out of the premises for its illegal use. From the reasons for rejection that I have given earlier it is difficult or impossible to compromise. The only "flexibility" that we can give is to grant reasonably sufficient time for a particular case to be resettled.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications if he will ascertain from the Housing and Development Board the reason why proprietors of provision shops in HDB estates have been required to stop selling intoxicating liquors on their premises or face the prospect of rent increase, although they are licensed to sell intoxicating liquors by the Liquors Licensing Board.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, the rentals of HDB shops depend on the type of trades which are specified in the tender applications and in the tenancy agreements. Any shopkeeper who wishes to carry out an additional trade, for instance, sale of intoxicating liquor, must
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> therefore obtain the Board's permission and, if approved, the rental will be subject to review.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Sir, why does the Senior Minister of State not raise any objection when the shopkeeper notifies in the newspapers that intoxicating drinks will be sold on the premises? Why does the Senior Minister of State allow emporiums and supermarkets to sell articles ranging from a drawing pin to an aeroplane, but does not allow a provision shop to sell intoxicating drinks although it is licensed by the Liquors Licensing Board to sell intoxicating drinks?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the answer is a fairly simple one. When a shopkeeper tenders for a particular shop premises, he has to make it known in that tender the particular trade he deals in. In a particular block of shops therefore, there are tenders for various trades. The tenderer must indicate what he wants to tender a particular shop for, such as a clinic. Therefore, he tenders a certain price for it. Compared to the tender for another shop, for example, a coffee shop, perhaps the tender price could be different. Therefore, in this case, the tenderer must indicate at the time of tendering that he wants to sell intoxicating liquor, but not as an afterthought. Because if it is an afterthought, it could jeopardise the business of other shops in the same block. So the mistake here is not with the authority but with the tenderer. We are saying that if he wants to add in another trade, it is subject to a review. Whether or not he pays more for it, is a matter for consideration by the Board.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, it is not. We have in one instance granted an additional trade to a particular tenant without any increase in rental.

   <b>RENT OF POSTWAR HOUSES</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications if he will consider the need to introduce legislation with a view to checking excessive increases of rent by owners of postwar houses, especially those houses built immediately after September, 1947, as there have been instances of rent increases of as much as 200 per cent and tenants have no recourse but to accept the rent increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, at present, rentals imposed on tenants of pre-war houses built before September 1947 are regulated under the Control of Rent Act. Rentals pertaining to postwar houses built after that date are not controlled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rental of houses depends on supply and demand. With the large number of housing units completed and under-construction by HDB, there is no problem of housing shortage in Singapore. In fact, at the present moment there is a glut of private housing. The Government, therefore, do not intend to introduce measures to control rental of postwar houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> If that is the case, Sir, why does the Senior Minister of State not lift the control of rent on the pre-war houses?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, my only reply is that pre-war houses and post-war houses are placed in different situations. However, the lifting of control of rent will be considered when the time is right and if the situation warrants it. This is to prevent any hardship that may be caused. For example, if we were to lift the control of these rent-controlled houses, land owners might want to develop their land and there could be thousands of cases requiring immediate housing.

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font>

  <br>

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I do not agree with the explanation given by the Senior Minister of State. On the one hand, he says that there is a glut of housing, and on the other he says that there will be hardship caused if the rent control regulation is lifted for the prewar houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, we are talking of a glut in private housing now. If a private developer is prepared to resettle all those tenants he intends to move out into his own new private housing estate, then there will be no problem. But in the present circumstances we are assuming that when the developer gives notice to the tenants or sub-tenants to move out, he expects them to find alternative accommodation in the HDB. So there is no contradiction in my explanation.

  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, can it be due to inflation?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of State has said that the rental of uncontrolled houses depends on supply and demand. One can expect that over the last 30 years most, if not all, landlords would have probably raised the rent of their houses. So the difference here is that those who occupy uncontrolled houses are paying quite a high rent. Those occupying controlled houses are paying a very low rent. Therefore, if we were to lift rent control, thousands of people occupying rent controlled houses would have to pay a very much higher rent. That is the reason why we are retaining rent control on houses built before 1947.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I still do not agree with the Minister. The Minister said that pre-war houses are subject to rent control. Since the rent is low, the Minister should allow the developer to increase the rent a little. For the post-war houses which are not subject to rent control, he is saying that the developer could increase the rent as much as he likes. So how does the Minister reconcile his statements?

  <br> the Kranji/Pandan water catchment areas to Punggol/Jalan Kayu, a non-water catchment area zoned for agriculture. The Senior Minister of State for National Development informed the House in May 1977 that farms which can be managed efficiently with modern husbandry practices and improved sanitation are being resettled in the Punggol/Jalan Kayu area.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These farmers are required to provide proper waste treatment facilities like cesspits and slatted floors for their pig pens. If the cesspits are maintained and desludged regularly, there should be no public nuisance or health nuisance from the overflowing of pig waste. Unfortunately, Sir, this has not been done by most of the farmers, probably to reduce the cost of their operations. It may be necessary to require these farmers to desludge their cesspits regularly, perhaps at least once a month. Otherwise the Ministry of the Environment will have to do the desludging and charge the cost to the farmers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is also implementing a drainage improvement scheme in the area to cater for the proper drainage of the farmlands. The widening and deepening of Sungei Tongkang Pechah is in progress at an estimated cost of $1 million. The improvements of the other earth drains, including drains serving the farmlands, will be carried out as soon as funds are approved.

  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> A supplementary question, Sir. In order that the size of the problem can be better appreciated by the House, can the Hon. Minister please indicate the number of farms, pigs and cesspits involved?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there are approximately 280 pig farms, 170,000 pigs and about 280 cesspits. The Member may be interested to know that it will cost $1/2 million to desludge the cesspits once a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, in May 1977 when the Senior Minister of State for National Development informed the House of the development of pig farms, I believe he did indicate that there would be provision of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> buffer zones in order to reduce pollution. Would the Hon. Minister please inform the House what steps have been taken to develop such buffer zones?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, frankly, I do not know. But like Kublai Khan, who believed that those who plant trees live long, I am sure the Minister of State for National Development will do his best to provide and plant trees in the buffer zone between the housing estate and the pig farms.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I think it is a case of buck-passing. Would the two Ministers please get together quickly?

  <!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34.
  <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology what measures are being taken to prevent further occurrences of contaminated food being sold in supermarkets and what action is being taken to make the public aware of such dangers to their health so that they can become more discerning when they shop.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of the Environment carries out regular checks of supermarkets, restaurants, eating establishments and food centres for compliance with environmental health requirements. Samples of products are taken for analysis and compliance with the Sale of Food Act. Inspections are also carried out to ensure hygienic handling of food products and good personal hygiene of the food handlers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where samples of food are found to be contaminated or the food products are not hygienically handled, enforcement action is taken. Convictions in court for non-compliance of health requirements are given due publicity in the mass media and reported in the press.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also carries out health education programmes including campaigns to educate the public and food handlers on food hygiene and proper handling of food.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, does the Senior Parliamentary Secretary agree that only when contaminated food is sold to consumers, court action, heavy fines and adverse publicity should follow? And does he also agree that when the health and safety of consumers are not affected, the first course of action should only be a warning? If so, why then was a supermarket prosecuted for only a technical offence when it had on its shelf a jar of cream with 12.1% fat instead of at least 25%? Are not many Singaporeans already obese? Most certainly. Despite the Singapore Sports Council's sports-for-all policy, Walkarun and so on, this obesity continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in dealing with cases of food contamination, we do not consider whether the company involved is a big one or a small one. It is a question of whether or not the food is contaminated. The samples of food that we have collected are analysed and if found to be contaminated, they will be dealt with according to the law.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>3.36 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill contains a few amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act, which have been found to be necessary. The first amendment (clause 4) empowers the Registration Officer to remove from any register the names of electors whose addresses as shown in the register have ceased to exist or to be used as a place of residence, and to transfer such names to the appropriate registers, provided that the changes of addresses have been notified to the Commissioner of National Registration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present such removal and/or transfer of names can only be done if there is a general revision of the registers of electors; the amendment will enable this to be done
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> without having to wait for such a general revision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of urban renewal and redevelopment, many electors have vacated their residences and resettled elsewhere. It is considered that these electors should not be entitled to vote in the constituency in which they have clearly ceased to reside. They should vote in the constituency in which they are currently residing. Provision is made for the Registration Officer to give appropriate notice in the Gazette and to make available for public inspection a list of the names of the persons so affected, at least two weeks before making any removal or transfer of names. If at the time a person's name is removed from a register of electors he has not yet notified the Commissioner of National Registration of his change of address, he can still subsequently apply to have his name entered in the appropriate register so that he will not be prejudiced by the removal of his name. However, on practical considerations, where a writ of election has been issued for an election in an electoral division, no entry will be made in the register of electors of that division until after nomination day or, if a poll is to be taken, until after polling day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment (clause 6) is designed to enable persons who have failed to vote at any election and whose names have been expunged from the registers of electors to have their names restored without having to wait until the next ensuing revision of the registers. The present provision is unsatisfactory in that it requires such persons to wait until the ensuing revision of the registers before their names can be restored, even though they may have furnished the Registration Officer with a good excuse or have paid the penalty of $5.00 for the restoration of their names. This amendment provides that such persons will have their names restored the day after the payment of the penalty of $5.00 or the day after the Registration Officer has satisfied himself of any good excuse which has been furnished. Again for practical considerations, it is provided that where a writ of election has been issued for an election in an electoral division, no name is to be restored to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> register of that division until after nomination day or, if a poll is to be taken, until after polling day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment (clause 7) seeks to prohibit, inter alia, non-citizens and undischarged bankrupts from taking part in any election activity. It is not in the public interest that such persons should play an active part in election campaigns.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding, I would like to inform hon. Members that it has been decided to increase the deposit required to be made by a candidate for election under section 28 of the Act from the present sum of $1,200 to $1,500. The Act (section 28(6)) provides that the Minister may vary the amount of the deposit provided that it does not exceed 10% of the total allowances paid to a Member of Parliament in each year. With the consolidation of the NWC awards into basic salaries, the monthly allowance of an MP is now $1,340. The yearly allowance is therefore $16,080 (not including the 13th month's allowance). Ton per cent of the yearly allowance is $1,608, a sum larger than the proposed deposit of $1,500. The increase will be implemented in due course by a notification in the Gazette in accordance with subsection (6).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the clause be read a Second time".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the existing provisions of section 28(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act (Chapter 50), candidates for elections are required to make their deposits in legal tender as defined under section 14(1) of the Currency Act (Chapter 64), that is to say, in cash. It is now proposed to allow the Returning Officer to accept deposits made other than in legal tender. The proposed amendment will enable such candidates to make their deposits by a bank draft order or a certified cheque apart from cash. "Certified cheque" is defined under this new clause to mean a cheque which is certified by the drawee bank as good for payment of the sum stated in the cheque.

  <b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment proposed in this Bill provide greater flexibility in appointing public officers to the Public Utilities Board; facilitate proceedings of the Board; and incorporate model provisions dealing with the appointment of auditors; keeping of financial records; submission of reports on the Board's accounts and powers and duties of the Board's auditors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, subsection (1) of section 5 of the Public Utilities Act provides for the appointment of only one public officer to the Board. For better administration and guidance, it may be necessary to appoint more than one public officer to the Board. In clause 2 of the Bill, it is proposed to amend subsection (1) of section 5 of the Act to provide for the appointment of more than one public officer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing requirement in subsection (1) of section 10 of the Act is for a majority of the members to form a quorum at meetings of the Board. This has posed practical difficulties when some members are away or unable to attend meetings for urgent reasons. In such circumstances, proceedings of the Board have been delayed. Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend subsection (1) of section 10
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of the Act by reducing the quorum from a majority to three members of the Board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to incorporate in the Act certain model provisions which the Auditor-General has recommended for adoption by all statutory boards in their legislation. These provisions are contained in clauses 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Housing and Development Act, the Board's officers can only act for a person buying a flat direct from the Board. In all other transactions including resales, the parties engage their own solicitors who will charge them for work done in accordance with the Solicitors' Remuneration Order, 1974.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to enable the Board to act for parties in resales and in other transactions. To date, the Board has sold 137,093 flats under the "Home Ownership For The People Scheme". As more flats are being sold by the Board, the number of resale cases and all other transactions has increased accordingly and the number of transfer instruments registered increased from 678 in 1974 to 1,606 in 1976. If the Board is permitted to handle resale cases and all other transactions, it will help a large number of flat owners to minimise legal costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to sections 42 and 49 of the Housing and Development Act will empower -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Board by authorised officers to act for the parties in resales and in all other transactions in respect of the flats where these parties do not engage solicitors; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Minister to make regulations prescribing fees payable to the Board for legal services rendered in such transactions.

  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs and Education, at the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill, informed the House how serious the problem of drug abuse and addiction had become. As compared with the few cases of heroin addiction in 1971, we now have as many as 12,000 heroin addicts and abusers. The Act, which was enacted to deal with this pernicious problem, provides for the necessary powers of arrest and detention of these drug addicts and abusers for treatment and rehabilitation in approved institutions, subject to certain safeguards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A constitutional problem, however, arises in regard to the Act, vis-a-vis Article 5 of the Constitution of Malaysia in its application to Singapore. Article 5 lays down the constitutional requirement that a person, who is arrested and detained, should be informed of the grounds of his arrest, should be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner, and should be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest. Whilst the importance of this fundamental right is recognised, it, like any other fundamental right, cannot be absolute and may have to be qualified in the interest of public order, safety or security. A departure from the normal constitutional requirements is necessary to deal effectively with the grave drug problem. The Bill before this House ensures the constitutional validity of the Misuse of Drugs Act, in so far as that Act authorises the detention of drug addicts and abusers in approved institutions for treatment and rehabilitation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, which authorises the arrest and detention of any person in the interest of public safety, peace and good order, was enacted in the year 1955. When Singapore
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> became a state within the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the fundamental liberties clauses (including Article 5) of the Malaysian Constitution became applicable to us. These clauses were retained in our Constitution when we separated from Malaysia in August 1965. It may be arguable that Part V of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act infringes Article 5 of the Constitution. The Bill before this House will ensure the constitutional validity of Part V.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the circumstances, which I have related, it is necessary to make this Bill both prospective and retrospective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>3.58 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the constitutional provision that no person shall be deprived of his personal liberty except in accordance with the due process of law as laid down in Article 5 of our Constitution is a provision that is basic to the system of government and way of life that we have adopted. But, as with other liberties, it must be conceded that it is not absolute. It is an ideal that we should not however deviate from without most careful deliberation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would all agree that there are some problems in our society that cannot be dealt with in strict accordance with the principle that no person should be detained without an open trial. In fact, to insist on strict adherence to the principle in such cases will only serve to undermine and destroy the very fabric of our society. One such case is that relating to secret societies and their activities. The ruthlessness of those engaged in such activities and the nature of these organisations ensure that nobody will testify publicly in such cases. To insist that the process laid down in Article 5 of the Constitution be followed will only serve to protect such criminal activities and make a mockery of the process of law and justice. As long as we have secret societies, it is necessary to have the provisions of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act in operation and it is proper that the Constitution be amended as proposed in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> new clause 6(a) to make the validity of such laws beyond doubt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6(b), however, deals with quite another matter and the reason as far as I can make out for this amendment is very different. The motive appears to me to be one of administrative expedience. In the case of misuse of drugs it has not been claimed, as far as I can remember, that it is difficult to obtain evidence. There are established medical tests which can provide the evidence. But the drug problem has grown at such an alarming rate that I understand the administrative machinery in terms of courts, magistrates and prosecuting officers cannot cope with the number of arrests being made. Since the problem is acute and cannot wait for the administrative resources to be strengthened before the problem is tackled, an interim solution is necessary. Thus, reluctantly we have to deviate from the fundamental liberty principle laid down in the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume, though I cannot be certain, that other solutions were explored before it was concluded that arrest and detention without trial is the only feasible immediate method of dealing with the problem. This method of dealing with the problem must however be conceded to be a temporary one. It will be difficult to maintain that given some time, the administrative machinery cannot be strengthened to deal with arrested drug abusers in the normal way. Would the Minister, therefore, be prepared to consider an amendment to provide that any law relating to the misuse of drugs which authorises the arrest and detention of a person without trial for the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation will have a definite life of, say, three years? Such an amendment would ensure that steps are taken within the period to enable the problem to be dealt with under the process laid down in the present Article 5 of the Constitution. It may even turn out, happily, that the number of drug addicts may be so reduced at the end of the period that they can be easily dealt with by the courts. In any case, at the end of the life of the Act, if circumstances require an extension, a Bill can be presented to Parlia-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ment to extend the Act and, at such an occasion, Parliament will have the benefit of considering the details of action taken and progress achieved to find a permanent solution and the reasons for the extension.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, if an amendment is not possible, I shall be grateful if the Minister will give an assurance that this particular aspect of the law to deal with drug misuse will be reviewed periodically and that action will be taken as soon as possible to revert to the system of dealing with drug abusers through the courts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear that if there be no limitation to the period of operation of such laws or if there be no undertaking to review such laws, there will be no incentive to strengthen the administrative machinery to deal with the problem. I fear further that if it is not made clear that short cuts to legal processes are only to be used as a last resort and that too with severe limitations, there will be great temptation to use short cuts where process of law or fair play or justice is expensive in terms of time, manpower and other resources. The administration, once it has found a cheap and easy way of doing things, seldom abandons it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I remember when taking our seats as Members of Parliament, among other undertakings, we swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. It is therefore disturbing to note that the House is being asked to approve an amendment to the Constitution because of an apparently ultra vires act on the part of the Hon. Minister for Home Affairs and Education when he last moved the amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act in this House on the 9th November, 1977. What we are now asked to do may be likened to closing the stable gate after the horse has bolted. A rather more serious implication, Sir, to my mind, is that, as law makers, we would appear to have shown no respect for the law and in this particular case, the most sacred of all, our Constitution. Whatever the justification, the action on the part of the Hon. Minister is inexcusable. I do hope that
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> this is the first and last time that such a thoughtless act is allowed to be committed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Hon. Minister for Law, I would like his assurance that all future Bills, prior to submitting to Parliament, will be thoroughly vetted to ensure that they are not inconsistent with or in contravention of any existing provisions under either the Constitution or any other statutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr E.W. Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Kallang has made many good points in his speech, but the better part of his speech should have been made last year when he spoke on the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill. But let me assure both hon. Members that other solutions were carefully explored before it was concluded that arrest and detention without trial was the only practical method of dealing with the drug problem. My colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, has explained in detail the reasons for the act. Sir, the spread of drug abuse was somewhat like the spread of an infectious disease like cholera, of which I am in charge, and had to be dealt with expediently and drastically. We could not wait. To take thousands of drug abusers to court would have meant delays. If the accused claimed trial and was granted bail, as is the usual practice, he would continue to take drugs and make himself even more addictive, Sir, it is not just a question of not enough courts or magistrates or administrators. We can set up special courts purely to deal with the drug abusers, as we have with the two traffic courts dealing with traffic offenders. But that is not the solution. Hence it was felt that drug abusers should be detained for rehabilitation without trial even before the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill became law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang has asked me to consider an amendment to provide that any law which authorises the arrest and detention of drug addicts without trial should have a definite life of, say, three years. I hope he is not suggesting that the present amendment to the Constitution which I am moving should be a temporary one, because it is not usual for amendments to the Constitution
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to be made of a temporary nature. Sir, the Constitution (Amendment) Act, which is the enabling Act, the principal Act, leads to the other two Acts. The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act lasts for five years. At the end of that five years, it has to be renewed. The Member for Kallang has a point when he said that the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill should have been made of a temporary nature, perhaps for three years or five years when we should come back here to discuss and debate it in Parliament. But again, if he has that suggestion, I am afraid he is a little out of time. The suggestion should have been made when the Bill was debated in the House last year. Unfortunately, the Member, not having the advantage of a study of the law, did not know that the Act was ultra vires the Constitution. But, as I said before, the Minister in charge had to deal with a rather drastic situation. When you have thousands of drug addicts on your hands, you cannot sometimes wait even for a parliamentary sitting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for future assurances, like the Member for Jalan Kayu, I myself swore to defend and uphold the Constitution. But sometimes amendments to the Constitution have to be made; in fact, there have been very few in the last 12 years since we gained independence and adopted some of the provisions of the Constitution of Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, may I clarify the point made by the Member for Jalan Kayu? But before doing so, I would like to thank my colleague, the Minister for Law, for his reply to the queries raised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point of clarification, let me put it this way. The implication of the statement made by the Member for Jalan Kayu is that this constitutional amendment was an after-thought after the Misuse of Drugs Act was introduced and passed in this Parliament. May I assure the Member that this was not the case. It was not an after-thought. We knew that this Bill which was introduced earlier would require an amendment to the Constitution of Singapore. If hon. Members will remember, before the Second Reading of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Misuse of Drugs Act, this Constitution (Amendment) Bill was introduced for First Reading in this Parliament. So it was not an after-thought. It was not a case, as was vividly put by the Member for Jalan Kayu, of closing the stable gate after the horse had fled. In fact, the horse is still in the stable when we try to close it. It is not a case of the horse having bolted. It is still in the stable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of clarification is that this is not a straightforward case of detention without trial of secret society gangsters. This is a case where a drug addict is being detained not for purposes of imprisonment but for purposes of treatment and rehabilitation. As my colleague, the Minister for Law, has aptly illustrated his point, we are not only fighting an epidemic, an epidemic which is called the "heroin" epidemic where the addicts not only require treatment and rehabilitation as quickly as possible, but we also have to prevent them from infecting other people, just like small pox or cholera cases. So we owe a duty not only to the drug addict, of treating and rehabilitating him, but also to the community of preventing the drug addict from infecting other unsuspecting youths.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 10(a) of the Arms Offences Act, 1973, exempts the following categories of persons from section 3 of the Act which provides for punishment for unlawful possession of arms or ammunition:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) members of any visiting force lawfully present in Singapore;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) members of the Police Force; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) members of a volunteer force or local force constituted under any written law for the time being in force in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this exemption provision, police officers and military personnel cannot be charged for unlawful possession of arms or ammunition under the Arms Offences Act. They can only be charged under another Act, the Arms and Explosives Act, which imposes much lighter penalties than the Arms Offences Act. In principle, there is no reason why uniformed personnel should not be treated like other citizens when they are not acting in the performance of their duty. They should not be allowed to escape the more severe punishment which they may deserve as provided by section 3 of the Arms Offences Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill therefore seeks to redress this anomaly without causing disruption or inconvenience to uniformed personnel who need to carry arms in the performance of duty by restricting the exemption.

  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Loan Act, 1974, which came into operation in November 1974 authorised a sum of $5,000 million to be raised by way of loans for the purposes of the Development Fund. So far, loans totalling $4,200 million have been raised under the Act, leaving a balance of only $800 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that, in order to meet the needs of development financing over the next four years, new loans amounting to $6,000 million will have to be raised in addition to the $800 million that can still be raised under the Development Loan Act, 1974. It is therefore necessary to enact fresh legislation to empower the Government to raise this amount.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill follows very closely the provisions of the Development Loan Act, 1974. The maximum amount of loans that can be raised under the Bill is $6,000 million.

  <b>The Minister for Law, the Environment and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade> *The motion reads as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by Government of that portion of the foreshore and seabed off Tampines and Changi containing an area of about 44 hectares, as shown coloured green on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAIMATION PLAN NO 4/77" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the development of more and more homes by the Housing and Development Board, it is necessary to provide more green "lungs" and public parks for the use and benefit of the residents. A number of public parks will be developed by Government, amongst them Pasir Ris Park. The development of this Park necessitates the reclamation of about 44 hectares of the foreshore and seabed off Tampines and Changi as shown coloured green on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/77", a copy of which is displayed in the library of this House for the information of hon. Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reclamation will cost Government about $5 million. Fill for the
  <br>

  <font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reclamation will be obtained from the cut-site of the Housing and Development Board's Tampines New Town.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When completed, Pasir Ris Park with an area of 95 hectares will be the major green "lung" serving the population in the north-eastern sector of the island including Upper Serangoon, Punggol Housing Estate and Tampines New Town.
  <br>

  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade> *The motion reads as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by Government of those portion of the foreshore and seabed at Sentosa Island containing a total area of about 17.0 hectures as shown coloured pink on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/77" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 30th November, 1973, this House approved the dredging and reclamation of about 11 hectares (27 acres) of the fore-shore off Sentosa Island for the creation of a swimming lagoon and construction of some foreshore structures (temporary bridges) as well as the reclamation of about 3 hectares (7 acres) of the Kuchin Creek Estuary by the Port of Singapore Authority as agents of the Sentosa Development Corporation. The reclamation off Sentosa Island for the swimming lagoon and the construction of tem-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> porary bridges have been completed. The reclamation of Kuchin Creek Estuary was, however, shelved temporarily since 1st June 1976 by the Corporation, as the Corporation had second thoughts on the profile of the reclamation. The Corporation now proposes to proceed with an enlarged reclamation scheme of about 17 hectares (42 acres) covering the foreshore at Kuchin Creek Estuary as well as the reef between Sarong Island and the Main Jetty as shown coloured pink on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/77". A copy of this plan is displayed in the library of this House for the information of Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area proposed for reclamation is an eyesore at low tide when muddy flats, mangrove swamps and flotsam are exposed. The reclamation will join up Pulau Selegu and Sarong Island with Sentosa Island which will not only improve the visual impact on visitors, but will also create more land for future development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority, as agents of the Corporation, will undertake the reclamation works which are expected to be completed in about 14 months' time at an estimated cost of about $7 million. Fill for the reclamation will be obtained from the Public Utilities Board Reservoir project at Ulu Pandan and the Port of Singapore Authority's Inland Container Depot site at - Holland Road/Bukit Timah Road junction.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, the land will be proclaimed as State land and alienated to the Sentosa Development Corporation on terms and conditions to be agreed with the Commissioner of Lands. Suitable landscaping, including the planting of coconut trees along the fringe of the reclaimed land to preserve the image of a tropical island, will also be undertaken.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the

</pre> The Honourable Member will notice that there is a consistent fall in fatal and permanent disablement cases in the last 2 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the amount of compensation paid under the Workmen's Compensation Act in respect of all work accidents, industrials or otherwise, a total sum of $13,883,289,07 was paid as compensation in 1977. The corresponding figures of actual payments for 1976 and 1975 were $11,290,743.47 and $4,874,247.23 respectively. It should be pointed out that these figures are payments of workmen's compensation actually made. They do not reflect all the cases for that year. The increases in 1976 and 1977 were the result largely of the upward revision of the quantum of compensation paid. The Honourable Member will recall that on 1 Oct 75 the new Workmen's Compensation Act came into operation which raised the maximum quantum from $21,600 to $35,000 for fatal cases and from $28,800 to $45,000 for total permanent incapacity cases. Separate statistics are not available on the amount of workmen's compensation paid out for industrial accidents. In future, such statistics will be available.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of private motor cars and station wagons, which form the single largest category of our motor vehicles, decreased by 6,608 to 133,350 in December 1976 and by a further 1,286 to 132,064 in December 1977. This reflects, to a large extent, the effectiveness of our policies to restrain the growth of private car ownership.

  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> I am aware of such a practice but I do not intend to curb it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment opportunities at sea are not that difficult to come by provided the seaman has the necessary discipline and is not choosy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may interest the Honourable Member to know that one-third of our seamen are employed on foreign flag ships.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to retain a sense of balance in these matters. Shipowners must be allowed some flexibility in their recruitment policy for otherwise they would be deterred from having their ships registered in Singapore. They are, however, encouraged to employ local seamen. In accordance with the Merchant Shipping Act, 50% of their annual tonnage tax is refunded if 25% or more of their crew consists of Singaporeans.

  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education, in view of the long period of interview, heavy costs in terms of man-hours, manpower and organisation support and the small percentage of officers promoted, whether there is any plan to rationalise the promotion system in order to save time and cost as well as to reduce the frustrations of officers in the teaching profession.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The present promotion exercise was in fact an attempt to rationalise the promotion procedures taking account the experience gained from the first two promotion exercises in 1972 and 1974. In the last two promotion exercises, only about 1,200 officers, or about 7% of those eligible, were shortlisted for a single round of interviews by the Public Service Commission. Many of the 93% of those not shortlisted voiced their disappointment at not being called. This time, after months of discussion and consultation with the Public Service Commission and planning by the Ministry, a total of about 7,000 were originally shortlisted based on their records. The names of these 7,000 were then provided to their Principals who were asked to comment on the list and to suggest further names for inclusion if they felt any deserving officer had been left out. This resulted in another 2,000 or so names being added to the shortlist. Although the number shortlisted was large, totalling more than -9,000, the Public Service Commission and the Ministry felt it would be well worth the time and effort to interview them. Firstly, it would give as many as possible the opportunity to appear for interview and be considered for promotion. Secondly, they would be given the chance to express their views on the education system, the teaching service and their own personal problems, preferences and career expectations to the interview boards comprising Public Service Commission members and senior Ministry officials and Principals. Thirdly, and very importantly, it would allow as many as possible to be identified for future career development leading to appointments as Principals, Vice-Principals, Senior Assistants and in specialist capacities. All these objectives were, to a large extent, achieved in this last promotion exercise which was the most thorough and comprehensive of all the promotion exercises held so far in the Education Service. No doubt, the numbers promoted were far less than those not promoted. This is so in any promotion exercise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The considerable time and effort put into this exercise were not counter-productive. Nevertheless, a thorough post mortem on this exercise is now being conducted and the lessons learned from this will be used to make further improvements, in consultation with the Public Service Commission and others, to the next promotion exercise for which initial planning has already begun.

  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The current School Building Programme is geared to meet the demands of school places in new towns.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Neighbourhood Two, a new primary school and a new secondary school each with 28 classrooms have been built so far and are already functioning. Construction on 2 more primary schools will begin soon and these are expected to be ready in 1979. Another secondary school is expected to be ready in 1980.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The number of new businesses and companies registered with the Registries of Businesses and Companies for the years 1975, 1976 and 1977 is shown below:
  <pre>
                              1975        1976        1977

</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of businesses and companies which ceased operations in the corresponding years is as follows:
  <pre>
                              1975        1976        1977

     (Local Companies)          36          86         127
   Struck-off (Local
     Companies)                414         386         275
   Wound-up voluntarily

        Foreign Companies       83          90          55
</pre>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses are not required to give a reason for terminating operations. The procedure requires that they complete a form giving information only of the name and address of the business, the Certificate of Registration number and the date of termination of business. However, normally a business is terminated because it has failed. The larger number of terminations of business operations in 1975, however, may be an effect of the Business Registration Act, 1973, brought into force on 1st September, 1974 which requires all businesses to have their registrations renewed annually.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of companies that terminate operations, by and large, those that are wound-up by the Court and those that are struck-off under Section 308 of the Companies Act (viz. because they have ceased to carry on business for a period of time) are normally insolvent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of companies voluntarily wound-up are solvent. Companies ceasing business in Singapore apply to foreign companies which for various reasons decide to cease operation as a branch in Singapore.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) how many tourists visited Singapore in 1977, according to country of origin; (b) what was the average number of days spent by them in Singapore; and (c) what were the comparative figures for 1976 and 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Tourism is an important growth industry. During the recession in 1975, tourist arrivals did not decline but grew at 7.5%. The pace increased to 12.9% and 14.1% in 1976 and 1977, respectively. In 1977, tourist arrivals by air and sea reached 1.51 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All tourist generating markets in 1977 registered increases except for slight decline for USA and Australia. This was probably due to slower economic growth in the US, the devaluation of the Australian dollar and the special Apex fare introduced between Australia and UK which discourages stopovers between the two countries through the imposition of a stopover surcharge. The slight decline in tourist arrivals from Australia and USA has, however, not affected their relative ranking among tourist generating markets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three years, visitors from Indonesia constituted the largest proportion of total visitor arrivals followed by Australia and Japan. In 1977, Japan registered the highest annual growth rate of 35.4%. Other major tourist generating markets in order of ranking are Malaysia, USA and UK. Table I below gives a detailed breakdown of tourist arrivals and growth rates for 1975 to 1977.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975 and 1976, the overall actual length of stay of all visitors remained at 3.4 days. Tourists from Southeast Asia (for example Indonesia, Hong Kong and Malaysia) generally stayed longer than those from Europe, USA and Australia. Data collection for the 1977 survey has just been completed and the data are being processed. Table 2 below gives details of the average actual length of stay of visitors by country of residence for 1975 and 1976.
