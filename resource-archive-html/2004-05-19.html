FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the&nbsp;Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi) (for the Acting Minister for Manpower):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, payments under the Workmen's Compensation Act are not&nbsp;given based on type of industry or sector.&nbsp; Instead, the quantum is determined by the severity of the incapacity suffered as a result of the accident as well as the age and monthly earnings of the workman and subject to a maximum and a minimum compensation. For example, for fatal cases, the minimum compensation payable is $37,000 and the maximum is $111,000. For permanent total incapacity, the minimum compensation payable is $49,000 and the maximum is $147,000. (The rationale for higher awards given for permanent total incapacity vis-Ã-vis fatal cases is to provide for the injured worker's subsequent livelihood and medical needs.&nbsp; In fact, for cases where the injured worker who suffered permanent total incapacity needs the constant help of another person during his lifetime, an additional compensation of one quarter of <p align=left>Column: 2914<p>the amount awarded for permanent total incapacity could be claimed). The current ceilings were last revised in 1996.&nbsp; Since then, there was no significant factor which necessitates a revision.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the ceilings will be continually reviewed by the Ministry to ensure that compensation is adequate.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For deceased workers, compensation is usually paid out, on average,&nbsp; in about 6 months for the majority of 80% of cases.&nbsp; Delays for the remaining cases are due to difficulties related to the identification of the employer and insurer, the cause of death,&nbsp; and disagreement among dependants on the apportionment of compensation to each individual dependant. For some cases involving foreign workers, the tracing of dependants and exchange of documents with them could be more difficult and the cases could hence take longer to complete. The average period of settlement for foreign workers is about 10 months.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless specifically exempted, all employers are required under the Workmen's Compensation Act to purchase&nbsp; workmen's compensation insurance for their workmen. Beyond workmen's compensation coverage, it is up to the employers what other policies they wish to take up for their workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry whether the compensation that is given in Singapore is comparable to that given overseas.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Hawazi Daipi:&nbsp;</B> Sir, generally, I would say that it is comparable and quite adequate.&nbsp; The amount depends very much on the level of development of different countries.&nbsp; To give you an example, in California, USA, the permanent total disability payment is up to US$728 (S$1,238) per week for life.&nbsp; In Canada, payments are calculated by <p align=left>Column: 2915<p>expressing impairment as a percentage and adjusted for age.&nbsp;

I hope she will enlighten us afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, compared to its value in 1997 just before the Asian financial crisis, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> dollar today is still 17% weaker against the US dollar.&nbsp; Nevertheless, let me use this opportunity to explain the main considerations and our approach in managing the Singapore dollar.</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS manages the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> dollar against a trade-weighted basket of currencies of our major trading partners and competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the weakness of the economy and absence of inflationary pressure, MAS has managed the exchange rate flexibly, and the trade-weighted exchange rate has eased since 2001.&nbsp; It was only recently in April 2004 that MAS shifted to a modest and gradual appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate as the economy strengthened and early signs of inflationary pressures emerged.</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main objective of the exchange rate policy in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is to maintain low inflation and a stable domestic currency, as a sound basis for sustained economic growth. The exchange rate should not be used as an instrument to gain export competitiveness, or a&nbsp;substitute for essential adjustments the economy needs to make as our external environment changes.&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we recognise the need to improve the competitiveness of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> economy. We have done this by deregulating the economy and directly reducing CPF contribution rates, rentals,<p align=left>Column: 2922<p> utility charges and tax rates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past two years or so, unit business costs have come down.&nbsp; Ultimately, firms stay competitive by increasing productivity, creating new products, and actively seeking out new markets.&nbsp; The Government has also tried to support and facilitate this process through various targeted measures.</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the high import content of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s economy means that a depreciation of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> dollar would entail higher costs for producers and consumers.&nbsp; A weaker <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> dollar will lead to higher import prices and result in rising inflation in the economy.&nbsp; This would erode the purchasing power of Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong and stable exchange rate supported by our sound economic fundamentals over the past two decades has generated confidence in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> as a regional financial centre and trading hub, and a rising standard of living for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; MAS will continue to manage the exchange rate in a flexible manner to ensure that exchange rate policy remains supportive of economic activity, while maintaining low inflation.&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list"><br clear="all"><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote"><p class="MsoFootnoteText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

Since the Chinese <I>renminbi</I> is pegged to the US$,&nbsp;for that period 1997 to 2001/2002, in fact we had gained competitiveness on the basis of&nbsp;currency.&nbsp; But then, we strengthened&nbsp; recently from the bottom of 1.85 to about 1.66.&nbsp; But the <I>renminbi</I> is still pegged to the US$.&nbsp; So, during this period, of course, we lost some competitiveness because of the currency.&nbsp; But, as I said, we cannot depend on the Singapore dollar for the crux of our competitiveness.&nbsp; In the end, it&nbsp;boils down to the fundamentals, which&nbsp;are productivity, innovation, new products and markets.</p></div></span><!--TITLE_NAME:MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE--><p align=left>Column: 2924<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First, the assessors from the IMF and the World Bank have<p align=left>Column: 2925<p> acknowledged that there are legal and institutional safeguards against any potential conflicts of interest.&nbsp; For example, while the MAS Board sets the broad policy directions, it is the Managing Director and his management team who execute the day-to-day operations according to these policies. In addition, MAS' long tradition of sound licensing and supervisory decisions and its increasing transparency will continue to ensure that the MAS carries out its responsibilities in an independent manner.</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, unlike in some countries where the central banks have been pressured to finance the fiscal deficit and so failed to maintain price stability, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> Government maintains a prudent fiscal policy. There has never been any need for MAS to finance any Government deficit, nor is such a need likely to arise in future. MAS has full freedom to carry out its primary role of maintaining price stability.&nbsp; It has established credibility with the market, through its track record of running a monetary policy that has yielded low inflation and sustained economic growth over a long period.</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we will continue to review the MAS Act to further strengthen accountability and transparency.</p><p class="12" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means that the Minister actually agrees with the IMF on this matter.&nbsp; Two supplementary questions, Sir.&nbsp; First, is the Government so lacking in talent that it actually has to appoint the Deputy Prime Minister who is also the Finance Minister to be the central bank's Chairman?&nbsp; The second question is: what will happen to this post when the Deputy Prime Minister becomes the Prime Minister?&nbsp; Will he continue to be busy running the MAS as well?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; The fact that the Minister for Finance is concurrently the<p align=left>Column: 2926<p> Chairman of MAS is not a new arrangement.&nbsp; It has been so for many, many years.&nbsp; You may remember that when Dr Richard Hu was the Minister for Finance, he was also concurrently the Chairman.&nbsp; As for the second question, although I am deputising for DPM, I cannot answer that question.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since the question is addressed to the Minister,&nbsp;and he cannot answer it,&nbsp;could I pose another Question subsequently for him to answer that?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;He can pose a Question, and if DPM is around, he can answer it.</p></div></span><!--TITLE_NAME:TOURISM REVENUE--><p align=left>Column: 2926<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>TOURISM REVENUE</span></B></div><BR><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Measures and programmes to arrest decline--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Measures and programmes to arrest decline)</span></B></div><BR><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Question stood in the name of&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo -</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.&nbsp;To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the Singapore tourism landscape seeing challenges marked by safety and security threats as well as intense competition from and investment to regional destinations, what measures and programmes are being planned and administered to arrest the decline in tourism revenue in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 12, Sir.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, 2003 was a challenging year for the tourism sector.

<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee had asked about trends in discipline and truancy in our schools.&nbsp; The state of discipline in schools has been stable over the last four years.&nbsp; From the records maintained by schools, disciplinary offences have shown&nbsp; a downward trend in primary schools and remained stable in secondary schools.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most common problems reported in primary schools have been students coming late to school or not doing assignments, which together account for over half of all the primary school offences.&nbsp; In secondary schools, latecoming, truancy and improper attire or grooming account for over two-thirds of the offences.&nbsp; The number of serious offences in schools has remained small and relatively stable over the last four years.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A further indication of this is in the number of students arrested by the Police for various serious offences.&nbsp; The number has ranged between 0.3% and 0.5% of the student population aged under 19, including not just students in schools but also those in the&nbsp;ITEs, polytechnics and the private schools, over the last seven years.&nbsp; Most of these arrests were for theft, ie,&nbsp;either simple theft or shop theft.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been more boys than girls involved in disciplinary cases.&nbsp; Girls account for 19% of offences in primary schools and 34% of offences in <p align=left>Column: 2933<p>secondary schools. &nbsp;The proportion of girls is much lower for serious offences, at about 11% in both primary and secondary schools.&nbsp; The lower proportion of girls&nbsp; is also evident in arrests by the Police. &nbsp;Girls have comprised a declining proportion of students arrested over the last few years. &nbsp;In 2003, they comprised 27% of students arrested.&nbsp; About three quarters of these girls were arrested for shop theft.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Recently, this House amended the Human Organ Transplant Act.&nbsp; With the amendments, we can expect some increase in organ transplantation, including liver.&nbsp; Currently, there are 24 Singaporean patients on the liver transplant waiting list.&nbsp;

Liver transplant is a highly specialised procedure and, given the small number of surgeries, we have so far concentrated<p align=left>Column: 2936<p> our public sector resources in the National University Hospital (NUH).&nbsp;&nbsp;The NUH liver transplant team, with four liver transplant surgeons, has been doing liver transplantation for 14 years now.&nbsp; It specialises in cadaveric and living donor adult-to-child liver transplantation.&nbsp; These operations make up the bulk of liver transplant operations.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, they have yet to develop the capabilities to do adult-to-adult liver transplants, as these require more demanding expertise.&nbsp; The NUH team expects to be able to do adult-to-adult liver transplants by next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, we do have such capabilities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s private sector.&nbsp; Arising out of the recent case of a liver failure patient, my Ministry has made an arrangement with the private hospital's transplant team, whereby such a surgery, if and when needed by a subsidised patient, can be outsourced to them, with the subsidised patients paying the same rate as if the surgery is carried out in NUH.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The trust mark would help students distinguish the good schools and make more informed choices.&nbsp; Participation in the scheme by the PEOs is voluntary.&nbsp; For this trust mark to be credible, we need to enforce strict standards and allow only institutions which fully satisfy the requirements to carry the mark.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nanyang Institute of Management (NIM) was awarded the SQC-PEO certification in July 2003. However, since then, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has received 22 complaints from 30 foreign students against NIM.&nbsp; NIM is alleged to have forged students' signatures on student pass applications, made students sign on blank forms, and enter false information to enable students to come here for courses not approved by the relevant authorities.&nbsp; NIM was also alleged to have charged students for items like school uniforms which are not needed, and guardianship fee when no guardian was made available to the student.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of these complaints, SPRING conducted&nbsp;two audits on NIM.&nbsp; The first audit, conducted in October 2003, recommended that NIM address several shortfalls.&nbsp; NIM was also informed that a second audit would be conducted in&nbsp;three months' time to check on their implementation.&nbsp; During these&nbsp;three months, more complaints were received from students.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second audit was conducted in February 2004. &nbsp;NIM was found to have<p align=left>Column: 2943<p> breached the mandatory pre-qualification requirements which all PEOs applying for SQC-PEO certification must meet on an on-going basis.&nbsp; NIM, as with all organisations applying for the SQC-PEO certification, had made a declaration in its application that it had met all such requirements.&nbsp; In view of this, SPRING decided to withdraw NIM's SQC-PEO status with effect from 15th April 2004.&nbsp; Contrary to what Mr Alan Lau, CEO of NIM said to the media, SPRING had communicated the reasons for the revocation in writing to NIM through the second audit report on 31st March 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am unable to go into the details of the breaches because SPRING is bound by a confidentiality obligation with SQC-PEO organisations with regard to their application for SQC-PEO certification.

However, as a concession, when vehicle owners scrap or export their vehicles before the expiry of the COE period, the Government has allowed them to recover the residual value of the COE validity through a&nbsp;rebate.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) scheme was introduced in 1975 to encourage timely replacement of old cars, so that the car population will remain relatively young and roadworthy.&nbsp; In essence, it allows car owners to replace their old cars with new ones at a discount by using a PARF rebate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the COE and PARF rebates are not meant to be refundable deposits placed with the Government, they are therefore not payable in cash. However, they can be used to offset the taxes and fees related to the purchase of a new vehicle. &nbsp; Since 1998, we have also made the process for utilising the rebates more flexible.&nbsp; Now, rebate certificates can be divided up or combined to offset the payment of COE, ARF, or the Registration Fee for new vehicles.&nbsp; They can also be transferred to a third party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Sir, would the Minister consider changing the law to allow for cash rebate?</p></div></span><p align=left>Column: 2950<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B> Sir, as I have said in my reply, the system is not meant to be a deposit which is refundable.&nbsp; It is actually a payment and the concession is the rebate that we are giving.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Sir,&nbsp;can the concession be allowed in the form of a cash rebate?&nbsp; Will the Minister consider that option?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B> The answer is no, and it is because we have considered it many times.&nbsp; Let me explain to him why.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is also a difficult process to estimate the amount of ARF and PARF rebates.&nbsp; Let me tell him that the amounts that we have rebated vary from about $600 million to last year's $3 billion.&nbsp; As such, it is very difficult to set aside the funds.&nbsp; Because, to do so, it would then deprive other Ministries of the funds that are being set aside.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Sir, where the amount of rebate is small, say, below $1,000, would the Minister consider that option so that it would not inconvenience the motorist to have to look for a buyer to take over that rebate?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B> Sir, if we do it for any particular amount, I think it would be fair that we do it for everybody.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not possible for us to change it into a cash rebate system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.38 pm</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministerial Statement.

Within 10 minutes, the first responders arrived at the scene.&nbsp; &nbsp;They immediately started the search and rescue operations that did not cease till four days later.&nbsp; It was a tragic accident and by far the most difficult and dangerous operation the SCDF had been called upon to tackle since the Hotel New World collapse in 1986. Not only was the incident site which measured about 110 metres by 150 metres huge, but the rescue operations were fraught with dangers to the lives of the rescuers from further soil movements and collapse.&nbsp; The rescuers had to work in chest-high, turbulent, murky waters, amidst unstable sharp exposed metal and concrete structures, and near-zero visibility to find and recover the four victims trapped under the rubble.&nbsp; Working round the clock in two shifts, the officers and men from the SCDF utilised all equipment and means, tactics and techniques, and sometimes literally even their bare hands, to undertake the very difficult operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of four days of continuous operations, the SCDF managed to retrieve three of the four bodies that were trapped in the rubble.&nbsp; After heroic efforts, the SCDF had to give up the search for the last body, that of Mr Heng Yeow Pheow.&nbsp; The commanders assessed that it was too deeply and intricately embedded in the rubble to be recovered without unacceptable risks to the lives of the rescuers.&nbsp; We all share the grief of those who lost their loved ones, both foreigners and Singaporeans.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant ground movement had been recorded by teams of engineers from LTA, BCA and Japanese contractors.&nbsp; The untimely arrival of heavy rains<p align=left>Column: 2952<p> exacerbated matters.&nbsp; If immediate actions were not taken to stabilise the area, the surrounding buildings might also be endangered.

The Bill also streamlines the fines stipulated under the Societies Act.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Role of the Societies Act</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Societies Act plays a gate-keeping role in ensuring that groups which may be used for unlawful purposes, or pose a threat to public order, welfare or good order in Singapore, or which will be contrary to our national interests are not allowed to establish themselves in Singapore.&nbsp; Over the years, the Registrar of Societies has administered the Act with a light touch. In the last five years, only 10 out of 1,236 applications for registration were rejected. This is less than 1%. Hence, the number of registered societies has increased from 3,900 in 1988, to 5,300 in 1999, to about 5,800 currently.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Registry of Societies (ROS) has been responsive to calls, in and out of this House, to speed up processing time. In 1999, 46.3% of approved applications were processed within two months and 72.2% within three months. Last year (2003), out of the 259 applications approved, 97% were approved within two months and 99% within three months. So, the norm has moved from&nbsp;three to two months. Indeed, last year, about 60% of the applications were approved within a month.&nbsp; So the speed of approval has improved, but we have not been satisfied.</p><p align=left>Column: 2957<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Review of the Societies Act</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, looking beyond&nbsp;expediting the application process, MHA initiated a comprehensive review of the Societies Act in December 2000, with a view of making it easier for the majority of societies which pose minimal law and order or security concerns to be registered. As the Act has not been amended since 1982, MHA also took the opportunity to review the other provisions to ensure that they remained robust and relevant.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existing registration process treats all societies as a homogeneous group, and subjects all applications to the same level of scrutiny.&nbsp; Resulting from the review, MHA piloted a fast-track registration regime in January 2002. The pilot trial showed that there was scope to further differentiate and manage societies according to their character and activities. At one end of the spectrum, we have societies such as reading clubs, chess clubs, trade associations, alumni of local schools and staff sports &amp; recreation clubs which pose minimal security concerns. At the other end, we have societies that are, for example,&nbsp;of a religious or racial nature which can be a cause for concern given the multi-religious and multi-ethnic nature of Singapore society. Illustrating a forward-looking approach, from a fast-track registration regime, which we were considering then, we, in fact,&nbsp;progressed and have now decided to adopt&nbsp;an automatic regime.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Automatic Registration</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In doing this, MHA has taken note of the recommendation of the Remaking Singapore Committee to list down explicitly the types of societies that would require prior approval, and those not listed can then be registered without having to seek prior approval. MHA&nbsp;also consulted the public on the proposed automatic registration regime. An e-consultation<p align=left>Column: 2958<p> paper was put up on the on-line feedback portal earlier this year, for a month.&nbsp; In addition, a Feedback Unit Session co-chaired by Mr Chandra Mohan and Mdm Ho Geok Choo was held on 29th January. Feedback received was generally supportive of the automatic registration regime and for a differentiated approach. Following the feedback received, we have&nbsp;finetuned and finalised the scheme.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me go through the main provisions of this Bill now.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The automatic registration scheme is set out in clause 4 of the Bill. Clause 4 amends the Societies Act to enable a society that is not a specified society to be immediately registered on the date the Registrar receives the registration application so long as it is accompanied by payment of the prescribed fee, a copy of the proposed rules of the society and a declaration that the society's objects, purpose or activities are not those specified in the Schedule. This is a paradigm shift from the current approach.&nbsp; We expect more than half of the 200 or so societies applying to ROS for registration each year to benefit from this new&nbsp; automatic registration regime.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Societies that do not qualify for automatic registration</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 8 of the Bill amends the Societies Act to create a Schedule, listing down the categories of societies that will not be eligible for automatic registration. Let me explain why we should not allow these categories of societies to be automatically registered. Take the example of an ethnic or religious society.&nbsp; History has shown that religious and ethnic issues can potentially be divisive ones, especially in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a relatively young nation with a multi-religious and multi-racial society. We cannot afford to have individuals or groups exploit these issues without due regard to our country's&nbsp;fragile social fabric. Closer scrutiny of<p align=left>Column: 2959<p> such societies is required to ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place in the societies' constitutions so that they will not carry out activities prejudicial to our national interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the same reason, societies whose main purpose is to discuss any matter relating to the governance of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> must go through the normal registration process. This category includes political parties and political associations, as well as non-partisan political discussion groups.&nbsp; These organisations have an influence over the governance of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the national policies of&nbsp; the day.&nbsp; We must ensure that foreign elements do not hijack these organisations to serve a foreign agenda which is contrary to our national interests. Politics in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is and must remain within the domain of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another category of such societies is the alumni of foreign educational institutions. Given their links with their alma mater, it would be prudent to ensure that they do not establish themselves solely to fund or to receive funds and promote the cause of a foreign organisation. They can also have an impact on Singapore's bilateral relations with the foreign country in question.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Societies that advocate civil or political rights are also specified in the Schedule.&nbsp; Such groups, which aim to promote a particular cause, can potentially give rise to law and order problems if they engage actively in pushing their agenda, without due regard for those who may not agree with their cause.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Societies that promote or provide training in pugilistic or martial arts will also not be allowed automatic registration. When I spoke in Parliament last year, in moving the repeal of the <p align=left>Column: 2960<p>Martial Arts Instructions Act, I assured Members that existing safeguards governing martial arts associations would remain in the Societies Act. This is necessary to prevent such associations from being exploited by secret societies and other criminal gangs.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, let me stress that it does not mean that the categories of societies specified in the Schedule cannot or will not be registered. Their applications for registration will be considered through the current normal process which, as I have said, in terms of timing, has now been cut down, and it is working fairly well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the current very high approval rate, I expect the vast majority of these societies to be approved for registration.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that the list of societies in the Schedule will be reviewed regularly. Clause 7 of the Bill inserts a new section 33A to empower the Minister to amend the Schedule by notification in the <I>Gazette</I>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Safeguards</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of gathering feedback on the proposed automatic registration regime, there were some concerns that automatic registration might become a loophole for illegal or unlawful groups to register themselves. Hence, I would like to assure the House that there will be sufficient safeguards in place. For example, a society, whether registered automatically or through the normal registration process, is required to abide by its own constitution and the prevailing laws of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. If the society engages in illegal activities, it will have to face the consequences. Also, currently, section 24(1) of the Societies Act empowers the Minister to order a society to be dissolved if the society is being used for unlawful purposes or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore; or for purposes which are incompatible with its objects or rules; or when the society has wilfully contravened <p align=left>Column: 2961<p>its own rules or any provision of the Act or its Regulations.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 24(1) to empower the Minister to dissolve a society if it had secured automatic registration through false declaration or misrepresentation of its objects and activities at the point of registration. But let me assure Members that the power to dissolve a society has been invoked sparingly all these years, and only as a last resort. For example, over the past 13 years, from 1991 till the present,&nbsp;about 24 bogus football and sports clubs were dissolved&nbsp;to curb the operation of illegal billiard saloons, gaming machines and other gambling activities.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a check on societies that are automatically registered, ROS will conduct random audits on the declarations submitted by these societies after registration. Clause 5 of the Bill empowers the Registrar of Societies to order a society to change its name or rules, taking into account the need to safeguard national interest and public peace, welfare or good order in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This power will be confined to societies that are automatically registered. ROS will also ensure that these societies do not use names which are offensive, misleading or have already been used by other societies or organisations.&nbsp; It will be an offence if a society does not comply with the Registrar's order to change its name or rules.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</B> Mr Speaker,&nbsp;I welcome the amendments.&nbsp; But after listening to the Senior Minister of State saying that they can clear 99% of the applications within three months, I really wonder whether we need to have automatic registration of the type that he has proposed.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is good also that the Ministry has followed up on suggestions made by MPs in the past that there should be a quicker mode of registration of societies.&nbsp; But I have a few queries about the workings of this particular new amendment.&nbsp; First of all, I really would like to ask how useful is the new track procedure under clause 4.&nbsp; I ask this because the Schedule which provides for specified societies is extremely wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State just now said that this was following the Remaking Singapore Committee's suggestion that they should list down what should be&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2963<p>specified as&nbsp;societies.&nbsp; But&nbsp;if you look at the list, they cover the whole gamut of what the Senior Minister of State referred to as social entrepreneurship.&nbsp; For example, if I may take just two of them.&nbsp; Clause 5 says, "Any society whose object, purpose or activity, whether primary or otherwise, is to discuss any matter relating to the governance of Singapore society."&nbsp; That alone would, I think, cover all civic societies.&nbsp; Then the next clause, "Any society whose object, purpose or activity, whether primary or otherwise, is to promote or discuss the use or status of any language."&nbsp;might cover even cultural groups discussing whether Mandarin&nbsp;ought to be used, and so on.&nbsp; So even looking at just two of the clauses, we can find that there were very few societies that would not be within the Schedule.&nbsp; I would like to know, out of the 6,000 that are registered, what percentage would actually in retrospect qualify for this automatic registration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I welcome the change for automatic registration, I doubt very much whether it is as useful as it is&nbsp;intended to be.&nbsp; And given the fact that previously, the complaint was that&nbsp;it took two years to register, for example, the Roundtable,&nbsp;now the speed of registration is much faster and approvals are much faster, I really doubt whether this amendment would have a significant effect on improving social entrepreneurship in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, &nbsp;I would like to ask why the opportunity was not taken to review the discretion of the Registrar in declining to register a society.&nbsp; For example, the Registrar's discretion is very wide.&nbsp; It includes the Registrar deciding not to register a society on the basis that it is undesirable in his opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;That sort of wide discretion should perhaps be controlled, how it is controlled and how can a society appeal for a review of the<p align=left>Column: 2964<p>Registrar's exercise of discretion, short of going to the court of law for judicial review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I welcome the amendments, I think this Bill raises the question: what are we to do with&nbsp;societies in Singapore?&nbsp; Should we not look forward to the day when registration is the exception rather than the rule?&nbsp; Should we not look at societies with some trust rather than mistrust?&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not think societies are comprised of enemies of the State or aliens.&nbsp; I think there should be more confidence in accepting the formation of societies in Singapore so that we can have the flourish of ideas on how to improve Singapore society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should really review the approach&nbsp;whether we need to register societies.&nbsp; And we should perhaps pay more attention to the constitutional right that we all have of the freedom to association.&nbsp; I believe that, so long as societies are not political associations or act against the interest of the fundamental institutions of Singapore society, we should leave them to flourish.&nbsp; We should not control them to&nbsp;the extent that we are controlling them now.&nbsp; Because as it stands, even after these amendments, all societies still need to be registered.&nbsp; Otherwise, they would be regarded as unlawful.&nbsp; I think many Singaporeans would rather like to have societies which are more informal and which do not require them to go through all the gamut of application forms, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With those comments, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</B> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for letting me join in this discussion.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, firstly, like to commend the Ministry in its efforts to set up a provision for societies other than those specified in the Schedule to be registered <p align=left>Column: 2965<p>automatically.&nbsp; This green lane capability, in terms of registration, is to be lauded and brings us closer to creating a more open society, which is&nbsp;part of the recommendations of the Remaking Singapore Committee.&nbsp; It endorses and entrenches the constitutional right of a citizen to get together with other like-minded individuals to form a society quickly to help make things better for society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I have some queries that I hope the Minister would kindly address.&nbsp; Firstly, like&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung,&nbsp;I too feel how the Schedule was actually drawn up.&nbsp; Like him, I too feel that it is a very broad spectrum and it covers almost every civil society initiative.&nbsp; I would like to put it to the Minister that such a Schedule goes against&nbsp;the very principle and spirit of the amendments made under this Bill.&nbsp; I would like to hear what the Minister's views are on this particular point.&nbsp; If the response is that certain applications to form a society have inherent problems unto themselves, would it not then be better to register them under the green lane, that is, automatically, then watch their performance and deregister them if they are found to be deviating from the original intent as to why they have got started in the first place.&nbsp; On the safeguards that the Senior Minister of State explained earlier, can they not kick in even for those under the green lane and therefore every society is treated the same?&nbsp; By providing a Schedule, such as this, it actually gives the impression that things may not have moved very far for civil society groups.&nbsp; A case in point is the Roundtable.&nbsp; They waited under the old structure for almost a year before they could be registered.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask: if we were to&nbsp;bring the clock&nbsp;forward now, where would the Roundtable stand?&nbsp; Would it be&nbsp;the green lane?&nbsp; Or would it again be the slower wait-and-see approach for the Roundtable, a proven track record?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2966<p>Lastly, I feel that it is better to have an automatic "yes" or "no" for such societies.&nbsp; This wait-and-see registration might just push certain groups to register under the Companies Act as a&nbsp;private limited or company limited by guarantee and thus run the risk of not being monitored adequately by the same indicators as those used under the Societies Act.&nbsp; That could even prove to be more of a greater risk when national security of our country is concerned, as they might just not be on our radar as diligently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my hope that, as we move towards greater openness, the need for the Schedule may not really be valid any longer.&nbsp; I am heartened that the Senior Minister of State has said that the Schedule will be reviewed.&nbsp; But in keeping with Prof. Chin Tet Yung's point,&nbsp;it is time to trust the citizenry and do the monitoring by the administrators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir, first, I want to thank both Members for speaking up in support of the Bill.&nbsp; They have brought up several points which are related.&nbsp; I will take them in turn.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Prof. Chin laments whether this new regime will make&nbsp;a difference.&nbsp; In fact, he compliments ROS for making improvements all these years, some of which are actually in response to the call of civil societies for a more enlightened regime.&nbsp; Indeed, he is right.&nbsp; ROS has moved and currently takes a light touch approach to administering the Act.&nbsp; Like I have said in my speech, this amendment&nbsp;represents a quantum jump because it is&nbsp;the beginning of a process where you automatically register.&nbsp; In the past,&nbsp;the Registrar would be your gatekeeper for all applications and, in&nbsp;a sense, would treat everybody as a homogenous group and subject everybody to the same scrutiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when you are not&nbsp;a specified society, you are registered on the date<p align=left>Column: 2967<p> when you submit your application&nbsp;you pay up, and you make a declaration that your objectives are not within those specified in the Schedule and&nbsp;you can start your activities straightaway.&nbsp; I think that will make a difference.&nbsp; Whether it is one&nbsp;or two months, the fact is that those who are raring to go can, upon making the submission, start their activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Prof. Chin, I would say this is something that many societies will look foward to.&nbsp; And indeed, going on the past&nbsp;two years' figures, about half of the societies registered over this two-year period&nbsp; -&nbsp;about&nbsp;260 a year are registered, so we are&nbsp;talking about&nbsp;520&nbsp; - &nbsp;half of that, 260-270 would benefit from this new regime.&nbsp; So it does make a difference.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is whether or not the Schedule is too wide.&nbsp; We have chosen 11 categories.&nbsp; These are all carefully chosen.&nbsp; It is not a perfect classification.&nbsp; Neither is it cast in stone.&nbsp; And that is why the Bill in fact &nbsp;makes provision for the Minister by <I>Gazette</I> to amend the Schedule.&nbsp; I want to assure both Members and this House that every category was carefully chosen for reason where there is a need to scrutinise the application, whether or not, for example, it is the fact that&nbsp;it may have possible foreign links or the fact that a society engages in topics that may be emotive, like race,&nbsp;language or religion, or espouses causes which, from&nbsp;its point of view,&nbsp;it passionately cares about but if too&nbsp;vigorously pushed can also have proponents which will have a counter point and that may present problems.&nbsp; But I think it is important to note that being in the Schedule does not mean that you&nbsp;cannot function.&nbsp; Basically, it means that you have an opportunity to interact with the Registrar, which is the current position.&nbsp; So upfront, the Registrar, when you make an application, will have an opportunity to look at your constitution and&nbsp;your rules.&nbsp; Both parties'<p align=left>Column: 2968<p> concerns can then be discussed and, ultimately, a consensus can be captured in the constitution.&nbsp; I think that lends for a better regime where, instead of letting everybody go ahead, and then, like what Ms Braema Mathi says, "Oh, after that, you can observe, you can scrutinise later on, and if any society is out of line, you hit the society.",&nbsp;that will create even more angst and&nbsp;acrimony.&nbsp; So it is better upfront to have a good discussion and&nbsp;come up with a set of constitution and rules where both parties are happy and then you proceed, not forgetting that if you do not do this,&nbsp;if everybody is just automatically registered, as Prof. Chin argues for,&nbsp;societies may then start functioning and initially,&nbsp;on the surface they may have what may look like</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

So, let us take this approach of having 11 categories.&nbsp; We will monitor, look at them and, if need be, over time, we can review them, not forgetting, like I said, that really, we are subjecting them to&nbsp;the current process which Prof. Chin has praised already.&nbsp; The current process is working well, but we are improving on it.&nbsp; Even if you are on the Schedule list, you are still a beneficiary of the current process, which is working well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Chin also asked why we did not take the opportunity to review the process by which the Registrar has discretion.&nbsp; I think that is how the Act is structured.&nbsp; In the first instance, the Registrar will have the discretion to look at applications.&nbsp; But his discretion is not an unfettered one, as shown by the track record. And the track record is important.&nbsp; That is why I have said in my main speech, look at all the indicators, our light touch approach shows that the Registrar <p align=left>Column: 2969<p>does not take a heavy-handed approach.&nbsp; He bases his discretion on the Act itself.&nbsp; Section 4 of the Act sets out&nbsp;the premises upon which he can reject a society's application.&nbsp; And indeed, as I mentioned just now,&nbsp;the very small number of 10&nbsp;societies rejected out of a total of almost 1,300 applications, ie, less than 1%, over a&nbsp;five-year period,&nbsp;shows that he does exercise his discretion judiciously and only based on the provisions of the Act.&nbsp; And very often it is a certain section in the Act that talks about the purposes, whether the purposes are unlawful or are prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order, or whether the existence of the society is contrary to national interest that is involved.&nbsp; In fact, since&nbsp;April 2000, the ROS lets the applicant know&nbsp;the provision under which the rejection is based, and then he can make an appeal to the Minister.&nbsp; And, indeed, judicial review lies from the decision of the Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the process is in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point that Prof. Chin makes, and which Ms Braema Mathi also makes, is whether or not there is a need for registration, whether or not the Societies Act has a place in modern-day Singapore, especially as we go full speed into building civil society.&nbsp; Sir, let me say that the Societies Act does have a place.&nbsp; It is because the Societies Act is able to weed out societies which may cause problems in the area of, for example, ethnic chauvinism or extremist religious tendencies or other illegal activities, such as gambling or&nbsp;secret society activities, that the rest of civil society can function.&nbsp; And that is a point we should bear in mind.&nbsp; It does not stifle.&nbsp; It, in fact, encourages and promotes civil society.&nbsp; And this in fact has been happening.&nbsp; If we look at what has been&nbsp;happening in Singapore over the past five to 10 years, societies have sprung up, and I have given Members the numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of registered societies has increased from 3,900 in 1988, to&nbsp;5,300 in 1999,&nbsp;to<p align=left>Column: 2970<p> about 5,800 currently.&nbsp; And not just in terms of the number of societies, but in the range of societies that has sprung up, very often fronted by good-minded, good-hearted Singaporeans over a whole variety of causes, from cats' welfare to nature society, to other topics.&nbsp; That is why I think civil society is working well, with this light-touch approach which is taken by the Registrar of Societies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, Sir, let us take this step.&nbsp; It is not a perfect step but it is a first step and is definitely an improvement.&nbsp; And, over time, we can review it.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B> May I know which are the 10 societies mentioned by the Senior Minister of State which were rejected by the Registrar, and what are the reasons for their rejection?</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The second set of amendments would allow for an external auditor to conduct an audit of the SAVER-Premium Fund.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to highlight the major aspects of the Bill.&nbsp; I will begin with the proposed refinements to the SAF court martial system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill seeks to refine the SAF court martial system as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; to replace the <p align=left>Column: 2978<p>existing system of ad hoc general courts martial with a system of standing general courts martial constituted from a panel that consists of both legally-qualified servicemen and lay servicemen; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;to establish a system of single-judge courts martial, to be called the "judge courts martial", to complement the existing system of general courts martial comprising three or more members.&nbsp; The existing system will be renamed as "panel courts martial".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me elaborate on the two proposed changes to the existing system.&nbsp; Currently, whenever a case is to be tried by a court martial, a three-member court martial has to be convened specifically to hear the case.&nbsp; This general court martial is automatically&nbsp;dissolved once the case is over.&nbsp; Thus, whenever a new case arises, a new general court martial has to be convened.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This practice of ad hoc courts martial was adopted from the British system that needed to dispense justice to its soldiers who were scattered throughout the reaches of the British Empire. Such a system allowed commanders to convene general courts martial on an ad hoc basis to punish errant soldiers wherever they were.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this system is not efficient for the SAF as effort has to be expended to convene ad hoc courts martial to try even the simplest of cases. Currently, the SAF Court Martial Centre hears about 450 cases a year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill therefore seeks to replace the system of ad hoc general courts martial with a system of standing general courts martial. The standing general courts martial will remain in operation for a predetermined period of time.&nbsp; The standing general courts martial will be convened by a single convening authority, who will appoint the members of the general courts martial panel. The panel will consist of legally-qualified SAF servicemen and SAF lay members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The standing general courts martial will be competent to hear all charges that are referred to it. The selection of the president and members of the individual courts martial can be delegated to the <p align=left>Column: 2979<p>Registrar of the subordinate military courts, or to some other person, and will be made from amongst the pre-appointed general court martial panel. This allows the selection process to be efficiently carried out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now talk about the second major refinement to the SAF court martial system, namely, the establishment of single-judge courts. Under the existing SAF court martial system, each court martial must consist of at least three persons:&nbsp;&nbsp;one president and two members.&nbsp; Although it is not a legal requirement, the policy in the SAF today is that such a president is a legally-qualified, operationally-ready national serviceman, who is either a serving magistrate or district judge in the Subordinate Courts or an ex-judicial officer.&nbsp; The remaining members are SAF servicemen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such three-member general courts martial hear a variety of cases, both military and civil cases, and are ideal for cases which concern SAF values and practices.&nbsp; For such cases, the policy and operational perspectives of the SAF lay members complement the legal perspective of the president and enables a balanced collective decision to be reached.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a significant number of cases that are tried in the general courts martial do not involve such considerations.&nbsp; In particular, cases involving solely civil offences usually call for a pure judicial analysis of the facts and legal issues and an application of established judicial sentencing principles and guidelines by the judge. Such cases will be more efficiently and effectively dealt with by a single legally qualified judge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the Bill seeks to establish an additional system of general courts martial known as judge courts martial, to <p align=left>Column: 2980<p>exist alongside the present system of general courts martial. Each judge court martial will consist of a single legally qualified national serviceman judge.&nbsp; In line with current practice,&nbsp;he is likely to be a current or former judicial officer. As a result, the judge courts martial will closely resemble the Subordinate Courts in the civilian justice system in that the accused serviceman, like&nbsp;his civilian counterpart, will similarly be tried by a single legally qualified judge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the default option is for offences to be tried by the panel courts martial unless the SAF Director of Legal Services directs that it be tried by a judge courts martial.&nbsp;&nbsp;Operationally, the Armed Forces Council will set guidelines for the Director of Legal Services on the types of offences that should be tried by the judge courts martial or by the panel courts martial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the introduction of the standing general courts martial and judge courts martial would enhance the efficient use of manpower in the SAF without compromising the high standards of quality, justice and accountability that the servicemen and the public have come to expect from the SAF military justice system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now move on to talk about the second set of amendments to the SAF Act, namely, the amendments to allow for the audit of the SAVER-Premium Fund to be conducted by an external auditor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAVER and Premium Plans hold the retirement benefits of military servicemen.&nbsp; Currently section 205C(5)&nbsp;of the SAF Act provides that the accounts and annual financial statements of the SAVER-Premium Fund be audited by the Auditor-General.&nbsp; The Auditor-General only audits the fund on a cash basis for the purpose of parliamentary reporting.&nbsp; For the purpose of the Fund's annual investment performance and dividend <p align=left>Column: 2981<p>declaration, MINDEF engages a commercial auditor to separately audit the fund on an accrued basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This results in significant overlap and duplication in the audit coverage by the Auditor-General's Office and the commercial auditor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF therefore proposes to amend section 205C(5) to allow the audit of the SAVER-Premium Fund to be conducted by an external auditor.&nbsp; This auditor may be appointed by the Minister for Defence, in consultation with the Auditor-General.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parliament is requested to approve the amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, I have some reservations and questions on the institution of single judge courts, which will be presided by NSman judges.&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge MINDEF to think very carefully before putting aside the present three-member court in some cases, and substituting it with a single judge court.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The military law regime provides for the maintenance of good order and discipline amongst members of the Armed Forces.&nbsp; It supplements the ordinary criminal laws in Singapore with a special<p align=left>Column: 2982<p> code of discipline and a special system for enforcing it.&nbsp; The idea of having a panel consisting of a presiding officer and two members on a general court martial, rather than&nbsp;a single judge court, goes back a long way in military history and military justice.&nbsp; It was indeed to ensure trial by your own peers, your peers who understand the military chain of command, your peers who understand military discipline, your&nbsp;peers who understand military convention, ethos and practices.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the three-judge panel, the other two members are experienced military officers who will bring with them deep insights into military practices, regimental ethos and the understanding of how men behave and conduct themselves in the field.&nbsp; Such empathy and insights cannot be taught in law schools, or gained from experiences in civil courts or civilian life.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the military chain of command, commanders are personally responsible for the men under their charge, in war as well as in peace.&nbsp; When their men are being charged, commanders or senior officers of similar background should sit in as members of the panel of judges.&nbsp; They may have better understanding of the situation of the soldiers.&nbsp; In contrast, in a single judge court, judges may not understand the military background or ethos.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some of the single judge courts, judges may have served national service in a non-combat role or they could be holding junior ranks in service.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the existing general courts martial&nbsp; panel has worked very well over the years in the SAF.&nbsp; There is no compelling reason to change it.&nbsp; If it ain't broke, why fix it?&nbsp; We must not&nbsp;try to just go for administrative efficiency or expediency.&nbsp;

May I point out that such cross audit normally happens in business companies where we have external auditors and internal auditors, as well as the appointment of auditors for specific audit or for due diligence purposes.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present Bill before this House to amend the SAF Act seeks to improve the administration of military justice and to allow for the appointment of outside auditors to audit the SAF SAVERS Scheme, a pension plan unique only to the SAF.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2985<p> While the amendment may be limited in scope, the issues that the Bill seeks to address may well be fundamental in nature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill addresses the process by which a court martial is constituted and further defines the types of court martial that may be convened.&nbsp; As a consequence, when approved by Parliament, the SAF (Amendment) Act will provide for the appointment of a panel of members from whom the convening authority, who after the Act will now be a single person, may choose, and will allow for a qualified person acting as a single judge to try cases.&nbsp; The amendment has provided the Government with much flexibility in constituting and convening a court martial from a panel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I can accept the need for flexibility, it is important for us to bear in mind that flexibility must not come at a price of unwittingly undermining confidence in the administration of justice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the process of determining the outcome is as important as the outcome itself.&nbsp; This is particularly true in the administration of justice.&nbsp; It is for this reason that our Constitution goes through great lengths to ensure that the trial of any accused person is fair and just; and that question must equally be determined by looking at the process by which judges are appointed, who makes the appointment, whether there is security of tenure in relation to the appointment of judges.&nbsp; It is only when a perception exists that the whole process is seen to be fair, that we find a greater willingness on the part of the accused to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court.&nbsp; After all, this is the process by which any demorcracy would set itself apart from any banana republic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it is that when we look at this Bill, we ask ourselves these same<p align=left>Column: 2986<p> questions, as these are just as relevant in our assessment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Bill, unlike the present Act, reposes the power to appoint and constitute members of a court martial in a single person who becomes the convening authority of the general court martial.&nbsp; For the purposes of the Act, the convening authority does not have to be a person whose rank is higher than a major.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minimum rank required to qualify for the appointment of convening authority is a legacy from the present Act.&nbsp; When the Act was first drafted in the sixties, a major was of a relatively senior rank as there were not that many to begin with.&nbsp; Today, it is often said that almost every other officer in the SAF is a major.&nbsp; Unlike before, the SAF today has grown in size and, as a consequence, and with my utmost respect to the officers involved, a major in the SAF would not be considered to be a senior appointment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the relatively junior rank required to qualify as a convening authority, it would not appear to be appropriate that such a legacy should remain.&nbsp; Even in the civilian context, the power and authority to appoint a High Court judge lies with the President&nbsp;of the Republic.&nbsp; What we have here is a situation where the law now allows the power of judicial appointment to be in the hands of someone whose rank is perhaps no more than a senior officer in the civil service.&nbsp; Is this satisfactory?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one may well ask: what is this fuss&nbsp;all about?&nbsp; The issue here is one of susceptibility to influence.&nbsp; There is little or no guideline within the Act or the Bill as to how a convening authority is to discharge his duty in appointing members to the court martial panel.&nbsp; Should he be allowed to appoint his friends?&nbsp; Should anyone, especially those in the senior military command, be allowed to have a<p align=left>Column: 2987<p> say or even influence the choice of panel members?&nbsp; Sir, the truth of the matter, unfortunately, is that the lower you are in rank, the greater is the likelihood of you coming under such pressure not to exercise independent judgment, whether consciously or otherwise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I am not suggesting that the convening authority, if he was a major, would allow his independent judgment to be influenced by his seniors, I would suggest that the confidence of the public would be a lot stronger if the minimum rank for appointing the convening authority was raised much higher instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, while the Bill proposes to establish a permanent panel of members from which members of a court martial may be chosen, there is nothing unlike a civilian appointment which suggests security of tenure arising from the appointment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 of the Bill sets out a new section 80A which provides the power of appointment to the convening authority to appoint any number of panel members as he shall determine.&nbsp; The term of appointment of the panel member shall be for such period of time as he shall determine.&nbsp; Also, the convening authority may at any time revoke the appointment of any panel member.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the face of it, it is clear that the court martial panel member does not enjoy&nbsp;any security of tenure in his appointment.&nbsp; This is clearly in sharp contrast to the civilian appointment of&nbsp;Judges.&nbsp; In its present form, a convening authority, who does not need to have a rank higher than a major, has complete powers under the Act to decide who gets to be judge, stay as a judge, or be removed as&nbsp;a judge of a court martial panel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2988<p> What it does mean is that there is little in the present Bill that would serve as an institutional check against abuse by the convening authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there, if the convening authority is so minded, that prevents the appointment to the panel, to be motivated by crony interest?&nbsp; How can the people be sure, other than out of pure faith and belief in the honesty and integrity of those involved, that a kangaroo court will not be set up or that those who serve the panel do so without fear or favour will be willy-nilly removed by those powerful officers higher up in the chain of command who are intent on covering up their misdeeds? Unfortunately, Sir, this Bill does not give us much assurance on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill therefore would&nbsp;depend very much on the integrity of those who administer it. I would support it only because it helps to make our system more efficient.&nbsp; And I would support because I do not believe that this Government would, or that it would allow those who work for it,&nbsp; abuse the powers that it enjoys under the Act.&nbsp; Sir, that does not mean that future generations of those entrusted with such powers will not abuse it.&nbsp; I would urge the Government to consider strengthening the process to reinforce the public's confidence in the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I note that the principal change, by way of introduction to the current system of general court martial, is per clauses 80A and 81.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment specifies the introduction of either a judge courts martial (clause 81(1)(a) or panel courts martial (clause 81(1)(b)) and where only a judge courts martial would have&nbsp;a "qualified person" as defined by the Legal Profession Act.&nbsp; Does this mean any panel courts martial (convened under clause 81(1)(b)) would constitute entirely military <p align=left>Column: 2989<p>officers with no training whatsoever in law or procedure?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am of the view that this is inappropriate as it would be no different from a summary hearing by either the junior disciplinary officer or senior disciplinary officer sitting in camp, save for the number of officers present to determine the guilt and sentence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, unless the Director of Legal Services otherwise directs (per clause 81(10)) that a "judge court martial" be convened whenever an accused is represented by counsel, it could mean that the charge to be filed by general court martial shall always be tried by a panel court martial, without any "qualified person" to determine on law or disputes on procedures as counsels may deem fit to address in court.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am of the opinion that army officers, albeit as a team, would be inadequate to judge or determine on such legal arguments or points as addessed by counsels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where an accused elects trial by a court martial as opposed to summary hearings, very often, such decisions may be due to a strong belief, whether rightly justifiable or otherwise, that a court martial presided over by a "qualified person" or judge advocate is&nbsp;fairer or correct than an officer or team of officers untrained at law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an introduction of "panel court martial" may undermine the quality of courts martial hearing, since it is being deprived of the benefits of having either a "qualified person" presiding or having the assistance of a Judge Advocate being present.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would also be open to public allegations or give the perception that it is not objective enough&nbsp; -&nbsp; own Singapore<p align=left>Column: 2990<p> Armed Forces personnel judged by their own officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is, the Singapore Armed Forces Court Martial Centre, though an open court,&nbsp;is situated within the premises of a camp and not many public members are aware of it being an "open court" as such.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To have a whole court's tribunal members consisting only of Singapore Armed Forces officers and without a "qualified person" currently, generally, being District Judges, as with the proposed "panel court martial", would be a move towards enhancing the public's notion that the military court martial is not necessarily a very objective tribunal.&nbsp; Justice, it had been said, must not only be done but seen to be done!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to highlight the following concerns:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the Director, Legal Services, of the Singapore Armed Forces, propose that all mentions and hearings of cases where the accused is represented by counsels be directed to be presided and adjudicated by a judge court martial?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; If the answer to point (1) above is affirmative, does it transpire that the accused who is too poor to engage private defence counsel, as a consequence of which the case would be heard by a panel court martial without a "qualified person" and as such he would be prejudiced by the case being determined by a tribunal of "lesser" quality?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; If the answer to point (1) above is in the negative, would a group of untrained, unqualified soldiers&nbsp; -&nbsp;officers no doubt -&nbsp;be adequate to understand and adjudicate over arguments on issues of laws or procedures or evidence, as may be raised by counsels from time to time?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2991<p>Should we not consider that where a panel court martial sits, that only officers, regardless of rank, with university degrees, be appointed to sit as members to better ensure their</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Sir, I urge the Minister to consider my inputs before the Bill is passed.&nbsp; On this note, I would like to support the amendments in the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, I share the concern of Dr Ong Chit Chung.&nbsp; I would like to add one point to the concern on the single-judge court martial.&nbsp; Under the new section 88 as drafted, it covers the objection by the accused to the president of the judge court martial.&nbsp; Since the judge court martial is conducted by the president alone, subclause (4) provides that any objection by the accused will be considered by the president himself, and it is provided that the president shall give his reason for dismissing the accused's objection to the convening authority.&nbsp; But it appears that this is just for the record, as it is not stated in the Bill that the convening authority will do anything about it.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question, Sir, is: how neutral will the president be in considering an objection about his own fitness to hear the case, and what recourse does the accused have if he has such a strong opinion that the president of the judge court martial appointed could be biased in the trial?</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 2992<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members for speaking on the Bill and for their interest in strengthening the military justice system in the SAF.&nbsp; I want to assure all Members that the Bill is indeed proposed to strengthen the justice system in the SAF, and the SAF has a similar interest to ensure that this is enhanced.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung asked why we are introducing a system of judge courts martial where a single judge presides. Would a single judge, he asked, especially one who is not a regular officer, be able to deal with military offences committed by regular servicemen and National Servicemen?&nbsp; Sir, our general courts martial deal with SAF servicemen who commit both military offences such as absence without official leave (AWOL) and malingering, as well as civil offences such as theft, cheating, and drug consumption.&nbsp; While the majority of the cases involved military offences, a significant number (some 20%) of all the cases dealt with by the courts martial in the last three years involved civil offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I explained in my speech earlier, such civil offences usually call for a pure judicial analysis of the facts and legal issues, and an application of established judicial sentencing principles and guidelines by the judge.&nbsp; Such cases will be more efficiently and effectively dealt with by a single legally qualified judge than a panel of three members.&nbsp; As such, the Bill sets up the judge courts martial to exist alongside the present system of general courts martial, that is, panel courts martial.&nbsp; It does not replace the panel courts martial.&nbsp; However, this judge court martial will deal essentially with civil offences.&nbsp; The judge courts martial will really be no different from the&nbsp;civilian criminal&nbsp;courts in the civilian justice system where the accused person is also tried by a single judge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2993<p>Sir, Dr Ong also asked about the role of the Director of Legal Services in determining whether a judge court martial or a panel court martial will be used&nbsp;in hearing&nbsp;cases. As I said in my speech, the default position will be that charges are automatically tried by a panel court martial unless the Director of Legal Services directs that they be tried by a judge court martial.&nbsp; While the system of having a single judge to try an accused person is the norm in the civilian justice system, it will still be a new practice in our military justice system.&nbsp; Moreover, the majority of the charges that are tried by the general courts martial are likely to continue to involve strictly military offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, MINDEF feels that rather than establishing the default position as one where cases will automatically be tried by a single judge, it may be more prudent, as Dr Ong pointed out, for cases to be tried by a panel court martial, unless the Director of Legal Services decides otherwise.&nbsp; And as I said earlier, the cases that will be heard by the single judge court martial will essentially be civil cases.&nbsp; In making his decision, the Director of Legal Services will not be acting on his own accord but according to the operational guidelines set by the Armed Forces Council.&nbsp; Over time, after the new system has been successfully implemented, the Armed Forces Council could possibly allow more types of cases to be tried by the judge court martial, if this should suit the needs and policies of the SAF at that time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Ong also asked about a situation where the Auditor-General disagrees with the appointment of an external commercial auditor.&nbsp; I would like to report that the AGO's advice has been sought on the proposed amendments to the SAVER-Premium Fund and it has not stated any objection to the proposal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2994<p> Dr Ong also proposed that the Auditor-General conduct both the cash as well as the accrual accounting audits rather than having a commercial auditor to do both of these.&nbsp; Sir, the SAF SAVER-Premium Fund invests in a wide variety of equities and bonds, and they are traded worldwide by fund managers&nbsp;who have operating presence around the world.&nbsp; Therefore, the advantage of engaging a commercial auditor with a global reach, as opposed to the Auditor-General's Office which does not have a global reach, is a compelling one.&nbsp; And we believe that an external commercial auditor would be able to do the job more efficiently in this respect.&nbsp; The selection of an external commercial auditor will be done in a careful manner and it is likely to be one of the big four auditing firms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I move on to address the questions raised by the honourable Member, Mr Sin Boon Ann.&nbsp; He asked about the measures to ensure the independence of the general courts martial panel since the members are appointed by SAF and MINDEF.&nbsp; Yes, the appointment or removal of the members of the general courts panel by a body independent of MINDEF is another safeguard.&nbsp; But we feel that it is not necessary as the rights of the servicemen are ensured by many other safeguards during the trial as well as the post-trial process.&nbsp; Let me cover some of these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill has indeed strengthened these safeguards as it expressly provides for the setting up of the judge courts martial, each presided by a single legally qualified judge, and the employment of a legally qualified president or&nbsp;member or judge advocate in&nbsp;a panel court martial.&nbsp; Existing safeguards in the courts martial system will also be preserved, and there are a few of them.&nbsp; Firstly, the independence of the court is enshrined in the SAF Act, and anyone who influences <p align=left>Column: 2995<p>or attempts to influence the court would be committing an offence.&nbsp; Secondly, the proceedings of the courts martial are open to the public and, thus, any alleged unfair conduct of the trial would quickly be discovered and publicly exposed.&nbsp; Thirdly, an accused serviceman may object to any member of the courts martial.&nbsp; Fourthly, primary jurisdiction over all civil offences rests with the Attorney-General, and the Attorney-General may transfer such cases from the military courts to the civil courts.&nbsp; Fifthly, all military prosecutions come under the direct supervision of the Director, Legal Services who is a legally qualified person and who, being a member of the Singapore Legal Service, is independent of the military command structure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, there are robust and independent appellate and review processes to right any possible wrong or unfair decisions of the courts martial.&nbsp; The appellate process involves allowing appeals against any finding of a court martial to the military court of appeal (or MCA).&nbsp; The MCA is a superior court of record.&nbsp; It is presided by a person qualified to be a Supreme Court Judge who has to be specifically nominated by the Chief Justice of Singapore for this purpose.&nbsp; Two other members of the MCA would also have to be legally qualified persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the review process, this is undertaken by the Armed Forces Council and the reviewing authority can quash the finding or sentence of the court martial.&nbsp; The reviewing process can be initiated by the aggrieved serviceman himself or by the Armed Forces Council acting on its own.&nbsp; In coming to its decision, the AFC can also seek the independent advice of the Judge Advocate-General, who has to be an experienced judicial or legal officer or a lawyer of not less than five years' standing.&nbsp; The Judge Advocate-General is also outside the military command <p align=left>Column: 2996<p>structure and is currently the Solicitor-General of Singapore.&nbsp; Finally, beyond the appeal and review processes in the SAF, and similar to the practice in our civilian justice system, a convicted serviceman can also petition to the President of the Republic of Singapore for a pardon or for a remission of his sentence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, there is a comprehensive and multi-faceted system of legal protection put in place to safeguard the interests of our servicemen. This extends from the actual conduct of the trials by the courts martial to the various post-trial appeal, review or petition processes.&nbsp; This system will continue&nbsp;to remain robust and, in fact, will be further enhanced by the provisions in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann also asked about security of tenure and whether this can be applied to the general courts martial panel.&nbsp; Sir, the general courts martial panel can be made up of regular or National Servicemen.&nbsp; In view of the new provisions in the Bill, the panel will also have to include a significant number of legally qualified persons who will almost invariably be NSmen.&nbsp; As such, it is expected that the membership of the general courts martial panel will have to change from time to time, depending on the potential candidates available, because NSmen do move into MINDEF reserves.&nbsp; Thus, the Bill does not seek to tie down the exact term of the general court martial panel or the exact period of office of its members.&nbsp; This is not unlike the practice in the Subordinate Courts where the magistrates or district judges are also not necessarily appointed for a fixed or definite period.&nbsp; Separately, there is no necessity to require security of tenure for the panel members just so as to ensure that they will not be subject to improper command influence.&nbsp; Let me elaborate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the panel members who are National Servicemen, panel membership<p align=left>Column: 2997<p> will not influence their career advancement in their civilian lives.&nbsp; Hence, there is no reason for them to be improperly influenced just so as to remain on the panel.&nbsp; As for the panel members who are regular servicemen, being a member of the panel is also not a primary or career appointment since such servicemen will continue to retain their regular appointments, whether they remain a member of the panel or not.&nbsp; Further, neither members who are National Servicemen nor regular servicemen who serve on such panels will receive any additional pay or benefit for being a member of the panel.&nbsp; Instead, their pay or service remuneration will remain the same, whether they serve on the panel or not. There is, therefore, no need to put in place security of tenure for the panel members since many safeguards are already in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann also questioned why the SAF Bill does not specify who the convening authority will be.&nbsp; He said that the Bill specifies that it should be an officer of or above the rank of a major, and he felt that a major may not be senior enough.&nbsp; The minimum rank set out in the SAF Act is only a guide and the convening authority need not necessarily be a major.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>The Bill does not seek to tie down the specific appointment or the rank of the convening authority as this is unnecessary and may be overly restrictive.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF Act instead requires the Armed Forces Council to make a specific appointment of the convening authority from officers from or above that minimum rank.&nbsp; Thus, the Armed Forces Council itself would have to specifically consider who is capable of assuming that appointment.&nbsp; In practice, the AFC is likely to appoint the Chief of Defence Force to be the convening authority.&nbsp; Our practice is in fact similar to that employed by many other militaries, such as those in&nbsp;Australia, United Kingdom and the United <p align=left>Column: 2998<p>States, where the ranks of the persons convening the general courts martial are also not tied down in their respective laws.&nbsp; Depending on the particular military, the general courts martial can be convened by an officer, commander or designated person specifically appointed to perform this task.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, let me take the questions raised by Mdm Ho Geok Choo, who has raised various issues, and I would address them in turn.&nbsp; The issues stem from the concern that the introduction of panel courts martial may undermine the quality of courts martial hearings since the panel courts martial may be deprived of the benefits of having either a qualified person presiding or having the assistance of a judge advocate being present.&nbsp; I wish to assure Members and Mdm Ho that the panel courts martial will be guided by legal expertise.&nbsp; In the new section 81(8) of the Bill, it is provided that if a panel court martial does not have at least one member who is legally qualified, then a legally qualified judge advocate designated by the convening authority shall officiate in any trial before that court.&nbsp; The effect of this provision is that every panel court martial will have either a legally qualified president or member or legally qualified judge advocate present.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of this House may also like to know that, as a further legal safeguard, we have a policy that the appointed legally qualified president or member of the court martial would in fact be a former or current judicial officer from the civil courts.&nbsp; Such a person would thus have actual experience with dispensing justice fairly and impartially in the course of his practice as a Judge in the civil courts.&nbsp; Such a member would bring his valuable experience with him to the general courts martial,&nbsp;further ensuring that the rule of law is as stringently observed in the military justice system as it is in the civilian justice system.&nbsp; Hence, whether or not the accused serviceman is repre<p align=left>Column: 2999<p>sented by counsel, the panel courts martial would be adequate to hear the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may&nbsp;also like to know that all military officers would have been trained in military law as part of their officer cadet training.&nbsp; Thus, the lay members of the court martial would have relevant training and would be competent&nbsp;&nbsp;for their roles.&nbsp; With the guidance of a legally qualified president or&nbsp;member or judge advocate in the course of a trial, together with their knowledge of policy and operational perspectives, and their training in military law, the lay members of the panel courts martial would play an important part in ensuring that justice is achieved in accordance with the policy of the SAF, the welfare of its servicemen and the expectations of the public as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang raised the question about judge courts martial.&nbsp; And since he is a single judge presiding over the case, how would objections to his fitness to being&nbsp;the judge be dealt with if it is raised by an accused?&nbsp; I would like to point out that this is no different from the civil courts where a single Judge presides over civil offences.&nbsp; And I would like to assure him that, at least for the beginning, the SAF would only put forward civil cases to such a single&nbsp;judge court&nbsp; -&nbsp; until we gain more experience.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, a point of clarification.&nbsp; I did not ask whether the Auditor-General was consulted in drafting this amendment.&nbsp; My question was: in the process of consultation between the Minister for Defence and the Auditor-General on the appointment of an external auditor, if the Auditor-General disagrees with the proposal, will the Minister for Defence proceed with such appointment?&nbsp; And, secondly, it is also a point of clarification.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3000<p> Of course, I agree that big auditors have global reach and they are desirable.&nbsp; But in this case, the Auditor-General could also, on his own, approach and somewhat pass some of the work to the big four or five international auditors who have global reach.&nbsp; So it is not necessary&nbsp;to be appointed by MINDEF.&nbsp; They could be appointed by the Auditor-General.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

pension funds around the world.&nbsp; And this is opposed to the Auditor-General's Office which may not have as wide an experience in this particular regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is more efficient and&nbsp;effective to propose a commercial auditor which is likely to be one of the big four accounting firms to carry out this particular function for the SAF SAVER-Premium Fund.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> The Minister, in his earlier reply, said that to require the appointment of a convening authority to be a rank higher than&nbsp;a major would be too restrictive.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Sir, indeed, the Bill seeks to improve this particular aspect of&nbsp;a convening authority.&nbsp; As it stands, ad hoc courts martial are convened to try each case, and they are convened throughout the year by different convening authorities.&nbsp; Therefore, to allow<p align=left>Column: 3001<p> for such flexibility, a minimum rank of a major has been stipulated, and this has been carried forward to the Bill.&nbsp; However, under the Bill, only a single convening authority is required to&nbsp;appoint a standing (rather than an ad hoc) general court martial panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, such a standing general court martial panel would likely&nbsp;hear cases of servicemen of many different ranks and from many different services, be it the airforce, the army or the navy.&nbsp; That is why, in practice,&nbsp;the Armed Forces Council&nbsp;expects to appoint the Chief of Defence Force, who is a two or three star General, to be the convening authority.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> That being so, and since the convening authority is just a single person, why&nbsp;does&nbsp;the amendment Bill not just make it simple by specifying that the convening authority shall be the Chief of Defence Force rather than leaving it to just being a person of minimum rank of a major?</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

safety at workplaces in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>; (b) review current safety standards and practices; and (c) recommend appropriate measures, including legislative changes, to further enhance the safety of workers in the construction industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, first of all, I wish to express my deepest condolences to the family members of the victims of the recent Nicoll Highway and Ayer Rajah construction-related accidents.&nbsp; I also wish to put on record in this House to acknowledge the courageous act of Mr Heng Yeow Pheow, who lost his life while saving his fellow workers.&nbsp; My salute goes to all the rescue workers and helpers who performed the risky rescue operations.&nbsp; The well-coordinated emergency rescue operations clearly reflect the sense of readiness of our emergency task force and their sense of mission.&nbsp; I am glad to learn that the Government will be recognising the courageous acts of all these Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many Singaporeans were shocked by these two accidents.&nbsp; Many were surprised that such accidents can occur in <p align=left>Column: 3004<p>Singapore, despite our stringent safety legislation.&nbsp; These accidents have eroded the confidence of construction workers in the industry.&nbsp; They serve as sombre wake-up calls for all stakeholders in the construction industry to relook into their safety practices.&nbsp; The impact of the accidents has also raised concerns among many Singaporeans who are questioning whether their buildings are safe or not, due to the extensive underground construction works that are still ongoing.&nbsp; The two accidents have indeed raised many questions concerning safety at workplaces in the construction industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in 1998, the Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry of National Development formed the Construction 21 Committee to look into the multitude of problems faced by the construction industry.&nbsp; The Committee held extensive consultations with various stakeholders of the industry and made recommendations to transform the construction industry, which is perceived to be a demanding, dirty and dangerous industry, into a professional, productive and progressive industry.&nbsp; Despite the introduction of safety legislation and safety measures, such as the Factories Act, safety regulations, safety standards and code of practice, the construction industry continues to have high accident rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me refer Members to chart 1&nbsp;[C<I>opies of charts distributed to all Members</I>].&nbsp; This chart shows the statistics of industrial accidents between 1992 and 2002, as compiled by the Ministry of Manpower.&nbsp; The number of industrial accidents in the construction industry had increased from 802 cases in 1992 to 1,337 cases in 2002.&nbsp; This is an increase of 67%.&nbsp; As a percentage of all industries, construction accidents had increased from 17% in 1992 to 39% in 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we were to analyse the fatality rate of construction accidents as shown in <p align=left>Column: 3005<p>chart 2, the results are more alarming.&nbsp; Between 1992 and 2002, a total of 518 workers had died due to construction-related accidents.&nbsp; The fatality rate in the construction industry accounts for between 52% and 74% of all fatal accidents in all industries.&nbsp; In terms of man-days lost, the construction industry has consistently more man-days lost, ranging from 405 to 1,150 man-days lost, as compared to all other industries as shown in chart 3.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this situation is definitely not desirable, and reflects poorly on the effectiveness of our safety legislation and safety measures in the construction industry.&nbsp; I certainly do not think that MOM should take comfort that the fatality in construction had dropped from 72 cases in 1997 to 27 cases in 2001.&nbsp; We must strive to achieve a zero fatality rate in the construction industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the years, the Ministries have been reviewing our Factories Act and Building Control Act to tighten safety practices in the construction industry.&nbsp; Safety training, seminars, awards and punitive measures were introduced to enhance safety at construction sites.&nbsp; Despite these measures, the number of accidents in the construction industry continues to increase.&nbsp; So, what are the root causes of these high accidents in the construction industry?&nbsp; In my opinion, there are three contributing factors which hinder safe practices in the construction industry.&nbsp; They are as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of integration of our safety and building legislation to provide an integrated safety infrastructure for the construction industry;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Lack of safety culture among various stakeholders in the construction industry; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Lack of commitment to design and implement a comprehensive safety<p align=left>Column: 3006<p> management system where independent checks and enforcements are carried out diligently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to adopt a holistic approach to enhance safety in the construction industry.&nbsp; Safety is the responsibility of all stakeholders in a construction project.&nbsp; The authorities, developers, consultants, contractors, suppliers, sub-contractors and all workers must play a role to develop a safety culture in our industry.&nbsp; The ad hoc review of legislation as a result of construction accidents is piecemeal and does not address safety issues effectively.&nbsp; What is needed is a consistent and total approach whereby all stakeholders fully commit to safe practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to urge the Government to form an inter-Ministry committee to review the current legislation and recommend appropriate measures to enhance safety in the construction industry.&nbsp; I wish to propose the following measures to enhance safety in the construction industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(1)&nbsp; Promoting "Safety First" in the construction industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to re-emphasise the importance of safety in the construction industry.&nbsp; The "Safety First" slogan must be constantly reinforced among various stakeholders of a construction project.&nbsp; Everyone must adopt the correct attitude towards safety, from the authorities down to the last construction worker.&nbsp; A study by Dr Evelyn Teo and various researchers of the National University of Singapore has identified two main reasons for unsafe behaviours of construction workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Lack of awareness about safety.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

Impose fines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, knowledge on safety and attitude towards safety are key pillars in fostering a safe work environment in the construction industry.&nbsp; But we face a huge problem of a transient workforce in our construction industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many construction workers are foreigners with diverse backgrounds.&nbsp; Many are here to work for a specified duration.&nbsp; Many work long hours with little rest so as to make enough money to support their families. The diverse composition of construction workers has made it difficult to implement effective safety training and improve communication among the workers.&nbsp; Very often, breakdown in communication is cited as one key contributing factor in construction-related accidents.&nbsp; This problem is further compounded by the multi layer sub-contracting system in Singapore. Construction work is usually sub-contracted down many tiers.&nbsp; As a result, the last person on the job may not know exactly what is going on. This practice of multi-tier sub-contracting is unhealthy, and has adverse effects on the quality and safety of construction work.&nbsp; Thus, I would urge the Minister for National Development to consider reviewing the sub-contracting practices in the construction industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope the Manpower Minister will also review the policies on foreign workers, allocation of man-year entitlement, training and retraining of workers and the granting of permanent residence status to foreign skilled construction workers so as to build a<p align=left>Column: 3008<p> stable construction workforce in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, it is common to see many sub-contractors working concurrently at different parts of a construction site. As such, it is crucial for management to develop effective communication on safety to their workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Japan, safety briefings are diligently conducted daily to ensure that all workers present on site understand the construction activities of the day. Such practices increase safety awareness among workers and avoid accidents.&nbsp; One key success factor in Japan and the United Kingdom&nbsp;is the strong support of their unions in promoting worksite safety.&nbsp; In the United Kingdom, the trade unions have developed their own safety inspection system supported by the UK Government and industry players.&nbsp; Unions are usually familiar with worksite practices, and thus can provide invaluable input to improve worksite safety. Therefore, I would urge the Building Construction and Timber Industries Employees' Union&nbsp;of the NTUC to step up its efforts to convey the "safety first" message to all construction workers in Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, we need to be more proactive and effective in increasing the safety awareness of our construction workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to re-emphasise safety, we must organise more safety campaigns and training for all stakeholders in the construction industry.&nbsp; In Japan, safety campaigns and discussion workshops were regularly held to constantly enhance safety in the industry.&nbsp;In Singapore, we seem to lack the will power and momentum to sustain our safety campaigns to make sure that they are effective in improving construction safety.&nbsp; No one seems to be interested to seriously improve safety standards in the construction industry. Although the Ministries, industry players, associations,<p align=left>Column: 3009<p> such as the Singapore Contractors' Association Limited, and unions have come together to organise various safety campaigns and programmes, we lack the follow-up actions to ensure that safe practices are indeed carried out throughout the development of a project.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should not be too obsessed with statistics on the number of workers trained, number of participants for safety campaigns or the number of firms achieving certification for OHSAS 18001 which is their Occupational Health and Safety Management System.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key performance indicator of our safety efforts must be the rate of decline of construction accidents and fatalities in the industry.&nbsp; At present, the risks of construction projects are poorly managed by various stakeholders, thus resulting in an apathetic and reckless attitude towards safety. There is an urgent need for the industry to re-emphasise safety.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrating the building and safety legislation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Building Control Act and the Factories Act are administered by the Ministry of National Development and the Ministry of Manpower respectively. While the Building Control Act ensures safety with regard to the design and construction of buildings and structures, the Manpower Ministry is responsible for workers' safety.&nbsp; But safety in construction projects is affected by both the design and construction of the projects.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A European study of the construction industry's fatal accidents showed that although the primary cause of 37% of accidents were failures of the construction site management and workers, 28% of accidents could be attributed to poor planning, and 35% due to unsafe design.&nbsp; The findings show that over 60% of accidents were due to <p align=left>Column: 3010<p>decisions made before work began on site.&nbsp; Therefore, it is crucial that safety is addressed at the planning and design stage of a project.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, both developers and designers do not conduct extensive safety audit on the designs of projects. The building contract only specifies the need to have an Accredited Checker (AC) for structural works. Designers rarely consider the health and safety requirements of a project. They also do not conduct comprehensive safety audit to determine the impact of their designs on safety during construction or maintenance. Such practices will result in unsafe designs which will inherently increase the risk during construction and maintenance. These risks will aggravate if untried designs were implemented. Sadly, the risks of such designs will be transferred to the contractors who may not be in a position to manage such risks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contractors' all-risk insurance policy is inadequate to cover such risks, especially when projects are under intense tender competition. Sir, we must reduce construction risks through safer designs of buildings and structures.&nbsp; The designers owe a duty of care to make sure that their designs are not only safe for building users, but also safe to construct. To avoid accidents during construction and maintenance stages, we have to adopt a risk reduction strategy at the design phase.&nbsp; International developments in occupational health and safety have now shifted focus on the designer instead of the principal contractor.&nbsp; The designer is regarded as the main party who can influence the prevention of ill health and accidents in construction.&nbsp; Besides the designer, the client also plays a significant role in the safety of a construction project. The appointment of competent consultants, specification of a reasonable construction period, award of tender to competent contractors and the provision <p align=left>Column: 3011<p>of safety measures will have a direct impact on construction risks and safety on site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate better risk reduction, allocation and management among different stakeholders in a construction project, I would propose that we adopt the United Kingdom's&nbsp;Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 1994, which is the CDM Regulations model.&nbsp; This proactive safety management system emphasises the management of health and safety throughout all stages of construction projects. The CDM Regulations place the duty upon clients, consultants and contractors to coherently and methodically think about their contributions to project health and safety. Moreover, their inputs must be coordinated and managed throughout all phases of the construction process.&nbsp; It also highlights&nbsp;the health and safety roles, duties and responsibilities of all parties involved in the project. This will provide better accountability and risk management of a construction project, thus enhancing safety.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as design has a direct impact on the safety of a construction project, it will be appropriate to integrate the Building Control Act and the Factories Act so as to provide a total approach to safe design and construction practices.&nbsp; A single agency will also facilitate efforts to foster a safety culture in the construction industry.&nbsp; Thus, I would like to urge the Ministers to consider merging the relevant sections of the Factories Act -&nbsp;safety regulations, safety standards, code of practice - into the Building Control Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing a one-stop agency for monitoring construction works</I>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have raised a Question in this House before to ask the Minister for National Development whether there is <p align=left>Column: 3012<p>any compelling reason to build so many basements in Singapore.&nbsp; Basement construction and deep excavation works are often complex and risky, due to the uncertain behaviour of soil conditions.&nbsp; In Singapore, two-thirds of our soils are alluvium and marine clay.&nbsp; These soft clays have high potential of soil failures, such as soil movement and soil settlement which will result in the consequent sinking of ground and failure of support systems.&nbsp; Thus, extensive and simultaneous underground construction works will increase the safety hazards of both construction worksites and its surroundings if not properly coordinated. Today, many public agencies and private developers are concurrently carrying out deep excavation works, such as MRT construction, deep tunnel sewerage system, underpasses, drainage works, underground expressways and various building developments. There is no single agency to coordinate and evaluate the impact of these construction works on the safety of worksites and its surroundings. Thus, each construction site will determine its safety measures based on its own assumptions, which may sometimes be wrong, due to a lack of information on activities around the construction sites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, temporary work designs, such as retaining walls for deep excavations are presently under the responsibility of the main contractors.&nbsp; The provision of temporary works is normally subjected to a competitive tendering and safety may be compromised if cost-cutting measures were undertaken by the contractors.&nbsp; Sir, although I do not wish to speculate on the causes of the Nicoll Highway accident, I hope to ask the Transport Minister the following questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, what are the compelling reasons for LTA to award Nicoll Highway&nbsp;and Boulevard stations, including the tunnels contract, to&nbsp;Nishimatsu Construction<p align=left>Column: 3013<p> Company and Lum Chang Building Contractor Private Limited Joint Venture as their tender bid was about $70 million lower than the rest of the tenderers? &nbsp;Please look at the tender results in chart 4.&nbsp; The difference between the lowest and the second, third and fourth bids is about 25%.&nbsp; In tendering, we would call such a bid an outlier, which is likely to be an erroneous bid.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what is the cost estimate for this project as determined by LTA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, are there independent checks on the design of the temporary works, that is the retaining wall? What is the safety factor for such temporary work designs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three, what are the monitoring mechanisms in place to measure soil movements during construction? Sir, the present approach whereby various public agencies or developers will self-regulate safety at their respective worksites must be refined.&nbsp; The Building and Construction Authority must exercise centralised control for all deep excavation and tunnelling works.&nbsp; It must be a one-stop centre that provides information on on-going construction works and approve all design submissions for both temporary and permanent works. There must be a centralised tracking system in place to monitor all deep excavation and tunnelling works. This will serve as a check and balance for designers of temporary and permanent works in deep excavation and tunnelling works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing a safety culture in the construction industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As compared to countries like Japan, the United Kingdom,&nbsp;the United States and Australia, the safety culture among construction firms is very lacking in Singapore. Presently, contractors adopt the minimum compliance mindset in providing safety measures at worksites. The contractors' attitude is that the Government will provide all the safety<p align=left>Column: 3014<p> legislation and standards while they concentrate on complying with the legislation and standards. This apathy among contractors impedes the development of a good safety culture in&nbsp;the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I visited a number of construction sites in Japan.&nbsp; I am indeed very impressed by the strong safety culture in their construction industry. The stakeholders of their construction projects take a serious view on safety and implement safety measures beyond their regulatory requirements for safety. The Japanese contractors take pride to ensure that their worksites are safe</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>and kept in a hygienic condition for their workers.&nbsp; Their housekeeping on sites is first class.&nbsp; Safety measures are meticulously&nbsp;planned and implemented on site.&nbsp; Safety designs and messages are displayed prominently to constantly remind workers of safety.&nbsp; In addition, all staff working on site are briefed daily on site safety, including the conduct of morning exercises to keep workers alert.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state of construction sites in Singapore is a far cry from that of Japan.&nbsp; Housekeeping is usually poor resulting in unsafe and unhygienic working conditions.&nbsp; Hazard areas are usually not or poorly demarcated.&nbsp; Workers are equipped with personal protective equipment which are not in very good working condition.&nbsp; Such practices have resulted in many construction accidents, such as fall of persons, hit by falling debris, stepped on or struck by objects, caught in or between objects, fire or explosion, contact with hot substances or objects, electrocution, exposed to harmful substances and dangerous occurrences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Manpower Ministry's change of emphasis to move from a compliance to a performance approach for safety.&nbsp; The way forward is to inculcate a sense of responsibility and accountability among various stakeholders on safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3015<p> Many studies have highlighted the importance of top management's role in affecting safety behaviour.&nbsp; Contractors must not only comply with regulations and standards but must be committed to constantly review and improve safety on sites.&nbsp; But in today's intense competition climate, many contractors are unable to provide adequate resources in a competitive tender to provide a safe working environment for their workers.&nbsp; We need to address this issue of putting safety provisions for competitive pricing in the tender.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent announcement by&nbsp;LTA to set aside 1.5% of its contract value for safety is a step in the right direction in enhancing safety on sites.&nbsp; We should develop this idea further by segregating safety provisions from competitive tendering, such as providing a fixed sum for safety provisions based on the contract value.&nbsp; In this way, contractors will be better positioned to ensure&nbsp; effective implementation of their safety management system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a study by the National University of Singapore has identified key success factors which help to improve safety in the shipbuilding and repair industry.&nbsp; These lessons are applicable to the construction industry, as both industries share very similar characteristics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key success factor is the constant emphasis on safety which entails the implementation of a comprehensive safety and health system, adoption of safe work practices, compliance of safety regulations, top management support, strong union cooperation and workers' involvement in safety programmes which help to drive home the safety message to both direct and contract workers in the shipyard.&nbsp; To develop a good safety culture, there must be a firm commitment from the top management of construction<p align=left>Column: 3016<p> firms.&nbsp; Contractors must make sure that they have a good safety management system which is clearly communicated to all personnel in the company.&nbsp; Inhouse rules, regulations and safety procedures must be adhered to diligently by all staff.&nbsp; Appropriate incentives and disincentives can be introduced to change the safety behaviour of workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adoption of a code of practice&nbsp;for a&nbsp;safety management system for construction worksites, the CP 79 (1999) will provide a good framework for developing a consistent and comprehensive safety management system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(5)&nbsp; Implementing independent monitoring and checks on safety</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> To be effective, there must be independent monitoring and checks on the safety management system of firms.&nbsp; Sir, who can be truly independent checkers to ensure safety through the delivery of a construction project?&nbsp; First, we need to identify who has a direct interest on construction safety.&nbsp; I suppose it must be the insurance company which should be liable for compensation if any accident occurs.&nbsp; Therefore, it is crucial that insurance firms play a more active role in conducting safety audit during the design and construction phases.&nbsp; Insurance firms will be able to provide a more independent and effective check on safe designs and site practices as they have direct liability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Independent consultants can be engaged by insurance firms to assess the risk of a design and its contruction so that appropriate measures can be taken to reduce the risk of harm to people, property and the environment to a level as low as reasonably practicable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The role of the planning supervisor as set out in the CDM Regulations can be undertaken by an insurance firm.&nbsp; In addition, the planning supervisor can also act as an independent safety auditor for<p align=left>Column: 3017<p> safety management system of site works. This arrangement will provide an independent check and balance approach to enhance the safety of a construction project.&nbsp; It will also make the guilty participant who is responsible for the accidents accountable.&nbsp; A person who is found responsible for negligence will ultimately pay a higher premium or be ousted&nbsp;from the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand that some developers have also implemented independent safety audit in their projects in Singapore.&nbsp; One local developer went to the extent of developing a five-star assessment system to assess the performance of their contractors on safety and environmental health issues.&nbsp; Similar to the Construction Quality Assessment Scheme, the five-star assessment scheme will grade and benchmark the safety performance of contractors.&nbsp; It provides a platform for contractors to share experiences and improve their safety performance.&nbsp; I would urge the Minister for National Development to consider instituting a safety audit system whereby both developers and insurance firms can provide a truly independent checking system on safety for construction projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further improve the safety management and safety audit, we must develop a consistent method to measure the effectiveness of the safety system.&nbsp; Researchers from the National University of Singapore have developed a 3P+I model as shown in Chart 5 to assess construction sites safety.&nbsp; This model is made up of four main factors&nbsp; -&nbsp; policy factor, process factor, personnel factor and incentive factor.&nbsp; Each factor is further categorised into more distinct attributes providing a systematic checklist for auditing covering all clauses of CP 79.&nbsp; I would propose that the Ministry consider this 3P+I model to improve the quality of safety audit in the construction industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3018<p> Sir, safety is about life and death.&nbsp; Safety is about our attitude to life.&nbsp; I would like to urge this House to support this motion to enhance safety at our workplaces and safeguard the lives of all our workers in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The accidents claimed six lives.&nbsp; And I join my hon. colleague, Dr Teo Ho Pin, in offering&nbsp;my deepest condolences to their families.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.26 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Home Affairs Minister for awarding a posthumous Medal of Valour to the late foreman Mr Heng Yeow Peow who put the lives of his workers above his own.&nbsp; I am sure the Heng family will have some comfort from this award.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we can never make up for their loss, this House can help make sure that<p align=left>Column: 3019<p> the lives of other workers will not continue to be put at risk, and that everything that can be done will be done to ensure the safety of workers at construction sites.&nbsp; And we must tackle this comprehensively at all levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the brutal fact is that despite all the professed progress that we have made so far, there are still more workers killed in the construction industry than in any other major industrial sector.&nbsp; In the past 12 years, construction accidents claimed the lives of 549 workers, accounting for more than 65% of all fatal industrial accidents in that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question that needs to be addressed is:&nbsp; why do these fatalities continue to occur at such a high rate?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to highlight three areas that we should look into:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Whether our regulations and tender process do enough to promote safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;The responsibilities of the construction companies and the steps that they should take to reduce the number of accidents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; The area that involves the workers themselves and whether they have a safety culture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a genuine concern that the cut-throat tender system has a role to play in this lack of focus on safety at construction sites.&nbsp; The competition in the construction industry is so acute that a string of construction companies have gone under.&nbsp; And for those which survive, many are tempted to offer unrealistically low bids to get a job to stay afloat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been instances when certain contractors were known to dive $50 million to $70 million lower than the others in their bids for a Government <p align=left>Column: 3020<p>contract&nbsp; -&nbsp; and they got the jobs.&nbsp; Surely, the question would be: how could their bids be so far off from the others and were they realistic?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trouble does not stop there.&nbsp; Once such contractors with low bids get the job, the other contractors bidding for other similar projects will also dive low, as they use these past successful bids as a guide.&nbsp; It becomes an industry-wide frenzy to the bottom.&nbsp; No wonder so many companies go belly up. &nbsp;So acute is the competition that companies are making all manner of short-cuts to reduce costs, especially when the costs of construction-related materials have risen world-wide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing safety measures and equipment is expensive and takes time.&nbsp; Hence, when constructing temporary protection works, such as retaining walls and struts, they will be tempted to offer a cheaper design with cheaper materials with a lower safety factor, as they will help them save costs.&nbsp; Smaller sub-contractors are often identified as culprits as they are prone to cutting corners because of their tight margins and poor cash flow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should review the industry practice of encouraging awards that go for the lowest quote, which runs the risk of attracting cowboys and increasing accidents.&nbsp; We should be concentrating on getting value for money which means taking quality and safety into account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its actions and contracts, the Government agencies must send a strong signal that they place top priority on safety by spelling out its safety requirements clearly in its contracts.&nbsp; For example, the contracts should tighten the procedures by making clear the design intent of the temporary protection works and spell out the need for a professional engineer to not only endorse the design, but to also supervise the construction of<p align=left>Column: 3021<p> these temporary protection works at the site.&nbsp; This is to ensure that they are built according&nbsp;to specifications.&nbsp; The safety officer on site is not trained to tell whether a design is safe or not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The client should also specify clearly a reasonable construction period.&nbsp; The experience of many in the construction industry is that projects have to be completed in a mad rush within very tight deadlines, and in the rush,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>corners are cut and accidents can happen.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government should also amend the safety-related regulations for construction sites to extend them to the sub-contractors as well, and not only the principal contractor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the levels of health and safety management are often determined by the requirements of either the client and/or consultants and contractors.&nbsp; For construction companies in Europe and the USA, safety for the workers is a number one priority as far as senior management is concerned. Clients are very demanding with regard to health and safety and will only deal with companies which are not only seen as caring for their workforce, but have safety planning, safety management and performance and have the records to back it up.&nbsp; Our efforts in this direction seem to be inadequate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I welcome the Land Transport Authority's introduction of a new performance scheme for future civil works contracts in which contractors with good safety performance will be paid up to $1 million.&nbsp; While this is a step in the right direction, as Dr Teo pointed out, it needs to be asked if this can be really effective, given the climate of low bids.&nbsp; If you drop $50 million to $70 million in your bid to get a contract, $1 million is a drop in the ocean.&nbsp; We have to fix the climate of encouraging unrealistically low bids in this cut-throat environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3022<p> Safety enforcement is an important component also, but the problem with Government enforcement is that it needs to be comprehensive in order to be effective.&nbsp; The sheer number of construction companies and worksites in Singapore that need to be overseen makes it very difficult.&nbsp; Hence, it is important to encourage companies to self-regulate and invest in training.&nbsp; There are often two reasons cited for worksite accidents:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Failing to identify an unsafe condition that existed before an activity was started or after an activity was started; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Deciding to proceed with a work activity after the worker identifies an existing unsafe condition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These two reasons put the primary responsibility for safety on the worker because the worker is the person nearest and most likely to detect an unsafe situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that the worker has not been properly trained, many unsafe situations may go unnoticed.&nbsp; In that case, the line supervisor and, ultimately, the employer also share in the burden of responsibility.&nbsp; However, the worker still plays the key role in deciding what to do once an unsafe condition has been identified.&nbsp; The question now becomes why would a worker wish to continue to work in an unsafe environment knowing that it could risk his life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, like Dr Teo, I do not wish to speculate on the causes of the Nicoll Highway accident, but I have three questions for the Transport Minister that need to be clarified:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Was LTA aware that there were earlier danger signs that the worksite was unsafe, and if not, why not?&nbsp; Those in the<p align=left>Column: 3023<p> industry said that workers had been giving their feedback earlier that the site was unsafe, including the newspaper reports of an LTA supervisor who later committed suicide.&nbsp; Was LTA aware of such feedback and, if so, did LTA act on them?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; I feel that LTA should set the example of putting safety first before everything else.&nbsp; Yet, its knee-jerk reaction after the Nicoll Highway accident was to announce that the works would continue in other sites along the Circle Line.&nbsp; Why did it take four days after the Nicoll Highway cave-in before the BCA ordered work to stop at 16 of the 24 worksites on the 33-km line so that they could be checked for safety?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Does LTA make it a requirement for the contractors to employ advanced and sensitive equipment, which I understand is expensive, to monitor soil movement in such potentially dangerous areas?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think these questions need to be addressed and I hope that we will hear the answers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, given the dangers of construction work, I would also like to ask the Ministry of Manpower what is being done to pressure upper management to play a key role in reducing construction accidents.&nbsp; To focus top management attention on safety, I would urge the Ministry to require all big companies to appoint a director with specific responsibility for safety within his firm.&nbsp; This would increase accountability and place top priority on the need for safety.&nbsp; Presently, big companies are required to have a safety officer but, more often than not, they are wearing other hats at the site, such as a foreman or line supervisor.&nbsp; Given the pressures, he is not full-time looking at the safety of the site.&nbsp; Rather, his priority is often getting the job<p align=left>Column: 3024<p> completed on time and supervising his workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in Europe and the US, the head of the organisation or a board member appointed as safety director is ultimately responsible for health and safety of the operations.&nbsp; There is a need to promote safety awareness and accountability as a fundamental value at the top levels.&nbsp; In essence, the development of a safety culture where safety is a habit rather than a chore.&nbsp; When upper management has made a commitment to be safe, they create a momentum which motivates middle managers, construction supervisors and, finally, workers to be safe.&nbsp; Without the motivation from the top, there is little chance that a successful safety programme will develop and almost no chance that a safety culture will develop.&nbsp; For this, financial support for the safety programmes is a must.&nbsp; Safety should be made the first item on the agenda at management meetings.&nbsp; This way, upper management will display its commitment to safety to lower level management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even if there is strong commitment from the top management, it does not necessarily mean that it has been successfully implemented by the line managers on site.&nbsp; In many cases, it is personnel, who have a priority for production rather than safety, which occupy key positions on-site and decide how the project is run.&nbsp; Sir, line supervisors are the most critical link in the safety chain because of their proximity to potentially dangerous situations.&nbsp; The line supervisors need to have a good understanding of regulations concerning safety.&nbsp; Since line supervisors are usually regular employees, provisions need to be made to ensure that they receive training on a regular basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worker training is next in importance.&nbsp; I would urge the Manpower Ministry to step up on its efforts to train those<p align=left>Column: 3025<p> working on the worksite on the need for safety in a comprehensive manner.&nbsp; As we know, most of the construction workers are foreigners - from Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and other countries.&nbsp; Hence, they are most at risk should there be an accident.&nbsp; I would ask the Manpower Ministry to investigate whether there is a link between language and cultural barriers and employee deaths.&nbsp; Is enough done to reach out and educate them on safety practices?&nbsp; Are there, for example, Thai-speaking or Bangladeshi-speaking trainers available with class materials and handouts in their language (in addition to English materials), to reach out to the thousands of construction workers in Singapore who have trouble understanding, reading and speaking English?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the end, the factor that induces the motivation that initiates the training is money.&nbsp; We must make sure that companies are persuaded that it is profitable to be safe.&nbsp; Relatively small expenditures upfront, as shown by the costs of training and safety equipment, can prevent large costs incurred after an accident.&nbsp; Lost time, loss of reputation, increased insurance costs, loss of competitiveness, and potential ligitation are strong reasons to invest in safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the end, this debate all comes down to the question: have we done everything possible to avoid any type of accident on the project?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we should take this opportunity to plug all the gaps, identify solutions and strategies to drive down the number of accidents at the construction sites to zero.&nbsp; We cannot bring back the lives of those lost in the recent accidents.&nbsp; But, at least, their deaths can be said to be not in vain if, by prompting this major review, other lives can be saved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would urge this House to strongly support the Motion.</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 3026<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</B> (<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, generally, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> has done well in maintaining workplace safety standards.&nbsp; The number of overall industrial accidents has dropped from 4,257 in 1993 to 3,179 cases in 2003, a decrease of 25%.&nbsp; The number of accidents in the shipbuilding and repair industry also decreased by 45%, and the accident rate in other factories dropped by 36%.&nbsp; The overall accident frequency rate (AFR) has declined from 3.2 in 1993 to 2.2 in 2003, a decrease of 31%.&nbsp;<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these improvements were the result of our strong tripartite approach to tackling workplace safety.&nbsp; The tripartite partners - the Government, the employers and the labour movement - collaborated at various levels to help the Government in reviewing safety and health legislation, to make recommendations on preventive measures and to promote good practices in the accident-prone sectors.</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent spate of industrial accidents brings on the spotlight on workplace safety, especially the construction sector.&nbsp; In fact, the Accident Severity Rate (ASR) of the construction industry has been successfully brought down to 510 man-days lost per million man-hours worked compared to 1,094 man-days lost per million man-hours worked in 1993.&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The high death rate in the construction sector is one of our main concerns in occupational health and safety (OHS).&nbsp; The construction industry accounts for about half of the total fatal cases in industrial accidents in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The fatality rate in the construction industry peaked at more than 70 cases&nbsp;a year in the mid-1990s.&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin called for the creation of a centralised agency to coordinate and look into how to prevent accidents from<p align=left>Column: 3027<p> happening in the construction industry.&nbsp; I would like to inform Dr Teo that the labour movement has all this while been attaching great importance to safety at the construction sites.&nbsp; In fact, the Building Construction and Timber Industries Employees' Union (BATU) has formed a Building and Construction Safety Consultative Committee (BSCC) in October 1997.&nbsp; Since then, the tripartite partners -&nbsp;MOM, Singapore Contractors Association and the labour movement - have been working very closely to curb the rise in fatalities.&nbsp; In fact, various measures were put in place by the tripartite OHS Advisory Committee and the Construction 21 Steering Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a direct result of such collaboration, the number of fatal cases dropped by more than half to 31 in 2003.&nbsp; I think this will help to enhance the safety of our workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1990s, we had about 70 cases a year, but in 2003 it dropped to 31.&nbsp; Of course, this result does not come about by chance. I think it is the result of our joint efforts in improving the safety measures.&nbsp; However, more can be done, and must be done.</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are saddened by the chain of events in the past few months.&nbsp; Many people may have noticed only the two incidents that happened recently.&nbsp; But, in fact, from January to April this year, 14 lives had been lost in the construction sector.&nbsp; Besides the <st1:Street><st1:address>Nicoll Highway</st1:address></st1:Street> and Ayer Rajah incidents, the kitchen explosion in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Changi</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Airport</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> also resulted in casualties.&nbsp; I would like to express my deepest sympathies for the families of the&nbsp;workers who died at their workplaces.&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we say, every case is one case too many.&nbsp; Any work-related death is not to be tolerated.&nbsp; As the old Chinese saying goes, we have to åŒ–æ‚²ç—›ä¸ºåŠ›ï¿½? (<i>hua</i> <st1:State><st1:place><i>pei</i></st1:place></st1:State> <I>tong wei li liang</I>) and äº¡ç¾Šè¡¥ç‰¢ (<I>wan yang bu lau</I>),&nbsp; that is, to turn grief into <p align=left>Column: 3028<p>strength, and it is not too late to mend the fold even after some of the sheep have been lost.</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tripartite partners should commit and spare no efforts to further tighten and&nbsp;improve the safety measures in construction sites. I hope that when the inquiry on these incidents is completed, the tripartite partners would look into how to tighten our safety regulations in order to prevent such accidents from happening again, so that our workers will have a safe working environment and a hazard-free environment to work in.&nbsp; If errant employers continue to risk the lives of our workers by ignoring our repeated calls for more stringent safety measures, then I think we should seriously consider even more severe punishments against them.&nbsp; As for those repeat offenders, I think we should consider punishing them more harshly like, for example, sending them to prison as a deterrent.&nbsp; At the same time, I urge the Ministry of Manpower to amend the law, particularly the Factories Act, to improve protection for more workers in workplaces, including the non-industrial workplaces, such as offices, hospitals, hotels, restaurants and laboratories. We should provide legal protection for our workers there.&nbsp; The current Act covers only about 700,000 workers, about one-third of our total workforce.&nbsp; For example, the number of industrial accidents covered by the Factories Act stood at 3,200 cases last year.&nbsp; But the total number of reported industrial accidents was some 12,500 cases.&nbsp; This clearly shows that there is a certain limitation to the Factories Act.</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much has been said, but the most important thing is how we could put all these recommendations into action.&nbsp; We should put in a concerted effort to make our workplace safe and sound for all our workers and not wait until accidents happen before we think of how to improve it.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>  	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div><p align=left>Column: 3029<p><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</B> Sir, even as the security of payment legislation is still being debated and the tender system being reviewed mainly in response to last year's upgrading fiasco at Marine Terrace, confidence in the construction industry has yet again been shaken,&nbsp;this time, more severely, by the Nicoll Highway and Fusionpolis collapse.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not since the Hotel New World collapse some 18 years ago, have we witnessed the construction-related mishap of the same severity and scale as the Nicoll Highway collapse.&nbsp; One shudders to think of what the fatality might have been if the case had occurred during peak office hours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The construction industry is indeed rife with numerous problems which have existed for many years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems of construction site safety&nbsp;and stop-work due to contractors folding up are not new, but the spotlight has been turned once again on these problems due to the recent high profile mishaps.&nbsp; Besides the Nicoll Highway and Fusionpolis collapse, both occurring within a span of&nbsp;10 days of each other, reports of contractors going belly-up have also continued.&nbsp; The fall in the number of construction fatalities from 72 in 1997 to 31 last year had been frequently cited as evidence that Singapore's construction safety record had improved over the years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with due respect, I feel that, for a more accurate picture, this figure ought to be compared to the quantum of the value of&nbsp;construction projects undertaken in each of the relevant periods.&nbsp; Even as the total number of fatalities fell by 57% from 72 to 31 between 1997 and 2003, the total value of projects also fell by about the same percentage, 58% in the same period, from $23.54 billion to $10 billion.&nbsp; The lower number of accident-related deaths may not be because&nbsp;our construction site safety standards have significantly <p align=left>Column: 3030<p>improved, but merely because there are fewer construction projects and, hence, a lower probability of accidents occurring.&nbsp; In fact, Sir, if I may refer to Chart 1&nbsp;which has been handed out.&nbsp;<I>[Copies of Chart distributed to hon. Members.]&nbsp;</I> Chart 1 plots the ratio of the number of fatalities per $1 billion worth of contracts awarded for the years 1996 to 2003.&nbsp; It shows that, after a decline from 1998 to 2001, the ratio has in fact increased again.&nbsp; And in 2003, at 3.1, it&nbsp;is actually slightly higher than even in 1997, which is at 3.05.&nbsp; If you turn to Chart 3, in terms of the number of industrial accidents per million manhours worked, the construction industry's figures have also been higher than the overall average since 1996.&nbsp; Moreover, this figure has remained the same at 2.8 for the last two years for the construction industry, whilst those for the shipbuilding industry has actually continued to improve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, even as the total number of construction-related fatalities has declined over the years, we must not take comfort in&nbsp;these numbers as they do not tell the whole story.&nbsp; When other factors, such as the shrinking size of the construction industry is taken into account, the safety record at construction sites clearly leaves much to be desired.&nbsp; A whole host of problems, including the recent construction-related mishaps and more contractors going belly-up, suggest that the construction industry is sorely in need of an overhaul.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Singaporeans wonder if the mishaps and woes faced by the industry are all symptomatic of much deeper problems within the industry.&nbsp; Are safety standards at construction sites adequate and enforced?&nbsp; Is there sufficient monitoring of site safety standards and follow-up action by the relevant Government agencies?&nbsp; Is worksite safety compromised as a result of aggressive tendering and negotiation practices?&nbsp; Has the long drought in the construction<p align=left>Column: 3031<p> industry led to a deterioration in the standards and the quality of the workforce as people with relevant experience and expertise exit the industry or are made to take charge of many worksites or multi-tasks in a bid to cut costs?&nbsp; These and many other questions are being asked even as the causes of the mishaps are being investigated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree with the Minister for National Development as well as with my parliamentary colleagues that we should not speculate on the causes of the two incidents, as investigations are under way.&nbsp; However, even as we await the outcome of the investigations, we should waste no time in initiating a thorough, coordinated review of the entire system -&nbsp;structures, processes and practices - of the industry to mitigate the risks of yet another accident occurring leading to unnecessary loss of lives.&nbsp; Thus far, whilst there have been efforts made to overcome some of the problems that have plagued the industry, such efforts seem to be ad hoc and piecemeal and are more reactive rather than proactive in nature.&nbsp; For instance, the security of payment legislation, that is currently being evaluated by BCA, is to counter some of the issues that have surfaced from the Marine Terrace fiasco.&nbsp; But it may not be able to wholly address the payment ills of the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would now like to highlight two key areas which warrant review.&nbsp; Firstly, the tender system.&nbsp; Sir, every time, a problem surfaces in the construction industry, such as the recent Nicoll Highway and the Marine Terrace fiasco, fingers inevitably point to the Government's tender system and its evaluation process.&nbsp; For instance, similar assertions that the Government's tender system which favours contractors with the lowest bids had contributed to some construction accidents were also made in letters to the press in 1999.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 3032<p>tender system seems to be everyone's favourite whipping boy for the ills of the construction industry.&nbsp; It has been identified by many as&nbsp;the root of all ills for the industry.&nbsp; A prolonged period of weak demand and intense competition, coupled with the tender system, is said to have forced contractors who are desperate for jobs to engage in severe undercutting, submitting unrealistically low bids.&nbsp; Many believe that this has led contractors to cut corners, such as compromising on safety measures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This negative perception about the tender system persists, despite the fact that the Government would come out each time to vigorously defend the merits of the tender system and assert that there is no direct link between the system and the issue at hand, such as the worksite accidents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for National Development's reassurance that the Government does not necessarily award contracts to the lowest tenderer,&nbsp;but to the contractor who gives the best value for money, in terms of performance and quality, is heartening.&nbsp; Additionally, as the Minister noted, all things being equal and to ensure a transparent and equitable system, it will only be prudent to award to the lowest bidder who meets all the criteria.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that, given&nbsp;a scarcity of contracts and hence an extremely competitive environment, contractors may enter into cut-throat competition, just to stay in business hoping that the market would eventually recover if they hang in there long enough.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for National Development's recent announcement that 28% of all public sector projects for the period April to December 2003 were not awarded to the lowest bidder, implying that 72% were, bears out this fact that contractors still stand a high chance of winning a tender on the basis of lowest price.&nbsp; Hence, whilst the fundamental<p align=left>Column: 3033<p> rationale of the Government's tender system cannot be faulted, refinements can and should be made to the tender criteria and evaluation system to address some of the concerns regarding the system.&nbsp; For instance, the Tender Evaluation Committee&nbsp;must be given&nbsp;ample time to evaluate the tenders, based on criteria which are made known to the tenderers.&nbsp; Bids which are substantially below the next lowest bid should be carefully scrutinised and the contractors interviewed to determine their technical competence and financial spending.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For large scale complex projects, such as the MRT lines and stations, the two-envelope method could be considered.&nbsp; Under this method, tenderers submit their bids in two separate envelopes, with the first containing the technical proposal and the second the bid price.&nbsp; Tenderers are shortlisted first and selected on the basis of technical competence.&nbsp; To ensure that safety requirements are not compromised, the Government could also require all tenderers to incorporate an item on safety provisions, as a provisional sum, not in the preliminary, and fix this at a certain percentage of the contract sum or minimum sum, whichever is higher.&nbsp; Currently, I understand that this item, although provided for, may be kept to a very nominal amount which is realistically inadequate for safety provisions, because the contractor wants to ensure that his bid is competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second factor that I would like to highlight that warrants a thorough review&nbsp;is site safety audits and monitoring.&nbsp; The Occupational Safety and Health Advisory Committee for the construction industry set up by&nbsp;MOM in response to the high numbers of fatalities in the industry has over the years reviewed its OSH policies and introduced tough measures, such as barring contractors with poor safety records to recruit foreign workers from non-traditional sources, to improve their safety standards.&nbsp; However, these<p align=left>Column: 3034<p>policies, the system of monitoring, etc, may have to be further reviewed and tightened to achieve tangible improvements in safety standards.&nbsp; Currently, contractors are required by&nbsp;MOM to engage independent safety auditors to undertake safety audits every six months, reports are then submitted to the contractors and&nbsp;MOM.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for Manpower what MOM does with these reports.&nbsp; How does MOM ensure that contractors have taken steps to rectify the deficiency in safety provisions identified by the audits?&nbsp; Are more frequent checks required of the contractor if the audits fall below a certain threshold level,&nbsp;as this will then ensure that the contractors comply with the safety provisions as soon as possible?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The qualifications of and&nbsp;criteria&nbsp;for safety auditors and safety auditing organisations should also be reviewed to ensure that these personnel and organisations have the relevant skills and experience to competently carry out safety audits.&nbsp; More stringent criteria could also be set up for those auditing more complex and large scale projects.&nbsp; The current demerit scheme for contractors who do not meet safety requirements could be tightened such that contractors get warning letters, stop-work orders and debarment from hiring foreign workers at lower threshold demerit points than presently.&nbsp; Like LTA, instead of punitive measures to elicit compliance by contractors, a carrot and stick approach with an incentive scheme to reward contractors who achieve good safety performance could be implemented to help inculcate a culture of safety first and respect for the sanctity of human lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, as the Minister for National Development has recently noted, the job of making worksites safe should not fall squarely on the contractors, but should be shared by all parties, from developers and architects to engineers and workers.&nbsp; Hence, schemes could also be devised to<p align=left>Column: 3035<p>ensure that developers could take responsibility to make the worksite safe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's move to make the payment to main contractors public and to have more frequent audits of the financial health of contractors, in response to the Marine Terrace upgrading incident, are positive steps to address some of the shortcomings of the industry.&nbsp; The SOP system that is presently being studied as well as the review of the tender system will also help to overcome some of the problems.&nbsp; LTA's recent announcement of $1 million incentive for contractors who maintain a good safety record and an equilibrium penalty for errant contractors would also help to inculcate safety first culture in the industry, benefiting both the public and those in the industry.&nbsp; However, as I have noted, these have largely been ad hoc and piecemeal.&nbsp; Our rescue workers, in particular the SCDF, the DART officers, the late Mr Heng</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The coordinated and swift Government-wide response in the aftermath of the Nicoll Highway tragedy which helped minimise damage and disruption to business is also highly commendable and reassuring to most Singaporeans.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But going forward, it is important to avoid needless loss of lives and exposing our construction workers and our officers from the SCDF, DART and other Government agencies to unnecessary danger by working towards zero accidents at worksites.&nbsp; This should be done by reviewing the operations of the entire construction industry which has been crying out for change for some time now.&nbsp; The relevant Government agencies, ie, BCA, MOM, HDB, LTA and JTC, should spearhead and coordinate the review, from the tendering and contract admini<p align=left>Column: 3036<p>stration system to payment modes, the BCA's contractors' registry, safety regulations and the adequacy of workmen's compensation, with inputs from all stakeholders.&nbsp; I urge the relevant authorities not to drag their feet and wait till more lives are lost before taking comprehensive action.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with this, I support the motion.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr S Iswaran (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr S Iswaran (West Coast):</B> Sir, I rise in support of the motion.&nbsp; The Nicoll Highway and Fusionpolis incidents were two qualitatively different incidents.&nbsp; But they have both served to draw into sharp focus the need for greater safety at construction sites.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I first join my colleagues who have spoken before me in&nbsp;offering condolences to the families that had been affected and, at the same time, commending the rescue workers, especially the SCDF and the Home Team, for their marvellous efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin has outlined very comprehensively a&nbsp;whole range of issues that need to be considered.&nbsp; I would confine myself to two or three key points by reiterating the fact that what this calls for is a system-level response, and not just specific investigations on the incidents that have occurred.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the first point I wish to address is whether current legislative regulatory frameworks are adequate for ensuring safety at our worksites.&nbsp; The worksite is a very busy venue with multiple parties, eg, main contractors and sub-contractors, all attending to a variety of tasks.&nbsp; The process of construction itself is going to be a highly complex coordination task.&nbsp; If we add&nbsp;to this the role of safety responsibility as well,&nbsp;the question then is: can that task be adequately achieved by the main contractor?&nbsp; Is there in fact a conflict when we ask the main contractor to take overall responsibility for safety at<p align=left>Column: 3037<p> the worksite when he has to take care of a very complex array of activities, and also the instinct might well be to cut corners or to take the path of least resistance when under pressure for time or resources?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the question which others have raised, and I wish to reiterate, is: should we in fact institute a process where independent audits and checks for safety purposes are mandatory?&nbsp; These can be undertaken by agents of the BCA and implemented on a regular basis, very transparent, with reports being circulated to all bodies, including the contractors.&nbsp; This is not going to be a foolproof solution to construction site accidents, but it will go a long way towards separating the responsibility for safety on the site from the need for constant monitoring and independent checking, and it will instill greater confidence in our construction industry, if such a measure is put in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe such a measure is justifiable, especially as construction projects in Singapore are increasing in complexity and, if the concern is that such&nbsp;a cost might impair the competitiveness of our contractors, this cost can be a very discrete fixed cost added on to any tender project called for by the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point I wish to focus on is the tender process.&nbsp; I think the Government tender process is a much maligned process, and some at least have argued that&nbsp;the practice of awarding the tender to the lowest tenderer, unless there are other compelling reasons, leads to a vicious downward spiral in destructive competition and safety standards.&nbsp; My own view is that we should not be in a hurry to throw the baby out with the bath water, simply because I am not convinced that there is a better system to what we already have in the Government tender process.&nbsp; But I agree with my parliamentary colleagues that we need to make sure that we get value for money and not the cheapest price necessarily.&nbsp; And we need <p align=left>Column: 3038<p>to adapt the criteria and the methodology of our tender system to take into account some of these issues that we think are significant enough but they are not necessarily price factors.&nbsp; One example is the point that Dr Teo raised earlier:&nbsp; how do we explicitly deal with the issue of the outlier, ie, the unduly or signficantly low tenderer who may be 10-20% lower in his bid compared to the rest?&nbsp; How do we ensure that that price is not unrealistic and likely to lead to greater problems during the construction process?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is: how can we incorporate the safety records of the contractor and&nbsp;his safety plan, if you will, for the construction project as a criterion in the award of the contract?&nbsp; Sir, I welcome the announcement that there will be incentive payments for a good safety record during a construction period.&nbsp; But it seems to me that that is after the fact.&nbsp; What we really need to do also is to ensure that, prior to the award of a tender, we do the best we can to ensure that the party who wins the tender is one who is well equipped, both by virtue of experience and his plan for the project, to ensure the highest standards of safety on the site.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third and final point I wish to raise is on the issue of the safety of buildings and other infrastructure in the vicinity of construction sites and, in particular, we are talking about deep tunnelling works, say, for example, in the context of the MRT projects and so on.&nbsp; These days it is not uncommon for residents or owners of buildings to see cracks in their walls when construction activity occurs in their vicinity.&nbsp; They are usually reassured by being told, after an inspection, that: "These are not structural problems, so do not worry about it.&nbsp; These cracks will not cause&nbsp;any serious damage to your building."&nbsp; However, in the light of&nbsp;incidents like the Nicoll Highway accident, it has clearly raised greater doubts in the minds of residents.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3039<p>They are more concerned: can they really feel safe?&nbsp; So, I think there is a need to undertake not just a PR campaign but something that should become part of the protocol of any major construction activity that BCA and other agencies undertake regular inspections of all buildings in the vicinity, submit a report and inform the owners of these buildings and their residents of their regular findings.&nbsp; I think this is an important way to just build confidence, and we see that it has economic consequences as well, for example, for those in the Golden Mile Complex and so on.&nbsp; What we need to ensure is that the public at large, and in particular those who live or work within the vicinity of certain construction sites, are reassured that it is safe and that their safety and the safety of their buildings are being regularly monitored.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the motion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.07 pm</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, many Members of this House have spoken on the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin, Ms Irene Ng, Dr Amy Khor and others&nbsp;have all raised very important issues related to current safety standards and practices in the construction workplace.&nbsp; They are concerned about workers' safety and the stability of buildings in the vicinity of projects with deep excavation works like the Circle Line MRT project.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say that I share their concerns.&nbsp; I was very much saddened by the tragic and unnecessary loss of six lives in the recent construction site accidents at Nicoll Highway and Ayer Rajah.&nbsp; We need to know why these accidents happened and we need to know what we can do to prevent them from happening again.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our regulatory framework for construction safety encompasses a whole<p align=left>Column: 3040<p> series of checks and balances covering the whole construction process.&nbsp; There are two key pieces of legislation governing the framework.&nbsp; One is the Building Control Act and the other is the Factories Act.&nbsp; BCA, under the purview of the Ministry of National Development, administers the Building Control Act, while the Ministry of Manpower administers the Factories Act.&nbsp; The Circle Line, which includes the Nicoll Highway site, is developed by LTA, which is under the Ministry of Transport, and the LTA's Building Control Unit has been authorised to carry out building control functions on these projects on behalf of BCA.&nbsp; So, I will explain this arrangement in more detail later on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This regulatory framework, which involves several parties, requires each agency to exercise its responsibilities with due diligence, drawing upon its own area of expertise and at different stages of the construction process.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the plan submission stage, BCA plays a role.&nbsp; BCA is the regulatory authority on building and construction.&nbsp; It has the responsibility to ensure that our physical infrastructure and buildings are designed and constructed safely.&nbsp; In line with this, BCA administers and enforces the regulatory framework for construction safety, as well as our laws on building control.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the design stage, a qualified person, or what we call the QP, who is either the registered engineering or architectural professional, designs and certifies the project plans.&nbsp; These plans are then checked and endorsed by an accredited checker (AC), before submission to BCA for approval.&nbsp; The AC is independent of the project team and he is usually a senior member of the engineering profession and he is accredited by BCA to fulfill this role.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3041<p> Next comes the construction stage.&nbsp; The contractor can only commence construction works after the structural design plans have been approved and a permit to commence work has been issued by BCA.&nbsp; For deep excavation works - and these are works which involve excavations of at least four metres in depth - BCA imposes additional safety conditions in the permit to commence work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, BCA requires that the temporary works must be designed and certified by a professional engineer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, before excavation commences, the contractor has to carry out a pre-construction survey of the adjacent buildings to determine their condition.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the qualified professional or QP for the project is required to state the allowable limits of ground movements to prevent damage to the surrounding buildings, and thereafter to submit the monitoring plan for such movements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo, in his Question for Oral Answer, asked how many such works there are.&nbsp; I wish to inform him that currently there are 17 public sector projects that entail deep underground works exceeding 15 metres in depth.&nbsp; These comprise LTA's 11 Circle Line projects as well as four Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway projects,&nbsp;JTC's Fusionpolis project, and PUB's Deep Tunnel Sewerage System project.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During construction, BCA conducts regular random checks on construction sites, and it can revoke the permits, if construction works pose a danger to people or cause damage to the adjacent buildings.&nbsp; Last year, BCA revoked 20 such permits.&nbsp; And work will not be allowed to resume until the deficiencies are rectified and adequate safety measures are put in place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3042<p> Since 1995, BCA has authorised the Building Control Units (BCUs) of three statutory boards, ie, LTA, JTC and HDB, to carry out building control functions for projects under their respective purview.&nbsp; This includes issuing of the permit to commence work</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

This delegation of function is to enable the respective statutory boards to have better control over the implementation of the extensive development and building programmes.&nbsp; The BCUs, over the years, have built up a pool of competent professionals and they have established internal quality control mechanisms to effectively regulate the projects under their purview.&nbsp; However, BCA continues to exercise supervisory control on how these BCUs discharge their authorised functions.&nbsp; So while BCA delegates the authority, it does not delegate the final responsibility.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about MOM's role?&nbsp; As part of the overall regulatory framework, the Ministry of Manpower also has parallel provisions under the Factories Act to ensure workers' safety at construction sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; These safety provisions cover the construction of various temporary works, such as scaffoldings, formwork&nbsp;shoring, tunnelling and excavation works.&nbsp; My colleague, the Acting Minister for Manpower, will elaborate on these measures later on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several MPs - Dr Teo, Ms Irene Ng, Dr Amy Khor - have asked if the Government is going to review the safety standards at construction worksites. The answer is yes.&nbsp; My Ministry and the Ministry of Manpower will set up a joint committee to review the current regulatory framework on construction safety. This committee will be tasked to identify any contributory factors that may hinder safe practices in the industry and the possible weaknesses and gaps in our systems and processes, no matter how well&nbsp;they may have served us. The review<p align=left>Column: 3043<p> will cover the regulatory responsibilities of BCA and MOM and the safety provisions under the current legislative framework, including those pertaining to temporary works.&nbsp; The committee will also consider Dr Teo's proposal of having BCA as a one-stop service to coordinate deep excavation and tunnelling works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The roles of all the contracting parties in the industry, including the professionals, as well as the procurement and administrative systems, will also be examined, with a view to enhancing construction safety.&nbsp; Finally, the committee will look at the delegation of building control functions by BCA to the BCUs and see how this relationship can be improved.&nbsp; In carrying out the review, the joint committee will take into account the findings and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry on the Nicoll Highway incident.&nbsp; Let me assure this House that we will do whatever is necessary to enhance construction and safety to prevent mishaps and loss of lives.&nbsp; We will strengthen the existing regulatory framework wherever it is found wanting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me emphasise that a strong regulatory framework alone is not enough.&nbsp; I agree with Dr Teo that construction safety is the responsibility of all the stakeholders involved - the Government, developers, professionals, contractors, sub-contractors, supervisors and&nbsp;workers.&nbsp; For instance, after the Hotel New World collapse, we implemented an Accredited Checker (AC) system.&nbsp; But despite the AC system, in 1999, a roof under construction at Compassvale Primary School collapsed.&nbsp;The cause was subsequently found to be&nbsp; negligence on the part&nbsp;of both the AC and the QP.&nbsp; Both were convicted under the Building Control Act and they have&nbsp;paid a price for their negligence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3044<p> So there must be a sense of professionalism and an appreciation and&nbsp;awareness of safety, what Dr Teo called a safety culture.&nbsp; This safety culture must be in each and every individual at every step of the construction process.&nbsp; The public has placed&nbsp;significant trust and confidence on building professionals to ensure safe construction practices.&nbsp; Good ethical practices and high moral standards should prevail over commercial interest. Architects, engineers and contractors must perform their professional and contractual duties with due care and diligence&nbsp;and prime regard to safety.&nbsp; If they do not, they must face the full force of the law.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on other related issues of concern to Members, starting with BCA's role in the Nicoll Highway incident.&nbsp; Following the Nicoll Highway incident, LTA stopped work at all the Circle Line worksites on the advice of BCA.&nbsp; BCA is currently conducting an audit of the design and construction relating to excavation at these sites.&nbsp; In this audit, BCA will direct the professional engineers involved to review their design of temporary works at all the sites. LTA's BCU has also been asked to go through all submissions by project parties to ensure that they are in order.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concurrently, BCA engineers are checking through the documentation and monitoring records of all the Circle Line projects for compliance.&nbsp; BCA is also appraising the various safety aspects of the excavation works. This involves presentations by LTA's project teams on the design of temporary works, on the construction methods, as well as on the safety measures.&nbsp; BCA engineers are conducting site visits to verify that temporary support and monitoring measures are in place.&nbsp; BCA will only allow work to resume when it is satisfied that this is so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3045<p> So far,&nbsp; BCA has audited and approved four Circle Line worksites to resume. Another 12 sites are still being reviewed and will be progressively allowed to resume work as and when BCA is satisfied with the safety aspects of the sites.&nbsp; After the resumption of work, LTA and the project parties are required to continue monitoring and supervising the works to ensure safety.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the issue of safety checks on buildings. Mr Steve Chia, in his Question for Oral Answer, wanted to know why safety checks on the buildings along the Circle Line were not done earlier, but had to wait until the Nicoll Highway collapsed.&nbsp; I wish to inform the Member that he is wrong to assume that this was the case.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before construction works commenced, LTA had required the contractor to carry out a pre-construction survey of surrounding buildings.&nbsp; As I informed the House, this is part and parcel of the process required before permit to commence work is issued.&nbsp; After the start of the project, LTA's BCU, in response to feedback received from the occupants, had checked and rectified affected buildings near the Circle Line construction sites.&nbsp; In the immediate aftermath of the Nicoll Highway incident, BCA and LTA undertook another round of safety checks of buildings within a 100-metre radius of the Circle Line construction.&nbsp; Why 100 metres?&nbsp; BCA took into account factors such as the type of construction works, the type of buildings in the vicinity, whether or not they were built on piles and also on the ground condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engineers from BCA, LTA and the contractors carried out the inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cracks and defects, if any, were assessed on whether they were structural in nature and could affect the stability of the buildings. Further remedial measures, if needed, were then carried out.&nbsp;&nbsp;For buildings that are found to be stable, LTA <p align=left>Column: 3046<p>will issue a letter and the PE certification to the owner.&nbsp; So&nbsp;regarding Mr Iswaran's concern that owners would need to be reassured,&nbsp;this step would help in&nbsp;reassuring the owners.&nbsp; For buildings that require structural repairs, BCA will issue an order to close them and the occupants will have to vacate their premises.&nbsp; So far, 588 buildings in the vicinity of the Circle Line sites had been inspected and found to be structurally stable. Two vacant buildings at the Paya Lebar/Upper Paya Lebar areas were assessed to require structural repairs. They were declared unsafe and closed by BCA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I come now to the question of the tender system. There has been a lot of speculation about the causes of the Nicoll Highway and Ayer Rajah accidents.&nbsp; One common comment, which was highlighted by Ms Irene Ng and Dr Amy Khor, is that the public sector projects, because they are always awarded to the lowest bidder, carry this risk that contractors are forced to compromise on safety measures in order to save costs and to remain viable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as I have said several times, it is not correct and&nbsp;premature for us to comment or to link any causes at this stage to the two incidents because a Committee of Inquiry has been set up.&nbsp; But it is important for me to set the record straight on the public sector procurement system which, as Dr Amy Khor mentioned, is a popular "whipping boy".&nbsp; In fact, it is a popular "whipping boy" for many ills in the industry, ranging from accidents to contractors going belly up to everything else that we can name.&nbsp; But I want to say once again in this House that the Government does not require agencies to award tenders to the lowest bidders.&nbsp; The tender process requires the agencies to review all the tenders submitted to make sure that the contract is awarded to the contractor who meets all the criteria,&nbsp;which gives the best value for money in terms of quality and performance and who is able to complete the works.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3047<p>Over the last 12 months,&nbsp;during the last financial year from April 2003 to March 2004, 37% of all public sector construction contracts were not awarded to the lowest bidder, in other words, more than one-third.&nbsp; Yes, this means that two-thirds were awarded to the lowest bidder.&nbsp; But what does that prove?&nbsp; Would it require all awards to be not given to the lowest bidder before we say that the procurement system is fair?&nbsp; Surely it cannot be.&nbsp; One-third of the contracts were not awarded to the lowest bidder.&nbsp; Why? One reason could be&nbsp;that there are doubts on the ability of these lowest bids to successfully complete the project based on their financial strength, or based on the fact that the bids that they have put in are unrealistically low.&nbsp; Another reason is that their proposals do not meet the tender specifications, whether in their method of construction or&nbsp;in their design.&nbsp; Their design could be inappropriate or unsafe or their method of construction could be deemed unsafe.&nbsp; So for all these reasons, the public sector agenices have deemed it not possible to award one-third of the contracts to the lowest bidder.&nbsp; This reflects an awareness among the public sector procurement agencies that they just cannot simply go for price alone and that there are many other factors involved.&nbsp; Having said that, as I have explained earlier, we will still require the joint committee to&nbsp;include this in their terms of reference&nbsp;and&nbsp;go through the tender process again and reiterate, if necessary, the importance of making sure that safety is not compromised.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, many Members have voiced concern, both in this House and at other times, that contractors may be selected without due regard to their safety record.&nbsp; Let me inform the House there is a system of pre-qualification in order to make sure that contractors that do not meet safety records are not allowed to even bid for <p align=left>Column: 3048<p>public sector projects.&nbsp; Under the Contractors Registry System (CRS) that BCA operates, contractors have to be registered and they have to be pre-qualified. The CRS has stringent criteria on safety performance and technical competence</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>  	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>as well as management and financial capability.&nbsp; Contractors without good safety records are barred from&nbsp;tendering for public sector projects.&nbsp; They do not even get past the first stage.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCA will be introducing additional safety criteria that would require some of the higher qualified&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;A1 and A2&nbsp; -&nbsp; contractors to be certified through the Occupational Health and Safety Audit System (OHSAS) 18001, and this will be with effect from July this year.&nbsp; What this means is that our top tier construction companies will have in&nbsp; place a more systematic framework to implement workers' safety and to enhance safety and health measures at construction sites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, of course, in addition to the CRS criteria, each individual agency specifies additional pre-qualifying criteria for their own projects, especially for complex projects like airports, MRTs, hospitals, defence projects and so on.&nbsp; All these different checks and&nbsp;safety criteria help to ensure that only technically and financially competent contractors can undertake them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are concerns also that it may not be the main contractor that may be the culprit.&nbsp; What about all the sub-contractors?&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng made this point about the dangers of sub-standard work being undertaken by sub-contractors.&nbsp; I would like to inform her that under the public sector conditions of contract, the supervisor in question has to approve the main contractor's choice of sub-contractors. Again, this is another level of check to make sure that only capable and reliable sub-contractors can undertake the jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3049<p> Having said all that, I come back to the point that I made earlier&nbsp; -&nbsp; that we can have these systems in place, we can have the checks, but at the end of the day, there are many other parties&nbsp;in the chain that also need to play their part.&nbsp; And this comes back to Dr Teo's point about how we&nbsp;must imbibe and inculcate this safety culture in the whole construction industry, all the way from the top to the bottom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, let me say that these two recent accidents are wake-up calls for all of us in the industry.&nbsp; We cannot take safety for granted.&nbsp; This is a joint responsibility of all the parties involved&nbsp; -&nbsp; the regulators,&nbsp;developers, contractors and&nbsp;the workers.&nbsp; Let us heed this call and work together to further strengthen safety in construction worksites, because lives are at stake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Members have spoken on the need to protect the safety of workers.&nbsp; I would like to assure the House and Members that MOM shares the same concern.&nbsp; My colleague, the Minister for National Development, has touched on a number of aspects.&nbsp; Sir, allow me to address certain issues as important questions have arisen from these two construction-related accidents at Nicoll Highway and Fusionpolis.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first question is:&nbsp; are our safety standards slipping?&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have the figures distributed&nbsp;by MOM.&nbsp; Let&nbsp;me clarify these figures and give Members the objective assessment.&nbsp; I think it is important for us to objectively assess where our safety standards are, so that we will know how to improve, how we have been doing and also not make sudden corrective measures for a system that may have served us well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The internationally accepted norm that different countries use in comparing<p align=left>Column: 3050<p> safety standards is the number of accidents or fatalities over those at risk,&nbsp;and those at risk are the number of workers working.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor says, let us relate it to the construction projects.&nbsp; But in a place with a very productive construction industry, they may just use less workers.&nbsp; So those at risk are the number of workers and that is expressed in man million hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The short answer, in terms of whether our safety standards are slipping, is no for both overall numbers as well as those arising within the construction industry.&nbsp; The Clerk of Parliament has circulated these figures.&nbsp; The overall number has been coming down&nbsp;from 1997 when there were 4,422 cases to about 3,200 cases last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the construction industry, Members will note that the number of accidents has been more or less constant, but the number of fatal accidents has fallen by more than half when comparing 1993 to 2003.&nbsp; There were 72 deaths in 1997 and 31 in 2003, or 0.3 fatal accidents per 1,000 employees in 1997 compared to 0.2 in 2003.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know the data.&nbsp; How do we compare internationally?&nbsp; Dr Teo mentioned certain countries that we should emulate&nbsp; -&nbsp; Japan, UK.&nbsp; Based on our data published and compared with those published by the International Labour Organisation, Singapore's safety record as measured by the number of fatal accidents is comparable to that of the USA, France and Canada, but we lag behind the United Kingdom and Sweden.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this assessment is important because it helps us conclude that our safety standards have improved over the years and are comparable with those of other developed countries.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I agree with Members that each life lost which could have been prevented if appropriate measures had been followed<p align=left>Column: 3051<p> is one too many.&nbsp; This was the sentiment expressed by all Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have seen from these two recent accidents, each life lost deprives one family of a husband, a breadwinner, a son, a brother, a friend.&nbsp; The social and economic costs are indeed high.&nbsp; And as Members say, they are wake-up calls.&nbsp; Mr Iswaran said that we should sharpen our focus and we should put safety first.&nbsp; But we all recognise that to save lives requires more than wishes and committees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin says that a safety culture must be pervasive and permeate every level from the developer down to the least skilled worker in the workplace.&nbsp; That is what we must achieve in order to improve our safety standards.&nbsp; Yes, we have been working with our tripartite partners, as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has mentioned, and we can do more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How then can we institute such a culture and improve safety performance for workers where everyone feels that it is his responsibility and it is something that he can do?&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor said that we should be proactive rather than be reactive.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; Our present approach to ensuring workplace safety rests on three strategic prongs&nbsp; -&nbsp; first, tough laws and harsh penalties; second, effective enforcement; and, third, facilitated self-regulation by management.&nbsp; These three platforms&nbsp;are still sound and have served us well and we will continue to use them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I agree with Members that while strict penalties through legislation and tough enforcement measures send the right signal, they are often measures which are applied after the accident has occurred, like now.&nbsp; When accidents occur, we say let us enforce them.&nbsp; To prevent accidents and deaths, we must facilitate and even coerce industries to self-regulate and implement effective <p align=left>Column: 3052<p>safety and health programmes to ensure a safe place for work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the Factories Act prescribes a framework of self-regulation by industries.&nbsp; For example, factories employing 50 or more workers are required to form safety committees.&nbsp; Larger factories in the more hazardous industries are required to employ safety officers.&nbsp; And these safety officers need to have tertiary education in a technical discipline and successfully completed the Safety Officers' Training Course.&nbsp; They also have to be registered with the Chief Inspector of Factories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1994, construction projects with contract sum of $10 million or more are required to implement an audit on their safety management systems.&nbsp; Safety officers are required, as are site safety supervisors for the main contractors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng asked whether these measures are applicable to sub-contractors.&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; For example, sub-contractors employing more than 20 persons are required to appoint a safety supervisor to promote the safe conduct of work within the worksites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the contract sum of the work is $30 million or more, they are required to appoint an independent external auditor to audit its safety management system once every six months.&nbsp; This was the point that was brought up correctly by Dr Amy Khor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1997, &nbsp;safety provisions have also been included in the contractual agreement between developers and contractors.&nbsp; This is to ensure that contractors understand their responsibility for ensuring worksite safety.&nbsp; And contractors are required to produce such documents when they apply for factory registration of their worksites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about training and awareness&nbsp; -&nbsp; a point that was highlighted by Ms Irene<p align=left>Column: 3053<p>Ng?&nbsp; Since 2001, it has been mandatory for project managers of worksites, formwork supervisors and lifting supervisors to attend occupational safety and health (OSH)&nbsp;courses.&nbsp; All construction workers are required to attend safety orientation courses to equip them with knowledge on common hazards at the worksites and the preventive measures. Yes, we do speak to them in their vernacular.&nbsp; These courses are conducted in six languages which include Bangladesh and Thai languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry, in collaboration with the Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL) and professional bodies, also organises regular safety seminars and other&nbsp;OSH promotional activities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take Members' point that the framework is in place, including the framework of self-regulation.&nbsp; But unless we have in place stiff penalties and strict enforcement to promote compliance, it will come to naught.&nbsp; A number of Members have asked, including Mr Iswaran, Dr Teo, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, whether our penalties are adequate.&nbsp; At present, the Factories Act provides for a maximum penalty of $200,000 and/or one year imprisonment for any contravention that resulted in the death of two or more persons.&nbsp; And this includes the occupier and the employers.&nbsp; So those higher up in the chain are liable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked the same question after these accidents whether we should enhance it.&nbsp; We did a comparative study of the penalties for OSH contraventions, and that study indicates that our prescribed maximum penalties are already amongst the highest in the region.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I agree with Members and we will review what else needs to be done, whether it is necessary to stiffen penalties or to enforce more strictly to bring us closer to the safety standards of the United Kingdom and Sweden, and this will be in the terms of reference for the joint <p align=left>Column: 3054<p>committee that my colleague, the Minister for Natrional Development has announced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked what can we do and how else can we facilitate.&nbsp; The Chief Inspector of Factories can issue stop work orders and fine errant factory occupiers and contractors who carry out work without due consideration for workers' safety.&nbsp; Have we enforced it?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Last year, 13 construction worksites and three factories were ordered to stop work.&nbsp; Repeat offenders are subject to twice the quantum of fines provided for under the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the construction industry in particular, there is a debarment scheme.&nbsp; This is the point alluded to by Dr Teo when he talked about performance based aspects.&nbsp; This debarment scheme has been&nbsp;in force&nbsp;since April 2000.&nbsp; Under this scheme, contractors who flout safety requirements are given demerit points, on top of the usual fine and stop work order.&nbsp; In other words, it is meant to be economically punitive.&nbsp; A contractor who accumulates more than 30 demerit points within a 12-month period would be issued with&nbsp;a warning.&nbsp; Further accumulation of more than 24 demerit points within a 12-month period following the warning will result in the contractor being debarred from employing foreign workers for 12 months.&nbsp; A total of 24 contractors have been warned to date, of which three have been debarred since the scheme was implemented.&nbsp; In other words, it effectively removes his workers from him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has recently revised the scheme to lower the demerit points, as suggested by Dr Amy Khor, from 30 to 24 points when&nbsp;a warning will be issued.&nbsp; This will take effect from 1st July 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM carries out strict enforcement to check on compliance of the provisions of the Factories Act by occupiers of factories and main contractors of worksites.&nbsp; Last year, MOM's factory inspectors carried<p align=left>Column: 3055<p> out a total of 17,000</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

MOM's basic three-pronged approach to ensuring occupational safety is sound.&nbsp; But to improve our safety performance, our legislation may need to be enhanced.&nbsp; I agree with Members.&nbsp; Industry needs to be willing to spend money, resources and effort to put in place safety checks.&nbsp; Industry must upgrade their management capabilities and skill of workers.&nbsp; Poor worksite management and unskilled workers are potent combinations begging for accidents to happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo, as well as other Members, including Dr Amy Khor, has asked for an integrated approach to this review.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has agreed, together with MOM, to conduct such a review that will cover the entire value chain of construction.&nbsp; He has already mentioned the areas.&nbsp; I would also like to add that we will review whether, as some have said, to increase the accountability of people along the chain as well as whether we need to enhance the penalties or&nbsp;increase the enforcement of the penalties already provided.&nbsp; We will incorporate the findings and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry related to the Nicoll Highway, when completed.&nbsp; MOM will also, as co-chair of this review committee, review the legislation and study the best practices of developed countries, including those of the UK and Japan, as Dr Teo Ho Pin has mentioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM had intended to expand the coverage of the occupational safety <p align=left>Column: 3056<p>requirements to more workplaces - a point brought up by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang who has been pushing this for a number of years - through a new legislation.&nbsp; This will be called the Workplace Safety and Health Act.&nbsp; We will use this opportunity to incorporate recommendations from the review of the construction industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me reiterate what my colleague, the Minister for National Development, said.&nbsp; Construction safety is the responsibility of all of us - Government, developers, professionals, contractors, management, and workers.&nbsp; We will work together with all parties to enhance worker safety and reduce the loss of lives.&nbsp; I have asked staff in MOM in this review to aim to reduce the number of fatal accidents by one-third over the next five years.&nbsp; This will place us among the leading countries in safety standards.&nbsp; It is an achievable goal and worth the extra effort.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B> Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Ms Irene Ng and Dr Amy Khor have raised several issues related to LTA's safety procedures in the construction of rail and road projects.&nbsp; I would therefore like to take this opportunity to address the issues raised.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, both Minister Mah and Acting Minister Ng, as well as Dr Teo, have pointed out that safety is the responsibility of all stakeholders - Government, developers, contractors, architects, engineers, workers, and so on.&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that LTA, as the developer and&nbsp;regulator, takes this responsibility very seriously, from the conceptualisation stage of a new project all the way to its completion.&nbsp; In order to understand how safety is assured in LTA's projects, we would need to first understand LTA's project development process.&nbsp; And this process consists of four stages - planning, tender stage, design and construction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3057<p> First, the planning and pre-tender stage.&nbsp; Sir, at this stage, the route of the MRT line is decided in consultation with the relevant agencies, such as URA and HDB.&nbsp; Thereafter, LTA undertakes an engineering evaluation to identify the best alignment from the engineering perspective.&nbsp; Various investigations are carried out to gather accurate information on the ground conditions and the buildings along the route where construction will take place.&nbsp; These investigations include soil investigation, building foundation assessment, trial trenching to identify locations of public utilities and services, survey of surrounding buildings, and preliminary design and risk assessment.&nbsp; The objective of this entire process is to gather information that will provide a better understanding of the site conditions.&nbsp; LTA can then identify the measures needed to reduce the risk factors to an acceptable level and to incorporate them into the tender document.&nbsp; This, in turn, enables the tenderers to provide a realistic bid for the project, based on an appropriate construction method that takes into account local site conditions and the potential problems that they are likely to face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the tender stage.&nbsp; Prior to calling tenders for the major projects, LTA has a process to pre-qualify contractors based on their track record.&nbsp; The four major factors considered are: financial capability, technical expertise, project management capability, as well as quality and safety management capability.&nbsp; This is to ensure that whoever wins the contract has the resources, the technical expertise and experience to deliver the project on time without compromising on safety.&nbsp; During the tender stage, technical and commercial evaluations are carried out by two separate committees.&nbsp; So, in a way, it is similar to what Dr Amy Khor has pointed out, the two-envelope process.&nbsp; Here, they do it through two committees.&nbsp; The technical sub-committee<p align=left>Column: 3058<p> evaluates the contractors' technical competence, the design proposal (since this is a design-and-build project), the construction methodology,&nbsp;the safety measures, the construction programme and other electrical and mechanical coordination considerations.&nbsp; The commercial sub-committee separately will look at pricing, qualifications on the contract terms and the financial capability of the tenderers.&nbsp; Evaluation by the two sub-committees typically takes about four months, and I can assure Dr Amy Khor that, therefore, it is not a rush job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked why was the Nicoll Highway project awarded to Nishimatsu-Lum Chang, despite a price difference of $70 million; what is the&nbsp;compelling reason.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the tender for contract C824 was awarded in June 2001, and this contract involves the design, construction and completion of the Nicoll Highway and the Boulevard Stations, which include the cut-and-cover and bored tunnels.&nbsp; As pointed out by Dr Teo, six contractors submitted bids.&nbsp; The two separate committees carried out&nbsp;a detailed evaluation on the three lowest complying bids after a preliminary evaluation of all the six tenders.&nbsp; The evaluation showed that the proposal submitted by Nishimatsu-Lum Chang was technically either equal to or better in various aspects when compared with the second and third lowest bids.&nbsp; The company also met LTA's financial criteria of having a net worth of at least 20% of the expected contract value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo asked how did the winning bid compare with the estimate made by LTA.&nbsp; As Dr Teo knows, for all these big projects, LTA has the responsibility to carry out an estimate of the project cost so that we can get the budget for it.&nbsp; I think LTA has a proven track record on its estimates because, quite often, we are able to complete the project either at budget or even below budget.&nbsp; In this <p align=left>Column: 3059<p>case, the tender price submitted by the winning consortium was slightly higher than LTA's pre-tender estimate.&nbsp;And, therefore, I think it was only logical for the award to be given to Nishimatsu-Lum Chang.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as indicated by the Minister for National Development earlier, not all of LTA's projects were awarded to the lowest tenderers.&nbsp; In fact, 27% of its major road and rail projects were not awarded to the lowest tenderers.&nbsp; Examples of these include the construction of the Hougang, Kovan, Little India, Farrer Park and the Harbour Front stations, along the recently completed Northeast Line.&nbsp; Hence, the tender evaluation process clearly is not driven solely by cost considerations but is based on the best value for money, and that safety is not compromised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the design stage.&nbsp; The focus on safety is also evident at the design stage.&nbsp; For design-and-build contracts, following the award of a contract, the contractors are then required to develop their designs, based on the concepts and approaches proposed in the tender.&nbsp; In addition, the contractors are required to carry out a detailed assessment of the risk factors to ensure that all potential risks in the project are properly addressed before construction commences on the site.&nbsp; This risk assessment takes into account measures to protect nearby buildings, protection of public utilities, instrumentation requirements and the method of construction.&nbsp; To advise and assist LTA on underground construction works, LTA has also engaged a high-level review board comprising internationally renowned experts and professionals in the field of deep underground construction work.&nbsp; The board reviews the adequacy of the contractors' technical proposals and, where necessary, makes recommen<p align=left>Column: 3060<p>dations to improve the design, safety and construction method.&nbsp; I think this emphasis on safety, right from the conceptualisation and design stage, is fully in line with what Dr Teo has stressed in his remarks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to the construction stage.&nbsp; Apart from the safety considerations at the tender and design stages, LTA also ensures that the emphasis on safety is maintained during the construction stage.&nbsp; At this stage, LTA works closely with the contractor on site to ensure that the construction works are implemented safely, in line with the proposals and programme, and more than comply with the requirements under the Factories Act.&nbsp; LTA has a system of checks and inspections to ensure that the engineering designs and plans are accurately transmitted down to the construction team.&nbsp; I think this is again what Dr Amy Khor has alluded to, that while the senior people (engineers and others) may have everything in hand, the line managers and others&nbsp;need to be also properly informed.&nbsp; So, this ensures that the information is transmitted down and that the project is constructed according to the specifications and designs.&nbsp; The contractors are also required to brief their workers on a daily basis on the workplan for the day and the key safety factors to be complied with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at this stage, let me address Dr Amy Khor's question.&nbsp; She asked who is responsible for safety at the MRT construction sites as well as the design and safety of the temporary works at these sites.&nbsp; Dr Teo has also asked if the design of the temporary works is independently checked by LTA.&nbsp; As this is a design-and-build project, the main contractor of the project is responsible for the design of temporary works at the MRT construction sites.&nbsp; But, notwithstanding this, LTA does review the design for acceptance.&nbsp; He also asked about the safety factors for the temporary <p align=left>Column: 3061<p>works.&nbsp; Sir, I do not have the information with me, but I would expect that the contractors,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>engineers and LTA&nbsp;to have adopted internationally accepted safety standards.&nbsp; In any case, this would be looked at by the Committee of Inquiry as well.&nbsp; Sir, I think we will leave it to them to investigate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where safety is concerned, under the Factories Act, the main contractor of the project is responsible for safety at the construction site.&nbsp; So I shall not go into the details, since the requirements under the Factories Act have been addressed by the Acting Minister for Manpower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as I mentioned just now, LTA has various safety measures over and above what are required of the contractors under the Factories Act.&nbsp; Let me describe three of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, LTA's practice is to incorporate more stringent requirements&nbsp;in its contract documents because of the complex nature of its projects.&nbsp; LTA firmly subscribes to the safety first philosophy and works to achieve this with its contractors.&nbsp; For example, LTA requires the contractors to conduct in-house safety induction course for all workers before they are allowed on site to familiarise them with the hazards specific to their assigned scope of work.&nbsp; All contractors are required to submit to LTA method statements, outlining the work and safety procedures together with the assessment of the construction risks before they can proceed with critical work on site.&nbsp; This ensures that the contractors have given due consideration to the safety of the work&nbsp;scheduled to be done.&nbsp; There is another example.&nbsp; LTA requires the contractor to inspect the cranes every six months, instead of yearly, under the Factories Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, secondly, LTA has put in place an Occupational Safety and Health Management manual (OSHM manual) and the project Quality Management System (QMS).&nbsp; The OSHM manual and the QMS <p align=left>Column: 3062<p>stipulate key safety programmes and work processes for compliance by its staff.&nbsp; The OSHM manual also stipulates that the risk management process must be performed at various stages of the project, ie, at the concept design, detailed design and construction stages.&nbsp; The objective is to record all identified potential hazards and to track the mitigating measures to eliminate or to reduce these hazards to an acceptable level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, LTA conducts regular safety exercises on sites, on various issues or themes, such as working at heights, preventing objects from dropping, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on Dr Amy Khor's question on the availability of contingency and evacuation plans, I would like to inform Members that all contractors are required to have emergency response and evacuation plans at all worksites, as part of their safety management system.&nbsp; The plans set out the procedures, communications and response sequences in emergencies.&nbsp; The contractors are required to instruct their workers on the procedures and to regularly conduct evacuation drills to familiarise them with the evacuation procedures.&nbsp; And periodically, LTA, Police,&nbsp;SCDF and other agencies are also invited to participate in simulated exercises to test the robustness of the emergency plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA does check to make sure that the contractors have the emergency plans properly drawn up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng&nbsp;raised concerns over why LTA did not act on the feedback from the workers on the safety on the site.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to assure her&nbsp;that LTA has in place a system for monitoring the progress of its projects and for escalating issues, such as those relating to safety, to the appropriate level of management for resolution.&nbsp; In the case of the Circle Line Stage 1 project, which is where the incident site is, the Project Director and <p align=left>Column: 3063<p>the Senior Project Manager are assisted by Project Managers assigned to each contract under the Circle Line Phase I.&nbsp; And there are two projects there, one of which was given to Nishimatsu-Lum Chang.&nbsp; The Project Manager is, in turn, supported by three teams of engineers covering design, site supervision and contractual issues.&nbsp; These engineers conduct regular inspections on site safety and the work progress and ensure that the works complied with contractual and statutory requirements.&nbsp; Any shortcomings of non-compliance are highlighted to the contractors for rectification.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contractors and their supervisory staff can also contact the LTA Project Managers and engineers on any issue or problem that they encounter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, here, I would like to state that the Committee of Inquiry (COI) will be investigating into the events leading to the collapse of the Nicoll Highway tunnel, and I am sure that it will also inquire into whether there were adequate and timely communications between the contractors and&nbsp;LTA staff on the site prior to the collapse.&nbsp; As such, I think it is best for us to&nbsp;wait for the COI to complete its investigations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked if there&nbsp;is soil monitoring instrumentation in place.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to inform him that there are comprehensive steps of instrumentation, such as settlement markers, inclinometers, etc, installed at all the sites to monitor and supervise the works closely.&nbsp; In fact, I was told that there are over 10,000 instruments at the moment monitoring the current Circle Line works.&nbsp; Where necessary, issues, such as signs of distress observed on buildings or structures, can be escalated by&nbsp;LTA engineers on the site to senior management for attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3064<p>Ms Irene Ng also asked why LTA did not stop work at all the CCL sites immediately after the incident.&nbsp; Sir, I wish to clarify that LTA did issue a stop work order to Nishimatsu-Lum Chang, which is also working on the adjacent CCL contract, ie, the contract that covers the Old Airport Station to the Paya Lebar Station, the day after the Nicoll Highway Station incident.&nbsp; Immediately following the incident, LTA focused its attention on the areas of greatest risks which are those works which are done by the same contractor,&nbsp;and that is why it stopped the work there.&nbsp; As for the other parts of the CCL beyond Stage 1 of the project, the works were at a less advanced stage, as the contracts were awarded one to two years later after CCL Stage 1.&nbsp; For example, excavation works have hardly started for CCL Stage 3.&nbsp; As for CCL Stage 2 and the other contract in CCL Stage 1, excavation levels are much shallower than the incident site and the levels range from three metres to 17 metres compared to 27 metres and beyond at the incident site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the sites also employ different construction methods, for example, top-down, instead of the bottom-up, cut and cover method at the Nicoll Highway site, and they use contiguous bored piles and other piling methods, instead of the temporary diaphragm walls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as such, LTA felt that it was appropriate not to require the other contractors to stop work immediately.&nbsp; What it did was to conduct an immediate review of the works at all the other sites.&nbsp; Hence, LTA asked the contractors at the other sites to immediately review the designs of their temporary works to confirm that these are safe, to get the engineers to review them, and that they have been constructed according to design.&nbsp; The contractors were also asked to review all the instrumentation readings once more.&nbsp; But there continued to be significant public concerns about safety<p align=left>Column: 3065<p> around the MRT construction sites.&nbsp; I think this is understandable, given the severity of the Nicoll Highway incident.&nbsp; Hence, as an added precaution, together with BCA, LTA decided to impose a stop work order on all deep excavations for all the CCL sites.&nbsp; Jointly with BCA, LTA asked for a detailed review of the temporary works by the contractors involved.&nbsp; The review process is still ongoing with BCA and, as mentioned by Minister Mah, works on four stations have already been given clearance to restart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Members can see, the decisions made by LTA at each stage were carefully considered, based on its professional judgement and the accumulated experience from its many past projects.&nbsp; The decisions also took into account technical evaluations, such as the nature of the incident and the conditions under which it occurred and the varying nature of conditions and construction methods at the other CCL sites.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the House that safety has been and remains&nbsp;a top priority for LTA in its efforts to build a comprehensive road and rail network for Singapore.&nbsp; The Nicoll Highway incident serves as a painful reminder to all of us of the importance of safe practices and procedures.&nbsp; LTA has appointed its own committee to review the circumstances and factors leading to the collapse.&nbsp; It will study the findings of this committee as well as that of the Committee of Inquiry, and identify the measures and procedures that need to be tightened so that safety on its worksites can be further improved.&nbsp; I can therefore assure Members that LTA will continue to work closely with the relevant Government agencies and contractors to improve the safety standards in our construction industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me thank all Members and <p align=left>Column: 3066<p>also the three Ministers for speaking and&nbsp;supporting&nbsp;the motion.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, first of all, I agree with Ms Irene Ng that&nbsp;we need to review our tendering system.&nbsp; While Minister Mah has mentioned that 27% of the contracts were awarded not to the lowest bidder, the public agencies have the discretion not to award the contracts to the lowest tenderers.&nbsp; But the lowest tenderers have no choice to withdraw from their bids because there is a penalty system which would debar a contractor from withdrawing his tender bid.&nbsp; So we need to look into this system.&nbsp; Because if a contractor makes a bona fide mistake and if he cannot withdraw his tender bid, he would have to go along and be awarded the contract, and that would leave him with no choice but to cut corners in order to survive in the project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also support Ms Irene Ng's call to look into the check and balance system for temporary works design.&nbsp; It is important that temporary works must be regarded almost the same as permanent works, especially for underground construction works.&nbsp; Because when you remove soil from the ground, you need to provide certain support system and that support system must be of equal strength to the permanent structure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also support Ms Irene Ng's call on developing a safety culture in the industry.&nbsp; It is important, as all Members have mentioned, that we need to inculcate a sense of professionalism and a sense of responsibility for safety in the construction industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me respond to Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's defence of BATU.&nbsp; I want to clarify that actually I am aware that BATU is involved, together with the Ministry of&nbsp;Manpower and also the Singapore Contractors' Association, to develop a safety audit system called SC2.&nbsp; But my <p align=left>Column: 3067<p>question is whether&nbsp;BATU can be more proactive and develop its own audit system to protect the interest of its workers, instead of relying on the tripartite system where there is a conflict of interests between the employers and the workers and the association.&nbsp; In fact, this morning, I received a letter from a director&nbsp;of a safety audit firm.&nbsp; He mentioned that&nbsp;SCAL has incorporated a subsidiary known as Singapore Construction Safety and Consultancy Pte Ltd (SC2) to look into the various aspects of worker safety and health at construction sites.&nbsp; But he questions</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

So, I think it is important that we make sure that the safety of this system is independent.&nbsp; That is the reason why I called for the parties, such as the developers or the insurance companies, to look into it.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry will look into that.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Dr Amy Khor that there is a need to look into the safety audit on site.&nbsp; I think this has been mentioned quite a number of times.&nbsp; We really have to look at the whole CP79 and look at all the clauses and see whether they are comprehensive enough to provide a good safety system on site.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am indeed very glad to hear from the Ministers that they have agreed to set up a joint committee of&nbsp;the two Ministries, ie, MOM and MND, and that it will provide this integrated approach to look into the whole process and value chain of a construction project.&nbsp; I have mentioned before that&nbsp;safety in the&nbsp;construction site&nbsp;is the responsibility of all stakeholders, and it is important that every stakeholder in the value chain understands his roles and responsibilities and exercises those roles and responsibilities effectively for safety sake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3068<p>I am glad that Minister Mah has also responded that BCA will also act as a one-stop centre to coordinate construction works in Singapore.&nbsp; This is very important, because there are so many projects ongoing all over Singapore, and the repercussions of construction works, especially excavation works and tunnelling works have a lot of impact on the surroundings.&nbsp; This is a very good lesson which we have learnt from these two accidents.&nbsp; Having a centralised coordinating agency will help to minimise all these adverse consequences on the surrounding buildings and structures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,<p align=left>Column: 3069<p> I agree with Dr Ng that the 3-pronged approach adopted by MOM has been useful and effective to a certain extent to bring across the messages to the industry, ie, tough laws, strict enforcement and also to promote self-regulation among the various stakeholders.&nbsp; In terms of safety legislation, we are definitely above or on par with many developed countries.&nbsp; We have very strict safety legislation.&nbsp; There is no doubt about it.&nbsp; But&nbsp;in terms of enforcement - I can understand that we have 4,000 sites, and there will be more sites and projects - we need to have a sustainable system where the authorities can take enforcement action and also make sure there is a tracking system where enforcement is effective to enhance safety at construction sites.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to self-management, this is one area which requires a lot of efforts from all stakeholders in the industry.&nbsp; I still cannot feel the&nbsp;will-power among the various stakeholders to really develop a safety culture in the industry.&nbsp; The&nbsp;experience which I got from Japan, UK and even&nbsp;Australia is that their safety culture is really very, very strong, compared to the local construction industry.&nbsp; This is one area where we really need to focus our efforts on to see how we can develop a strong safety culture.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Dr Ng that prevention of accidents is the key.&nbsp; We should focus efforts upstream, to make sure that every effort is made to prevent accidents.&nbsp; If we get the design and all the legal framework right, we will avoid a lot of risks downstream during construction, and that will reduce safety hazards during construction and even during maintenance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am indeed very pleased to hear from Minister Yeo that LTA is very comprehensive and exercises due diligence in its 4-stage procedures when they implement their projects.&nbsp; It is important that we let the public know what is the process which LTA has gone through.&nbsp; LTA has exercised diligence in making sure that, even before construction, they have investigated the sites, surroundings, soil conditions, the impact of the proposed project on the surroundings and taken precautions to minimise those risks to property, people and the environment.&nbsp; That is important.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;very reassuring.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also mentioned before that safety is actually the responsibility of all stakeholders.&nbsp; I have made certain recommendations in my speech.&nbsp; I hope the joint committee will look into those suggestions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3070<p>Finally, I would like to assure all Singaporeans that this Government does not just talk.&nbsp; We will make every effort to make sure we provide a safe work culture and safe workplaces for all our workers in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That this House, noting the two recent construction-related accidents at Nicoll Highway and Ayer Rajah, urges the Government to (a) re-emphasise the importance of safety at workplaces in Singapore; (b) review current safety standards and practices; and (c) recommend appropriate measures, including legislative changes, to further enhance the safety of workers in the construction industry.</p></P></span></div><!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT--><p align=left>Column: 3070<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There are three types of dialysis: haemodialysis, CAPD (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) and APD (automated peritoneal dialysis).&nbsp; The cost differs among the service providers as it depends on the type of service and the level of care provided.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, the cost for haemodialysis ranges from about $1,300 to $2,700 per month.&nbsp;

TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 58.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients receiving dialysis at VWO dialysis centres are subsidised by the VWOs and/or the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; Generally, each patient on CAPD will receive a Government subsidy of $200 per month.&nbsp; For patients whose medical conditions require them to be on haemodialysis or APD, the Government subsidy is $600 per month.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, the Government subsidy is provided without any means-testing.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

Instead members' savings are invested mainly in risk-free Singapore Government bonds* issued specifically to the Board to meet its interest and other obligations.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board's interest rate for the Ordinary Account is computed based on a weightage of 80% on the 12-month fixed deposit rate and 20% on the savings rate of the major local banks, and is reviewed quarterly. Based on this computation, the prevailing rate should have been between 0.59% and 2.16% since July 1999, but the Government guarantees CPF members a minimum interest rate of 2.5% per annum, even if the market rate should fall below this level.</p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list"><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 58.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Special and Medisave Accounts, the interest paid to members is computed on the OA rate plus 1.5%. A 4% interest rate has been paid on the SA since July 1999 and on the MA since October 2001** because of the minimum interest rate paid on the OA. By comparison, the yield on 10-year Singapore Government Securities since July 1999 has ranged from 1.79% to 5.01%. The yield has been below 4% since January 2001, except for the last quarter of 2003 when the rate briefly went as high as 4.09%.***</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 58.5pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 58.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2002, $1.28 billion of interest was paid to the Ordinary Account of members.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 58.5pt 382.75pt">&nbsp;</p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list"><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote"><p class="MsoFootnoteText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></p></span><p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Singapore Government Bonds are floating rate bonds with interest rates pegged to the same interest rates that the Board pays to members on their balances.
