<div align="center"><b>SITTING OF THE ASSEMBLY ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SATURDAY AND SUNDAY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is a business motion in the name

of   the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  seeking  that  this

Assembly  do  sit  on Saturday and  Sunday,  that  is,

tomorrow and the day after. As insufficient notice was

given  of the motion, before the Deputy Prime Minister

can  move, he would require my consent and the general

assent of Members present. If it is the general assent

of  Members present that the motion should  be  moved,

then,  of  course, I will give my consent. Is  it  the

pleasure of hon. Members that the motion be moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion cannot be moved.

it.

<div align="center"><b>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Amendment

[21st November, 1961] to Question [20th November, 1961].





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That, whereas it has always been the avowed

objective of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve the

reunification  of  Singapore with  the  Federation  of

Malaya  and to remove the artificial division  created

by  the  British by their policy of "divide and rule",

this   House  affirms  and  declares  that  the  first

objective of all true patriots of Malaya is to achieve

the reunification of these two territories in a merger

of  Singapore  with  the Federation of  Malaya'.-(The

Minister for Labour-Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from "a" in the second last line to the end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Ayer),

Federation  of  Malaya,  with Singapore  entering  the

Federation  as  the twelfth state  and  with  all  its

Citizens  automatically becoming Federal  Citizens  on

Merger Day".-(Dr Lee Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

he left out, be left out."



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

P.A.P., which was once trusted by the people, has  now

turned the spears against the people. It threatens the

people   that  they  must  accept  the  phoney  merger

proposed  by  the P.A.P., otherwise, the water  supply

will  be cut off. They must not accept the true merger

proposed  by the Barisan Sosialis (this is  what  they

say,  Sir),  otherwise, they will be  disenfranchised.

Sir, how threatening the words are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. leaders told the Party workers during the

Anson by-election that there was no necessity for  the

Leftists  to help the Party in Anson. They  then  told

the people of Anson that if the P.A.P. was defeated in

Anson, the Government would consider whether or not to

stay  in  office.  Owing to their refusal  to  rectify

their  past  mistakes and owing to  their  refusal  to

unite  with  the  Left-wing  forces,  the  Party   was

defeated. The merger issue became a major item of open

debate in the Anson by-election and the defeat of  the

P.A.P. in Anson clearly showed that the people had  no

faith  in  the P.A.P. The people rejected  the  phoney

merger proposed by the PAP. Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this defeat of the P.A.P. in Anson, the P.A.P.

leaders went wild like wild beasts. They ran to Malaya

to  consult the Tunku to cure their injury.  They  are

supposed  to  be injured by the so-called  Communists,

Sir. They told the Tunku that they were injured by the

so-called  Communists and they also warned  the  Tunku

that  if  he  did  not watch out,  he  would  also  be

injured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy speech states that, "this dead-end is

favoured  by  some, because they are afraid  to  leave

security in the hands of the Central Government  of  a

new  and  larger Federation." Sir, what does it  mean?

What  does it intend to tell the people? It means that

the Leftists in Singapore are opposing merger. That is

not true. It intends to tell the people that merger is

good  for  them,  but  the Leftists  are  opposing  it

because  they  are  afraid of being  arrested  by  the

Central  Government once merger has taken place.  That

is  also not true. What a despicable attempt to  smear

the  Leftists!  Why do I say that, Sir? Because  these

Leftists  had been arrested once or twice  during  the

colonial  regime,  during the  period  that  was  most

dangerous  to  them. Sir, you can  ask  our  Ministers

opposite, where were they then? In their warm beds,  I

think. Who were arrested?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. ruling clique also said that we liked the

British because we fought only for full internal self-government  and  not merger. My answer  is  this.  The

British come from a place outside Singapore. So is the

Federation, a country that is outside Singapore.  From

these  two, we will oppose anyone who tries to exploit

us - the  British and Malaya too. If the  P.A.P. ruling

clique  purposely say that we do not want  the  phoney

merger  proposed by the P.A.P., and we  are  therefore

anti-nationals, then I would like to inform them  that

we  are  not  anti-nationals,  we  are  anti-violence.

Violence  is always created by Right-wing  people  and

colonialists. The atrocious act of Portugal in Angola,

Tshombe  in  the Congo and the French in  Algeria  are

clear  instances. If the Government tries to sell  the

interests of the people, then the people will have  no

choice  but to put the Government down before they  do

something to the British.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Singapore said that merger between

Singapore  and  the Federation was for rapid  economic

expansion and industrialisation that would bring  more

factories and more jobs for thousands of our young men

leaving  our schools and seeking employment.  But  the

Government   of   Malaya  said  that  merger   between

Singapore and Malaya was decided because of  the  fear

that  the Communists would turn Singapore into a  base

of  operation against Malaya. Sir, from here,  we  can

see  that  the Federation Government is not interested

in   the  so-called  merger  proposed  by  the  P.A.P.

Government. What she is interested in is the  internal

security  of  Singapore, which the  P.A.P.  Government

promised  to  hand over to the Federation  Government.

This means that the status of Singapore will remain as

it is; and even worse, Singapore will remain as a self-governing  State  with its defence, internal  security

and  foreign  affairs  transferred  from  the  British

colonial   government   to  the   Malayan   Right-wing

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government says that Singapore will seek

independence  through  merger under  conditions  which

will  give Singapore autonomy in education and labour.

Sir,  this  proposal  is  unworkable  and  the  P.A.P.

leaders  know  it. Singapore cannot have  autonomy  in

education  and labour if internal security is  in  the

hands  of the Federation, because the Federation  will

use  the internal security power to interfere with the

education and labour policies in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not going to elaborate any more details

about  how  the  Federation  Government  is  going  to

interfere, but I can show you the case of Mr Lim Lian

Geok, an educationist whose citizenship is -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes. I have personal knowledge of the

fact that the case of Mr Lim Lian Geok is before  the

Federation Court of Appeal, and I would ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, whether it is proper,  either

according to our Standing Orders or according  to  the

normal courtesies of Comity of nations, to mention  in

the Assembly a matter that is sub judice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the matter is, in fact, .sub judice

then,  of  course,  it  cannot  be  mentioned  in  the

Assembly. I accept the information given by the Member

for  Anson  that the matter is, in fact,  sub  judice,

and,   therefore,  it  cannot  be  mentioned  in   the

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I withdraw what

I  have  said  just  now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, will the

Government in the Federation keep quiet when  it  sees

that   the  Singapore  education  policy  and   labour

movement  are  advancing to such an extent  that  they

become entirely different from those of the Federation

Government?  Sir, she will not keep  quiet.  Will  the

Government in the Federation cry for a change  of  our

education and labour policies when she does  not  like

our  ways  of  implementing  the  policies?  Sir,  the

Federation  Government will cry for a change.  Due  to

the  present education policy of the Federation,  will

the  Chinese  school students in the Federation  swarm

into Singapore for secondary education? They will come

and Singapore cannot stop them because it is "part  of

Malaya".   If   this  happens,  will  the   Federation

Government  grant  financial  aid  to  Singapore   for

education? Can the students educated in Singapore seek

employment in the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Tunku said at the U.M.N.O. General Assembly

on  4th  of November this year that merger was decided

for   fear   of  Communist  activities  in  Singapore.

Therefore, we can see from here that the Government of

the Federation is not interested in economic expansion

or  the  employment  of our young  men  after  leaving

school  in Singapore. Sir, you can go and read the  12

fairy  tales written by our Prime Minister  and  which

were  broadcast over Radio Singapore last  month.  You

will see how the Prime Minister of Singapore plans for

the Government of the Federation to lay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



hands  on  persons  whom the Prime Minister  does  not

like.  He  does it secretly and openly by telling  the

names  of  the  so-called Communists  to  the  Malayan

Government  for future action. He also plans  for  the

Government  of  the  Federation to  interfere  in  the

education  and  labour policies  by  saying  that  the

communists  have  infiltrated into  Chinese  secondary

schools,  trade  unions, cultural organisations,  etc.

Sir,  it is a plot to sell the people and to save  the

ruling clique of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Party Chairman has given a very

lengthy  speech about the question of citizenship  and

merger,  but  it is very regrettable that citizenship,

which  is  so  important and which is the  fundamental

right  of  the  people, was not broadcast  over  Radio

Singapore  to  enable  our people  to  know  what  has

happened  in this Assembly. The P.A.P. has now  turned

Radio Singapore into Radio P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> The 15-minute speech delivered by

the  Minister  for Labour took about 30  minutes  over

Radio  Singapore, but the 450-minute speech  delivered

by our Party Chairman took less than five minutes over

Radio Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think you will remember that a

few  years back the Chinese Chamber of Commerce fought

so  hard for citizenship rights for those who were not

born in Singapore, and due to the effort and energy of

the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce particularly, and the

support   of   the  people  generally,  the   colonial

Government  gave citizenship rights to the  people  of

Singapore - those who were born outside the colony.  Now

many  people have acquired citizenship rights and,  of

course,  they  are very happy and proud - happy  because

they  have a say in their welfare in the Assembly  and

proud  because they have the right to vote persons  to

form  their  own  government. Now the  effort  of  the

people  is to be sold to the Federation by the  P.A.P.

ruling  clique. This citizenship right which they  had

fought to obtain is now to be deprived -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Read your White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> - as a result of the P.A.P. type

of  merger.  Yes, White Paper - the P.A.P. White  Paper!

Their  happiness is now turned into sorrow  and  their

pride  is no more. Their love for the P.A.P. has  now

turned into anger. That is why the P.A.P. leaders dare

not  go to meet the people and yet they say that  they

represent  the  people. But they need bodyguards  when

they go and see them!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. says that in the complete merger proposed

by  the  Barisan Sosialis, Singapore would be entitled

to  have 14 or 15 seats in the Central Government  and

that   half  of  the  Singapore  citizens   would   be

disenfranchised. This means that half  of  the  people

who  are citizens born in Singapore will automatically

become  citizens  of the Federation. This  also  means

that  these people will have the right to vote and  be

voted to the Central Government in the Federation.  We

can  call this an incomplete merger. This is what  the

P.A.P. says. But our Barisan Sosialis stand  is  that

all   Singapore  citizens - about  620,000 - must  become

Federal citizens automatically on Merger Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come to the P.A.P. merger. They said that all

citizens of Singapore would not lose their citizenship

rights or be disenfranchised with the P.A.P. brand  of

merger.  But  as  you  will  see  at  page  4  of  the

Memorandum on merger, all Singapore citizens will only

vote  in Singapore and elect their representatives  in

Singapore to the Central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put the position more clearly to the people,

I shall set out my arguments in a mathematical way:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In the phoney merger of the P.A.P., we will get -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 15 seats for Singapore in the Central

Government;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Singapore citizens cannot become citizens of a

larger Federation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) all powers and privileges



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



are handed  to the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the incomplete merger of the P.A.P., we will

get -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 15 seats for Singapore in the Central

Government;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) half of the Singapore citizens will be

disenfranchised;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) all powers and privileges are handed to

the Federation Government; but



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In the complete merger of the Barisan Sosialis,

we will get -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 25 to 30 seats for Singapore in the Central

Government  on  the basis  of  proportional

representation;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) all Singapore citizens - about 620,000 - will

automatically become citizens of Malaya;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the powers of the State will be

transferred to the Central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in any colony, you are sure to find

the mouth-pieces of colonialism and these people are a

privileged class with the colonialists who rule.  They

live  on  the blood and sweat of the majority  of  the

people. These people with the colonialists control the

Government and they call themselves representatives of

the  people.  These so-called representatives  of  the

people govern the people without any knowledge of  the

people's sufferings. What they know is the passing  of

a  few  Bills  and  motions for  the  benefit  of  the

cornpradores  and  their own  clique  to  Control  the

people's  thinking in order to give more opportunities

for  themselves  to  exploit the people  and  to  rule

longer.  What  they  are  interested  in  is  dancing,

cocktail parties, garden parties.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did promise not to intervene

for   irrelevancies,  but  I  think   this   type   of

irrelevancy must not be allowed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P.

leadership  believe in having a good time. Like  their

colonial predecessors, they like to hold on to power.,

otherwise  they would be deprived of their  status  in

life.  The  people of Asia and Africa  are  in  revolt

against this mentality. What do the ruling class  do?

What  do  they care? They do not care. If you ask  the

ruling class about this -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who are the ruling class?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> The P.A.P. ruling class! If you

ask  the ruling class about this, they will answer  in

this  manner, "Never mind, let the poor people be  the

poor people, and they can go and die. Anyway, it is  a

free  and democratic country and if they want to, they

can  try  to rule us. They have the right to  do  so."

This is what the ruling class will answer. Sir, such a

feature  is very common in those countries  where  the

people  are now trying to overthrow the ruling  class.

And  this  ruling  class have never thought  that  the

people will rise one day to revolt against them.  That

is  why many countries and many governments have  been

overthrown. Having experienced that, the ruling  class

are becoming more fierce, ruthless and merciless. They

blame  the  people for creating violence. Some  people

misunderstand and say that it is the people who create

violence  because they use force against the so-called

Government.  Who creates violence? Surely  it  is  the

ruling  class. When an incident takes place,  we  must

first  find out the cause. Violence is not necessarily

due to those who are involved in it. Often enough,  it

is  due  to the repression that comes from the  ruling

class.  If  the Government is good, no one will  fight

against  it. Instead the people will support it.  That

is  why  the  people will not support  the  P.A.P. - the

P.A.P. is no good. It is because the Government  uses

force to suppress the people and makes them suffer  so

much  that they have no alternative but to go  against

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said above can also be applied to strikes

and other matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



As  in  the  case of merger, the P.A.P. is seeking  to

bring about a situation of greater repression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways by which we can overthrow a

government. One is by peaceful means and the other  is

by force of arms.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid I am compelled to

intervene in this type of speech which seems to me  to

be  au  electioneering speech. It has gone very,  very

far away from the motion. I think perhaps I could warn

Members  that if they go too far away from the  motion

they must expect interventions from the Chair. I think

this  type  of speech has gone much too far away  from

the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the people want

the  Government  to return their mandate.  The  P.A.P.

refuses.  It  therefore quickly brings up  the  merger

issue  and  threatens  the  people  by  talking  about

imaginary consequences that will happen if merger does

not take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said above, the phoney merger of the P.A.P. is

an  attempt to enable the ruling class to control  the

people's thinking, to exploit them and to rule  for  a

further  period.  The merger issue is  of  such  vital

importance   that  it  affects  everyone   living   in

Singapore,  but the P.A.P. which came into power  with

the  support  of the people does not consult  them  on

this  merger  issue. Instead it tries to threaten  the

people  and prepares to impose its own type of merger.

We accuse the P.A.P. of not consulting the people. The

leaders  of the P.A.P. said that they would  put  the

matter before the people after the Prime Ministers  of

the  Federation and Singapore have settled the details

on  merger. Sir, this is not, the correct way of going

about  the  matter.  Merger is a national  matter  and

concerns  everyone.  It is not a  .party  matter.  The

Government  should  have consulted the  people  before

making any decision. It should put the matter for open

debates  and  discussions. It  should  ask  the  trade

unionists, education bodies, cultural bodies,  student

organisations,  rural organisations, professional  men

and others to submit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



their  views and make suggestions. But the P.A.P. has

not  done  so.  This  is the first great  mistake  the

P.A.P. has made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legislative Assembly is a place where

representatives  of the people discuss  matters  which

concern  the  country and the people.  On  the  merger

question, the Government should have first sought  the

opinion   and  support  of  the  Assembly  before   it

discussed  the  matter with the Tunku. The  Government

has  not  done that. Before the Tunku led  the  merger

mission  to England to discuss the Malaysia  plan,  he

received   overwhelming  support  from   the   Federal

Assembly, but the P.A.P. did not ask for support  from

the  Assembly before it went to meet the Tunku on  the

merger  issue.  This is the second great  mistake  the

P.A.P. made.  The P.A.P. Government, without consulting

anyone,   secretly  tried  to  transfer  all   powers,

privileges,  rights and interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore  to the Federation Government. This  is  the

third  great mistake done by the P.A.P., and it  is  a

treacherous  act of the P.A.P. in trying to  sell  out

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Years ago in China, Sir, there was

a  General  called Wu San Kwei. For  his  own  selfish

ends, he allowed the Manchurians to conquer China, and

the P.A.P. is doing that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Doing what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Ask yourself. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  the hon. Member for Cairnhill is aware that  if

the  P.A.P. is  defeated on the merger question,  the

S.P.A. and the P.A.P. will be thrown into the drain to

be  washed  away by the people, and because  the  hon.

Member  is  afraid  that his Party,  the  S.P.A.,  may

vanish  with  the P.A.P., he is forced to  oppose  our

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about ourselves?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> The same. They are all the same,

Sir, and he also criticised the P.A.P. brand of merger

because  he knew that if he supported it, his  Party,

the S.P.A., would be in the dead camp



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



of  the  P.A.P.  If we study carefully what  the  hon.

Member for Cairnhill has said, we will be able to find

out  that  what he has uttered is also very  much  the

same  as  that  uttered  by the P.A.P. leaders, both

inside the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion. Sir, the P.A.P. and the S.P.A. are

sitting on the same side as that -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Opposite side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Same side - the thinking is the

same,  Sir. It is a regret that a non-communal  Party

like  the  P.A.P., when discussing the  importance  of

citizenship  rights  in this Assembly,  has  purposely

tried to cast a shadow of communal fear over our Malay

brothers both in Singapore and in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of the Government in ruling a multi-racial

country  such as ours is to create harmony  and  unity

among  all races and not to create hatred and disunity

among  the  races,  but  P.A.P. is  now  using   this

despicable method to create communal fear and to  undo

all  the  efforts which the people had put in  in  the

past, to bring about unity to all races. I would  like

to remind the P.A.P. that if they want to leave a good

record  for the history of Singapore, then  they  must

not  attempt the sordid practice of creating  communal

fear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unity is strength. This formula can he applied

to  all things. It is good and wise for all peoples of

all races to unite together to form a single group  of

people,  hut this can only take place if the guardians

or  the  leaders of the people treat them impartially.

To  guarantee  that  there is no  conflict  among  the

races,  the  leaders must not take the communal  line.

but  must  treat all people equally. Under the  P.A.P.

brand  of  merger. Singapore citizens share  the  same

responsibility, but have no equal  benefits,  and  it

will only bring chaos and disunity to our country  and

our  people. No one will benefit from it.  The  P.A.P.

and  even the ruling clique will suffer. It will be  a

total  loss to our country. It is very interesting  to

see   the   P.A.P. leaders  fighting   the   British

colonialists with their voices in this Assembly, where

there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



are  no  British colonialists. They blame the  British

for  their divide-and-rule policy but this divide-and-rule  policy has already been made. It is  up  to  the

Government to mobilise the strength of the people,  to

persuade and force the British colonialists to  accept

our  demand. It is only with strength that the  battle

can  be won, but can we see the Government doing that?

We   can  see  them  only  creating  communal  hatred,

creating suspicion among the races, creating fears. We

can  see them begging the colonial forces, the  Right-wing  forces,  to save the P.A.P. from being  drowned.

Sir,  when a person is in danger of drowning, he  will

struggle  desperately and dangerously. The  P.A.P. is

now  struggling desperately and dangerously. Sir,  the

Member  for  Kreta Ayer has said something like  that;

that we, the Barisan Sosialis, do not have any plan as

to how the merger should take place.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I know who the Member for

Kreta Ayer is?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I am sorry. I mean the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the merger should take place and how the citizens

of  Singapore should automatically become citizens  of

the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought I remarked that there

is a difference between reading and referring to one's

notes. I ask the Member for Changi not to make  it  so

obvious that he is reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I would like to inform the Member

on  this  merger issue. The Government has not  sought

the   Opinion  of  the  Opposition  Parties.  It   is,

therefore, the duty of the Government to draw up plans

on this merger issue. If they want our detailed plans,

the  only  way  is  for them to resign  and  face  the

people.  This  is the only solution. When  the  P.A.P.

resigns,  elections must, of course, be held  and  the

Barisan Sosialis will be eager to explain clearly  the

meaning  of merger and citizenship to the people.  Let

the people choose freely whether they want our Barisan

Sosialis'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



merger, or they want the sell-out plans of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now. Sir, if the P.A.P. Government

wants  our  plans of merger, it must call an All-Party

Conference  to discuss the matter, or the P.A.P. must

resign. The Minister for Finance said that we  were  a

group  of angry young men. Yes, angry young men, angry

because the P.A.P. traitors are trying to sell out the

interests  of  the people of Singapore; angry  because

the  P.A.P. leaders call themselves patriots,  sincere

democrats, nationalists, 100 per cent socialists,  and

yet they do things similar to those done by traitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture said that the Barisan Sosialis were afraid of merger for fear of getting into trouble when merger takes place. He indicated that the Barisan Sosialis leaders are afraid of being arrested by the Central Government. Sir, in a phoney merger, the sell-out has taken place. This type of

utterance  is meant to fool the people into  believing

that the Barisan Sosialis is selfish. I would like  to

inform  the  Member  that his false statements  cannot

blind the people. The people will not believe him. The

people  may believe him if he had been sleeping  in  a

hard bed in Changi Gaol. But he has never slept there;

he  has  been sleeping in a warm soft bed in  his  own

sweet and comfortable home.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am trying to avoid this type of

language. These personalities should never creep in in

a debate in this Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> During the colonial regime our

Barisan  Sosialis leaders were thrown  into  gaol  for

years.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> There was no Barisan

Sosialis!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Yes, our Barisan Sosialis leader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Where were you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, where was I? I was a student

in  Beatty Secondary School, and I did help the P.A.P.

to   contest  the  elections.  Ask  the  Member   for

Tampines. I was a student.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the colonial regime our Barisan Sosialis

leaders were thrown into gaol for years. They were put

in  gaol by the colonialists just because they  fought

for the interests of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> If it

were not for the people, they would still be there!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> The P.A.P. leaders then were in

Cameron Highlands and Fraser's Hill. The Minister  for

Culture  said that it was true that Singapore citizens

could  not  go  to  the  Federation  to  contest   the

elections:  but  it was equally true  that  Federation

citizens  cannot  come  to Singapore  to  contest  the

elections.  Only fools believe such words.  Federation

citizens  cannot  come  to Singapore  to  contest  the

elections,  but they lose nothing. Instead they  gain.

They  gain control over Singapore. Singapore  citizens

cannot  go to the Federation to contest the elections,

but they lose all the rights and privileges which they

are now enjoying. He also said that Singapore citizens

have the right to elect representatives to the Federal

Parliament. But the Member must remember that the  so-called  citizens are only those who can speak  English

and  the national language; only persons who can speak

English and the national language have the right to be

voted to sit in the Federal Parliament, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Change it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> We will try to change it.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> The Barisan Sosialis

can change it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Yes, we can change it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Sometimes it is pleasant to hear

a  lady's  voice.  But perhaps the lady  will  contain

herself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, what this indicates is that

Singapore  citizens will be deprived of  their  rights

completely in one way or another. The people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



Singapore have the right to vote but they have not the

right  to  be  voted because they are not English  and

Malay speaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Health and Law has quoted many

words  of  law in order to misled the people.  He  was

trying to tell the people that because of this law and

that  law,  the people of Singapore could  not  become

citizens  of  the Federation. Therefore, their  demand

for equality was illegal. This is because the law says

so. This is what the Minister for Health and Law said.

Sir,  laws are made by men, and some laws are made  by

men  to  safeguard their own interests. And the P.A.P.

leaders, who call themselves the mass leaders or self-appointed mass leaders, must discuss with and persuade

the  Malayan Government to make arrangements to  allow

Singapore  into the Federation without any  inequality

and prejudices against the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders of the P.A.P. say that we, the 13 Barisan

Sosialis   Assemblymen,   are   carrying    out    the

instructions of the people behind us. I would like  to

inform  them  that  the men behind us  and  giving  us

instructions are the majority of the people.  If  they

do  not  believe this, the only way for them to  prove

it,  is  to go and face the people. That is  the  only

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have brought the written instruction of the people

into  this Assembly, Sir. This instruction is  written

in  the  Constitution  of the  Barisan  Sosialis.  The

Government  says  that those who are against  the  so-called  merger  proposed  by  the  P.A.P. are   anti-nationalists. In other words, the P.A.P. leaders  are

patriots and true nationalists. But they are certainly

not.  They  are  traitors  and  enemies  of  the  true

nationalists  and  patriots of Singapore  and  Malaya.

They  say that those who are against the phoney merger

of  the  P.A.P. will be crushed. I say  to  them  that

those  who attempt to sell the interests of the people

will be crushed by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Correct!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, my strength is the people's

strength,  and  the P.A.P.'s strength is  only  a  few

Ministers. The P.A.P. say that we are elected  on  the

P.A.P. ticket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Were you not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Yes, it is right. We were elected

by  the people on the common objectives of the people.

But  we  were  not  elected  on  the  P.A.P. leaders'

objectives. These objectives are written in  clause  2

of   the  People's  Action  Party  Constitution  which

reads - Sir,  if  you  will  permit  me  to   read   the

objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Do not be frightened.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is permitted to read

if  the  paragraph  is not too long.  I  do  not  know

whether   the   Government  side  still   know   their

objectives. Possibly the Barisan Sosialis  would  like

to adopt them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> The P.A.P.'s objectives are also

the  same  as the objectives of the Barisan  Sosialis.

And  we  are fighting for those objectives, Sir.  They

are    not   fighting   for   them.   That   is    why

[Interruptions].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Changi is not

allowed  to continue, we will never be able to  finish

with the debate. We have already taken four days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> These are the Constitution and

Rules of the People's Action Party, clause 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Party's objectives -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To end colonialism and establish an independent,

national  state  of  Malaya  comprising  the  two

territories now known as the Federation of Malaya

and Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To create a democratic unitary government of

Malaya  based on universal adult suffrage of  all

those  who  are  born  in Malaya  and  who  adopt

Malayan nationality;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)	To abolish the unjust inequalities of wealth and

opportunity inherent to the present system;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To establish an economic order which will give to

all  citizens the right to work and full economic

returns for their labour and skill,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



to  ensure a decent living and social security  to

all  those who through sickness, infirmity or old

age can no longer work;

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To infuse into the people of Malaya a spirit

of national unity, self-respect and self-reliance

and to  inspire them with a sense of endeavour in

the creation of a prosperous, stable and just

society.



<br><br>Sir, all these are forgotten by the P.A.P. leaders! We

are  loyal and faithful to these objectives,  but  the

PAP, leaders  are  disloyal and unfaithful  to  these

objectives. They try to deviate from those  objectives

and  follow their own objectives. We therefore had  no

alternative but to divide our political line with  the

P.A.P. leaders. Although we have divided the political

line  with the P.A.P. leaders, we are still loyal  and

faithful  to the objectives that bring us  to  sit  in

this Assembly. Only the P,A.P. objectives bring us  to

sit in this Assembly and not the P.A.P. leaders. These

objectives are also written in clause 2 of the Barisan

Sosialis  Constitution. I will read, Sir - the  wording

is different. The Constitution of the Barisan Sosialis

is in a very short form. Clause 2, Party's objectives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To eradicate colonialism and to set up a united

national independent State comprising the Federation

of Malaya and Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To establish a democratic government of Malaya

based on universal adult suffrage of all those who

are born in or owe their allegiance to Malaya;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To bring into being an economic system that will ensure a prosperous, stable and just society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To mobilise all sections of the people for the

building of a Malayan nation.



<br><br>It  is  the P.A.P. leaders who have deviated from  the

objectives.  They must therefore face the  people  and

face the music.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as indicated by a gesture by the Prime Minister

on  Tuesday,  he  was  trying  to  force  the  Barisan

Sosialis  into  a  situation  where  we  would  commit

suicide or cut our own throats on this merger issue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are doing it now!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I do not know who will cut their

own throats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Cut yourself!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether I could

accuse  the Member for Changi of misleading the House,

because  he always turns round and brings up  a  whole

sheaf  of  notes after he has finished one sheet.  Mr

Teo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> The Prime Minister and the other

Members  on the Government side thought that we  dared

not  oppose their phoney merger. They thought that  if

we   opposed  we  would  be  accused  of  being  anti-nationalist or anti-merger. This is what they thought.

If  we  did not oppose, then we would fall into  their

trap  and  they  could laugh. Then we  might  cut  our

throats.  But what they had hoped for did not  appear.

The P.A.P. always try to hide their own intentions and

to  deceive the people in order to enable them to rule

longer and to exploit some more from the people. We in

the  Barisan Socialist have never tried to deceive  the

people.  We will never do such a shameful act done  by

the  P.A.P.  We  never  hide our  own  intentions  and

objectives  as  stated  in clause  2  of  the  Barisan

Socialist   Constitution.  We  never   hide   our   own

objectives towards merger and towards everything.  The

P.A.P. may  think  that we are like  ostriches  which

always  hide their faces in the sand when people  want

to  catch them. Maybe the P.A.P. is adopting an  ostrich

policy.  I  do not know what they know of the  ostrich

policy.  It  is  because of this that  we  oppose  the

phoney  merger proposed by the self-appointed  leaders

of  the P.A.P. We have now opposed the motion moved by

the  Minister  for  Labour, and we  have  to  make  an

amendment  to  this  motion.  It  is  because  of  our

amendment that the P.A.P. leaders could not sleep  for

the  last few nights. Before our amendment was  moved,

they  planned and they plotted on how to trick us  and

how to trap us for their own selfish ends. But now, to

their regret, they have to change their tactics.  They

could not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



attack  us  from the direction which they  had  chosen

before.  Now  they can attack us not  with  their  own

strength but with the strength of the colonial  forces

and  the Right-wing forces both inside and outside the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental aim of the people is to struggle

for  a better society and a better standard of living.

Nobody  will  allow our society to turn  from  bad  to

worse  unless  that  person is a traitor,  if  not,  a

coward, fearing the strength of the people and  bowing

to   colonial  forces  and  reactionary  forces.   The

fundamental right of the people is citizenship and the

fundamental  aim  of the people is a  better  society.

This  fundamental  right and fundamental  aim  of  the

people are closely related.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men are born equal. Nobody can deny that. If merger

is  to take place, the right of the people of the  two

territories must be equal. According to the Memorandum

on  merger on page 6, we will be able to see that  all

the rights, powers and privileges are transferred from

the hands of Singapore to the hands of the Federation.

All  these rights, powers and privileges of the people

of  Singapore are to be lost and be sold by  the  P.A.P.

But the status of the people of Singapore will remain

in   Singapore  as  it  is,  but  with  their  rights,

interests, and privileges deprived. Can this be called

merger?  All  these rights, power and privileges  are

here for us to enjoy at this moment, but are ready  to

be sold, if Singapore citizens can become the citizens

of  a new larger Federation, enjoying the same rights,

powers   and  privileges  as  those  enjoyed  by   the

Federation citizens, if merger takes place,  then,  of

course,  our State powers must be transferred  to  the

Central Government, otherwise, there will be chaos for

the  two  Governments having the same powers. But  the

trouble is that the so-called merger proposed by  only

the ruling clique of the P.A.P. is entirely different.

The  P.A.P. ruling clique proposed a merger where  the

rights,  powers and privileges are to be handed  to  a

person  for nothing. Sir, we sell things and  articles

for  money, and with this money we buy things and earn

more money to feed ourselves. It is the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



with  merger, Sir. We are prepared to give the  powers

of our State to the Central Government if our citizens

born or not born in Singapore can become automatically

the  citizens of a larger Federation and enjoying  the

same  power  and  privileges as those enjoyed  by  the

citizens of Malaya. Because the P.A.P. brand of merger

is  not  a merger but a sell-out, therefore we  oppose

the motion -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> The motion, Sir, moved by the

Minister  for Labour, and not the amendment.  That  is

our Party's amendment, and not the P.A.P.'s amendment.

If it is the P.A.P.'s amendment, we are sure to oppose

it.  I  think the P.A.P. ruling clique must have known

that  the  people do not want their merger, otherwise,

there would not have been so many twists and turns  on

so  many  minor  points, such  as  passports.  Sir,  a

passport  is not a very important point. Not  all  the

people  can go abroad to enjoy their holidays.  It  is

only the Ministers and some millionaires -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Some Barisan Sosialis might need it,

you know!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> We will face our troubles in

Singapore,  but not the P.A.P. leaders.  We  fight  on

principle on the merger issue and we do not fight  for

those  minor points. Maybe the P.A.P. leaders  do  not

know  that  they are selling something for nothing  at

first -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> $90 million!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Yes, $90 million. I do not know it

is  $90  million but they must know it now because  we

have  already  put down all reasonable  arguments  and

facts for them to study; but to our regret, the P.A.P.

leaders,  after  studying  our  reasonable  arguments,

still  insist  on their phoney merger. A  person  will

have  no voting rights and be voted to office, and  he

will  also  have  no  other privileges  to  enjoy  the

benefits  of  his motherland if he is not  a  citizen.

Sir, our demand for automatic citizenship is basic and

fundamental. I support the amendment of the Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, I oppose strongly the amendment moved by  the

Barisan   Socialist.  Mr  Speaker,  I  personally   am

surprised at the attitude of the Barisan Sosialis  who

oppose  the original motion moved by the Minister  for

Labour. The Members of Queenstown and Changi say  that

they are the elected representatives of the people but

they must bear in mind that they were elected, not  on

the Barisan Sosialis ticket, but on the P.A.P. ticket.

If  they  are  really men, they must go  out  of  this

Assembly   and   face   the   people   in   the   same

constituencies to prove whether they have the  support

of  the people or not. If they are successful, then it

can   be   said  that  they  are  truly  the   elected

representatives  who  support  the  Barisan  Sosialis;

otherwise they have no business to say that  they  are

the representatives of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Members for Queenstown and Changi also say that the future citizenship will be second-class citizenship. But what do they mean by second-class citizenship? Does it mean that a citizen of Singapore who lives in a certain area wishes to throw

away his money for the purpose of voting in Malaya, or

would  he  prefer  to  vote in his  own  constituency?

Whereas, in point of fact, when merger is achieved, we

will  be  able  to  send  our representatives  to  the

Federal Parliament. Cannot the electorate elect  their

own  representatives to sit in the Federal Parliament?

It  is just the same. Why are they harping on the same

citizenship rights for Malaya and Singapore?  We  know

that  in the past the electorate preferred to vote  in

their own constituencies for the sake of economy.  Mr

Speaker, this is only a tactic adopted by the  Barisan

Sosialis  because  they  are more  keen  to  stand  as

candidates  in  the Federation. But they  conveniently

forget  that if we do not discharge our duties in  our

own  constituency, people will not elect  us  in  that

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that this opposition is most unreasonable and

the result is that they are anti-merger. They also say

that we the P.A.P. should not talk about merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



Why  do  they say that? Because they know  that  right

from  the beginning we the P.A.P. have desired  merger

and we have struggled for merger. Until we die we will

not  budge an inch. We will move forward to defend our

motherland  so that it will not be taken over  by  the

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am surprised at the stand of the Barisan Sosialis who always put the blame on what has happened in the past two years on the Government, but

they forget that over the past few months, before they

left the Government, they were with us. Now, they have

turned round and pecked at us. Is this the attitude of

a man'? I think this is the attitude of a coward. They

have  no  responsibility. The people  have  put  their

faith  in us as their elected representatives  and  we

must  discharge our responsibilities to protect  their

interests  in the constituency we represent.  We  must

not think of one community, but the people as a whole,

so that the people will be able to taste the fruits of

their  labour. It seems that they deliberately do  not

discharge their duties truly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, they challenge the Government to resign because they say that the people no longer support the Government. But, Mr Speaker, the people know they

have  given us the power for a certain period  and  we

are  not  so  foolish  as  to resign  until  the  time

determined  by the people so that we can  go  back  to

them  for  another election. Why must we be afraid  to

face  another  election? We are prepared  to  face  an

election when the time comes, and when that time comes

we will see. God will be on the side of the people who

are  for truth. But let not the Barisan Sosialis think

that  they are always in the right. If they are really

right-thinking people, they must not be afraid to face

another election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should they speak in this strain which should not

be  uttered in this Assembly? The subject under debate

is  a very important issue and not one in which we can

dabble.  Mr Speaker, they have compared the situation

in  Singapore with what has happened in Angola and the

Congo.   But  Mr  Speaker,  they  have  misunderstood

matters. In Angola



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



and  the Congo, for instance, the population comprises

only  one  people,  but  here in  Singapore,  we  must

remember that the society is multiracial and we cannot

do  anything without considering this fact. We must be

careful in whatever we do so that we will not be sorry

for  our actions. I say so, Mr Speaker because if the

people  had no faith in the P.A.P., then we would  not

have won the elections in 1959. But we understand that

it  is because of agitation from certain sections  who

do  not wish for peace but who wish for chaos that has

led  the  people into being misled. But  we  hope  the

people  of Singapore will use their discretion in  the

interests  of harmony for the generation to  come  and

not  just  for our own selfish ends. We must  remember

that  this  is one of our aims, otherwise we  will  be

influenced by undesirable elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the merger as described by them as good,

they  do  not think of the implications of labour  and

education if we follow the Federation system,  because

we  know that in Singapore here the Chinese are in the

majority  and  who  are not yet versed  in  the  Malay

language,  if  we  adopt  the  Federation  system   in

education the Chinese-educated will not be able to get

jobs in Singapore. Will this not frustrate the people?

We  must  remember  that when we want  to  improve  on

something, it will take time. In the beginning it will

be  difficult because. Mr Speaker, when we were  born

we did not become lawyers or doctors automatically. It

took  years for our mothers to bring us up so that  we

will  become useful citizens of the State.  Similarly,

on  the job we are discharging. We must do it properly

so  that our generation will taste the benefit and  we

shall not think in terms of our own interests only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Queenstown and Changi also say that

we  the P.A.P. pay more interest to the Party.  It  is

false.  I  repudiate this statement. But, Mr Speaker,

those  gentlemen themselves know how difficult it  is.

But  because  they are cowards and not  sincere,  they

cannot face hardships. For that reason, they left  the

Government because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



felt  that  the  P.A.P. would collapse  and  if  they

toppled  they  would be thrown away. For  that  reason

they  formed a new Party to attack us. But we  on  the

Government  side  will stand erect  to  discharge  our

duties to the very end. We will not budge; we will not

retreat  in  the  face of the agitation.  We  will  be

prepared  to  defend  our  motherland  from  dangerous

influences  which  are the concern of  the  people  of

Singapore and Malaya.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In case hon. Members have not understood

what  I  am trying to do, I am trying to give a Member

of  the Opposition an opportunity to speak and then  a

Member  on the Government side. Then I will come  back

to  the Opposition. I am trying to divide time as best

I  can.  The  Barisan Sosialis have  already  had  two

speakers. Now it is U.M.N.O.'s turn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if I am not

mistaken,  today is the sixth day we are debating  the

amendment moved by the Barisan Sosialis to the  motion

of the Minister for Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that we are not tired of hearing the

arguments put forward by Members of this Assembly.  We

must  not forget that the matter under discussion will

not  only  determine the fate of the  Members  of  the

Assembly but also the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As representatives of U.M.N.O., we would naturally

like to express our thoughts from our point of view to

our  non-Malay brothers for them to consider. We  will

not  be  carried  away  by historical  sentiments  and

emotions and try to dominate another community with  a

feeling  of  hatred. Our main objective is  to  direct

U.M.N.O.'s  struggle  which  is  led  by  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman.  There is no need for me to say here that  the

majority of Malays have great faith in the Tunku as  a

national  leader.  He  has wholeheartedly  helped  the

people of the Federation and, at the same time, he has

not forgotten the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is this, Mr Speaker. Sir. The Tunku

wishes that U.M.N.O. should have a branch in Singapore

so  that  the  objective of U.M.N.O. (Malaya)  can  be

carried  out  in Singapore. To take one  example,  the

people  of  the  Federation of  Malaya,  comprising  a

multiracial community, have been able to live in peace

and  harmony. This is not something which  I  wish  to

bring up before Merdeka Day, but I would like to  tell

the  Barisan Sosialis that if they are really  sincere

in  their desire to live in a family as a result of  a

merger between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya,

then they should not have moved their amendment. It is

against  our aim to unite the various people  together

into a strong and peaceful community. This has further

aroused  our suspicion because we know of the  success

achieved  by  the  Tunku in his  negotiations  on  the

question   of   merger  between  Singapore   and   the

Federation of Malaya. This is not the first time  this

matter has been put to the people. In fact, the merger

issue  was  discussed fully in the Federal  Parliament

and  the  speeches made by the Tunku in  October  1961

have  appeared  in  the  Straits  Times.  The  Tunku's

speeches  were  clear and it was  easy  to  understand

them.  There were no twists and turns. But the Barisan

Sosialis  did not touch on the objectives or the  aims

of merger. There should be no further delay if we wish

to  unite the people of the two territories. The  time

has come to merge if we wish to prevent Singapore from

turning Red. I say unhesitatingly that U.M.N.O. is  an

anti-Communist  Party. This has  been  proved  not  by

words but by deeds. For instance, during the emergency

period  in  the  Federation of Malaya,  the  youth  of

U.M.N.O. were prepared to defend their country against

Communism if the Government was not able to do so. But

the  efforts  of  the elected representatives  of  the

Federation of Malaya were successful and Communism has

been  smashed in Malaya. The Federation of  Malaya  is

not  keeping  quiet in the meantime. It is  keeping  a

watchful eye over those people who are sympathetic  to

Communism. I say courageously that the amendment moved

by the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis is a line of the Communists. I would not  say

that  they are already Communists. It is a line  which

is  adopted by the Communists in their struggle. I say

so,  Mr Speaker, Sir, because the Communists  do  not

wish  to  see  a free Singapore through a  unification

with Malaya. They cannot avert this reunification  and

they have no alternative but to pretend that they  are

also  in  favour of the building of one nation.  Their

true  aim is not for merger but that Singapore  should

stand  as an independent State so that they can  align

themselves  with  stronger powers according  to  their

political inclinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the long time taken by the Member for

Queenstown - he made a record by speaking for 7�  hours

in  this  Assembly - to put forward his arguments  could

have   been   put   to  better  use  on   constructive

suggestions to the White Paper of the Government. This

has  added  more poison in the minds of the people  of

Singapore  with the object of frustrating  the  merger

proposals.  Why I say this is that we do not  question

the reasonableness or otherwise of these proposals. We

must  think in terms of time and we must act  now.  We

must  also  ask whether the objectives of the  Barisan

Sosialis can be accepted by the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we do not like to recapitulate historical

events, we would like to relate what happened  in  the

Federation  of Malaya. After the Japanese  occupation,

when  the  British administration returned to  Malaya,

the  British Government sent over a mission headed  by

Sir  MacMichael to amend the then existing  Federation

Agreement. At that time, we were not quite sure of the

aim  of  the  British Government. The  Malays  enjoyed

sovereignty  at  that  time. When  the  Agreement  was

signed  by the rulers without prior consultation  with

the  people and it was realised that the Agreement did

not  only  hope to put an end to the Malay rulers  but

also  Malay  sovereignty, there  was  opposition,  and

activities were intensified to dissolve the Agreement.

That was the process of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



political  development until the  Federation  achieved

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore also made progress since the end of World

War  II.  From a colonial' status, we moved  on  to  a

Constitution  and  then  to  a  self-governing  status

today.  From here, we will take a step further towards

our  aim  of  reunification  with  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  This seems also to be the aim of the  Barisan

Sosialis. So today with the progress we have achieved,

Mr  Speaker,  I  can  say that communal  feeling  has

almost  gone.  It  can be said that there  is  now  no

communal fear. Communal fears have disappeared. We are

able to live in peace and harmony, and we hope that in

future  we  will be a State that sets an  example.  In

fact,  the Federation of Malaya has set an example  to

the  world  and has received warm tributes from  other

parts  of the world to say how our multi-racial people

can  live  in  peace and harmony. So we must  be  very

careful  in this matter, because there are people  who

wish  to create or revive communalism. In the past  we

used  to say that the British were fond of doing this,

but  now  we say that it is a new form of colonialism,

i.e.  Communism,  which is even  more  dangerous  than

British  colonialism. It is not because we are  afraid

of  the  Communists or that we have  any  dislike  for

their leaders, but their way of living is nothing  but

the  oppression  and suppression  of  people.  In  the

circumstances, we cannot accept Communism. We want  to

live  in  a  free country where there  is  freedom  of

expression. Although we are angry, we have given  them

freedom. We have given them 7� hours to speak because

this  is  the place for any elected representative  to

put  forward  his  views.  But  if  their  aim  is  to

disseminate poison and to revive communalism, then  we

will  not  oppose merely with words  but  we  have  no

alternative  but to resort to anything to  avoid  this

communal issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.M.N.O. oppose those extreme racial organisations

formed  by Malays, for instance, the A.R.T.I.S. which

we   heard  about  early  this  year.  We  oppose  the

A.R.T.I.S., but it does not follow that because  they

are Malays, we will tolerate such an organisation.  We

wish  to  nurse  the  efforts  and  progress  so   far

achieved,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



and  we wish to consolidate them. Therefore, we do not

wish   to   see  an  irresponsible  group  of  persons

destroying our progress. So I sincerely hope that  the

elected  representatives  choose  a  way  which  will'

really  lead to the building of one nation. I  do  not

adopt twist-and-turn tactics. We in Singapore must not

try to bring arguments to defend ourselves but we must

find  a  point of agreement where it can he acceptable

to  all.  In that way alone will we he able  to  march

forward  towards  peace  and prosperity  for  all  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mr Speaker, when this House first met

after  the  advent of the P.A.P. Government,  we  were

always  pointing out proposals that would be good  for

the people of Singapore. But in this matter we are not

defending  the P.A.P. by any means. What we stand  for

are the interests of the people. In our view, whatever

is  not  good  for  the people must be  rejected,  and

whatever  is  good  we  must  support,  otherwise  our

democracy  will  not be a healthy one.  We  should.  I

feel,  give  our congratulations to the Government  at

least   for   having  seen  one  good  way   for   the

reunification of the peoples of these territories even

though  what they have been able to achieve so far  is

not what everybody else would wish, as what some would

call "genuine merger".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many things synthetic these days, Mr

Speaker, Sir. There is synthetic rubber, for instance.

Likewise  people too are synthetic in their  attitude.

Some  people would make utterances which actually  are

the  words  of  others. I say that some  Parties  send

their   representatives  here  merely  to  be  puppets

because  they  cannot choose for themselves  and  they

have  to be directed from behind by somebody. If  they

are   truly  genuine  and  want  to  carry  out  their

responsibilities to the people, they should be able to

speak  what is in their own minds. We should he  brave

enough  to face the people, although what we ourselves

feel  may not be agreeable to certain sections of  the

people. If we know that a thing is not good and yet we

say  it  is  good,  that is not what  is  called  true

democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



That  sort of thing is undesirable for us here as well

as in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no wish to reply point by point to the

arguments put forward by the Barisan Sosialis, because

most of these arguments are not only unacceptable to a

sober mind but also that most of what the Members have

been  saying are no different from something  that  is

undesirable.  But I wish to touch on the point  raised

by  a Member that Singapore he put under the aegis  of

the United Nations.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am indebted to the hon. Member. He

misrepresents me at the moment, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  My

speech  was  directed very briefly to  an  alternative

independence on which I shall he speaking later.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

although  it  appears to me that the hon.  Member  for

Anson  did  not  get  my point, I say  I  respect  the

statements he made in this House. Although  I  do  not

like to debate that matter at length, nevertheless his

proposal represents his own personal view. As for  us,

we  feel that his views are different from ways  which

we  ourselves would choose, because then we  would  be

able  to find a way to bring about something that will

be  in the interests and for the benefit of the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state here clearly, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  this matter is one of national interest, and  it

is  only  right  that everyone who  has  the  national

interest  at heart should fight on national lines.  We

should  give  credit to the efforts made so  far.  And

when  we receive results from the efforts we have  put

in, we carry on our efforts so as to be acceptable  to

all the people we represent. If there are still doubts

in  our minds after that, then the question of Federal

citizenship which we are now demanding is one which we

should  consider very carefully. We should  not  bring

forward points which are not acceptable. What we  must

now do in Singapore - as we can see in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



White Paper - is to achieve some form of merger. By this

we will be able to assure the people of Singapore that

there  are no matters which could be of grave  concern

to  them.  The Government of the Federation of  Malaya

are  really  not  having any fears about  the  Chinese

people or the Barisan Sosialis. But they have a  grave

concern   about  the  Communist  influence.  If   this

influence  is absurd, then no problem arises.  If  the

Malays  in the Federation are afraid of being  swamped

by  other  people, then it means that they  know  that

within  10 or 20 years their number would be  more  or

less  the  same. But those who are not Malays  in  the

Federation  must  be  able  to  convince  their  Malay

brothers  that  they can live together with  them  and

stand  shoulder to shoulder in peace and  harmony,  as

was  shown  by  them  when they  faced  the  emergency

together.  This is a matter of national pride  to  the

people  in the Federation. Because of what took  place

in  1948,  where  there  was  a  big  Communist  armed

movement,  they  have  learnt a  lesson.  They  cannot

forget  this,  and, therefore, they have  to  be  very

careful  all  the time. They have to be on  guard.  If

there had been no emergency then, it is possible  that

Singapore  would have achieved Merdeka  together  with

the  Federation.  But  because of  the  emergency  and

because they know that Singapore is a big base for the

Communist  movement, the Federation of  Malaya,  after

very  carefully  considering the  question  of  giving

Singapore  independence, has kept it in abeyance.  But

in their heart of hearts, they do not wish to separate

Singapore  from the Federation forever. The people  of

the  Federation have the interests of  the  people  of

Singapore at heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi, Mr Speaker, Sir, hurts

my  feelings even more - as a member of the same family

in  Singapore - when he says that the Federation  is  an

alien  country  to Singapore. This  kind  of  talk  is

rather  ungrateful, because they came  here  with  the

assistance of the British. It was because the door  of

Singapore was thrown wide open that they were able  to

come  here  in great numbers. A good number of  people

who had the same view as he had were able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



to  come.  It  is as though someone who is  given  the

calf,  demands the thigh and after that is  given,  he

demands the head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand, Mr Speaker, Sir, is clear. We must be

wary in the matter of bringing about communal feelings

or saying one community is strong and another is weak.

What I say is based on facts. The points raised by the

Malays,  they  say, are matters which are unreasonably

brought  up  by  the  Malays. Matters  concerning  the

rights  of  the Malays must be safeguarded. We  cannot

achieve  the object of national reunification  if  the

weaknesses  of  certain sections cannot  be  remedied.

That can give rise to all sorts of conflict. So let us

not dwell too much on that. As the Malay proverb goes,

it  is  as though the duckling dies of thirst  in  the

pond.  So  what  has been achieved is  really  in  our

interests and to our mutual benefit.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, the Member for Cairnhill  has  quite

aptly  stated that the debate on the motion for merger

is   one  step  in  the  constitutional  progress   of

Singapore.  In  1955,  under the Rendel  Constitution.

there  were  24 elected Members, of whom,  I  believe,

there  are about four old boys still sitting  in  this

Chamber  for the first time. The Member for Anson  was

at  that  time the Chief Minister of the Labour  Front

Government. During his term of office, he  found  that

it  was difficult to work under the limitations of the

Rendel  Constitution, as we had predicted.  Therefore,

the  Member for Anson, then in his capacity  as  Chief

Minister, led a delegation to London in April/May 1956

to  seek  a revision of the Constitution of Singapore.

We were behind the Chief Minister then. Unfortunately,

those  talks  collapsed and it ended in the  isolation

and   resignation  of  Mr  David  Marshall  as  Chief

Minister.  Tun Lim Yew Hock took over the  reins  from

Mr  David  Marshall. Once more in December  1956,  approaches were again made to Whitehall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



for  a  new  Constitution for Singapore.  This  second

constitutional   conference  brought  about   changes,

providing  for internal self-government for Singapore.

hut  foreign affairs and defence remained in the hands

of   the  United  Kingdom  Government.  This  is   the

Constitution under which we are operating today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the tenure of office of Mr David Marshall and

Tun  Lim Yew Flock as Chief Minister, approaches  were

made  to the Federation Government - Tunku Abdul  Rahman

then  was head of the Federation Government - to  solve

the  problem  of the isolation of Singapore  from  the

Federation. That this was SO has been confirmed by the

Prime  Minister  of the Federation in  his  speech  in

Parliament  on  the  18th of October  this  year.  The

Federation Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The subject of merger has not been brought up for

the  first  time  by  the present  Prime  Minister  of

Singapore.'



<br><br>It  was,  in  fact,  brought  up  by  different  Chief

Ministers who were in power be-bore Mr Lee Kuan  Yew,

like  Tun  Lim  Yew  Hock and. I may  say.  Mr  David

Marshall.   Unfortunately,   these   approaches   were

rebuffed, in the words of the Member for Anson. May  I

quote   him  in  Hansard  No.  23,  Volume  14,  dated

2Oth/21st July, 1961, column 1710. This was  what  the

Member for Anson said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are all too conscious that for many

years  now  the Government of Singapore has officially

offered  to  the  Federation merger as  a  constituent

State  unconditionally. I have disclosed that  I  made

that  offer in 1955. I know it was repeated again  and

again, Mr Speaker, up to about the middle of or early

1956.  I have no doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it  has

been  repeated since then. We have each been rebuffed,

sometimes courteously, and sometimes even sharply, on

the offer to merge as a State unconditionally. Yet  it

is  suggested by the Prime Minister that Singapore can

and  will achieve merger with the Federation in  1963,

with  autonomy in education and labour legislation.  I

say  to  you, Sir, that that is a daydream which  they

know  to  he  a day-dream. I do not know whether  they

expect  the  people  to take it  seriously,  but  they

themselves cannot believe in it seriously. We have the

hard  reality  that for six years  now  we  have  been

refused  any kind of opening of official conversations

for a merger. For the last two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



years they have even refused a Common Market. In those

circumstances,  Sir,  I  say that  it  is  the  P.A.P.

leadership   that  is  making  impossible   conditions

leading to the impossibility of merger.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We all heard that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, today,

proposals for merger with Singapore retaining autonomy

in  the  fields of labour and education have now  been

agreed  to  by  the  Government of the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> This is now no longer a day-dream.

If it is anybody who is day-dreaming, it is the Member

for  Anson. The possibility of the realisation of this

objective of merger with Singapore retaining  autonomy

in  labour and education is so real that it has shaken

not  only  the  Member  for  Anson,  but  the  Barisan

Sosialis as well. Of course, both parties tried to get

over this shock by quibbling on the meaning of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not the P.A.P. that is making impossible conditions leading to the impossibility of merger, but I say that it is the Barisan Sosialis who

are  putting forward impossible conditions which  will

not  be  accepted by the Federation Government as  the

basis for merger. They are putting up conditions which

will  not  be acceptable either to the people  in  the

Federation or the people in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Federation of Malaya Agreement was

implemented in 1948, Singapore was excluded  from  the

Federation, but Penang and Malacca became  integrated

into  the  Federation. Since that time  political  and

economic  interests grow more and  more  divergent  in

Singapore  and the Federation, so that today sectional

interests do exist in both territories. It is  because

of the divergent outlook in many spheres, particularly

in  the  fields  of  education and  labour,  that  the

approach to the problem of merger must be made in such

a  way  so that there is no violent clash of sectional

interests.  I  ask  the House not  to  under-rate  the

consequences of disasters which can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



brought  about  by a clash of sectional interests.  We

have  seen historical precedents in India and  Ceylon,

where  there have been disastrous clashes  leading  to

misery  for thousands of people over the questions  of

language, religion and education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is separated from the Federation not only

by  the  Straits of Johore, but also by a gulf in  the

outlook  of the people of both territories in  various

spheres. The physical separation of Singapore from the

Federation  can be immediately bridged by a  man-made

causeway, but I say the differences in mental  outlook

can never be overcome -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> By different education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker) --> <b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen):</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - today or tomorrow, but they

can  only  be overcome gradually with the  passage  of

time   and   mutual  tolerance  and  understanding - two

qualities  which  I  hope the Member  for  Anson  will

cherish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya has honestly made an attempt to study Singapore's special interests which, for the

time being, are incompatible with the Federation's own

interests.  On  this account he said  in  the  Federal

Parliament in October this year (I quote):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Absolute merger, for instance, would cause some

degree  of  uneasiness in the minds of the  people  of

both  territories.  There  are  various  sections   or

interests which have to be taken into account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore where the great majority of people are

Chinese, they naturally want Chinese participation  in

government service without any reservation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who were not born in Singapore would also be

unhappy   at   the   different   qualifications    for

citizenship which are applicable to the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would also not like any control of their

education  policy,  of  their system  and  methods  of

education in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want a free hand in dealing with their labour

problem and greater reserve of powers in order to keep

the sectional interests of the island satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, they would want to retain their

control over their domestic affairs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it would he true to stay that the

people  of  the Federation view with some  nervousness

the prospect of a merger with Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, the predominantly Chinese population

in Singapore have shown strong ties with China and are

inclined towards Chinese chauvinism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evidenced to some extent by the fact that

they even have a Chinese university.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under these circumstances, it is obvious that a

middle  course  acceptable to both the Federation  and

Singapore must be found. The golden mean, as  proposed

in  the  White  Paper,  is for Singapore  to  form  an

integral part of the Federation, but still retaining a

large measure of autonomy in domestic affairs. Such an

arrangement has been compared by the Federation  Prime

Minister as akin to the relationship existing  between

the  United  Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  Now,  this

realistic   approach  by  the  Federation   Government

towards  a  vital problem, instead of being  carefully

examined  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  has, on   the

contrary, brought forth their anger and made them  see

red.  After  delving into the history of  Ireland  and

vaunting  the  facts  of the Sinn  Fein,  a  terrorist

organisation that used violence and murder to  achieve

its  aim  of  an independent Ireland, the  Member  for

Queenstown  gave  this warning. I  quote  him  in  the

Straits Times, dated 22nd November:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the Government in the Federation had the same

motive  for  'merger' as England had for a  union,  if

they  think they could coerce the people of  Singapore

into  subjugation, it is well that they  should  learn

the lessons from the Irish history.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tone of anger, in which this threat was

uttered  will not pass unheeded, and I dare  say  that

there  are qualified historians in the Federation  who

are  not only familiar with Irish history, but who are

also  capable  of reading between the  lines  of  this

warning given by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the Barisan Sosialis shake their

fists  at the Federation and, on the other, they  call

for  a  genuine  merger. But does this not  thoroughly

expose   their   utter  dishonesty  in   moving   this

amendment, that, in fact, they really have  no  desire

for a merger between Singapore and the Federation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenting on the grant of autonomy in education to

Singapore,  the  Federation  Prime  Minister  said  (I

quote):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Having taken into account the feelings of the people

of  Singapore, my colleagues and I have arrived at the

conclusion  that  with  the  situation  prevailing  in

Singapore  it  would he inadvisable to  agree  to  any

proposa1  to  impose  our  education  policy  at  this

particular juncture on the state.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have a reasonable and tolerant approach by

the    Federation   Government   towards   Singapore's

problems.  This  willingness  by  the  Federation   to

recognise  Singapore's special problems has  now  been

smeared in typical Barisan Sosialis style as a  phoney

merger.  We  have our problems - that cannot be  denied - and  these  problems cannot be wiped out by the  magic

slogan  of genuine merger. Slogans cannot solve  human

problems.  They can be solved only by human  qualities

of   reasonableness,  tolerance  and  sincerity.   The

Barisan  Sosialis  say they want  genuine  merger.  By

that,  they  mean  a  full and  complete  merger  with

Singapore  joining  the Federation  as  a  constituent

State like Penang or Malacca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, my colleagues have already dealt with the consequences if such a genuine merger is adopted and I do not want to retread on old ground

that  has already been covered. The Minister  for  Law

has  expertly  explained how automatic citizenship  is

granted under the Federation citizenship laws and  why

a  large  number  of Singapore citizens  not  born  in

Singapore  will  not only not qualify  for  Federation

citizenship,    but   will   lose   their    Singapore

citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not true!



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> It

will be proved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will come to that in a little

while. Let me ask - are the Barisan Sosialis sincere  in

their wanting what they called a genuine merger? In  a

statement explaining the stand of the Barisan Sosialis

on our constitutional future, this is what they said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We fully realise that many of the policies of the

present  Right-wing Government in the  Federation  are

unacceptable to us. The present Federation  Government

is  in  close  alliance with foreign capital:  it  has

bound  the  country  to the so-called  British-Malaya

Mutual Defence Treaty' and turned our motherland  into

a  military base for British armed forces; its foreign

policy  has  alienated our country from the mainstream

of Afro-Asia, particularly Indonesia, Ghana and India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its internal policies are repressive, particularly to

trade unions and intellectuals; freedom of expression,

organisation,  and other civil liberties  are  curbed;

and its educational policy is misguided."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the Barisan Sosialis damns the

Federation Government and here, with their  tongue  in

their cheek, they ask for a genuine merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude of the Barisan Sosialis is like giving

the  Federation a kick in the pants and  then  turning

round  and  saying,  "Let's shake hands."  Here,  very

clearly, is exposed the contradiction of the  Barisan

Sosialis.  It  reveals not only their immaturity,  but

worse of all, their insincerity. So when they talk  of

wanting  a genuine merger, they really intend that  no

merger  can be brought about. If the Barisan  Sosialis

do  not  accept the attitude of the Federation  in  so

many  things, can they expect the people of Singapore,

whom they claim to represent, to accept the conditions

of  a genuine merger with all the implications? Do the

Barisan  Sosialis  expect to  bring  about  merger  by

demanding that the Federation Government agree to what

they do not agree?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson claims that his Party's stand is

one  of complete merger with the Federation and  that

policy on education and labour should come under  the

control of the Federation Government. He had admitted

that  he  had  offered to the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation   Government  unconditional  merger,   but

because  he was rebuffed he had to seek a  new  line.

Not so long ago, Members of this House will recollect

that this very same person -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - sorry, the Member for Anson

wanted   to  convert  Singapore  into  an  independent

territory under the control of the United Nations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a personal explanation, Mr Deputy

Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am indebted to the Deputy Prime

Minister. Will the Leader of the House be fair  enough

to  indicate that it has always been our stand that if

we  cannot  get merger, then we should be  independent

and  within the United Nations? We have never  changed

our stand.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He has indicated his stand - his

second stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He will change again!



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for

Anson always believes in standing on two legs. But let

me tell you how he has found himself a third stand, so

that today we find him standing not on two legs but on

three legs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is the third leg?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will explain to you when the

time comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just let me go on a little bit on what the

Member  for  Anson has to do with the United  Nations.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, it is not that we in this  House

have   any   disrespect   for   the   United   Nations

Organisation,  but  this proposal by  the  Member  for

Anson  can  only  bring  Singapore  into  a  state  of

confusion - as confused as that now existing in his mind

and the Congo. On 15th September, the Member for Anson

sent me a telegram. Permit me to quote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Where was he then?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Please! [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the Member for

Anson  and the Government Bench will behave  and  keep

the decorum of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir. It is not my fault. May I read his telegram:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Your letter 6th contains elements so hopeful for

future have delayed reply to approach issues free from

anger and suspicions caused by the leadership and lies

of your Government and the political propaganda letter

of 26th August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regret that though your letter 6th September deals

with  matters  grave national moment, you  indulge  in

untrue  jibes at political opponents and  petty  party

propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am deeply stirred by your statements that the

arrangements between Singapore and the Federation  are

those  of  a  merger as a State in the Federation  and

that the only difference between Singapore and any one

of  the  other States in the Federation is that  there

will  be  more powers reserved to the Singapore  State

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is true my party and I, despite the past,

will support you with all our heart and all our energy

in sincerity and humanity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is lying party political propaganda we will

fight you and damn you even from prison.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, when he sent me that telegram, he was not

in  prison. He was honeymooning in Australia! It reads

on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Reply your specific questions, my party stands for

complete merger with the Federation. Singapore  should

not  seek special privileges which would set us  apart

from   our   fellow  citizens  and  create  envy   and

antagonism.'



<br><br>And  this  is  where, Mr Deputy Speaker.  Sir,  I  am

utterly confused. Just a few lines in the telegram, he

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If there would be more reserved powers in the

Singapore State Government if this true my party and I

will support you.'



<br><br>Now he comes along and says,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Party stands for complete merger with the

Federation.   Singapore  should   not   seek   special

privileges  which would set us apart from  our  fellow

citizens  and  create  envy and antagonism.  We  fully

understand that this means Central Government  control

of   defence,  external  affairs,  internal  security,

education  and labour and also considerable  financial

sacrifice."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yesterday the Member for Anson was warning

us - particularly   the   Minister   for   Finance   who

unfortunately was not present - that we would be giving

a  cut  of approximately $90 million to the Federation

for  defence.  But  here he has admitted  that  he  is

prepared for this sacrifice -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> For merger!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...Central Government control of defence, external

affairs, internal security, education and labour  and

also  considerable financial sacrifice. All these  we

are   prepared  to  accept  to  establish   a   sound

foundation  for a healthy nation. We prefer  complete

merger  but  are  prepared  to  support  merger  with

special privileges for Singapore...'.



<br><br>Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  this is exactly  what  we  are presenting in this White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not with merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...and no disadvantages, according to the formula

that the only difference between Singapore and any one

of  the  other States in the Federation is that  there

will  he  more powers reserved to the Singapore  State

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he happy to return to Singapore forthwith.'



<br><br>Sir, I am quite lost trying to trace the orbital path

of  the  Member  for Anson. He wanders  from  complete

merger with the Federation to the United Nations, from

the  United Nations to merger with special rights  for

Singapore  and  back to unconditional merger.  I  must

confess   that  it  is  easier  to  follow  Alice   in

Wonderland  - whom  the  Member for  Anson  referred  to

yesterday - than to follow the March Hare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis demand for full internal self-government can only result in Singaporeans being

Singapore  citizens and British Nationals and  British

subjects.    Under   the   White   Paper    proposals,

Singaporeans would be Singapore citizens  and  Federal

Asians.  So the P.A.P. contention is that the  Barisan

Sosialis  objective  of full internal  self-government

really   amounts   to  this.  The   Barisan   Sosialis

supporters,  for  all  these  exuberant  anti-colonial

shoutings,  are reduced to admitting that it  is  more

humiliating  to be a Singapore citizen and  a  Federal

national  than  a  Singapore  citizen  and  a  British

national. They were discomfited to find themselves  in

this  paradox  to which they are driven  logically  by

insisting on full internal self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson - perhaps not deliberately - came

to their rescue by quoting the British Nationality Act

under which all Commonwealth citizens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



are British subjects. Since the Federation is a member

of  the  Commonwealth - so argued the Member for Anson -Federal nationals too would still be British subjects.

The  Barisan Sosialis were so elated and happy at  the

clue  given to them by the Member for Anson and  were

so  delighted  that they had discovered the  straw  to

cling  to,  that the Member for Queenstown chipped  in

with  an  interjection - "Devastating!" The  Member  for

Queenstown  and his associates could not  have  looked

more  grateful  to the Member for Anson,  like  a  dog

which has received a bone from its master. But it is a

bone without meat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 29 of the Federal Constitution provides that

"every  person  who  is a citizen  of  the  Federation

enjoys ...  the status of a Commonwealth citizen ...".  The

term  "British subject" is not used in the  Federation

Constitution. It is true that the British  Nationality

Act,  1948,  provides  that the  expressions  "British

subject"  and  "Commonwealth citizen" shall  have  the

same meaning, but this is only for the purpose of  any

enactment made in the United Kingdom. It cannot  apply

to  the  Federation  to which such enactments  do  not

apply.  Whatever may be the position in  England,  the

status of a citizen of the Federation is only that  of

a  Commonwealth citizen. Now the concept  of  "British

subject" within the framework of the Commonwealth is a

legal fiction - like the legal fiction that a King  can

do   no  wrong - the  Queen  is  at  the  head  of   the

Commonwealth,  and  to this extent all  the  different

nationals  and citizens in the constituent members  of

the  Commonwealth are, for legal convenience, adjudged

British  subjects.  For example,  the  law  for  legal

convenience presumes that every citizen knows the law,

but  as  everybody knows, this is a legal fiction,  as

you will have gathered, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you had

been present in the House yesterday, from some of  the

legal  pronouncements  made  in  the  course  of  this

debate.  Legal  fiction is one thing  and  reality  is

different.  Under  full internal self-government,  the

Member  for Queenstown and his Bansan colleagues  will

be carrying British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



passports. If the Member for Queenstown happens to be

in   Paris   and  gets  into  trouble - not  necessarily

political  though - he would be assisted  and  protected

not by the Malayan Embassy but by the British Embassy.

If  he  is  admitted  to a delegation  in  the  United

Nations - if   ever - he  would  sit  with   the   British

delegation and not with the Malayan delegation. But as

a  Singapore, citizen and a Federation  national,  he

would be carrying the Federation passport and he would

be  looked after by the Malayan Embassy. He would  sit

as  part  of  the  Malayan delegation  in  the  United

Nations. As a Federation national, he would be sitting

in the Federation Legislature in Kuala Lumpur and help

to  shape the defence and foreign policies of  Malaya.

including Singapore. In a self-governing Singapore, he

would  not be able to take pant in shaping the defence

and foreign policies of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think this is an

appropriate time to suspend. We will suspend  to  5.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis

have  kept  on  harping upon the tune that  the  White

Paper has been a sell-out. Let me ask them in what way

the  proposals  as contained in the White  Paper  have

sold  out their rights? Have they sold out the  rights

of  the Member for Queenstown to practise as a medical

doctor?  Have they sold out the rights of  the  Member

for  Hong Lim to practise as an accountant? Have  they

sold  out  the  rights  of the  Member  for  Anson  to

practise at the Bar?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> $90 million.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Have they sold out the rights of

the Member for Pasir Panjang to cut hair? Whose rights

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



been  sold out? If the proposals as contained  in  the

White Paper appear to the Barisan Sosialis to be  like

purgatory, then surely the logical conclusion is  that

the prospects of their type of genuine merger must  he

the road to hell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us sum up the stands of the opposition. The

Barisan's  genuine merger means, as the  Minister  for

Education  has said, never, never merger.  They  speak

with  their tongues in their cheeks. The reason behind

it  all  is  that they want an internal self-governing

Singapore.  The  Member  for Anson  first  fights  for

unconditional  merger;  then  he  wishes  to   convert

Singapore into a territory of United Nations; and then

he  supports merger with special privileges. These are

his  three legs. Sir, give him enough time and we will

find him standing on four legs!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> All animals in the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yesterday the Member for Anson

stated   that  the  Federal  Constitution  could   not

disenfranchise  the  citizens  of  any  State.  It  is

legally  correct.  But  unfortunately  he  avoids  the

realities of the situation. Let me explain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, State nationality by operation of law is

restricted to aborigines in the State - Malays  born  in

the  State and persons born in the State - one of  whose

parents  was  born in the Federation  of  Malaya.  The

qualifications  for  acquiring State  nationality,  in

fact,   are  more  restrictive  than  those  for   the

acquisition of Federation citizenship. And,  in  fact,

every subject of the Ruler could also qualify to be  a

Federal   citizen  under  the  Federation  of   Malaya

Agreement independently of his status as a subject  of

the  Ruler.  In  none  of the Malay  States  were  the

qualifications   for   the   acquisition   of    State

nationality  less  restrictive  than  those  for   the

acquisition of Federation citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the subjects of the Ruler become citizens

of  the  Federation  not by virtue of  the  Federation

Constitution but by virtue of the Federation of Malaya

Agreement,  1948, entered into between the  Rulers  of

the Malay States



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



and  the Queen. They became citizens of the Federation

in  1957  by virtue of the tact that they were already

Federal citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is not true to say that Penang or Malacca

had  no  citizenship  laws before  1948.  The  British

Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, applied to

Penang  and  Malacca,  and  subsequently  the  British

Nationality Act, 1948, so that persons born in  Penang

or  Malacca were British subjects or citizens  of  the

U.K. and Colonies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the status of a subject -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Explanation, if the Minister would

permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged, Sir. I never said, Mr

Speaker,  if  you will remember, that  there  were  no

citizenship  laws in Malacca and Penang. I  said  very

simply,  there were never any citizens  of  Penang  or

Malacca. Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Lastly, the status of a subject of

the   Ruler   today   has  little  significance.   Its

importance stems from this fact - that a person who is a

subject  of  the  Ruler  is  also  a  citizen  of  the

Federation.  But  citizenship  of  the  Federation  is

conferred  not  by State law but by  Federal  law.  In

other  words,  a person who becomes a subject  of  the

Ruler  after 1957 will not ipso facto become a citizen

of  the  Federation. Article 8, paragraph  3,  of  the

Federation Constitution provides that there  shall  be

no  discrimination  in favour of  any  person  on  the

ground that he is a subject of the Ruler of any  State

otherwise  than as set out in Article 8, paragraph  5,

of the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualification for election as a State Legislative

Assemblyman is citizenship of the Federation, and  not

that  of  a  subject of the Ruler.  If  a  citizen  of

Singapore is not therefore a citizen of the Federation

on complete merger, he will, in effect, have no rights

other than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



as  a person ordinarily resident in Singapore. He will

have  no rights, for example, to vote or to stand  for

election  as  a  Member  of the Singapore  Legislative

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson said yesterday that the 4:1

ratio  of  recruitment to the public services  in  the

Federation  does  not apply to the State  service  but

only  to  the Federal service. He is correct.  And  on

this basis, he has advanced the argument that complete

merger  with the Federation will not therefore  affect

civil  servants in Singapore because you  can  have  a

Singapore State Civil Service. But there is one  major

and  important  point that the Member  for  Anson  has

forgotten.  It  is this: that full merger  means  that

several departments in Singapore will no longer remain

under  the  State  service but  will  come  under  the

Federal   service.  For  example,  education,  health,

judiciary,  labour, finance, commerce, industry,  will

all  come  under  the  Federal List.  Full  merger  in

effect,    therefore,   will   bring   many   existing

departments in the Singapore Government directly under

Federal control, and consequently the principle of the

4  : 1 ratio of recruitment to the public service will

apply  to the majority of civil servants in Singapore.

The  State  List in the Federal Constitution  includes

Muslim  law, land, agriculture and forestry  - there  is

not  much  forestry  in  Singapore  - local  government

outside  the  Federal capital (we do  not  have  local

government   today),  other  services   of   a   local

character,  State  works and water, machinery  of  the

State government, State holidays, creation of offences

in respect of any of the matters included in the State

List,   inquiries   for   State  purposes,   including

Commissions  of inquiry and collection  of  statistics

with  respect  to any of the matters included  in  the

State List, indemnity in respect of any of the matters

in  the State List - most important of all, turtles and

riverine  fishing. The situation may perhaps be  saved

if we can import enough turtles into Singapore to keep

our civil servants busy!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Mr Speaker, the Member for Anson is a man

of  law.  I  think  that  is  a  fact  which  we  must

acknowledge.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



As  he  himself has admitted, he has been 25 years  in

the  profession - is it 25? Within that  period  he  has

also  acquired  many  words. But  unfortunately,  more

important, one must also be a man of logic. I have  no

objection  to the verbosity of the Member  for  Anson.

But  the  trouble is this: yesterday he got  not  only

himself  but  also all of us lost in his multitude  of

words.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You are always lost!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> As you said yesterday, Mr

Speaker,  confusion heaps upon confusion. The  -Member

for  Queenstown asked - why did the Tunku suddenly  want

merger  in  spite of his fears? Perhaps we can  recast

the  question. Why did Mr David Marshall and Tun  Lim

Yew  Hock  fail to bring about merger? Sir, I  am  not

discouraging the Member for Anson -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Leader of the House

has  made a slip. He should have said "the Member  for

Anson" and "the Member for Cairnhill".



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I do not intend to disparage

the Member for Cairnhill and the Member for Anson, but

I  want very seriously to bring the correct conclusion

to the House, why today we are able to produce a White

Paper on merger to which the Federation Government has

agreed. I do not say that the Member for Anson is  not

a clever man. [Interruption] No, no, he

is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You know better.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I do not say that David lacks the

wisdom of Solomon! But Solomon is not his middle name.

I  do  not  say that Tun Lim Yew Hock failed to  bring

about  merger because he is unfriendly with the Tunku.

On the other hand -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Leader must remember

that Tun Lim is now the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sorry, Mr Speaker. I do not say

that  the  Member for Cairnhill failed to bring  about

merger  because  he  is  unfriendly  with  the   Prime

Minister of the Federation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



Malaya. On the other hand, he spends more of his  time

in  Kuala  Lumpur  than in Singapore.  I  do  not  say

unabashedly  that merger is now being realised  simply

because  of  the P.A.P. Far from it. The  prospect  of

merger  is now being realised simply because the  time

for  merger  is ripe and the conditions for  achieving

merger  are  fulfilled. Merger cannot  be  imposed  by

Singapore upon the Federation. On the other  hand,  it

is  the  Federation  that must be  willing  to  accept

Singapore  into a merger. The condition then  was  not

the  same as it is today. There was no indication then

that  the British would leave Singapore or would  make

Singapore  an independent State. But as  I  have  said

today, things have changed. And so must our thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, time does not stand still. History

does not remain stagnant. So equally no constitutional

arrangement need be permanent. The Rendel Constitution

under  which  the Member for Anson operated  as  Chief

Minister  was not permanent. The existing Constitution

under  which  we  operate today is not  permanent.  So

neither  will'  the  proposed arrangement  for  merger

between Singapore and the Federation be permanent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreements owe their existence so long as they are

acceptable   to   the  parties  which   contract   the

agreements.  Agreements,  if  they  are  to  work  out

smoothly,  must be bilateral, and not be  unilaterally

imposed by one party upon another party. The heads  of

agreement  for  a  merger between  Singapore  and  the

Federation have been arrived at and presented in  this

White Paper because they are in accord with prevailing

conditions  and  the mood in the two  territories.  So

also  they  can be altered in the future to  suit  the

prevailing mood of the future. As the Federation Prime

Minister  has said, the agreement is a matter relating

only  to  State  and Federal Lists. If at  some  later

stage  it  is  thought  right  and  desirable  in  the

national  interests that we should revert  from  State

Lists to Federal Lists, then, of course, we can always

take  the proper steps. Our task. Sir, at the present,

is to take care of the present so that the future will

not be jeopardised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

the third Session of this Legislative Assembly opens,

merger between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya

dominates every other issue. So we are told, Sir, by

the Government, and so it is. That is why we are

spending so many days debating this issue of merger.

That merger is of the utmost importance to the people

of Singapore, as it is to the people of the Federation

of Malaya, nobody denies. That economically Singapore

cannot survive if isolated from the Federation, nobody

denies. That merger of the two territories is in the

interest of both the territories, we are all fully

agreed upon. But then this amendment is being moved in

this House because certain misunderstandings have

arisen as a result of certain parties trying to

confuse the word "merger" with some form of closer

association that is envisaged in the Tunku's proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest we on this side of the House be labelled

anti-merger,     anti-nationalists,    pro-Communists,

Communist-inspired, or what have  you,  let  me  state

categorically here, Sir, that in so far as the Barisan

Sosialis   is   concerned,  we  stand  unconditionally

committed  to a merger which we define as the  genuine

reunification and complete integration of the  peoples

and  territories  of Singapore and the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the process of the debate in this House, my

leader,  the  Member for Queenstown, has unfortunately

been  misunderstood and misquoted by certain  Members,

particularly the Member for the Southern  Islands  and

the  Member  for Geylang Serai. I would  like  to  put

things straight here, Sir, and to state, on behalf  of

my  Party,  that  we  have never  attacked  the  Prime

Minister of the Federation in any way in this  debate.

To us. Tunku Abdul Rahman is not a politician. He is a

statesman.  We  respect him,  Sir,  because  he  is  a

statesman and he puts the interest of the country  and

the  people  before  his  own interest,  quite  unlike

certain  other politicians who are quite incapable  of

doing  that.  We have never stated that we  disrespect

the  Tunku.  We  only say that in so far  as-  we  are

concerned, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



disagree with certain of his policies; just as  in  so

far  as  U.M.N.O. or the S.P.A. can  say  that  they

disagree  with our policies. But, Sir, we  have  never

attacked  or embarked upon an attack on the person  of

the  Tunku himself. We respect him as a leader of  his

people elected and loved by his people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who are the people?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The people who voted him, of

course.  Surely  it is not my duty here  to  speak  on

parliamentary democracy to clarify such things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Chicken-hearted!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Who is chickenhearted? I beg your

pardon, Sir. I should actually be looking at you. But,

Sir, having said these things, having stated our stand

on  merger, it does appear a little confusing that  we

should  have  moved an amendment to a  motion  of  the

Government which only seeks agreement on the principle

of  merger.  Let me quote, Sir, the last paragraph  of

the Minister for Labour when he moved this motion.  He

considered that it was not necessary. This is  in  the

Straits Times of 21st November:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It was not necessary to have a long debate. What was

required was for each Member to declare his stand  for

the record.'



<br><br>Our  stand  is clear. We stand committed to  full  and

genuine merger. But then why is there a necessity  for

an  amendment? The answer is very clear and simple. It

is because the Government has attempted to confuse the

issue and, to borrow a phrase by the Member for Queens-town,  has attempted to pass off fish eyes for pearls,

or  to  pass  off  a dog's meat for mutton  by  merely

exhibiting  a  sheep's head. That  the  Government  is

trying  to  positively confuse the people of Singapore

is  undoubted. Even the leader of the S.P.A.,  in  the

person of the Member for Cairnhill, has said so  much.

In  view of this blatant attempt to pass off a form of

association  that  is  not a  merger  for  merger,  it

becomes  very  necessary for us  to  define  the  word

"merger",  so  that when we say we stand committed  to

merger, the people of Singapore and the people in this

House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



will  understand what we mean. If we take a good  look

at  the  Order  Paper of the day we will notice,  Sir,

that  the  first item on the Order Paper  asks  us  to

state our stand on principle whether we support or  do

not  support  merger. In item 3, Sir, on the  reverse,

there  is  a  motion by the Prime Minister  That  this

House  accepts the heads of agreement set out  in  the

White  Paper  Cmd. 33 of 1961 agreed  to  between  the

Governments  of  the  State  of  Singapore   and   the

Federation  of  Malaya  as  a  working  basis  for   a

reunification of the two territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In item 1, we have merger. We commit ourselves to the

principle  of  merger.  So  automatically  we   commit

ourselves to item 3. But the Government, Sir, has been

very   clever,  very  shrewd  indeed  in  having  very

discreetly left out the word "merger" in item 3.  That

brings  me  now to this memorandum Cmd.  Paper  33  of

1961. The intention of the Government, Sir, is to  get

everybody  committed, in item  No.  1,  to  merger  in

principle and therefore committed in item No.  3,  and

it  has  been  shrewd  enough to leave  out  the  word

"merger" in item No. 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961. In page 1,

clause 2 - Agreement in



Principle:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On 23rd August, 1961, agreement was reached in

principle   between  the  Prime   Ministers   of   the

Federation of Malaya and Singapore for a merger of the

two territories.'



<br><br>A  merger. So this motion pertains to an agreement  as

set  out in the White Paper Cmd. 33; the word "merger"

is  missing  in  this motion, but in  the  Cmd.  Paper

itself, it defines the set of agreements as merger. So

to  all intents and purposes, if we agree in principle

to  the first motion, it is not possible for us not to

agree in principle to the third motion, because it  is

the  same.  It is because of this deliberate  attempt,

Sir,  to confuse the word "merger" that we have  found

it necessary to introduce an amendment to clarify this

man-made and indeed P.A.P.-made confusion on the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on this confusion, Sir, I would like to

touch on what the Member for Cairnhill said. He waxed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



eloquent on the whole issue. Before I go on to mention

more  about his speech, Sir, I would like  to  make  a

curious  observation to this House. During  the  first

year  of  the  existence of the People's Action  Party

Government,   the   Government  was   preoccupied   in

attacking   the   personalities  of  the   Opposition,

particularly, the Member for Cairnhill, the Member for

Farrer  Park  and all the worthy Members  who  sit  in

front of us. During the second year of existence,  its

attack  shifted  slightly to my left; and  during  the

third year of existence its attack has been pinpointed

to  focus  on the Barisan Sosialis, having  completely

forgotten  about  S.P.A.  Not  one  Member  from   the

Government benches, Sir, has thought fit to  rebut  or

to argue against the arguments of the Member for Cairnhill.  In  the  Prime Minister's radio  series  of  12

speeches, there was not a single instance in which the

S.P.A. was attacked. The P.A.P., Sir, is supposed  to

be  a  socialist party, and the S.P.A. is a Right-wing

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come back to the Member for Cairnhill. He

starts  off  by  saying, or at least by attacking  the

P.A.P.  Government for passing off some form of closer

association   or   relationship   between   the    two

territories as merger. I quote, Sir, the Straits Times

of the 23rd of November:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tun Lim said the unfortunate thing was that the

P.A.P.  Government  had  tried to  describe  something

which  was not merger as a merger, and thereby  caused

these misunderstandings in the minds of many people.'.



<br><br>Again he says, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"This closer relationship is definitely not merger,"

...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Prime Minister of the Federation had said it

was  more  correct  to describe it  as  a  very  close

relationship or association.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established the point, Sir, that what the

P.A.P. presents to us is not a merger, he turns  round

and  attacks  the Barisan Sosialis for saying  exactly

the same thing and for trying to define or to clarify

the  word "merger". Sir, if he were sincere and if  he

were honest-[Interruption] I beg your pardon. I  never  said

he was dishonest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Nee Soon

unfortunately  is  so  close  to  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  that  he  even hears  a  murmur,  which

nobody else hears. I would suggest that he turn  a

deaf  ear  to  murmurs,  but  open  his  ears   to

interjections.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Just a passing remark, Sir.

As  a medical man, it is very difficult to turn  a

deaf  ear to murmurs because murmurs are the basis

on  which congenital heart diseases are diagnosed.

In any case, Sir -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose the Member for Nee

Soon  would then like to ask permission to  bring

his stethoscope here?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> It is in no way showing

disrespect to the Chair, Sir. You see. Sir, I have

not the advantage of a wig to cover my ear and  it

is  a  little  difficult when the murmurs  are  so

close to completely ignore such murmurs. But, Sir,

I  shall  try  to  look at you  as  frequently  as

possible so that I will not be misled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

says  that  the P.A.P. is dishonest in  trying  to

pass   off  some  form  of  association  that   is

definitely  not merger for merger, and in  another

breath  he says merger is merger and where is  the

necessity  for merger to be qualified or  defined?

If  he  were sincere  - I am not saying he was  not.

Sir,  there can be degrees of sincerity, and there

can  be  degrees of honesty  - and if he were honest

he would have had to support our amendment because

our  amendment seeks just to clarify and to define

the  word merger. All that the amendment seeks  to

do is to say that we should all agree in principle

to  merger  and that merger should  be  a  genuine

merger. The Member for Cairnhill says a merger  is

a merger. Why should there be a genuine merger and

a  false  merger? But, Sir, if the P.A.P. persists

in  passing off a phoney merger for a merger, then

there  must  necessarily by  argument  be  also  a

genuine merger quite opposite to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



phoney  merger.  The  Member for  Cairnhill  goes

further to say, "We are against this amendment but

we  are  not  against a merger that is genuine;  a

merger  that brings Singapore into the  Federation

as  an  integral part of the Federation where  all

citizens  of  Singapore enjoy  the  same  rights."

Where is the logic? That is exactly what we say we

must fight for. That is exactly the same thing  he

says  he  must fight for, and yet he  opposes  the

amendment!  His  Party was against  the  amendment

because   it   considers  the   additional   words

redundant. He himself has set out to show that the

merger presented by the P.A.P. is only a form  of closer

relationship,  and therefore  not  a  true merger.  We  therefore prove to

him the  necessity for  an  amendment and he opposes  the

amendment. Enough of that, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say is that the Barisan Sosialis amendment to this motion would have never come up

if  the Government had been honest and sincere  in

the  application  of the word  "merger"  in  their

motion  and  subsequently in their Command  Paper.

But,  Sir, let us again have a look at the  Member

for  Cairnhill. Why is it necessary for the Member

for  Cairnhill to defend one issue and yet  attack

the  same  issue when he himself tries to  confuse

the  whole  issue? I would submit, Sir,  that  the

Member  for Cairnhill has got dual loyalties,  not

personalities.  On  the one hand,  Sir,  his  very

close association with the Tunku, which may  be  a

very  good  thing for Singapore,  Sir,  we  admit,

urges his inner self to support the P.A.P. as much

as  possible in so far as this Tunku's  merger  is

concerned.  On the other hand, Sir, by  supporting

the  P.A.P. merger too far, he may very well  earn

the  displeasure  of  his own  colleagues  in  the

S.P.A. because they do not want him to  help  the

P.A.P.,   although  the  P.A.P. would   certainly

welcome  that help, seeing that they  need  it  so

much   nowadays.   And  thus  torn   between   two

loyalties, not exactly two personalities,  he  has

balance this way and balance that way and although

we  were all overcome by his eloquence, his  logic

has not been so overpowering as his eloquence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



It is not my intention here, Sir, to weigh between his

logic  and  his eloquence and to advise which  one  to

accept.  But  I  consider it my  duty  to  expose  the

weaknesses  of his argument, because if  his  argument

had  been strong, and if he had not been contradictory

himself,  he  would  have had no  alternative  but  to

support  the  amendment. So having  said  nice  things

about how he wishes to support Government, he feels it

is  necessary also to attack the Government because we

all  know. Sir, the political situation today is  that

both  the P.A.P. and the S.P.A. are fighting  for  the

support  of the Right-wing faction of the voters,  the

English-educated   faction,  because   the   Left-wing

faction is now completely behind the Barisan Sosialis.

Sir,  they  are fighting for a common pool. To  borrow

the  words of the Prime Minister, they are tapping the

same  reservoir, sinking the same pipes into the  same

substrata  of  the  earth,  tapping  the  same  oil  -

[Interruption].  I  am glad the Minister  said,  "same

sewer",  because I was referring to the P.A.P. tapping

it.  I  am  so glad. I am indebted to him. I was  very

glad  that I heard that murmur, because, for the first

time,  we hear the P.A.P. admitting that from  tapping

oil,  they have changed to tapping sewerage. So,  Sir,

having  to  fight for the same group  of  people  they

become  at  loggerheads with each other.  They  either

merge or they fight. It is not for me, Sir, here



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was waiting for the hon. Member

to  pull  himself back. He is going so very, very  far

away,  as far away as the Member for Changi went,  and

that  was the time I pulled the Member for Changi back

very  gently. I hope the Member for Nee Soon will pull

himself back.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Sir, I am much obliged

for your advice. I just wanted to labour on one point,

that  the Member for Cairnhill took that line because,

on  the  one  hand, he had to support merger;  on  the

other  hand, he would not want to go so far in support

of  merger  that  he loses his own  following  to  the

P.A.P. That is all I wanted to impress upon the House,

Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill, having made a sort of

political  analysis  as to how the  motion  should  be

dealt with, then felt that if he pursued the line  too

far, he might very well get into difficulties and  get

himself  exposed. So before long he changed  his  tune

and  changed  his  line  and  talked  about  frivolous

things.  That was the occasion, Sir, when  I  had  the

advantage of his very nice disposition to allow me  to

interject,  and I find, for that, the newspapers  have

put a photograph of myself in the papers -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> With a lovely beard also!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Unfortunately, the photograph was

not quite clear -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You look handsome!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you. The Member for

Cairnhill likened merger to a marriage. Although it is

a  bit  frivolous, I must say that it is a  very  good

simile  because,  by  definition,  a  merger  is   the

complete  integration  of two groups  of  people,  two

corporations, or two units of anything  you  may  have

into  one, so that the separate identities merge  into

one    common   identity.   So   is   marriage,   Sir.

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, I will limit myself to

rebuts  from  the  Front Benchers. I will  not  bother

about  the  Back-Benchers. So  to  liken  marriage  to

merger  is  indeed a very skilful way of  arguing  why

merger should be defined, because though marriage  can

be  legally defined, we still can have so many form of

marriages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The Women's

Charter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The Women's Charter allows

polygamy in respect of Muslims, of course. Still, that

is a legal definition of marriage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Muslims are not included in the Women's

Charter. Muslims are not monogamous.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Talking of marriages, I was very

interested  to  read  an  account  of  the   different

possible  types  of  marriages in a  book  of  Chinese

fiction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are going for fiction -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have, of course, indicated that

I  will try not to intervene as much as I can help it.

I  was  just wondering whether this discourse  on  the

types of marriages will help us in this debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, just as the Member for

Cairnhill has compared marriages to merger, so I would

like  to  show  that there can be  so  many  types  of

marriages and so many types of merger. In embarking on

this  course, if you feel that I am not keeping within

the  confines of the subject under debate, I  will  be

glad to drop it. So may I pursue, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> For a little while.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> This is a book on Chinese stories

from  the  tenth  to  the  seventeenth  centuries.  It

describes   a  young  girl  who,  unfortunately,   was

separated from her parents and found herself,  because

of   the  hard  realities  of  life,  in  a  house  of

disrepute.  The adopted mother found it  difficult  to

persuade the girl to accept her first client -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is going into

those  details,  we might find him going  further  and

further into details which may not be proper for  this

House  to  hear.  Let  us perhaps forget  about  these

Chinese  marriages and come to the "marriage"  of  the

Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Since I have gone more than half-way through the story - there is only a little bit more,

Sir - you  might allow me to carry on so  that  I  can

drive my point home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this mother got a friend to talk to this girl and

the girl said, "I am a reputable girl from a reputable

family.  I shall only consent to marriage and  nothing

else." So the friend who had the gift of the gab said,

-

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> From the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - "It is all very well for you to

get  married, but do you know that there are so  -many

types  of  marriages? There are,  for  instance, true

marriage, sham marriage, sad marriage, happy marriage,

marriages  that  are timely, marriages  of  necessity,

marriages  that  end  well,  and  marriages  that  end

badly." I had intended, Sir, to go into a little  more

detail  in  the  definitions of these  marriages,  but

since  it might not meet with your approval,  I  shall

close the book now, and let in one more - marriages  of

convenience.  I  shall labour a  little  bit  more  on

marriages  of convenience. These marriages still  take

place  today  in  Singapore. In fact,  I  was  at  the

Immigration Office only a few days ago -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The wrong office.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - and I heard the story of

another  woman  who used this trick of  getting  into

Singapore. We know that there are a lot of nice young

ladies in Hongkong who wish to come into Singapore  but they could only come in, Sir, if they had -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A genuine marriage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b>- definite grounds to enter

Singapore.   And   one  of  the  grounds - compassionate

perhaps,  I  do  not  know: it may have  been  stopped

today.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

order.  Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Nee Soon  has

been  talking about the different kinds of -marriages.

I  suggest  that he can talk about this  subject  when

there is a Bill on marriages.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would like to give way to ladies. But

I  cannot see that that is a point of order. That is a

point for argument. But I do suggest to the Member for

Nee  Soon - talking about marriage - that he had  better

come to the point as soon as he can.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I was not talking of pre-marital

relationships. I was only talking of marriages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was talking about marriages of convenience and

young girls in Hongkong find -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think every Member in this

Assembly knows what a marriage of convenience  is.  So

please  do  not define it. We know what  marriages  of

convenience are.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, just as there are many forms

of  marriages, so there are many forms of merger: true

merger,   genuine  merger,  phoney  merger,   sell-out

merger,  merger  that is pursued for  the  purpose  of

saving  the  skin  of a small group  of  people.  When

people  lose their support, they look for other  means

of  support. When a building is about to collapse they

either  pull  it  down or patch it  with  planks,  and

support  it  with props and carry on for a little  bit

longer,   although   ultimately  the   building   will

collapse,  [Interruption]. But in  view  of  the  many

types of possible mergers, it surely behoves us,  Sir,

in this Chamber, enacting laws on behalf of the people

of  Singapore to see that if we talk about merger,  we

mean  what we are talking about. My leader, the Member

for Queenstown, [Interruption] -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I ask Members of this

Assembly  not  to  interject  if  they  can  help  it,

otherwise  we will never finish this debate which  has

gone  on for four days? This is the fifth day. Perhaps

the  Speaker might be prompted to accept a motion  for

the closure if interruptions go on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The necessity, Sir, for us to

amend the motion so as to define the word "merger" has

been  emphasised  by the Member for  Queens-town.  But

unfortunately  after he finished, other  Members  have

stood up to confuse the issue again, so that confusion

mounts  upon confusion - as you have said, Sir -  and  it

becomes  necessary  for me to  clarify  a  little  bit

again.  I  shall not go on for a marathon  session.  I

shall  just  mention  a  few things  which  should  be

emphasised and re-emphasised. It is very necessary  to

define what "merger" is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> On a point of

clarification. Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Can the hon. Member term a pro-Communist or a Communist merger as a temporary or a

genuine merger?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Nee Soon understand

that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> If the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Home Affairs is not able to  express

himself  clearly in English, I will  not  mind  if  he

expresses himself in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can we term a

pro-Communist or a Communist merger as a temporary  or

a genuine merger?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Hon. Members must realise that

when  they  rise for elucidation, they must  rise  for

elucidation of some part of the speech that  has  been

made.  I  do not know whether the Member for Nee  Soon

has  mentioned a pro-Communist or a Communist type  of

merger - at least not for the moment. Dr Sheng.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, I was saying that if the

P.A.P. were sincere when they said merger,  we  would

have  accepted  it, but even the Member for  Cairnhill

has  said that they are not sincere. So as it  is  not

possible for us to accept what they mean when they say

merger  it becomes necessary for us to get that merger

defined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am not digressing too far, I may mention another

instance  of how the words of a person who  is  crafty

and   cunning  cannot  be  accepted  unless  they  are

defined.  I had a friend in Hongkong who went  into  a

curio shop to buy a bit of china. He was, like myself,

very unceremoniously dressed without a coat and tie - as

they  are not wont to do in Hongkong - and he asked  the

price of a very nice-looking curio piece. He was  told

that  it was $500. As the salesman did not expect  him

to  buy  it, he just quoted the genuine price  without

haggling. When my friend showed interest in that curio

and expressed a desire to buy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



it,  the saleman immediately told him, "$500. Yes, but

American dollars". The difference, Sir, is six  times.

One  American dollar is six Hongkong dollars. We  know

the  craftiness of such people and we know that people

in  this  House  are  capable of the  same  degree  of

craftiness. We know that the Prime Minister is  a  man

who is very shrewd. I try to be parliamentary, Sir. I

had  intended to say "crafty", hut I thought that  you

might  rule  that as unparliamentary for a  person  in

this  House.  In any case, "shrewd" and "crafty"  mean

the same thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember an occasion in this House when the Prime

Minister stood up to speak on a very important  issue.

He  told the House, "We in the P.A.P. lay our cards on

the  table  so  that everybody can  see  that  we  are

sincere and can understand us and sympathise with us."

I  took him as a sincere man then. I took him to  mean

that as the cards were on the table he had nothing  to

hide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think he misquoted the Prime

Minister.  The Prime Minister said, "We lay  cards  on

the table. But only fools turn them face upwards!"



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I was coming to that, Sir. Thank

you  for helping me to develop the theme. I was saying

the  Prime Minister told the Opposition that the cards

were  on  the table, meaning that the P.A.P. was  not

hiding  anything.  "Here are the facts.  You  see  for

yourself. You judge for yourself. The P.A.P. has  done

right."  And when the Member for Farrer Park (I  think

it  was  him, Sir) jumped up to ask him, "face  up  or

face  down?", he said, "Face down, of course, because

only fools put their cards face up." Sir, it might  be

an excellent repartee, but it certainly does not speak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



well for the Prime Minister's sincerity. Thanks to the

Minister for Culture for helping me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I knew you were coming to that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> So in the case of people who have

no  intention of being sincere to the Opposition,  how

can  we  accept  their words unless we  confine  their

words  to  the  meaning  of  the  words  by  attaching

qualifications to those words? It is now  quite  clear

that  I have told the House of the insincerity of  the

people opposite, and in dealing with insincere people,

one must be very careful. When one buys something from

them,  and  they  say, "$500", we had better  add  the

words "Straits" or "Malayan", before they jump up  and

say, "American", as they are wont to look for American

dollars nowadays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill admitted to bootlicking in

Kuala Lumpur. I thought he admitted. If I am wrong,  I

stand  to  be  corrected, Sir. And  he  described  the

action of the Prime Minister as something that is more

than  bootlicking, and I would not  venture  to  think

what can be more degrading than bootlicking. If I were

to  use  my medical student day language, I  am  sure,

Sir, you will rule me out of order. Suffice it to  say

that  the  P.A.P., when they were in  the  Opposition,

said  that in dealing with the Federation, they should

not  be  in  a  position of supplicants  claiming  for

favour. Now that they are in the government, they  are

indeed mendicants asking for alms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have said enough of the Member for

Cairnhill, and now to come to the Minister for

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is not here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The Minister for Finance - in the

Straits Times, 22nd November, headlines in bold type:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Barisan's Aim is to Topple Tengku's Govt., says Goh' -

<br><br>trying to sour up relationship between the Barisan

Sosialis and the Tunku.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Finance, Dr Goh Keng Swee, told

the   Legislative  Assembly  today  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis had stated in practically so many words  that

their  objective in merger was eventual  overthrow  of

the   "right  wing  feudalistic  Government"  in   the

Federation by strengthening the struggle against it.'



<br><br>I  have  said,  Sir, we have all the respect  for  the

Tunku.  But that does not mean, Sir, that we  are  not

privileged  to  disagree with his policy.  After  all,

Sir,  we  are  a parliamentary democracy, which  means

that each group of people or each political Party may

present  their Party programme to the people  and  let

the  people choose. And if we are not allowed  to  do

that, then where. Sir, is parliamentary democracy? The

Barisan  Sosialis had never advocated that  we  should

overthrow  the Tunku by bloody revolution or  anything

of  that  sort. We believe in parliamentary democracy.

We  disagree  with certain policies  of  the  Alliance

Government.  We  adopt  the  constitutional   way   in

presenting  our own policies to the people  and  fight

and  struggle for the people to accept our  policy  so

that  we  may  implement them for the benefit  of  the

people.  That, Sir, is fair and square.  The  way  the

Minister  for  Finance put it is certainly  a  blatant

attempt  to sour the relationship between  the  Tunku

and us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now, Sir, turn to the P.A.P. political bible.

I  have  got  two of them here. In case  they  cannot

recognise  it, the P.A.P. symbol is there. It  is  the

Fourth Anniversary Souvenir of the P.A.P. published in

1958.  Sir,  my intention in quoting certain  relevant

sections in this book is to state in exactly  as  many

words  as  the Minister for Finance said that  it  was

also the intention of the P.A.P. Government in 1958 to

topple  the Right-wing feudalistic Government  in  the

Federation.  It is exactly the same intention  of  the

P.A.P. What the Barisan Sosialis seeks to do today  is

exactly what the P.A.P. sought to do in 1958.  It  is

because  the  Barisan Sosialis has kept  the  straight

path of the P.A.P. whilst the P.A.P. has deviated that

we are different today. In page 2:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The creation of an independent, democratic, non-Communist Socialist Malaya (Federation plus Singapore)

is  a task which will occupy our whole life-time. They

are  enduring  objectives  for  which,  as  socialists

seeking  a just system of organising society, we  must

always strive.'



<br><br>We   must   always  strive  to  change  a   Right-wing

feudalistic society into a Socialist society. What  do

the  P.A.P. strive to do today, Sir? They  strive  to

sour the relationship between the Bansan Sosialis  and

the  Tunku because they have deviated from this stand,

and the Barisan has maintained this stand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Huh!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Do I hear a laugh? Or is it a

sneer?  Sometimes people, when their conscience  hurts

them  for  the  wrong things they have done  to  other

people, sneer at themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the P.A.P. said in 1958 that they must

strive  to fight for a socialist Malaya, they  implied

that  the  Tunku's  Government  was  not  a  socialist

government. They meant that they must strive to topple

the   Tunku's  Government  by  parliamentary  and   by

democratic  means. Let us see what else they  have  to

say  in this political bible of theirs. Talking about

the need for merger, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This is even more true now than four years ago. For

to  achieve  freedom  in  an island  we  must  achieve

merger ... the British obstructed us [in  the  earlier

part] ... Now  the  Alliance led by  U.M.N.O. rules  the

Federation and they thwart our hopes of merger ...'



<br><br>And  why  does  the  Alliance  Government  thwart  the

P.A.P.'s   hopes  for  merger?  Why  is  the  Alliance

Government  anti-merger? The P.A.P. gave two  reasons.

They  are  so well known today that they do  not  bear

repetition.  But  lest  the P.A.P. forget  their  own

argument, I shall just remark in passing that the  two

main  reasons  are  too  many  Chinese  and  too  many

Leftists. And how should they go about resolving these

difficulties?  In  respect of too many  Chinese,  they

have a paragraph here which can, I think, resolve  the

difficulties. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It must be demonstrated to three million Malays in

the  Federation  that  the  one  million  Chinese   in

Singapore are ready, willing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



and  able  to  be absorbed as one Malayan people,  all

able to speak Malay, and willing to work together  for

the  economic betterment and upliftment of the  Malays

as  equals  of the other races. Malay fears  that  the

Chinese  wilt  outnumber  and  overcome  them  in  the

economic,   social  and  cultural  fields   of   human

endeavour must be dispelled. The Malays will  want  to

be  satisfied that their language and culture are  not

relegated   to  second  place.  Hence  the   paramount

importance  of settling once and for all what  is  the

premier  language of Malaya. It is for us in a  mainly

Chinese  Singapore  to show that we  accept  this  and

welcome  any  steps  to make the  Malay  language  the

national language spoken by all.'



<br><br>It   is  possible,  Sir,  to  resolve  the  Federation

Alliance's  fear  that there are too many  Chinese  in

Singapore.  And  the answer is there,  Sir,  a  common

culture,  a common language. And it is untrue  to  say

that   all  -the  people  of  Singapore  are   Chinese

chauvinists.   Let   us   -look   around,   Sir,   the

Backbenchers  on the Government side. The  Member  for

Kallang returned from a division that is predominantly

Chinese.   The   Member  for  Bukit   Timah   from   a

constituency that is predominantly Chinese. The Member

for Kampong Kapor - predominantly Chinese. The Member

for  Ulu Pandan - predominantly Chinese. It shows, Sir,

that  the Chinese people in Singapore are not all that

much  Chinese chauvinistic. It shows that with  proper

leadership, a proper education system, it is  possible

to  build  a Malayan nation. "Too many Chinese"  fears

can  be  resolved. And all these Members, Sir,  fought

against Chinese candidates who play the communal line,

the  Chinese  chauvinism line. And they won!  And  not

only  won,  but won comfortably on the  stand  of  the

P.A.P. which today has become the stand of the Barisan

Sosialis.  It  is unnecessary for me, Sir,  to  labour

further  on this business of too many Chinese, because

it is not the fear of the Federation Alliance leaders.

The real fear is too many Leftists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how the P.A.P. goes about trying to

resolve this problem of too many Leftists. I know this

book  very well, Sir, as I have read it many times.  I

think  it is well worth reading many more times again.

But I fail to find in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



any  section,  in any paragraph, in any sentence,  the

P.A.P.'s  solution to this problem. Of  course,  today

the  P.A.P. will say, "Let us forget about socialism.

Therefore we can get a merger." But if they said so in

1958,  they would not be here in this House.  So  they

did  not  say  that. All they said, Sir, was  that  in

Malaya,  where  the majority of the votes  belong  to

people who are poor, if the system of one man one vote

is to be operated, a government that is pledged to the

poor workers, poor peasants, under-privileged people,

must  necessarily  win, and therefore  socialism  must

necessarily win the political battle for  the  minds

and  hearts  of  the people. And if socialism  is  put

against  Communism,  socialism  is  far  superior   to

Communism  because  it  avoids bloodshed,  revolution,

unnecessary  trials and tribulations. And,  therefore,

if  a  more  egalitarian society is  to  be  built  in

Malaya,  a socialist system is infinitely superior  to

the  Communist system, with which, Sir, I fully agree.

I  fully agree. They did not give an answer to how to solve this problem of too many Leftists. They give the

answer  today. Let us deviate. Let us go  towards  the

Right;  let us forget about socialism; then the answer

will be found, and the problem will be solved. Let  us

see in what language the P.A.P. stated these facts. In

page 5 of this political bible, they said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are Democratic Socialists, not Communists, and we

believe  in  achieving the socialist  society  through

peaceful  methods of persuasion, and the vote  through

the political machinery of the democratic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Malaya wants to create a socialist society without

inter-racial strife, it can only be through  the  more

tolerant  and  humane  road of  Democratic  Socialism.

Because  socialists believe in revolution by  consent,

not  revolution  by  violence, they  are  provided  in

Malaya with the best conditions for success. The  less

uncompromising  method  of  persuasion   through   the

democratic system ensures that social changes are  not

forced against emotional and violent resistance of the

people.'



<br><br>Today the Minister for Finance sees fit to attack  the

Barisan  Sosialis for a stand which they  embraced  in

1958.  If  that is not proof of the P.A.P.'s  Rightist

deviation,  what  is? Let us examine the  motive  that

leads to the so-called P.A.P. merger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



today.  Will  the P.A.P. merger help  to  resolve  the

economic problem that we are faced with? The Tunku  is

the  best  judge. He says, "No, not to an  appreciable

extent."  What  then is the purpose of  this  merger?

Again let us hear what the Tunku has to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The merger's main consideration is political,

political  in  the sense that socialism  or  Communism

should not invade this part of the world.'



<br><br>And according to the P.A.P. definition, it says that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is apparent from the statements that are made

from  time to time by Federation Alliance leaders that

they  make  no  clear  distinction between  Democratic

Socialists and Communists.'



<br><br>I repeat, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...that the Alliance leaders make no clear

distinction   between   Democratic   Socialists    and

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything Left is viewed with apprehension. For

anything  that is Left is thought to be  Communist  or

potentially  Communist.  There  is  no  line   between

Democratic  Socialism and Communism. So  in  order  to

check  the  advance of Democratic Socialism, Communism

can easily be invoked.'



<br><br>It reads again, and this is the important point:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Malays are devout Muslims. And Islam is a

powerful  religion  which  is  anti-Communist.   Malay

leaders  always  find  in the emotional  loyalties  of

Malays  to  Islam  a powerful and easy  resistance  to

invoke against Communism. So any group of men who  are

not  only  anti-Communist but also anti-Socialist  and

anti any change towards a more egalitarian society...'



<br><br>That   was  the  P.A.P.'s  objective - towards  a   more

egalitarian society.



<br><br>It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...any group of men who are anti any change towards a

more  egalitarian society, can easily blur  the  lines

between Democratic Socialism and Communism, and invoke

the   ready,   made   resistance  against   Democratic

Socialism by labelling it Communism.'



<br><br>We  have  seen the application of this theory  by  the

Prime  Minister of Singapore, who also was responsible

for  writing  this very sentence into  this  political

bible of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, the motive of this merger is neither

economic  nor  in  the  interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore. It is a political motive and that political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



motive  is the obstruction of socialism developing  in

this  country.  The  obstruction  of  the  spread   of

socialism  in this country. If that is the motive  for

merger  today, it certainly is diagonally opposite  to

the  motive  in the P.A.P. political bible which  says

that we should seek merger for the purpose of creating

a socialist society. The merger today, Sir, is for the

purpose  of  retarding, negating, making it impossible

for the creation of a socialist society. This point is

important, Sir, because the P.A.P. always argues  that

it  had a mandate from the people to bring about  this

merger.  I submit, Sir, that the P.A.P. had a  mandate

from the people only for a merger which would lead  to

socialism   and  to  independence  which  means   more

political freedom. Therein lies the P.A.P. attempt  to

confuse  the word "merger". Therein lies the  strength

of  our argument to show that in trying to confuse the

word  "merger", they are only looking after their  own

interest  and  not  the interest  of  the  people  who

elected them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Sir, the purpose, the motive, the

objective of the whole exercise in this P.A.P. merger

is  a political on-e. It seeks to retard the expansion

of  socialism.  We  can  quite  appreciate,  Sir,  the

Alliance Government wanting to retard the growth of  a

socialist society, because they call themselves Right-wing.  And as Right-wing politicians, they have  every

right - indeed it is their duty and responsibility  - to

see the prepetuation of a Right-wing political system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku, in saying that he wants to check the

advance of socialism, is completely -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member is

entitled to misquote the Tunku. I do not think he  has

ever  said  that  he wishes to retard the  advance  of

socialism,  unless the Member can give me chapter  and

verse.  I  think what the Tunku has said  is  that  he

wants to retard the growth of Communism.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, the Tunku wants to retard

the  expansion of Communism and, by P.A.P. definition,

I will read it again, Sir, for you -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I understand what is in

the  mind of the Member for Nee Soon. But he must  not

say  in so many words that the Tunku has said that  he

wishes to retard the growth of socialism. All that the

Tunku has said is that he wishes to retard - or words to

the   effect - Communism.  Whether   the   P.A.P. says

Communism  and  Socialism are  the  same  is  quite  a

different matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I am indebted to you for your

advice,  Sir,I will try to do better now.  The  Tunku

says that the objective of the merger is to retard the

growth of Communism, and by P.A.P. definition there is

no  clear  distinction. In fact, there  is  a  lot  of

deliberate   befuddlement   between   Communism    and

Democratic Socialism. [Interruption]. Do I hear sneers

again'?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Nee Soon must not

listen  to  these  little sneers that  come  along  or

little laughter that comes along from the Front Bench.

If  he  concentrates  as much as I  am  concentrating,

perhaps he will not hear them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> As I said, Sir, the objective of

the merger is to retard the development of a political

system which is conveniently called Communism, and  is

really  Socialism. The basic fears  which  the  P.A.P.

have  analysed in this political bible have  not  been

resolved.  On  the contrary, the merger has  come  not

because there is a resolution of the fears but because

there  is  an intensification of those fears  and  the

merger  has  been hatched to circumvent  those  fears.

This it does by a form of merger which gives Singapore

no   proportionate  representation  in  the  House  of

Parliament  and no automatic conversion  of  Singapore

citizenship into Federal citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about citizenship, I would like to remark

that  the  Minister for Finance, who has a very  acute

mind, is sometimes purposely not very acute when it is

not  in  his interest to be so. For instance,  in  the

first  place,  he  said that it was not  possible  for

Singapore citizens to be automatically converted  into

Federal citizens. Subsequently,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



when chapter and verse was quoted to show that it  was

possible, he just said, "Well, well, mm, mm,", typical

of him, you know. "mm'mm". And subsequently it becomes

only an academic interest but still possible. It could

but it would not be done. Well, perhaps that is a form

of  intellectual honesty. But if that is so, I do  not

recognise  the  honesty  part  of  it.  It  might   be

intellectual.   After   all  an   intellectual   often

bamboozles people by talking of very, very complicated

things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I thought it was "Oo, oo".



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I did not hear that one, Sir. I

was about to rebut anyway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the question of citizenship, I remember in

this  House  the  time when the Minister  for  Finance

caught a cold and was not able to hear very well,  his

master's voice - at one time my master's voice - spoke on

his behalf.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Who is your master now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Still the same, the people. The

people  are always our masters. And he said the reason

why  automatic  conversion from Singapore  citizenship

into  Federal citizenship was not possible was because

of  the  Communists in Singapore. The Prime  Minister,

Sir,  also had occasion to mention at the Airport that

in  his  reckoning there are about 300  Communists  in

Singapore. Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis  feel  that

if  300 Communists in Singapore are depriving all  the

citizens  of  Singapore  from  being  converted   into

Federal citizens automatically, then surely it is  the

business,  nay, the responsibility, of the Government,

by  using professional trackers so well praised by the

Minister  for  Finance, to identify these  Communists,

label  them,  deregister  them  from  the  citizenship

register  so  that  the other 300,000  minus  the  300

Communists may get automatic citizenship.  That  is  a

fair  appeal,  because if three  people  are  blocking

3,000 people from attaining certain rights, then it is

only fair that the three people should be sorted out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



so  that their deeds or misdeeds, or whatever  it  is,

will not affect the future of the others. And, Sir, we

have the Minister for Labour and Law -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Health and Law.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. I am much

obliged. It is the Minister for Health and Law.  There

are a lot of stories going around as to why the switch

came round -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Especially to look after

lunatics!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> That I suppose, Sir, is the

privilege of doctors and certainly not of lawyers.  As

a  doctor,  I  will  be in a much better  position  to

decide  and to judge who is a lunatic and who is  not.

The   Minister  for  Health  and  Law  laboured  quite

unnecessarily on points of citizenship which were  not

very  elucidating. He tried to put  one  over  us  by

saying   the   Constitution  does  not   provide   for

proportionate  representation until  Article  116  was

called  to  his attention. Then when that Article  was

being  described - I refer to the Malayan Constitutional

Documents  on  the Constitution of the  Federation  of

Malaya,  Article 116, which provides for an  electoral

quota  for proportionate representation of the various

States - he came up and tried to mislead us by quoting a

lot of mathematical figures. It is as if he tries  to

mislead  you when you ask him how to get to  Fullerton

Square. "You go straight, turn left, then turn  right,

take two steps, to the left again, then go round, turn

right  again, then proceed straight to about 10 yards,

and then there you see a pill-box, turn right again."

In the end, Sir, you will not know where you are. That

was exactly what he sought to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he has misunderstood the

official record which I produced yesterday.  It  is  a

pity I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



not  got  it  here  with me now. I  drew  the  House's

attention  to Table 1 and the formula that  was  used.

That  formula was produced by people who are competent

to work out the proportions, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I am much obliged, Sir,I was

just  about to come to that because it did  not  prove

very  much,  Sir,  because when he  was  quoting  the

figures. I took down a few figures and I noticed  that

his  main  argument was that it is not  the  electoral

quota alone that matters, but that other factors, such

as  the  population quota, also matter;  and  that  in

arriving  at  the  figure,  it  is  a  computation  of

electoral  quota, population quota, and certain  other

aspects.  But  the two most important  items  are  the

electoral  quota and the population quota.  If  I  had

been  permitted that day to clarify for  him,  Sir,  I

would  have told him that there was no need to produce

all  these  complicated calculations, because  if  one

looks   at  the  citizen  population  ratio   in   the

Federation and the citizen population in Singapore, we

note  a  curious fact, Sir, and that is that they  are

the  same. There are some 2,350,000 citizens  and  6.4

million  population in the Federation,  so  the  ratio

becomes one citizen to 2.6 of the population.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All this academic debate on these

numbers, does it really help? I think all the Assembly

need  know  is  the Barisan Sosialis claim  that  they

should  have  30 seats or 25 seats. The Minister  for

Law  has said that his calculation gives 22 seats. Let

us split the difference, shall we?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I had

intended  to  say  was that the ratio  of  citizen  to

population is identical. In Singapore, there  are  2.6

members of the population to one citizen, and in  the

Federation the same figure applies - it is also 2.6.  So

if  both  factors influence the final  result  of  the

computation, and if the ratios are the same, then they

should not influence very much. And I was surprised to

hear  the  Minister  say that  there  should  be  no

proportionate  representation  because  it  is   quite

unnecessary. It is quite necessary, Sir, that  if  two

States having an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



equal  population and an equal number of citizens  are

to  merge,  each must have exactly the same number  of

representatives because they have the same population.

This   is  just  imaginary,  otherwise  there  is   no

equality,   otherwise  there  is  no  democracy.   For

instance,  shall I say, as a matter of argument,  that

one  State  is in Holland Road? They have  a  thousand

citizens.  Another  State is in Chinatown.  They  also

have a thousand citizens, hut because the Holland Road

citizens  happen to pay more income tax  and  property

tax,  it  does  not mean that they should  have  inure

representatives  in  the  House  than  the   Chinatown

people, because basic human rights demand that  in  so

far  as political and human rights are concerned,  all

men  are equal. It does not matter whether a man is  a

millionaire  and the other man is a  poor  man.  They

have equal rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to stress, Sir, is that today there

are  people  who  say,  out of consideration  of  tax

payment  or retention, there must be a subtraction,  a

diminution of the number of representatives  Singapore

must  have  in the House. If that is not a feudalistic

argument,  then I do not know what feudalistic  means.

We  have  people telling us that we should be entitled

to  21 representatives in the Federation Parliament by

the application of a certain formula which I accept -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You accept?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - and on the other hand, they

say  we may only have 15 because we retain much of our

revenue  in Singapore for the advancement of  our  own

policies.  That  is  to  say,  for  the  privilege  of

retaining that revenue, we lose our political rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the same people advocating to voters

before  the election, "Never mind if the S.P.A. gives

you  $5, take it. But you do not sell that right.  You

can  still  vote for the P.A.P. even if you take  that

money.  They  will never know. But on  principle,  you

should never take the money."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they come and tell us that political rights can

be  bought  in terms of dollars and cents.  But,  Sir,

even then it is not a matter of how much we retain and

how  much we give. It is a matter of how much we  give

in  hard  cash  and  how much service  we  receive  in

consideration for that amount of money paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked out the contribution Singapore is

expected  to  pay - $90 million approximately.  And  how

much  benefit  can  Singapore  accrue  from  this  $90

million?  The Federation armed forces will defend  us.

Defence,  we have already been provided with. External

affairs,  we have already been provided with.  All  we

get is the police, against which item the estimate has

hitherto showed $23,514,450. That is our cost. We  are

paying  $90 million for a service for which we are  at

present  paying  $23� million in the  1961  Estimates.

Surely,  Sir,  it is not how much we retain,  but  how

much  we pay, and for the amount of money we pay,  how

much  we  receive in service in goods or in kind.  To

pay  $90  million  and receive $23�  million  back  in

service  is certainly not paying very little.  We  are

paying a lot. And for paying so much, we have nine  or

five  or  how  many seats lopped off from the  Federal

Parliament.  I  do  not follow the argument.  If  only

people  are honest and put the facts before us clearly

and without confusion, we will all be in a much better

position to appreciate the facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very interested to listen to the argument of

the Minister for Culture. He stretched the argument

very far, Sir, to say -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I do not

wish to interrupt the Member for Nee Soon, but if he

is going on until 8 p.m., may I, at your suggestion,

just interject to read this telegram which I received

from the Tunku? But if the Member is not going on

until 8 p.m., then I will have the opportunity to do

it in the proper order while the debate is on. I will

wait for my turn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it of some importance?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the House will want to

know, Sir. I received that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could the Member for Nee Soon indicate

how long more he will take?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I was just waiting for you to sit

down,  Sir, before I got up. I thought I would  finish

within  one hour. That is what I told certain  people,

but  I  will not be able to do so. I will give way  to

the Prime Minister first.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point is, does the Member think he

will complete his speech before 8 p.m.?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Not having the benefit of a

written script, Sir, I am unable to assure you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I think the House will be

interested  to  hear  the Prime Minister  reading  the

telegram. I do not think there will be any objection?

No objection.



<br><br>7.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this afternoon

at  3  o'clock I received a telegram from London, from

the Prime Minister of the Federation who is now there,

through his office in Kuala Lumpur, in which he stated

as  follows  (I  am  reading only parts  of  it,  Sir,

because some other parts do not concern this House):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Agreement reached between us and the U.K. on the use

of  Singapore  base  is  only  extension  of  existing

agreement with U.K. It permits the use of the base  as

provided  under the terms of the treaty only with  the

agreement of future Malaysia Government, but not as of

right.  The British Government and ourselves emphasise

Singapore base is not S.E.A.T.O. base.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am unable to lay on the Table the whole

telegram because it contains certain other matters  of

public  importance which should not be tabled in  this

House.  But this is the part which relates to  defence

and  which  is of interest to the House, and  I  shall

give the Clerk an authenticated copy of the telegram.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also, Mr Speaker, Sir, table two letters

exchanged between myself and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation Prime Minister, which I think may save

the  Member  opposite and many other Members  in  this

House   from   an   unduly   lengthy   discussion   on

hypothetical  "yes" and "noes" of what the  Federation

Parliament may or may not do. I think the Tunku  knows

that  the exchange of letters is being tabled in  this

Assembly today. I have copies here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the two letters handed in to the Clerk.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Whilst the copies are being

distributed, Sir, may I read the contents of  the  two

letters?  First  is my letter to the Federation  Prime

Minister,  dated  11th  November,  1961.  I  wrote  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My dear Prime Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer to our memorandum, para, graph 15,

Representation in the new Federation Parliament, House

of Representatives and the Senate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I place on record our respective views and

considerations which led to the understanding recorded

in this paragraph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If merger were completely on the basis of Penang,

then  the  citizenship laws of the present  Federation

which applied in Penang will apply to Singapore. About

284,000  representing those born in Singapore  out  of

the  624,000  Singapore citizens  would  automatically

qualify  for  citizenship of the  present  Federation.

This    would   entitle   Singapore   to    send    14

representatives to the Central Federation Legislature.

This  is  comparable to the 14 seats to which Johore's

291,230 citizens are entitled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 340,000 Singapore citizens who were not

born  in Singapore would have to apply for citizenship

under  the  present citizenship laws of the Federation

which require, inter alia, a residential qualification

and a knowledge of the Malay language. On the basis of

the  numbers  in  the  other  States  in  the  present

Federation  who  have  qualified  by  application  for

citizenship  in  this way, over two-thirds  i.e. more

than 230,000, will lose their present citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the claim that Singapore citizens

should  automatically become Federation  citizens  and

thereby increase the representation Singapore would be

entitled  to,  was and still is, in the view  of  your

government, too absurd to merit serious consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger on either of these terms would be unrealistic.

However,  you  have agreed that all present  Singapore

citizens will keep their citizenship rights and become

Federal  nationals,  provided this  is  not  then  put

forward  as a reason for an increase in the number  of

representatives for Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My government estimated that on a merger like Penang,

Singapore  would be entitled to 19 seats  in  view  of

Perak's 450,000 voters entitling Perak to 19 seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You pointed out that on a merger like Penang,

Singapore  would  lose her autonomy in  education  and

labour. Further, the citizenship laws which applied to

Penang and Malacca at the time of Merdeka were due  to

the   special   constitutional   position   of   these

territories as part of the Federation of Malaya  since

1948.  Your view was, and still is, that it  does  not

follow that the same treatment must necessarily  apply

to  Singapore. If the stricter citizenship laws of the

other States of the Federation were applied, Singapore

would  be  given no more than 12 seats in  Parliament,

since weightage must be given to the rural areas as in

the rest of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have agreed that Singapore would keep

more  than  three-quarters  of  her  revenue  for  the

discharge  of  her responsibilities on  education  and

labour,  social  welfare, health  and  all  the  other

matters    set    out   as   state    or    concurrent

responsibilities  in  the  schedule  annexed  to   our

memorandum, and be entitled to 15 seats in the Central

Parliament of the new Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement has precedents in constitutional

practice.  Northern Ireland, though part o the  United

Kingdom  retains certain autonomous powers. In  return

for this, though Northern Ireland would be entitled to

16  seats on the basis of electoral strength, she  has

only  12 because she retains autonomous powers. Should

in  the future Singapore surrender some or all of  her

autonomous  powers and state revenue  to  the  Central

Government,  the  question of  representation  can  he

reviewed.'



<br><br>The  Prime Minister of the Federation replied on  13th

November, 1961, as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My dear Prime Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer to your letter of 11th November, 1961

regarding  the  representation in the  new  Federation

Parliament which is contained in paragraph 15  of  the

memorandum forming the basic proposals for  merger  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that it cannot he assumed

that  the  analogy of Penang or Malacca is necessarily

relevant  to the status of Singapore in a merger  with

the   Federation.   Article  22  of   the   Federation

Constitution  makes  provision for  a  merger  of  new

states  on  terms  which do not  necessarily  have  to

follow  Penang and Malacca which were already  members

of the Federation when the 1957 Constitution came into

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the stricter citizenship laws of the other states

were applied to Singapore, Singapore would be entitled

to not more than 12 seats,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



since  less  persons would be eligible for citizenship

and  consequently for franchise, quite apart from  the

question of weightage for rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after our frank and thorough discussions of

all  the  implications involving Singapore citizenship

and  merger, I have agreed that all Singapore citizens

should  keep  their  present rights and  automatically

become nationals of the new Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently it is felt that representation in the

new  Federation Parliament should not be based on  the

total  number of such citizens, large numbers of  whom

would he disenfranchised if the Federation citizenship

and representation laws were applied. In this context,

may  I  reiterate that the argument that all Singapore

citizens  at  the time of merger should  automatically

become  Federation  citizens  cannot  find  acceptance

under our Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have accordingly agreed, after having given full

thought  on  various  aspects  of  the  merger,   that

Singapore should be entitled to only 15 seats  in  the

Central Parliament of the new Federation.'



<br><br>Finally,  Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall  that  the

Member for Anson -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, is the Prime Minister going to

read another document?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is another document which I

think  would  assist hon. Members in the  debate.  The

Member for Anson raised certain queries regarding  the

term  "national  of the new Federation",  and  I  have

sought  the opinion of the State Advocate-General  for

this specific purpose. He has done so in writing and I

would like to table it for the benefit of the House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In that case, I think that would

provide a rebuttal of what the Member for Anson  said.

Perhaps that could be circulated later on. I was going

to  propose that, in view of these important documents

from the Federation as against the legal opinion which

can be debated, the adjournment be taken now to enable

Members  to study these important documents  from  the

Federation.  Meanwhile, that legal document  could  be

circulated and the debate could continue on Monday.  I

think  that  would  be  fair to all  Members  in  this

Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you wish, Mr Speaker, Sir. In

that  case, if you are suggesting an adjournment,  may

I,  for  the benefit of the non-legal Members of  this

House, go through the State Advocate-General's opinion

which  is  a  two-page document. I am only  suggesting

this -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The point I am making is that I

have  permitted this intervention because  the  matter

concerns a different country - the Federation of Malaya.

The  documents are of some importance for  Members  to

study.  But when we come to the legal opinion  of  the

State  Advocate-General, which is, of course,  subject

to  debate, I do not think it is proper to allow it to

be  read  at  this  stage.  But  if  the  document  is

available,  I  think the Clerk will  be  able  to  get

copies out to Members tomorrow morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you wish, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Sheng.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, when I gave way to the Prime

Minister,  I  thought there was something of  urgency,

but  now  I  notice that the -two documents are  dated

respectively 11th and 13th of November, and I  do  not

think it was fair of him to interrupt me in the middle

of  my  speech in this House to table documents  which

are  about ten days out of date as something  that  is

urgent.  I  do  wish to continue with my  speech  till

eight  o'clock. I do not know what the Standing Orders

are and I am asking for advice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understand from the Prime Minister

that he had the permission of the Tunku only today  to

table these documents. Am I right?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. Today I received a telegram  which  not

only  allowed  me  to disclose those  letters  to  the

Assembly,  in view of the course that the  debate  has

taken,  but  I  also have the telegram  regarding  the

S.E.A.T.O. bases which I think it is of  considerable

importance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I have said, these letters contain

certain information on the points on which the  Member

himself  is  touching. He may wish to look  at  these

documents and then reorientate his speech to  dovetail

with  them. It is only a question of dovetailing  what

the hon. Member is saying with the documents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> In so far as the relevant part of

my  speech is concerned, I have already covered  these

points,  and  I  will not be touching on  them  again.

Could I then continue?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have another suggestion. I do not know

whether hon. Members would like to take a vote on  the

adjournment motion to be moved now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In the absence of the Leader, may

I  suggest that the debate should go on? If  the  hon.

Member  feels that he wants to go on, I see no  reason

why he should not do so. I think we are quite happy to

sit  back and hear him till eight o'clock. I hope  you

will survive it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps some of us are tired and some

are  not, but I do think that perhaps some Members who

have  not  had  the time to study these  letters  will

welcome an adjournment. If there is no Member who will

welcome  an adjournment, then the Member for Nee  Soon

can carry on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Do I carry on?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you. I was talking about

the Minister for Culture stretching a point beyond its

elastic  limit  when  I  was  so  aptly  and  expertly

interrupted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The permission of this House was

obtained.  If  any Member had said 'No' when  I  asked

whether there was any objection, then, of course,  the

Prime  Minister would not have been able to read those

letters. But since nobody said 'No', I do not think it

is  fair to intimate that the Prime Minister pulled  a

fast  one. The Speaker just asked the Members  whether

they  had  any objection and there was none.  Anything

can be done with the assent of Members. Dr Sheng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, I was the first to

give way and I indicated that I would do so. I was

talking about the Minister for Culture when I was

interrupted. If that does not please you, Sir, I shall

withdraw that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member went a little further.

He  intimated  that the Prime Minister had  intervened

very  expertly. I do not think the Member for Nee Soon

is fair in alleging that. Dr Sheng.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying

that the Minister for Culture stretched a point beyond

its  elastic limit when he stated that, by  virtue  of

the  proposal  of the Barisan Sosialis  for  automatic

conversion   of   Singapore  citizens   into   Federal

citizens, we are giving fuel to the P.M.I.P. to oppose

the  merger. I said, Sir, that that was a point  which

was  stretched beyond its elastic limit. He might have

very  well  said that in the United States of  America

any  lover of negroes should not advocate their  right

to  fight  for equality because in doing so  they  may

well be faced with the possibility of being hanged  by

the  Ku Klux Klan. Indeed, if the Minister for Culture

was  trying to save the negroes in America,  not  only

would  he  be  likely to be mistaken in  identity  and

hanged by the Ku Klux Klan but he would also be tarred

and  feathered by the negroes themselves who are  only

seeking  human  justice and equal  rights  with  their

white brothers.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> And the Minister for Culture

laboured on second-class citizens equating to  second-class  citizens.  As  that point has  been  adequately

covered  by  the Member for Anson, I shall not  labour

excessively on it. Suffice it to say that for a monkey

in a cage, it is quite possible for the monkey to feel

that all the people over the other side of the bar are

prisoners, and the monkey itself a free animal. So  it

is  possible for prisoners who are confined to  prison

to feel that they are free



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



and  all  those people who are outside are subject  to

the  evil influences of society and are suffering from

a  loss  of freedom. At least in the confines  of  the

prison, one cannot be further intimidated. Outside the

confines  of the prison, one may very well be  further

intimidated. So because a prisoner cannot get out  but

is  free to move in the prison, and a free man  cannot

get  in but i; free to move outside the prison, it  is

not  true to say that a prisoner is as free as a  free

man.  That  is the logic of the Minister for Culture's

argument and I do not think it is necessary for me  to

say anything more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been established beyond doubt that in the

arrangement  that we have agreed to, Federal  citizens

have  a right of entry into Singapore for purposes  of

political association and otherwise, freely, and  that

Singapore citizens cannot claim the vice versa rights.

Even  now in the advertisements for Government service

jobs,  the  Singapore Government  inserts  the  words,

"Singapore  citizens and Federal citizens may  apply",

whereas  a  Singapore  citizen may  not  apply  for  a

Government service job in the Federation.  And  if  he

should  want to go into the Government service in  the

Federation,  he  would have to go  on  contract.  This

P.A.P. merger  will bring about  the  same  state  of

affairs  - that Singapore citizens may not  indulge  in

political   affairs   in   the   Federation,   whereas

Federation citizens will have full political and human

rights   and  all  other  rights  to  participate   in

political or other movements in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let me come to the point as to why the

P.A.P. persists in perpetuating this  confusion,  why

the  P.A.P. is reluctant to call a spade a  spade,  to

call   this  form  of  closer  association  or  closer

relationship  just  by its true  name.  Why  does  the

P.A.P. seek  to  label  a  form  of  association   or

relationship as merger? It is because the P.A.P. would

not like to face the people and to ask them to give it

a   mandate  for  this  kind  of  a  relationship   or

association. It is also because it so happens that the

P.A.P. in the 1959 elections had written "independence

through merger" in their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



electoral platform. But that merger, Sir, refers to  a

merger which brings us towards a socialist society,  a

merger which brings us towards more political freedom.

So it is that the P.A.P. try to confuse the picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me come to the reason for this merger. I

have  said  just now that this merger is  a  political

move, a move calculated to retard the expansion  of  a

political   system  which  is  not  clearly   defined.

Socialism can easily be labelled or misinterpreted  as

Communism,  and the P.A.P. has said so.  The  Alliance

Government  has  a right, an honest right,  to  oppose

socialism.  But has the P.A.P. a right to  oppose  the

spread  of  socialism?  The  P.A.P. claims  to  be  a

socialist Party, but if the spread of socialism is  to

come about in Singapore, the P.A.P. may very well find

itself outside the political arena in Singapore. So in

order  for  the P.A.P. to survive in Singapore,  where

conditions are such that it is inevitable that a Left-wing government or a socialist government only may  be

returned,  I quote, Sir, the 4th Anniversary  Souvenir

number published in 1958:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For "one man one vote" regardless of race, class or

creed   in  Malaya  and,  indeed,  anywhere  else   in

economically  backward  Asia,  must  result   in   the

election  of  Governments  pledged  to  the  poor  and

underprivileged  peasants  and  workers  who  are  the

overwhelming majority. In other words the  outcome  of

the   vote,  in  the  Democratic  system  of  periodic

elections  by universal franchise, must  result  in  a

Government  pledge  to Socialism.  And  our  party  is

pledged  to  help  bring this about  as  soon  and  as

peacefully as possible.'



<br><br>That,  Sir,  was  in 1958. But today, it  becomes  the

selfish interests of the P.A.P. to see that the  creed

of socialism does not spread, because they can no more

represent  themselves  as a socialist  force,  because

there is another political force in this country which

has occupied the place they occupied in 1959 and which

has  taken  over  the vacuum which they  evacuated  by

virtue  of  their  Rightist  deviation.  And  if   the

socialist movement is to be allowed to expand,  it  is

obvious  that the P.A.P. will be out of the  political

arena. So the P.A.P. has its selfish interests to  see

that socialism is checked.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Communism is checked.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> For the benefit of the Prime

Minister,  Sir, I shall read to him what he  wrote  in

1958, since he was not here earlier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Central Executive committee

of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> All right, the Central Executive

Committee of the P.A.P. of 1958:



<br><br>'...the  Alliance  leaders make no  clear  distinction

between Democratic Socialists and Communists. Anything

"Left" is viewed with apprehension, for anything  Left

is thought to be Communist or potentially Communist.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right. That is where we

come in to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Ah, ha, that is right! We will

clarify that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A non-Communist is a Communist!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So any group of men, who are not only anti-Communist

but also anti-Socialist and anti any change towards  a

more  egalitarian society, can easily blur  the  lines

between democratic Socialism and Communism.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Prime Minister pretends he is not hearing.

Since this is mere repetition, as I have already  read

that  before,  I  shall not waste my time  because  he

knows this as well as I do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has a common interest now to check

the  spread  of socialism. The Alliance Government  is

honest  about it. We respect them, though we  disagree

with  their system. But the P.A.P. is not very  honest

about  it.  On  the one hand, they want to  check  the

advance of socialism. On the other hand, they have  to

pretend  to be a socialist Party, otherwise  they  get

out   of   the  political  arena.  So  some  form   of

association,  some  form of a  relationship,  must  be

established with the Federation Alliance in  order  to

prop  them up. What kind of a relationship?  A  merger

between the P.A.P. and the Federation Alliance? It may

fit in very well, but that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



certainly  will  spell  the  doom  of  the  P.A.P. in

Singapore,  as  the  results of the Anson  by-election

have clearly shown. In the Federation it may very well

be that the electorate prefers a government led by the

Alliance. But in Singapore it is not possible  to  say

that the electorate prefers a government that is Right-wing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Not possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Not possible, because history has

shown that any government which toed a Right-wing line

moved towards its political doom. So if the P.A.P. can

make  sure that no other group of political forces  is

to  its Left, then it can claim to be Left although it

is  a  phoney  Left.  So  the P.A.P. embarks  upon  a

relationship with the Federation Alliance and, because

it is not possible for the parties to merge, they find

a  way in which the Governments of the two territories

cement  their  relationship while the  Parties  remain

separate,  separate only in name but not  separate  in

deeds, for in a parliamentary democratic system it  is

the  Party that runs the government. And it  is  their

hope  that  by  this form of arrangement,  the  P.A.P.

Government  can  fix all its political opponents.  And

who are the political opponents?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Not the S.P.A., because I do not

think  the  Tunku will he very happy if the S.P.A. is

fixed,  as  the  S.P.A. forms an  alliance  with  the

Federation  Alliance,  calling  it  the  Four-cornered

Alliance. The only possible Party that might be  fixed

is  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  fixed  because  of  their

proclaimed genuine socialist line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Communist line.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Socialist line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why don't you call it the Communist

line?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Because the analysis in the 4th

Anniversary Souvenir shows that a society like  Malaya

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



which there are different races, different creeds, and

in  which  politically they are  quite  advanced,  and

economically   very   well   off,   the   trials   and

tribulations  of  the  Communist  methods  which  were

successful  in  Soviet Russia and in China  are  quite

unnecessary  here, quite unnecessary. We  accept  that

analysis  even  if  the  P.A.P. does  not  accept  it

anymore. We still go by that analysis. It is as  clear

and as simple as that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how does the P.A.P. go about putting us in trouble?

An  association of Governments but not an  association

of  parties.  And it so happens that, fortunately  for

the  P.A.P.,  the Alliance Government makes  no  clear

distinction   between   Communists   and   socialists.

Anything that is to the Left is potentially Communist,

or Communist, or Communist-inspired, or pro-Communist.

And  since the Prime Minister in a series of  speeches

over  Radio  Singapore proclaimed  that  all  his  ex-comrades  are either Communists, potential Communists,

pro-Communists, or Communist-inspired, it is very easy

for  the  Alliance  leader in the Federation  to  say,

"There you are. These people are Communists." But  are

we  Communists? We have been told that if a man  is  a

Communist, it is known only between him and  God,  and

in  between  him and God there is the Special  Branch.

Let   the  Special  Branch  tell  us  whether  we  are

Communists.  If indeed we were Communists,  certainly

the strategy the P.A.P. should use to fix us should be

different  from  this  one.  In  Volume  13   of   the

Legislative  Assembly  Debates of  3rd  August,  1960,

column  64, when talking about the strategy of ducking

and being ducked, the P.A.P. says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But it is useful if we can put these things in

perspective,  in terms of the ultimate, of  the  worst

and the best, that is possible. What is the worst that

can  happen  in  the  immediate future  for  us  as  a

Government? It is that the Government may find  itself

out-manoeuvred  and  out-propagandaed  [despite  Radio

Singapore]  by these Left-wing adventurers,  in  which

case  the P.A.P. will have to take the count  in  this

fight and the Communists will be counted out for  many

years to come.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



That  was very good strategy. That was what the P.A.P.

proclaimed  it  would  do if  it  had  to  oppose  the

Communists.  But  unfortunately the P.A.P. knew  that

neither  I  nor my colleagues are Communists,  and  so

that  strategy is not applicable. So another  strategy

must be found. It says here, Mr Deputy Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are not unaware what with the Communists on one

side  of us and the British colonialists on the other,

each  side  will want to pull us to its side.  We  are

also  aware  that  failing this,  each  of  these  two

contending extremes are quite prepared to  use  us  as

buffers in their machinations against each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...But it is also the business of the Government to

ensure  that if a collision has to take place  between

these   Left-wing  adventurers  and  the   colonialist

imperialists, the P.A.P. should let them  break  their

heads  on  each  other.  For  we  are  confident  that

whatever the temporary manoeuvrings and ups and downs,

we  as a non-C.P. socialist force have a historic role

to  play  in the political struggle of Malaya in  this

crucial  stage of our history. Our duty is to preserve

the  integrity  and effectiveness of our non-Communist

socialist  movement, not to be used in other  peoples'

plots.'



<br><br>If  we  were Communists, would this not be the  ready-made  and ready-tailored strategy against us?  But  we

are  not  Communists. So another strategy  has  to  be

found.  And  what  other strategies are  there  to  be

found? A ready-made strategy across the Causeway where

distinctions are blurred? Very useful. And so we  have

this merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was talking about proportionate

representation,  I said that taxes should  in  no  way

influence a person's political or human rights. I said

that because I heard over the radio the Prime Minister

saying that we should have about 18 seats, and because

a great deal  of  money is to be retained for the running  of

independent   educational  and  labour  policies,   it

becomes necessary in lieu of this independence to give

up a number of seats.



<br><br>7.48 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, that surely is an argument

that  may  hold  water, say, some  300  years  ago  in

feudalistic  Europe. But it is surprising,  Sir,  that

today  we  find self-proclaimed socialists  professing

the principle of political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



representation  as  a direct product  of  taxation  or

direct relationship of taxation. That has surprised me

very  much. Even though the Prime Minister has  tabled

two  letters, I do not see any mention of this bit  of

his  analysis in the letters. That is why I  say  that

what I am going to deal with is quite apart from those

letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so that we may not be smeared as anti the

principle  of merger, let me say, in conclusion,  that

we  in  the Barisan Sosialis believe in genuine merger

and  stand committed unconditionally to a merger  with

the   Federation  which  we  define  as   a   complete

reunification  and genuine integration of  the  people

and the territories of Singapore and the Federation of

Malaya.



<br><br>7.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  oppose the amendment in the name of the Member for

Queenstown. Originally I had not intended to speak  on

this   motion,  but  after  hearing  the  Member   for

Queenstown  and  the  Member for Changi  speaking  for 7�

hours,  and using phrases like "treachery",  "selling-out", "phoney merger" and so on, I cannot keep quiet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me speak on only a few points made by the Member

for  Queenstown.  Before he made  any  attack  on  the

proposed  merger as contained in the White Paper,  the

Member  for  Queenstown in commenting  on  the  vacant

seats  on the Government benches, said that it grieved

him to see the vacant seats. I wish to say this to him

and  his  colleagues:  if it  had  not  been  for  the

treacherous acts of these 13 Barisan Sosialis Members,

he  would not have to be grieved. The Barisan Sosialis

in   this   House  were  elected  by  the  people   as

representatives  of  the P.A.P. and  not  as  Barisan

Sosialis Members. They have pledged an undertaking  in

writing, Sir, that whenever they are expelled from the

P.A.P. or  if they ever resign from the P.A.P.,  they

will resign their seats in this Assembly. These people

have not kept their promises. And these are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



people  who  talk about treachery - the same treacherous

people. These people, as pointed out by the Member for

Cairnhill, have no right to be in this House, and they

come and talk about betrayal and treachery and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the leader of the Barisan Sosialis

mentioned on 20th November that because there  was  no

mention   of   immediate   merger   in   the    P.A.P.

booklet - "The Tasks Ahead" -  and the Five-Year Plan, we

cannot Strive for immediate merger; we should only try

to  get  full internal self-government. The  inference

is,  of  course, Sir, that because merger was  not  an

immediate  objective of the P.A.P. in 1959, we  should

only  ask for full self-government and not merger.  He

asks  why  we are suddenly clamouring for merger.  The

reason  is  that  it  is in our interest  and  in  the

interest of the people of Singapore to merge with  the

Federation at the earliest possible time. If there  is

no  merger  immediately, the Communists  or  the  pro-Communists and their agents will try to overthrow  the

democratic Government in Singapore and they  will  use

Singapore  as  a  base. That is  the  reason  why,  as

mentioned  by  the  Minister for  Culture,  the  Prime

Minister   of  the  Federation  of  Malaya  has   been

convinced  that  an early merger is necessary  and  is

beneficial to both territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let me say a few words about this automatic

conversion  of all Singapore citizens into  Federation

citizens. The Barisan Sosialis first wanted a complete

merger  on  the  basis  of  Penang  and  Malacca.  The

Minister  for  Health  and Law and  the  Minister  for

Culture  have already explained how and on what  terms

the  citizens of Penang and Malacca were given Federal

citizenship on attainment of Merdeka by the Federation

of  Malaya.  It is needless for mc to labour  on  this

point,  that  if  Singapore is to he merged  with  the

Federation  on the same basis as Penang  and  Malacca,

then  only  about 284,000 people will  become  Federal

citizens. But now the Barisan Sosialis have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



conveniently forgotten the clamour for merger  on  the

basis  of  Penang  and  Malacca.  They  now  want  all

Singapore citizens to become Federal citizens. It  has

been said in this House by several Members that if the

Federation Government or Parliament wants to agree  to

this request, it could do so. But it has been said  by

the  Prime Minister that it is unreasonable for us  to

demand  the conversion of all Singapore citizens  into

Federal citizens. The Prime Minister of the Federation

of  Malaya  has also said that he could not and  would

not agree to this request -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>TRADE UNIONISM IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government,

when  it  came into power in June 1959, in its  first

policy  speech  said in this Assembly (I  am  quoting

from column 8, Volume 11, No. 1 of Hansard):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In implementing its declared policy of a unified

Trade   Union   movement,  the  Labour   Ministry   is

consulting all the main streams of the labour movement

to  get the widest possible agreement on the structure

of  the  new organisation to be set up. The Government

will  also cancel registration of splinter and  yellow

unions after due investigation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a declaration of policy in regard to the

unification  of the trade unions in Singapore.  In  an

endeavour  to  unify the trade unions, the  Government

did  say  that they were going to deregister  splinter

and  yellow  unions.  Sir, with  that  declaration  of

policy  the  Government went ahead using  the  T.U.C.,

which had already got into the hands of the P.A.P., to

gain  a stranglehold on the trade unions of Singapore.

Not very long after that declaration, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



read  in  the  newspapers  of  "Ten  Tall  Men"  being

appointed as Assistant Secretaries to the T.U.C. Their

terms  of  office were to be for five years. Later  we

found  that  they  could  not  be  removed  under  the

Constitution  of  the T.U.C. The  Ten  Tall  Men  (the

tallest  man  is the Secretary-General of the  T.U.C.)

went  ahead  trying to unify the trade union  movement

for  the  P.A.P. It was not to unify the  trade  union

movement so as to strengthen the movement as a  whole,

but to unify the movement for the P.A.P. Sir, a number

of  organisations  were strengthened.  In  fact,  some

federations   were   registered   and    were    later

deregistered,  and  that  gave  rise  to  a   lot   of

misgivings  and  attacks.  But  the  Government  quite

cleverly   said  that  the  deregistration  of   these

federations was as a result of instructions  from  the

Internal  Security Council - as if the Internal Security

Council interferes in the trade union movement



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in May 1960, nearly a year after the T.U.C. came

into  power, the Government had its Trade Unions  Bill

for  Second  Reading on the 13th of  May.  During  the

Second Reading of that Bill, it was pointed out by  me

and  by Members of the Opposition that certain clauses

of  the Bill were inserted in order to gain control of

the  trade  union movement for a political Party,  and

that  is  the Party in power. Of course, at that  time

there  were only eight of us and there were 43 on  the

other  side. They just ridiculed and laughed and said,

"We  don't  worry  about the Opposition.  Who  is  the

Opposition? We are the Government with 43  strong  men

and  a great majority in this Assembly. We can do what

we  want."  And  so  they went ahead  trying  to  gain

control  of  the workers of Singapore in trade  unions

for  the benefit of the P.A.P. But suddenly, Sir,  the

Government must by then have smelt something going  on

that was not according to the P.A.P. pattern. The  Ten

Tall  Men did not respond, as it had been thought that

they  would respond, to the P.A.P.'s scheme of gaining

control.  Therefore, in spite of the  fact  that  this

Bill was pushed through this Assembly without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



even  referring  it  to  a  Select  Committee  - pushed

through  the  Assembly  on the  13th  of  May  by  the

Government  in its desire to capture the  trade  union

movement  for the Party in power - that Bill  was  never

assented  to  by  His Excellency the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.  No  reasons were given why the Bill  was  not

assented   to.   I  looked  up  the  Constitution   of

Singapore, Sir, and I must say that I could  not  find

in  it  the  power whereby the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

could  refuse to give assent to a Bill that  has  been

passed  in this Assembly. Of course, there are certain

reserved  powers,  but those reserved  powers  are  in

connection  with defence and external  relations,  and

have nothing to do with trade unions



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Government, in its rush to capture the trade

union movement, found it was caught in between by  the

Ten  Tall Men who were quite tall. In fact, they  were

growing taller and taller, getting out of reach of the

P.A.P.,  and  the Government suddenly felt  that  this

Bill  must not be assented to. Sir, I do not know.  It

could  have advised the Yang di-Pertuan Negara not  to

give his assent to the Bill. Well, that is that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as to be expected, trouble started in the

P.A.P. itself. Then we had a spectacle a  few  months

ago  (in July 1961, I think) of the disintegration  of

the  P.A.P.,  so much so that even before the  Barisan

Sosialis  came  into  existence, here  was  the  great

Secretary-General of the T.U.C. who is now,  Sir,  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture. I

must say this, Sir, and I would ask the Government  to

consider  - and consider properly - that it is not  right

that  a Parliamentary Secretary of a Government should

be    the   Secretary-General   of   a   trade   union

organisation,  particularly of such  a  union  as  the

Amalgamated  Union  of Public Employees  who  are  the

servants  of  the Government. Here is a representative

of  the masters getting into a union of employees  and

saying  that  they  are  the great  champions  of  the

employees. And yet the Government, Sir, was very  fond

of  saying yellow unions, yellow unions. I do not know

what kind of a union one would call the A.U.P.E. which

has as its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



Secretary-General a Parliamentary Secretary.  I  would

say  in  this House, Sir, that it must be the greatest

yellow union in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, when that failed, the

Secretary-General of the T.U.C., in other  words,  the

Parliamentary  Secretary  now  to  the  Minister   for

Culture - Culture,  mind  you,  the  whole  time  it  is

culture! - told the Minister for Labour (at that time he

was the Minister for Labour but now he is the Minister

for  Health and Law), "I say, terrible, terrible, man!

Cannot  control! Dissolve T.U.C.!" I do  not  know  on

what authority - just one man to come and say, "Dissolve

the  T.U.C." And that is that. Yet they say  they  are

the  champions  of a democratic trade union  movement.

One man suddenly got the jitters because he found that

all  that  he had hoped to do for the P.A.P. was  lost

because  the struggle to gain the hearts and minds  of

the  workers had already gone the other way. Suddenly,

there was this heading - when I say it I had a laugh -  on

page  16,  the  Straits Times, Wednesday,  26th  July,

1961, "Byrne to dissolve the T.U.C." and "Kandasamy to

organise new set-up".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, Sir, in the Press release it was admitted by the

Secretary-General  of  the T.U.C. that  the  present

Constitution of the T.U.C. had never been  registered.

It  is  wonderful,  Sir. So if one  could  just  be  a

Parliamentary Secretary or belong to the  P.A.P.,  one

could   do  anything  against  the  law  because   the

Government  will not take action. The Constitution  of

the  T.U.C. had  never been registered  and  yet  the

T.U.C. was  all-owed to function for so many  months!

The  next day on 27th July, it is Byrne again - "Unified

Unions  Policy Will go on - Byrne". It said here on  the

front page, "Mr Byrne agreed with Mr Kandasamy  [how

could  he  do  anything but agree?] that  the  present

Constitution of the T.U.C. had not been registered and

could  not  legally  be registered under  the  present

Trades  Union  Ordinance,". And yet  this  T.U.C. was

allowed  to  function  for  so  many  months  under  a

Constitution that could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



not legally be registered. The Minister for Health and

Law please take note!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> He has gone home!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Constitution could not be

legally  registered and yet the T.U.C. was allowed  to

function.  So it is clear to us, Sir, that the  P.A.P.

is just making use of the workers movement for its own

political  ends.  But, of course, the  Government  was

quite clever. It gave a sop, you know, a little sugar,

"We  give  you a Trade Union House. Never  mind,  your

T.U.C. can go. In the meantime, before the  House  is

built  in Shenton Way, take back the poor Natina  Home

In Queen Street and have it. Have all the fun!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister this: who are now the

occupants of that house? It is still occupied  by  the

now  dissolved  T.U.C. coming under a different  name?

What  is it - National Trade Union Centre? What is in  a

name after all? I would ask the Government to consider

properly  and  to remember that they  cannot  use  the

funds of the people of Singapore to achieve their  awn

party political ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And yet, the Minister for Labour

and  Law,  in  reply to a question by the  Member  for

Anson   on  the  unification  of  unions,  said,   "No

legislation can be introduced to unify the trade union

movement  because of the present split in the movement

here."  Sir,  it is because of a split that  one  must

unify. Yet they say that because there is a split one

should not unify, What was meant by that was that  the

Government will not want to make any move to unify the

unions because the Government does not think that  the

workers  of Singapore are foolish enough to put  their

trust  in  organisations or trade union  organisations

which  are  under  the control of P.A.P.  Assemblymen,

Parliamentary Secretaries, and a lot of things P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming to A.U.P.E. - Amalgamated Union of Public

Employees - here is also an attempt to unify  the  trade

union movement. When the P.A.P. came into power,  they

had  a  brain-wave. "Ah, ha, we are going  to  be  the

masters! Since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



we  have  been  helping the Government  unions  to

fight  against the government of the day, it would

be  better  for  us now to control the  Government

unions before they come and start fighting us." So

they  had this brain-wave of the Amalgamated Union

of  Public Employees. There was an attempt made to

Let  all  the unions of Government employees  into

one  amalgamated union under the great  leadership

of  the  great  trade  unionist  who  is  now  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  in  the   Ministry   of

Culture. What did this Amalgamated Union of Public

Employees - A.U.P.E.  - do?  They  tried   to   force

Government employees to join up with the  A.U.P.E.

and  the Government not only countenanced  it  but

encouraged  it.  Take  the  case  of  the  partial

restoration   of   the  pay   cuts.   Instead   of

negotiating with the Staff Side, the Minister  for

Finance   negotiated  with  the  great  Secretary-General  of  the A.U.P.E. for partial  restoration

and  reached agreement with him. Not only  did  he

reach  agreement, but he issued circulars  to  all

employees  of  the  public service  saying,  "Thou

shall not get this partial restoration unless thou

art  a member of the A.U.P.E." What is this?  This

is  all  wrong. This is the P.A.P. way of building

up  a trade union movement to strengthen the trade

union  movement to look after the welfare  of  the

workers. It is unbelieveable. All this is for  the

P.A.P. Then, all right, partial restoration. As  a

result of that, Sir, I understand there were many,

many civil servants who became members of A.U.P.E.

just to get that partial restoration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly, because of this great integration

idea  of  the P.A.P., the City Council had  to  be

scrapped   because   the  Mayor   and   the   City

Councillors   had  absconded  and  contested   the

elections. The City Council had to be scrapped and

the  employees  of  the City  Council  had  to  be

integrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been far many, many years a City

Council  Labour  Unions Federation  to  which  the

Prime Minister was a very able adviser. I think he

led them in two strikes. But when integration took

place, the Government made some attempt to  close

down  this  Federation and said, "Boys, since  you

are being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



integrated,  join  the A.U.P.E." Fortunately,  the

workers  of  the City Council were not  so  easily

intimidated. They fought and they sent in a strike

notice to the Government saying, "We want to  help

ourselves.  You can change our name if  you  like.

You  can  change  it  to  the  Public  Daily-Rated

Employees  Unions Federation."  At  that  time,  I

think  it was a different Minister who said,  "Oh,

no, you cannot have it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fortunately because of the solidarity of the

workers of the City Council, they won the day. But

now  because  of the rivalry between the  A.U.P.E.

and   the  Public  Daily-Rated  Employees   Unions

Federation,   there   was   a   strike.   I   must

congratulate  the Minister for Labour  for  having

settled   this  strike.  They  go  back  to   work

tomorrow.  But then they have been on  strike  for

more  than 20 days. Singapore was in a real  mess.

There  was dirt in some places. You will remember,

Sir,  that when the Government came into power  in

1959,  even  the  Prime  Minister  rolled  up  his

sleeves and swept Tanjong Pagar - which was all  for

propaganda.  The  Prime Minister, other  Ministers

and  P.A.P. Assemblymen swept the roads. Why?  For

propaganda!  But during the period of the  strike,

if  they  had  any  sympathy or feelings  for  the

people  of  Singapore [Interruption]  they  should

have  been  sweeping the roads  in  Tanjong  Pagar

[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They have

not  done  so  because  they have  become  rubbish

themselves and they will be swept away very  soon. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Serjeant-at-Arms, if

there   is  any  more  levity  in  the  Strangers'

Gallery, the strangers will have to be removed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They did not go out sweeping

because  they  know that they will  be  swept  out

themselves. Let that be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the A.U.P.E., Sir. The A.U.P.E. have already

shown that they are not a yellow Union. Therefore,

while the strike was going on, there was the great

Kandasamy saying in the Free Press -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - "We will -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for Cairnhill

is  encouraging this levity by his speech. If he  will

be  a  little more serious and talk seriously, we will

not have this levity. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you very much for your

guidance,  Sir,It is in the Free Press:  "Government

Staff    May    Strike - Warning    By    Kandasamy" - the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture.

Imagine  an  employer giving warning  to  himself  and

saying that the staff may go on strike! As if that was

not  enough, you have another one. I think it was  Mr

Devan Nair who said, "Oh, unions should not take  part

in  politics." I do not know why after 2�   years  of

playing politics in trade unions they now come out  to

say,  "Oh  unions  should not take part  in  politics.

Unions  should not be vehicles of any party ideology."

They have been trying to get the trade unions to be  a

party  to the P.A.P. ideology for the past 2�  years.

But  when they find now that they can, not control the

unions any more, they say, "Do not be bluffed by other

trade unionists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a trade unionist, I say in all sincerity that

in  order  to strengthen the trade union movement  the

trade  unions must be unified. When they are  unified,

the trade union movement should not be made use of  by

the party in power.



<br><br>8.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I think the Member for  Cairnhill,

who was the Minister for Labour and Social Welfare  in

the last Government, knows - as  everybody  knows - that  the  conditions  then

prevailing  in the trade unions, particularly  in  the

Trades Union Congress, were in a mess. There is hardly

any  time - with nine minutes to go - to go into details,

but  I  will  touch  only on the major  criticisms  re

garding  the  T.U.C. and the accusation  made  by  the

Member for Cairnhill that the A.U.P.E. is a Government-sponsored union.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the P.A.P.

Government assumed office, the Singapore Trades  Union

Congress was revived - let me make it quite clear - not by

the  Government  but  by  the Singapore  Trades  Union

Congress' affiliated unions themselves in response  to

the  Government's call for unifying and  strengthening

the trade union movement in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime about the end of April 1960, the S.T.U.C.

convened  a  Special  Delegates  Congress  under   its

registered  rules - that  is, the  old  rules.  At  that

meeting,   a   new   constitution   was   adopted   in

anticipation of the coming into force of the new Trade

Union  Ordinance.  Subsequently,  new  officers   were

elected  and  nine secretaries were appointed  by  the

newly-elected Secretary General in accordance with the

provisions   of   the  new  constitution.   This   new

constitution has never been submitted to the Registrar

of   Trade  Unions  for  registration  as  it  is  not

registerable under the existing Trade Union Ordinance.

The  Singapore  Trades  Union  Congress  continued  to

function  under  this unregistered constitution  until

the  middle  of  this year. Then its leadership  split

into  the groups and the S.T.U.C. was abandoned. These

are  all facts, Mr Speaker. The group led by Mr  Lim

Chin  Siong and his friends lost no time in forming  a

new  body called S.A.T.U. Other trade unions which  do

not  have similar aims as those of Mr Lim Chin  Siong

and  his  friends then came forward to  form  the  so-called National Trade Union Congress - the N.T.U.C. Both

these two new bodies have applied for registration and

their applications are still under consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been accused of arbitrarily

dissolving  the S.T.U.C. - as the Member  for  Cairnhill

has  suggested. I think this is just another  attempt

to  mislead and confuse the people. The fact  is  that

Government  has not dissolved the S.T.U.C. because  it

cannot  do  so  under the law. Under the  Trade  Union

Ordinance,  the  dissolution  of  a  registered  trade

union - and the S.T.U.C. is a registered trade union - can

only  be  effected voluntarily by the union itself  in

accordance with its own constitution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, allegations have been made that the

A.U.P.E. is a Government-sponsored union and that the

A.U.P.E. is  backed by the P.A.P. at the  expense  of

other   unions.  These  allegations   are   not   only

misleading but mischievous.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is why

they go on strike.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Now let me give some facts

about the emergence of the A.U.P.E. I got the official

facts  from my Ministry. About three months after  the

assumption of office of the

P.A.P.   Government in June 1959, the Singapore  Union

of  Postal  and  Telecommunications  Workers  and  the

Postal   Telecommunications  Uniformed   Staff   Union

effected  a voluntary amalgamation and gave  birth  to

the  A.U.P.E. which was registered  on  26.9.59.  Two

months   later,  another  amalgamation  was   effected

between  the A.U.P.E. and six other unions.  They  are

the   Singapore  City  Council  Services  Union,   the

Singapore   Telephone  Board  Employees   Union,   the

Woodbridge   Hospital  Uniformed  Staff   Union,   the

Singapore Laboratory Technicians Union, the Government

Public  Health Inspectors Union and the  Public  Works

Labour  Union. The parties to the second  amalgamation

again   chose  the  A.U.P.E. as  the  name   of   the

amalgamated   body.  This  second   amalgamation   was

registered on 16.11.59. In the first half of 1960, the

Singapore  Midwives Union, the Singapore Fire  Brigade

Employees  Union and the Central Provident Fund  Staff

Association   dissolved  themselves  voluntarily   and

transferred  their  membership  to  the  A.U.P.E.  The

amalgamated unions which form the A.U.P.E. are amongst

the  oldest  unions in Singapore, one being registered

as  far back as in 1946 and three in 1947. One of  the

amalgamated  unions,  the Public  Works  Labour  Union

registered  in  May  1947, has been  representing  the

daily-rated workers in Government departments for  the

past  13  years.  This  right  of  representation  was

transferred to the A.U.P.E. upon amalgamation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the above facts, the people

can  judge for themselves whether or not the  A.U.P.E.

is a Government-sponsored union or a splinter union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime in May 1960, when I was

still   the   Minister  for  Health,  we  sought   the

assistance  of  the  Labour Ministry  to  arrange  for

secret  ballots to be held to settle the  question  of

union  representation of the grades of  staff  in  the

Health Ministry: assistant nurses, almoners, appliance

makers, male nurses, Division IV personnel, excluding

the Woodbridge Hospital uniformed staff. Subsequently,

the   Singapore   Medical  Services  Union   and   the

Amalgamated Union of Public Employees settled amicably

between    themselves   the    question    of    union

representation  in  respect of  the  grades  of  staff

mentioned  above.  But,  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  both  the

A.U.P.E. and  the  Singapore  Medical  Workers  Union

wanted  to  contest  the right  of  representation  of

Division IV personnel attached to all the institutions

and   branches  of  the  Health  Ministry  other  than

Woodbridge  Hospital  and Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital.  A

secret  ballot was therefore held from  10th  to  19th

January,   1961,  among  the  Division   IV   officers

concerned to decide which of the two unions they would

wish  to  have represent them. The secret  ballot  was

conducted  under the supervision of the  Registrar  of

Trade Unions. I think everybody knows the result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Public Daily-Rated Employees Union, I

am happy to say that the question of union recognition

has  been discussed during the last few days and I  am

also  glad  to say that they have reached a settlement

and  that  the question of union recognition  will  be

dealt with in the shortest possible time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The time appointed for the

termination of the sitting has arrived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker adjourned the House without Question put

pursuant to the Standing Order.
