FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar)</B>:&nbsp; As I have said in this House before, our legal system, legal services and legal expertise are important to our economy. We have seen the demand for more specialised legal services growing in recent years as our economy and the regional economy develop. To meet this new market demand, our legal services sector needs lawyers with the requisite knowledge and skills. But because Singapore is a small jurisdiction we need to be able to tap the expertise of lawyers from around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1999, we launched schemes to allow local law firms to enter into Joint Law Ventures&nbsp;(JLVs) or Formal Law Alliances (FLAs)&nbsp;with foreign law firms. &nbsp;We wanted to provide a convenient and efficient mode for delivery of legal services in cross-border financial transactions. At that time, we agreed&nbsp;to review the Schemes in 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, a Review Committee, headed by the Attorney-General, recently completed a review of the Schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They found that the range of legal services in foreign laws and in Singapore law available in Singapore is satisfactory and meets the current legal needs of the strategic service sectors of the economy.&nbsp; In addition, the Review Committee found the Schemes to be structurally sound and appropriate to their objectives. &nbsp;They have achieved the objective of providing an adequate 'one-stop shop' service in foreign laws and Singapore law in cross-border financial transactions in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this legal framework for collaboration between local and foreign firms firmly established, the Review Committee has proposed that we can now expand the scope of practice of JLVs and FLAs.&nbsp; Looking ahead, this will enable JLVs and FLAs to provide the necessary legal support for the emerging strategic <p align=left>Column: 1176</p>service sectors of the economy. The new areas proposed are arbitration, intellectual property law and maritime law. Arbitration, Sir,&nbsp;is a very fast growing area of law practice and Singapore is an ideal venue for international arbitrations.&nbsp; Singapore is also an IT and maritime hub in the region.&nbsp; We will develop and support these areas by including them in the JLV and FLA schemes. &nbsp;Furthermore, the Review Committee has also proposed JLVs or FLAs for any or a combination of these practices will also be considered on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help Singapore law firms grow their practices abroad, the Review Committee also considered how they can acquire in-house foreign law expertise. &nbsp;Some foreign lawyers with the skills and experience that we need may not find a consultancy relationship with a local firm to be satisfactory, even if the compensation package is high. &nbsp;To ensure that we can continue attracting experienced and talented foreign lawyers to work in Singapore law firms, the Review Committee has recommended that foreign lawyers be permitted to own equity shares in local law firms, subject to an aggregate limit of 25% of the total equity shares or profits of the local law firm. Sir, this will help our local firms to expand their capabilities and reach out to the region. This proposal, I believe,&nbsp;will also help Singapore law firms in the region, especially in China, to grow by giving a stake to local lawyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has accepted these recommendations&nbsp;of the Committee and we are working to implement them as soon as possible. The Government has also agreed that the Attorney-General be given the discretion to grant a JLV or FLA licence for any other area of law practice either as a complementary or principal practice of a JLV or FLA if it enhances the quality of legal services in Singapore or supports the development of Singapore. This way, we will give flexibility to include <p align=left>Column: 1177</p>other areas of law practice for which there may be future demand for legal services.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from this recent review of the JLV/FLA schemes, let me say that we are also addressing the question whether we will have enough lawyers for our future needs. &nbsp;My Ministry has set up a Committee, which is&nbsp;headed by the Attorney-General, to look into the supply of lawyers.&nbsp; We will work closely with the Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the report of this Committee should be completed by the middle of this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me end, Sir,&nbsp;by saying that our existing framework for admission to the Singapore bar&nbsp;is primarily based on a Singapore law degree. &nbsp;For the purposes of admission, however, we have recognised certain specific LLB degrees obtained by our citizens and permanent residents from some universities in England, Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp; In order to encourage the creation of a more diverse generation of lawyers here in Singapore, we will soon give our students more choice by adding to the list the Juris Doctor degrees from four US universities, namely, Columbia University, Harvard University, New York University and the University of Michigan.&nbsp; This is pursuant to the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, my Ministry will continue to work closely with the various legal institutions and organisations to develop the legal services sector in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)</B>: I have three supplementary questions, Sir.&nbsp; First, is on the opening up of the JLVs and FLAs to cover arbitration.&nbsp; I would be grateful if the Minister for Law could explain the rationale behind extending it to arbitration, given that foreign law firms are already able to conduct arbitration in Singapore, whether under SIAC or any other mode of arbitration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1178</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question: DPM and Minister for Law mentioned that foreign lawyers would be allowed to own equity shares in local firms.&nbsp; I would like to know whether the foreign lawyers would also be required to be admitted to the Singapore Bar and, thereby, practise Singapore law, or whether by virtue of their admission through equity in a local firm they can automatically practise Singapore law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third question: for the Juris Doctor degrees, in the US, of course, it is a post-graduate degree.&nbsp; What I want to know is whether people who get degrees from the US and want to come back to Singapore to practise would also be required to undergo the Singapore Diploma conducted by the NUS,&nbsp; something that students who graduate from the UK and other countries are required to undertake before they can practise.&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B>&nbsp; The Member is right about our laws permitting foreign lawyers to practise arbitration.&nbsp; We are not just looking at foreign lawyers/counsels flying in when retained to appear for specific cases.&nbsp; What we are trying to encourage really is full service firms that specialise in arbitration, especially in specialist fields.&nbsp; So, Singapore law firms can form such an association to boost their capabilities.&nbsp; Foreign law firms would be able to establish a presence or base here, so to speak, to serve the region, bring dispute resolution work from various parts of the region to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The firms that may be interested in this may not be the same firms that are already here for international financial&nbsp; transactions.&nbsp; So, we are thinking that collaboration with Singapore law firms could allow the foreign firms become more competitive in terms of pricing their services for work involving Singapore law - China work, India work, perhaps.&nbsp; So the FLA, local and foreign partners, <p align=left>Column: 1179</p>through that mechanism, can then market their arbitration service as a global service, as it were, that includes Singapore law services in arbitration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her next question was about the proposal to allow foreign lawyers to have an equity stake in Singapore law firm - whether that foreign lawyer who takes such a stake can, by the very act, practise in Singapore.&nbsp; The answer is, no.&nbsp; That person will have to comply with whatever requirements that already exist for practice of Singapore law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third question is with regard to the four degrees in the United States that would be recognised for the purpose of admission.&nbsp; Students who have obtained their degree from the universities, like students who have obtained their degree from other scheduled universities, will have to comply with the requirements for admission to the Singapore Bar.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the NEA has stated that it aims to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 190,000 tonnes by 2012,&nbsp;by reducing energy wastage and promoting its conservation.&nbsp; In relation to this, I would like to ask the <p align=left>Column: 1184</p>Minister to provide us with an update of these efforts and, in particular, whether the Ministry would&nbsp; implement a mandatory energy labelling scheme, at least on all airconditioners and refrigerators, which are guzzlers of energy, and whether the Ministry will be ratifying the Kyoto Protocol as yet another sign to the international community of our earnest efforts and commitment to promote energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, what does the Ministry see as other global trends and challenges facing us on the environmental front, and how does the Ministry plan to tackle them?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore's pole position in the region for its stringent controls with clean air and water and green urban designs is undisputed.&nbsp; However, we will be hard put to say that we have the same high standards of public hygiene and cleanliness or recycling habits.&nbsp; To me, these relate to basic behavioural patterns and social graces.&nbsp; Cumulatively, shaping them is even more important in environmental conservation than mere programmes or campaigns which have limited shelf life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year, after the New Year countdown or the Chingay parade, there never fails to be letters to the <I>Forum</I> pages on the amount of litter left at Orchard Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, it was reported that two tonnes of litter were left behind after the Orchard Road Chingay parade.&nbsp; On 31st December last year, it was reported that the litter generated at the Orchard Road New Year countdown amounted to some six kilotonnes!&nbsp; The writer further noted that rubbish was simply thrown&nbsp;to the ground even with the many rubbish bins available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have been trying to tackle the littering problem since the 1970s, but like stubborn stains on&nbsp;white shorts, it refuses <p align=left>Column: 1185</p>to go away.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry how it plans to meet this challenge in the coming year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another fundamental issue relates to our standard of public hygiene and cleanliness of our public toilets.&nbsp; Since the retreat of SARS, it seems that the standard of hygiene and cleanliness in many public toilets has also retreated, and many of the toilets which have been given the "Singapore OK" mark seems to have k-oed.&nbsp; In fact, the label itself has k-oed, because&nbsp;it is&nbsp;faded and filthy.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry plans to review and revamp the whole initiative to improve the standards of cleanliness and hygiene of our public toilets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is noted that households here do produce less rubbish than in the West, but they lag behind in recycling.&nbsp; It is also noted that whilst the number of homes participating in recycling is high, the volume of recyclables collected is low compared to those overseas.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry could look into improving our infrastructure, such as having more recycling bins at convenient locations in housing estates and commercial areas, as well as working with the MND to have flats with separate rubbish chutes for food waste and other recyclables like paper.&nbsp; This would help to improve the participation rate as well as the amount of rubbish recycled.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister, besides educating and encouraging individuals and companies to participate in recycling, what other measures are being taken to reduce the amount of waste produced in Singapore.&nbsp; For instance, what is being done to encourage companies to use recyclable packaging and&nbsp;is there&nbsp;any attempt to reduce the amount of plastic consumption in Singapore?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I just heard&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor say that some areas are filled with rubbish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of the Mass Rapid Transit trains contributed towards a cleaner mode of transport.&nbsp; Today, I understand that the main bulk of fine particles in our ambient atmosphere&nbsp;is from vehicles.&nbsp; These particles are in the form of elemental carbon and from fuel oil combustion in the form of sulphates.&nbsp; One of the main sources of suspended particles or particulate matter, commonly referred to as PM,&nbsp;affects the people's health.&nbsp; The big particulate matter is PM10 and the smaller&nbsp;one is PM2.5.&nbsp; Both PM10 and PM2.5 particles can cause health problems,&nbsp;in particular respiratory&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because&nbsp;PM2.5 travels deeper into the lungs and&nbsp;it is made up of things that are more toxic, like heavy metals and cancer causing organic compounds,&nbsp;PM2.5&nbsp;can have&nbsp;worse health effects than the bigger PM10.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US, it was found that PM2.5 was linked to some 95,000 cases of chronic and acute bronchitis.&nbsp; In Singapore, as I understand, we are able to meet the US EPA standards for PM10 but not for PM2.5, which is mainly emitted by diesel vehicles.&nbsp; What efforts are being done to ensure that we can meet the US EPA standards for PM2.5?&nbsp; With more pharmaceutical, chemical and petrochemical plants being set up in Singapore and with the growth of vehicular traffic and new criss-crossing flyovers, the amount of pollution will naturally rise.&nbsp; Singapore is becoming busier and busier with higher people density, from the residents to the&nbsp;ever rising transient tourist&nbsp;traffic.&nbsp; People are becoming more <p align=left>Column: 1187</p>affluent and the rise of consumerism also gives rise to the burning of more fuel.&nbsp; Power plants are generating electricity due to higher electricity consumption.&nbsp; More people movement results in higher vehicular traffic.&nbsp; More garbage thrown means more waste for incineration.&nbsp; The pollution situation is going to get worse and worse, and we have to put in a lot of effort before it can get better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may need to have an inter-Ministry panel to look into how we are going to cope and to put in place a plan to control&nbsp;pollution before it is too late.&nbsp; What is the Ministry's plan and effort on&nbsp;the control of air quality in our living environment?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pertinent question&nbsp;after the COS debate on transport makes me wonder&nbsp;whether our small island-state is able to sustain the 3% vehicle increase annually, in terms of the pollution impact to our environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that&nbsp;LTA and NEA are already working closely,&nbsp;and on 1st October 2006, we will adopt the Euro&nbsp;IV emission standards for all diesel vehicles registered henceforth.&nbsp; My suggestion is that the MEWR should work closely on an inter-panel basis, to encourage and persuade, and also to ensure that our economic and social activities of all the other Ministries should not cause undue stress to our environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I am of the opinion that NEA should also rope in the health officials to monitor the relationship between pollution and the rise in, say, cases of people falling ill from respiratory and other diseases.&nbsp; I think there is more to public and private relationship, and the Ministry has to look into inter-Ministry policies and guidelines&nbsp;on other economic activities as well.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</B>&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Amy Khor, our GPC Chair, and other Members for their questions and suggestions.&nbsp;I will try my best to answer all their queries.&nbsp; If we cannot, we can probably follow up after the COS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me begin by highlighting some of the key environmental challenges facing us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by Members,&nbsp;it is increasingly clear that climate change or global warming is one of the major environmental challenges of our time. Extreme weather patterns in 2005 have threatened lives and disrupted economies <p align=left>Column: 1190</p>in many parts of the world. Increasing scientific evidence suggests a link between global warming and such natural disasters. This calls for greater efforts around the world to slow down or reduce the emission of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of public health, there was a resurgence of dengue cases&nbsp; throughout the South-East Asia region, including Singapore. &nbsp;Through the&nbsp; combined efforts of the Government and the community, we succeeded in bringing the dengue situation under control very quickly. From a peak of 713 cases in one week in September last year, this has fallen to an average weekly&nbsp;of 66 for January 2006.&nbsp; So I wish to take this opportunity to thank the many grassroots, volunteers, officers and residents who have supported my Ministry's efforts in this area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide concern over environmental issues, however, also means&nbsp;that there is increasing demand for better and more&nbsp;efficient environmental and water technology and services, and this presents us with opportunities. &nbsp;My Ministry has been a pioneer in increasing private sector involvement in the provision of environmental and water&nbsp; infrastructure and services.&nbsp; In 2003, we awarded a public-private partnership (PPP) contract for the first desalination plant in Singapore, followed by a PPP contract for a NEWater plant, and one for Singapore's fifth incineration plant last year. Besides boosting our water supply and improving our environmental services, such partnerships have helped companies to gain valuable expertise and track record for expansion overseas.&nbsp; We can also contribute to the enhancement of environmental well-being in other regions.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also made good progress in job creation in the environmental sector. Between April last year and February this year, NEA, together with the <p align=left>Column: 1191</p>Town Councils, Workforce Development Agency, NTUC and environmental companies, has successfully matched more than 580 workers with jobs paying more than $1,000 a month. NEA and its partners were also given the Job Recreation Programme "Top Achiever Award" last month by NTUC for its efforts in this area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our various environmental efforts&nbsp; have ensured that the quality of Singapore's physical environment remains good.&nbsp; Singapore has continued to be&nbsp; highly rated in the 2005 annual surveys by CondÃ© Nast Traveller and the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC).&nbsp; In fact, under the PERC survey, Singapore scored particularly well for our air quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example of international recognition of our excellent environmental efforts is the decision by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to host the annual award ceremony of the "Champions of the Earth" Award in Singapore for the next three years.&nbsp; The first one will be held next month. As the UNEP Executive Director, Mr Klaus Toepfer noted: "Singapore is a natural choice for such a global environmental event, as it is a country that has become an inspiration for other nations striving to achieve the goal of sustainable development".&nbsp; A high-quality living environment benefits all.&nbsp; It also bodes well for our tourism and business sectors, where Singapore's reputation as a global city with a clean and healthy environment will continue to attract visitors and investments to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that our high-quality environment is the result of years of sustained effort by individuals, organisations and the community.&nbsp; Many are doing their part in recycling, conserving water and adopting energy-efficiency practices.&nbsp; In a recent public <p align=left>Column: 1192</p>perception survey carried out by my Ministry, a large majority of respondents were positive about the state of our environment. 79% rated Singapore's state of the environment as "good" or "very good", and 64% rated it as better than that three years ago.&nbsp; In the same survey, more than 90% said they can play a part in energy and water conservation.&nbsp;My colleagues and&nbsp;I are heartened by this positive feedback and keen interest, and we encourage all to keep up these efforts in sustaining a clean and healthy environment.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, indeed, we cannot take our clean environment for granted. As Dr Khor had mentioned earlier, littering remains a key environmental challenge we need to address. Discarded containers such as drink cans are among the top three sources of mosquito breeding in residential estates. Litter can also blemish the image of our cityscape and clog up our waterways.&nbsp; From the public perception survey, cleanliness of public areas such as roads, drains and canals is identified as the top environmental concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEA has been working with the community to promote anti-littering behaviour. In 2005, 19 national events such as the National Day Parade and the Singapore River Regatta, as well as another 230 community events, implemented litter-free initiatives.&nbsp; These included providing adequate litter bins during the events and reminding the participants on the proper disposal of their litter. Close to 120 primary schools have also participated in the Litter-Free School programme, where students are encouraged not to leave unwanted items around.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue with public education and enforcement efforts, NEA will extend the Litter-Free Campaign to include Litter-Free Premises this year.&nbsp; We will work with operators and users to <p align=left>Column: 1193</p>keep premises frequented by the public such as hawker centres and coffeeshops litter-free.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor has correctly pointed out that waste management is another one of our key environmental challenges. We are on track to achieve our target, which is to recycle 60% of the total waste generated by 2012. Our recycling rate in 2005 was 49%, up from 40% in 2000.&nbsp; We are setting up centralised recycling bins in all HDB estates by 2007 to encourage more household recycling.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond recycling, however, we can do more to reduce waste at source. Last month, we launched the campaign to reduce excessive use of plastic bags and encourage the use of reusable shopping bags.&nbsp; The response from the public as well as from retailers, including the major supermarket chains, has been encouraging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another major type of waste is packaging waste, as noted by Dr Khor, which makes up 35% of household waste in Singapore.&nbsp; My Ministry is working with manufacturers and distributors to develop a voluntary agreement to reduce the amount of packaging used and enhance the recovery of packaging materials.&nbsp; To date, several major food and beverage companies and the Packaging Council of Singapore have indicated their interest to participate in this proposed agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have sketched out the key environmental challenges facing Singapore and what my Ministry is doing to ensure that we continue to enjoy a high-quality living environment.&nbsp; Singapore's blueprint on tackling these environmental challenges is spelt out in the Singapore Green Plan 2012, which was released in 2002. Last year, we embarked on a review of the Green Plan to update its targets and action programmes, and I am pleased to inform the House that the revised Green Plan will be made public <p align=left>Column: 1194</p>later this month.&nbsp; The revised Singapore Green Plan is a product of extensive consultation between the Government and the private and people sectors.&nbsp; I am happy to see Singaporeans taking greater ownership of our environment.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, climate change or global warming is one of the major global environmental challenges of our time.&nbsp; Both Dr Amy Khor and Dr Geh Min have pointed this out.&nbsp; There is general scientific agreement that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have contributed to climate change effects such as rising global temperatures, rising sea levels and extreme weather. There is also agreement that the international community needs to take concerted action to deal with climate change before it is too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's commitment to climate change is consistent with our good record on environmental issues. We have been a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change since 1997. Last year, in this House, I mentioned that we were studying the timing of our accession to the Kyoto Protocol, which is the primary international agreement on climate change. Sir, I am pleased to inform Members that Singapore will be acceding to the Kyoto Protocol in 2006.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore intends to engage in the ongoing international debate on how to manage greenhouse gas emission levels in a manner that is not harmful to our economic growth. By balancing environmental quality and sustainable economic development, Singapore will continue to prosper economically and provide a high-quality environment for residents, investors and visitors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will continue to take actions domestically to address climate change. Dr Khor and Dr Geh Min have asked about our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas <p align=left>Column: 1195</p>emissions. In Singapore, the primary greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide generated from energy use. A range of measures has therefore been adopted to improve energy efficiency and increase cleaner energy usage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, NEA introduced a voluntary Energy Labelling Scheme for air-conditioners and refrigerators. The labels provide energy performance information to help our consumers choose energy-efficient models and thus save on their utilities bills. As of January 2006, 121 air-conditioner and 77 fridge models were labelled, representing 27% and 20% of available models respectively. However, as most air-conditioner and fridge models are not labelled, the voluntary scheme remains limited in its ability to help our consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;we will thus make it mandatory for all air-conditioners and refrigerators to carry energy efficiency labels from mid-2007.&nbsp; I see Dr Khor smiling.&nbsp; This, as Mdm Cynthia Phua has also&nbsp;pointed out, would allow consumers to make more informed choices on appliances whose energy consumption forms a significant part of their utilities bill. My Ministry is now working with suppliers to ensure a smooth transition to the mandatory labelling scheme. We will also study the possibility of expanding the labelling scheme to include other energy-intensive appliances such as clothes dryers, dishwashers and water heaters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory labelling will complement the existing domestic measures on climate change.&nbsp;For example, to promote energy efficiency in buildings, NEA launched the Energy Smart Buildings Scheme together with NUS in December 2005.&nbsp; This is the first energy-efficient building label in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote the purchase of green vehicles such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid vehicles, we have <p align=left>Column: 1196</p>doubled the Green Vehicle Rebate and extended it till 2007.&nbsp; At end February 2006, after just two months of the extended rebate, there were 208 green vehicles on the road, more than double the number last year. Motor traders have started marketing green vehicles to car buyers and reported positive response. We can thus expect to see more green vehicles on the road. So, to answer Dr Geh Min's question, we are taking the&nbsp;lead, given our context in promoting energy efficiency in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also opportunities arising from action on climate change, as noted by Dr Geh Min, and Singapore should capitalise on these.&nbsp; There is now growing worldwide demand for low-carbon technologies and fuels. We are thus encouraging companies to explore alternative energy technologies such as solar energy, as well as to test-bed emerging technologies such as fuel cells. Dr Geh Min has asked whether this will be the focus for NRF.&nbsp; As I replied earlier in the House to one of the questions, I will leave it to Dr Tan, as Chairman of NRF, to announce this.&nbsp; But in the cut on environmental technologies, I will update the House on the efforts by my Ministry to work together with the NRF to grow the environmental industry in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Kyoto Protocol, developed countries can buy carbon credits to help meet their emission-reduction targets. As a result, carbon trading markets such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme have developed. To look at opportunities relating to emission reduction and carbon trading, IE Singapore has helped form an iPartner consortium of Singapore-based environmental technology companies. This consortium is led by Asia Carbon, one of the first-movers in the carbon emissions trading industry. I hope all businesses and industries, in playing their part in addressing climate change, will also view such actions as opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1197</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has also been working with other agencies, as noted by Dr Geh Min, Dr Khor and Mdm Cynthia Phua, to develop a holistic climate change strategy that actively engages the people and private sectors in climate change action.&nbsp;The climate change strategy will explain how Singapore can address climate change in an environmentally and economically sustainable way. It will examine four key prongs of action: adaptation to climate change, mitigation of our carbon emissions, raising awareness on climate change as well as competency building. This strategy forms a key focus area of the Singapore Green Plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming months, we will be carrying out public consultation on the climate change strategy, to gather ideas and feedback on Singapore's proposed response to climate change.&nbsp; I will strongly encourage all members of the public to offer their views.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, to contribute to climate change action, the public first needs to understand the causes of climate change and how it affects our lives.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

So NEA will be working with the Singapore Environment Council to roll out a public awareness programme on energy efficiency and climate change in April.&nbsp; This programme aims to raise its awareness on the link between energy use and climate change.&nbsp; It will also show how households and motorists, by making simple adjustments in their daily habits, can reduce energy use, thus saving money and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; This programme, I hope, addresses Dr Khor's question on <p align=left>Column: 1198</p>promoting energy conservation and efficiency practices in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contributing to the global climate change effort, my Ministry will continue to explore other programmes to improve Singapore's energy efficiency over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me turn to the issue of particulate matter (PM)&nbsp;2.5, which was raised by Mdm Cynthia Phua.&nbsp; Energy use in Singapore is also linked to air quality, as the burning of fossil fuels emits not just greenhouse gases but other air pollutants.&nbsp; While our ambient air quality generally compares favourably with other cities in the world,&nbsp;it was right for Mdm Cynthia Phua in highlighting the emerging issue of PM2.5 or particulate matter finer than 2.5 microns as a key challenge.&nbsp; PM2.5 has been linked to respiratory diseases and heart diseases.&nbsp; Singapore's ambient level of PM2.5 today is 21 microgram per cubic metre which is above the standard of 15 microgram per cubic metre set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&nbsp; Unless we do something, our ambient PM2.5 level will increase further, largely due to vehicular growth, as noted by Mdm Phua.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we reduce PM2.5 levels by replacing diesel vehicles with CNG vehicles which emit negligible amounts of PM2.5.&nbsp; This is why we have enhanced and extended the Green Vehicle Rebate for CNG vehicles and why CNG taxis will continue to be exempt from the special tax until December 2007.&nbsp; To improve CNG support infrastructure, NEA has also provided $2 million to support the building of three more refuelling stations across the island this year.&nbsp; We will continue to work with our public and private partners to promote measures that contribute to better air quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think I have addressed most of the issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><p align=left>Column: 1199</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, I wish to thank Dr Amy Khor and Dr Ong for their questions. 2005 has been a significant year in Singapore's water history. In&nbsp;September 2005,&nbsp;our Prime Minister turned on our fourth National Tap with the opening of SingSpring's desalination plant in Tuas. Our first three National Taps are water from local catchment, imported water from Johor, and NEWater. I am pleased to inform the House that our ongoing projects to increase supply from our local reservoirs are progressing well. By 2009, when the various reservoir schemes are completed, our catchment area will increase from half to two-thirds of Singapore's land area.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about our strategy to secure sufficient water for Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, with all four National Taps now in place, we are well-placed to meet our future water needs. If need be, Singapore can be self-sufficient beyond 2061. Besides ensuring a sustainable supply of water, we will also continue to uphold high standards of water quality, water supply security and reliability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB will continue their stringent Water Quality Monitoring Programme, involving both PUB's and external laboratories. We will also continue to engage an International Audit Panel to provide independent reviews on PUB's management of water quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone of us needs to play our part to ensure that the rain water <p align=left>Column: 1201</p>collected in our network of drains, canals and rivers is free of litter and pollution. As more and more of Singapore's land is utilised as catchment areas, pollution caused by people and industrial discharge is likely to find its way into the reservoirs. It is important that we minimise such pollution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as noted by Dr Ong, the Marina Reservoir once completed&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a freshwater lake which will be created with the completion of the Marina Barrage. While we are confident that the raw water collected can be treated to high drinking standards with advanced membrane technology, the challenge, as noted by Dr Ong,&nbsp;will be to ensure that the water is good for recreational and other lifestyle activities. Once the Marina Barrage is built, the basin will be free from the influence of the ocean tides and ideal for various water activities. So we need to ensure that water flowing into the basin is not polluted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB is working together with other agencies to draw up a comprehensive programme to tighten pollution control, and with industries on housekeeping measures to manage pollution. In 2006, we will reinforce our efforts in two key areas. Firstly, we will continue to upgrade the sewerage network system to minimise sewer leakages. Secondly, PUB is working with the construction industry to adopt earth control measures such that silt from construction sites does not end up in our reservoirs. Concurrently, we will also step up enforcement to deal with recalcitrant offenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we continue with our efforts to diversify and increase our supply of water, we must concurrently pursue conservation strategies to manage water demand effectively. Both Dr Khor and&nbsp;Dr Ong have&nbsp;asked how we can further encourage water conservation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1202</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB adopts a multi-pronged approach in managing water demand through pricing, mandatory water conservation requirements and encouraging voluntarism. This strategy has worked as our per capita domestic water consumption has decreased from 176 litres per day in 1994 to 160 litres per day in 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is however room to do more. Following feedback from the Singapore Green Plan (SGP) 2012 review process, PUB will set a new target to lower our per capita domestic water consumption to 155 litres per day by 2012. To achieve this target, PUB will be rolling out additional new initiatives in 2006.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first update the House on our existing programmes. Our ongoing Water Efficient Homes and Water Efficient Buildings programmes have been very successful. In our recent public survey, 87% of Singaporeans indicated that they practise water conservation at home. A further 231 commercial and industrial buildings and premises joined our Water Efficient Buildings programme in 2005. In July 2005, PUB launched the Water Detective Programme to educate primary school students on how they should conserve, value and enjoy water. We will continue with these efforts to spread the water conservation message.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the existing programmes, PUB will roll out a new programme in 2006 called the "10-Litre Challenge".&nbsp; This programme aims to get every individual, you and me included,&nbsp;to reduce daily water consumption by 10 litres. The "10-Litre Challenge" programme will comprise various initiatives, such as water volunteer groups, a labelling scheme for water-efficient appliances, and promoting the use of dual-flush low-capacity flushing cisterns (LCFCs).&nbsp; Allow me&nbsp;to elaborate.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, PUB is working with the Singapore Environment Council to set up <p align=left>Column: 1203</p>a dedicated web portal to show how easy it is to save 10 litres of water a day. For example, I was told that just by reducing shower time by one minute, each person can save up to&nbsp;nine litres of water.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, PUB is working with PA and&nbsp;CDCs for grassroots organisations to form water volunteer groups. These water volunteer groups, supported by PUB officers, will conduct visits to educate households on water conservation practices and help them install water saving devices. The water volunteer groups will also visit lower-income and needy families to help them save on their water bills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we will put in place a voluntary water efficiency labelling scheme for water fittings and appliances by the end of this year. Like energy efficiency labels, water efficiency labels will enable consumers to make better informed choices before purchasing items like washing machines and flushing cisterns.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, PUB is looking into the mandatory installation of dual-flush low-capacity flushing cisterns (LCFCs) in all new buildings, as well as existing buildings undergoing renovations by end 2009. Compared to single-flush cisterns, the dual-flush models use less water as they allow users the choice of a half-flush versus a full-flush. Based on a market study, dual-flush and single-flush types cost almost the same. HDB will be carrying out pilot projects to install dual-flush LCFCs in flats for selected HDB Main Upgrading Programmes (MUP).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor also asked how we are helping low-income families so that they have a constant supply of water. I have earlier mentioned the Water Efficient Homes Programme&nbsp;and the Water Volunteer Groups, and how they would <p align=left>Column: 1204</p>visit lower-income and needy families to help them save on their water bills. For example, volunteers from the Sunlove Home Neighbourhood Link and Indus Moral Care visit needy senior citizens in South East and Central CDCs respectively to help them install water saving devices and share with them water saving habits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For households that are in arrears, PUB has made arrangements with SP Services to offer instalment plans for households to settle their utilities bill arrears over a period of time.&nbsp; Instead of having their water supply cut, PUB reduces the flow rate of water to these households by installing flow restrictors. This enables such households to continue to have access to water for their basic needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides utilities rebates provided under the Utilities Save (U-Save) Scheme, CDCs also offer financial assistance to help low-income and needy families offset their utilities bills.

Sir, both environmental and water technologies have played a significant part in our efforts to enhance our environmental and water resources, and to sustain the high environmental standards that Singapore enjoys today.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Research Foundation (NRF) has identified Environmental and Water Technologies (EWT) as one of the two new areas for strategic research and development&nbsp;initiatives that would generate economic benefits for Singapore.&nbsp; My Ministry is working closely with the NRF to further develop plans to grow the environmental and water technologies sector.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will&nbsp; intensify our efforts to attract global research laboratories and companies to set up their operations in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will offer more Government facilities for companies to test and try out their new technologies.&nbsp; Through the NRF,&nbsp;we intend to create a pool&nbsp;of specialist manpower, such as engineers,&nbsp; researchers and technicians,&nbsp;to support the increased&nbsp;R&amp;D work.&nbsp; By doing these, we will strengthen Singapore's position in applied water and environmental research, as well as Singapore's ability to commercialise and use the new technologies.&nbsp; We will also build up our capabilities in the area of basic research so that Singapore will be better placed to develop the next generation of cutting-edge technologies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board (PUB) has ensured that Singapore has enough water to sustain its growth and development through our Four National Taps strategy.&nbsp; In doing so, Singapore turned weakness into strength, and is now a growing water hub, a recognised leader in adopting new water technologies and in integrated management of water resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our efforts have not gone unnoticed by the international community. &nbsp;I am pleased to announce that at the <p align=left>Column: 1207</p>2006 Global Water Awards held in Dubai last evening, PUB won the prestigious Water Agency of the Year award.&nbsp; This award by the Global Water Intelligence Magazine is a prestigious symbol of achievement in the global water industry.&nbsp; PUB won the award against competition from reputable water agencies from the UK, US and Saudi Arabia. &nbsp;Our homegrown company Hyflux was also named the Water Company of the Year.&nbsp; These awards reaffirm the good work put in by PUB and our industry partners in ensuring a sustainable water supply for Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of water technologies, PUB is working with companies and research institutes to test the use of new membrane systems to treat used water to further enhance our water sources.&nbsp; The Membrane Bio-Reactor (MBR), the Membrane Distillation (Memstill) and the Variable Salinity Plant (VSP) are just three examples of recent technological advances which have the potential to drive down the cost of water production, enhance our water sources, and provide Singapore with a leading edge in the global water industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have also been promoting applied research and test-bedding of emerging environmental technologies in Singapore through the Innovation for Environmental Sustainability (IES) Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;One project supported by the IES Fund is the development of a process by GPac Technology (S) Pte Ltd to produce pallets from recycled horticultural and wood waste instead of timber.&nbsp; We hope that more companies will come forward and tap on the IES Fund to test new and innovative technologies in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, both Dr Amy Khor and Mr Othman asked about the private sector participation in the environmental and water sectors.&nbsp; My Ministry has been helping to build up the companies' experience and <p align=left>Column: 1208</p>track record to expand overseas.&nbsp; Through the Public-Private Partnerships projects that I mentioned earlier, companies have built up plant operation and maintenance experience, and can now offer their services as a more complete package to potential clients.&nbsp; Members may have read that some of our environmental companies are bidding for projects overseas, including the Middle East and China.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further develop the water industry, my Ministry will explore the possibility of giving the private sector a larger role in the supply of NEWater to the Kranji cluster.&nbsp; This will be studied in greater detail in the coming months before finalising the plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we leverage on Singapore's strong networks and ties with other countries to facilitate the companies' expansion abroad.&nbsp; We have strong government-to-government links, for example, with ASEAN, China, the Middle Eastern countries and India.&nbsp; IE Singapore also has strong networks and links with potential overseas partners.&nbsp; We have also been organising business missions for environmental and water companies.&nbsp; My Ministry will continue to support and encourage our water and environment companies venturing overseas.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I know that the Government does not regard this as an empty gesture, but a commitment backed by firm action.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many countries have a governing legislation that includes the procurement of environmentally sound technology and products based on their proven track records and endorsements, so that the public sector is required to request for <p align=left>Column: 1209</p>products under an Eco Label category within its tender requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these products and technologies are affiliated to Singapore's Green &nbsp;Labelling Scheme, and a number of foreign companies based in Singapore have also already committed to integrating such practices into their businesses here, eg, Fuji and&nbsp;Xerox.&nbsp; But there is still no official policy in the public sector yet for promoting the procurement and use of environmentally sound&nbsp;products and technologies.&nbsp; Why?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commitment and support from the&nbsp;Government would promote green procurement practices in the private and people sector.&nbsp; It would lead to the increase of imports and local development of more eco-friendly products and technology.&nbsp; It could propel the expansion of the range and quality of such products locally and promote the export of eco-friendly products to external markets.&nbsp; It will also give greater substance and an additional dimension to Singapore's clean and green image by going one significant step further.&nbsp; By taking the lead for sound eco-friendly practices, the Government agencies will enhance their credibility and Singapore's reputation, both locally and abroad.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister Mentor's vision of a clean and green Singapore as good for business, good for people and good for the environment pre-empted the triple-bottom line of an economically profitable, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable practice.&nbsp; But while visions are timeless, their interpretation and implementation need to be reviewed regularly to remain relevant to the changing global environment and to new challenges.&nbsp; In today's context of global warming, limited supply of fossil fuels, and rising costs of energy, "clean and green" requires new mindsets, policies and practices.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1210</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the introduction of a Green Procurement Policy in the public sector is an obvious one - low-hanging fruit that is in our garden.&nbsp; Singapore may be clean and green, but there are some "black holes" in our green image, and&nbsp;one of these is our lack of a green procurement policy in the public sector.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

My question relates to the recent world-wide fears about the emergence of bird flu in the region.&nbsp; Does the Ministry have safety guidelines for workers on how to deal with the disposal of dead birds found in public areas, such as roadsides, schools, parks and other public places?&nbsp; The reason is because the current outbreak is primarily in migratory birds that have been propagating the Avian flu.&nbsp; In particular, do these guidelines dovetail with our national H5N1 flu surveillance efforts?&nbsp; Does the public have to be educated on the safety guidelines for handling dead birds as well?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I reiterate my concern, as we cannot afford&nbsp;not to be too careful, what&nbsp;with the recent bird flu outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and Singapore's situational position.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Geh Min and Dr Tan for their questions.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Geh Min has asked about green procurement in the public sector.&nbsp; We recognise that green procurement can offer environmental benefits and lead to <p align=left>Column: 1211</p>greater efficiency and savings.&nbsp; Hence, we welcome the use of green products and services, and encourage the adoption of green procurement practices, not just in the public sector but throughout Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, the Government has put in place a number of measures to encourage green purchases.&nbsp; For example, we have extended the green vehicle rebates to encourage more to choose such vehicles.&nbsp; In addition, my Ministry will be making it mandatory, as announced by the Minister a few minutes ago,&nbsp;for air-conditioners and refrigerators to be energy labelled, so that consumers have the necessary information when buying those appliances.&nbsp; We are also encouraging energy audits among companies and building owners to improve their energy efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key principle of public sector procurement is to secure value-for-money for goods and services purchased.&nbsp; While the public sector does not have an explicit green procurement policy, public agencies are free to procure environmentally-friendly goods and services, based on their own needs and circumstances.&nbsp; We encourage them, where possible, to purchase green products within those guidelines.&nbsp; I am heartened to see that the public sector is piloting a number of green procurement initiatives.&nbsp; For example, the Singapore Police Force has procured two hybrid cars for trial as patrol vehicles.&nbsp; Eight public sector agencies, including MEWR, MOF, MOM and SGH, are also participating in a pilot scheme on performance contracts for energy audits.&nbsp; Under this scheme, the contractor designs and finances the installation of energy-saving equipment and gets paid according to the savings achieved.&nbsp; The agencies put in nothing, or very little.&nbsp; If successful, Sir, we will encourage more public agencies to implement such green contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1212</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides green procurement, it is equally important for us to internalise environmentally-friendly habits.&nbsp; Recently, MEWR and NEA were awarded the Green Office Label under Project Eco-Office.&nbsp; This is an initiative launched by the Singapore Environment Council to encourage office workers to incorporate environmentally-friendly practices in their daily routines.&nbsp; Since certification, my Ministry has achieved a 5% reduction in both energy and water consumption - very green practices.&nbsp; Recovery of recyclables, such as paper and drink cans, has also increased significantly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to further promote the adoption of green procurement and practices among public agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Tan has asked about the&nbsp;guidelines on the&nbsp;disposal of dead birds and whether these guidelines dovetail with our Avian&nbsp;flu surveillance efforts.&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; AVA has put in place an Avian flu surveillance system as well as an inter-agency action plan to respond to an Avian flu incident.&nbsp; As part of the surveillance system, NEA will respond to calls on the presence of dead birds and send these for H5N1 virus testing in AVA laboratories.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out this work, Sir, NEA officers and cleansing workers are equipped with personal protection equipment, such as gloves and masks, and are trained to follow safety procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, AVA has not detected the presence of the H5N1 virus in Singapore.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, as a precautionary measure, the public is advised not to handle any dead birds they come across, but to contact NEA.&nbsp; As we have learnt in our fight against dengue, maintaining Singapore's high standard of public health requires the public to be our eyes and ears on the ground.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof)--><p align=left>Column: 1213</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

With improved floorings, better tables and chairs and stall designs, more airy environment, improved disposal system and better and more airy toilets, many found the upgraded hawker or food centres more comfortable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we need to do more to make it vibrant.&nbsp; I had been to the upgraded East Coast Park, Adam Road, Bedok Corner, Pasir Panjang hawker centres during the weekdays and weekends. My impression is that they <p align=left>Column: 1214</p>have not shed their old characteristics of a place for one to "come, eat and go".&nbsp; To make them more vibrant, we need more than just improving the gastronomic aspect. So when I saw the <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> report on 23rd January and the <I>Straits Times</I> on the same day that said, "Flea markets, buskers jazz up hawker centres; over 50 food centres now have added attractions.",&nbsp;I say we have done well in energising our hawker centres.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, how many of these 50 or so centres really have all the attractions mentioned by the newspapers?&nbsp; Why not also consider placing television sets so that diners can eat and update themselves on news and enjoy the entertainment such as football matches?&nbsp; Or provide stages for buskers or music performance at the site?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one of the reasons for the constraints faced by those managing the hawker centres is the location.&nbsp; It is either too cramped or too near residential areas that neighbours get unhappy over the noise generated apart from the fumes coming from the kitchens. Perhaps, we could build some of these hawker centres near to parks or water bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the past year, we have seen more recreational activities taking place near the water bodies such as reservoirs.&nbsp; I remember hearing about&nbsp;a plan to build hawker centres and recreational facilities&nbsp;near the water areas.&nbsp; Bedok Reservoir has been mentioned as one of the possible new locations.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether there is a plan to move towards this direction island wide?&nbsp; If indeed there is, when would such a plan be completed?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, I would like to thank Mr Yatiman for raising an issue which is close to our heart and our stomach, which is on the hawker centres. I am impressed by his ability to <p align=left>Column: 1215</p>read Mandarin apart from his knowledge of <I>Tongkat Ali</I>.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the&nbsp;Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme was launched in 2001.&nbsp; To date, a total of 48 centres have been upgraded. With increased ventilation, wider aisles, larger stall spaces, and aesthetically pleasing landscape, these upgraded centres have enjoyed improved patronage and business.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides being key amenities, hawker centres are places for social interaction and community bonding.&nbsp; Mr Yatiman asked what we can do to make hawker centres more vibrant.&nbsp;Sir, I mentioned in the COS last year that my Ministry would study the feasibility of introducing activities to increase the vibrancy of our hawker centres. I am pleased to announce that since August last year, a variety of activities such as busking, cultural performances and flea markets have been organised in more than 80 centres. Television sets have also been installed in some of our hawker centres.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have received positive responses from both stallholders and patrons on these activities. Stallholders have reported an increase in customer volume. 71% of the respondents in MEWR's recent survey indicated that they would visit hawker centres more often if there were such activities. In fact, we have been told that the singing and dance performances at hawker centres have become so popular that some customers are requesting for singing and dancing contests to be organised for them to take part.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Hawkers Associations have played a key role in organising these activities. In fact, Hawkers Associations have a better feel of the uniqueness, strengths and shortfalls of their respective <p align=left>Column: 1216</p>centres. They are thus best placed to work with the grassroots to determine the nature, extent and frequency of such activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me cite an example.&nbsp; The hawker centre at Blk 137 Tampines Street 11 is a good example. The Hawkers Association, together with the Merchants Association and grassroots have worked together to increase the centre's vibrancy.&nbsp; It is the first hawker centre to provide wireless broadband services.&nbsp; In addition, with five 29-inch television sets placed around the centre, diners will be entertained while they enjoy their food.&nbsp; To top it off, the centre has a customer service counter where customers can charge their mobile phones and borrow umbrellas when it rains.&nbsp; PR consultants have also been engaged to help stallholders improve the presentation of their stalls.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to encourage Hawkers Associations to work with the grassroots and NEA to organise&nbsp; activities at our hawker centres.&nbsp; NEA is also developing a set of guidelines to help the hawkers associations in introducing more activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the second part regarding our water bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, the PUB adopted a new approach to engage our 3P partners to value and enjoy our water resources. We opened up our reservoirs for more recreational activities and launched Our Waters programme that encouraged public adoption and ownership of our waterways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As more and more of our population live and work within water catchment areas, these efforts encourage the public to form a closer bond with water and appreciate the need to keep our catchments clean. Singaporeans can play a part by not littering or polluting the catchment so that our water sources remain clean and our water quality remains high.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1217</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yatiman has asked about the plans to enable the public and community to better enjoy our reservoirs and waterways.&nbsp; In 2006, we will continue the outreach efforts under an umbrella programme known as the Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme, or ABC Waters Programme. Our waterways and reservoirs should not be just for water collection, storage and drainage purposes.&nbsp; The ABC Waters Programme will transform the waterways and reservoirs into vibrant and aesthetically pleasing community spaces with activities for everyone to enjoy and participate in.&nbsp; I have circulated some pictures to Members of the House so that they have a better sense of what we are talking about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members in this House are aware of the concept plans that have been drawn up for Bedok and MacRitchie Reservoirs which were developed after much public consultation and feedback.&nbsp; In the next&nbsp;two to three years, PUB will be working with the relevant stakeholders and grassroots organisations to implement the plans.&nbsp; Sir, with the experience gained, PUB intends to work with other stakeholders and 3P partners to develop similar plans for our other reservoirs such as Pandan, Upper and Lower Seletar reservoirs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another initiative which will be implemented under the ABC Waters Programme is Watershed Management. The PUB will appoint private sector companies with the relevant experience and know-how to manage our water bodies.&nbsp; These Watershed Managers will contribute ideas to enhance and redevelop our waterways and reservoirs. This is not new. It has been done in some other countries.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More can also be done to improve the aesthetics along and surrounding the waterways to provide further opportunities for Singaporeans to enjoy the environment.&nbsp; Projects of similar nature <p align=left>Column: 1218</p>have been attempted overseas with great success, like the Cheong-gye Stream in Seoul and the Isar River in Munich, Germany. As a pilot project, the PUB, NParks and HDB will provide landscaping and recreational facilities along a short stretch of Kallang River in the second half of 2006.&nbsp; Learning from this pilot project, the PUB and NParks will then develop the remaining sections of Kallang River in the next stage, which could even incorporate water features.&nbsp; With these in place, residents could look forward to carrying out activities amidst the greenery by the river, such as leisure strolls, jogging, or simply socialising with neighbours and friends.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another potential area for redevelopment is upstream of Kallang River that runs adjacent to Bishan Park and the HDB housing estate.&nbsp; By maintaining a constant level of water in the canal and integrating landscaping and recreational facilities, the canal could be transformed into a focal point for residents to engage in recreational activities and enjoy the serenity of the waterway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Marina Basin,&nbsp; its strategic location in the heart of the city presents a wonderful opportunity to promote the Basin as a lifestyle attraction with lots of activities in and around the waters.&nbsp;We have heard the announcement about the Bridge.&nbsp; More can be done.&nbsp; With the closure of the Marina channel,&nbsp; expected to be in July this year, the Basin will become an enclosed water body ideal for recreational activities to take place. PUB is working with relevant agencies through the Downtown Ministerial Steering Committee and other inter-agency forums, as well as with stakeholders to manage the activities in the Marina Basin so that these can be conducted safely and smoothly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in building the Marina Barrage and beautifying the waterways leading into the future Marina Reservoir, PUB, as the <p align=left>Column: 1219</p>custodian of our water resources, has shown us a host of possibilities for bringing us closer to water and transforming the waterfront view in many of our neighbourhoods. In order to realise the full potential of our waterways, this undertaking cannot be PUB's alone. We need to harness the ideas and efforts of many parties in the private, public and people sectors, especially those living close to these waterways and who have a stake in bringing this vision to fruition. This will take time, and can only be possible if we continue to enjoy good economic growth.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, PUB is working towards a public exhibition early next year, and all Singaporeans will have the opportunity to share their ideas on how we can make our living environment, including the waterways as a more vibrant and enjoyable place. This will give new meaning to living in a garden city where beautiful waterways run through it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have outlined how the Ministry will spare no efforts in tackling the environmental challenges which face us in preserving and enhancing our natural resource endowments of water, land and air.&nbsp; We have put in place many programmes and plans, but we cannot achieve and sustain this without a strong partnership with the people and private sectors, ie, a 3P partnership approach.&nbsp; We also need individuals to do their part, so that as a nation, our collective efforts would make that quantum difference to our continual quest of being a clean, vibrant and beautiful global city.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Mr Chairman, just two points of clarification.&nbsp; I would like to&nbsp;thank&nbsp;the Minister and PUB for their support in working with the MPs and grassroots leaders of Aljunied&nbsp;GRCs in making our Bedok Reservoir a&nbsp;jewel in Aljunied GRC.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1220</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I just want to appeal to the Minister to allow certain areas in the Bedok Reservoir for&nbsp;children or even adults like me, who love water, to be able to walk into the water or to dangle our feet in the water.&nbsp;Currently, the edge itself is very rough with rocks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is on the hawker centres.&nbsp; Our hawker centres have matured, like what our Member of Parliament has said.

That the total sum to be allocated for Head O of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many positive changes have taken place in the healthcare sector over the last one year, for which I must credit the Health Minister.&nbsp; We now have a more robust MediShield scheme where more of the bigger hospital bills are covered, providing immense relief to many Singaporeans suffering from ageing illnesses.&nbsp; Another development is the higher daily Medisave withdrawal limit which will benefit 50,000 Singaporeans.&nbsp; These changes have made our healthcare system much more robust and sound.&nbsp; However, we all know that healthcare is not a static subject, but is constantly evolving with new issues emerging all the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1228</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to raise three issues.&nbsp; Firstly, Sir, healthcare costs continue to be a concern to Singaporeans.&nbsp; In a 2004 Feedback Unit survey involving 1,064 Singaporeans, 67% were worried that they would not be able to pay for their future healthcare cost, while 60% were worried they would not be able to pay for their dependant's future healthcare cost.&nbsp; These concerns are not without basis.&nbsp; Healthcare costs have been rising as reflected by our medical inflation rate which, at 5.9% in 2004, was the highest in a decade and definitely higher than the general inflation rate of 1.7% in 2004.&nbsp; Households are also spending more on healthcare, with the lowest 20% of the income groups spending the most, about 7% of the household income compared to the highest 20% of the income group, which spends about 4.7% of the household income on healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although healthcare is not something that we consume all the time, it is a subject that occupies our mind all the time.&nbsp; Even those who are now healthy worry in case they fall ill one day and are unable to provide for themselves or their families.&nbsp; While I agree that we can contain our own healthcare cost by keeping healthy and&nbsp;cost increase is also due to advancement in diagnostics and medical technologies, I also believe that the Government can do more to control the increase in healthcare costs and to boost the productivity and efficiency of our healthcare providers.&nbsp; Otherwise, I do not see how we can maintain a tight lid on our national health expenditure and Government subsidies without the population suffering a fall in medical care.&nbsp; I believe, Sir, that we can better leverage on economies of scale, a more efficient use of manpower such as the advanced practice nurses and greater control over the use of new medical technologies,&nbsp;just to name a few areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what measures would be taken to control <p align=left>Column: 1229</p>medical inflation and ensure that healthcare costs remain affordable to all Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir,&nbsp;we need to pay greater attention to the long-term healthcare needs of our elderly Singaporeans.&nbsp; Those above 65 years have on average only about $5,300 in their Medisave, barely sufficient to&nbsp;pay for&nbsp;their MediShield and ElderShield premiums as well as the smaller hospital bills of specialist outpatient treatment.&nbsp; As our population is ageing rapidly, I would like to ask the Minister whether our 3M system is sufficient to take care of the long term healthcare needs of our elderly.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the Ministry undertakes a comprehensive study of the long-term healthcare needs of our elderly and assess whether our 3M system can sustain their needs financially.&nbsp; I am not talking here, Sir, about the ability of our 3M system to pay for the needs of the elderly today,</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>but rather to assess how demographics, cost increases, advancements in diagnostics and medical technologies and many other factors would impact on the 3M system and its ability to provide for the future healthcare cost of the elderly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another matter, Sir, related to the elderly, I note that the Committee on Ageing Issues had concluded its work, and made many recommendations pertaining to our ageing population.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister when the Ministry will be giving its response to the recommendations of the Committee on Ageing Issues, particularly on those matters related to health.&nbsp; My concern is that sometimes we have a lot of committees making recommendations but the follow-up may not be sustained.&nbsp; On the elderly alone, Sir, there have been many reports and committees, and what we need now is to ensure that there is effective follow-up on these reports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1230</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is on the need to continuously improve medical standards.&nbsp; Singaporeans are concerned not only with cost but also whether they are provided with a good standard of medical care in Singapore.&nbsp; The quality and standard of healthcare that we receive is important to ensure that we recover quickly, do not stay in the hospital longer than needed or develop serious complications, all of which will add to our cost and agony.&nbsp; Yet, unlike the purchase of other goods and services where the customer can easily make a distinction in the quality of service or goods, it is not so simple for the average patient to do so. While the publication of hospital fees is a laudable move and has ensured that hospitals do not overcharge for the same type of procedure or treatment, much more needs to be done to inject transparency into our healthcare system.&nbsp; For example, if someone wants to have a cataract operation -&nbsp;the price being equal -&nbsp;how is he to decide whether to have it done at SGH or NUH?&nbsp; Yet, this is an important point.&nbsp; An ignorant or ill-informed patient may breed complacency in our healthcare system as he is not in a position to demand high standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March last year, Sir, Prof. Robert Brook of the US think tank, RAND Health, recommended that health institutions here start providing information about the quality of its services as well, so that people can choose a healthcare service based on price and quality.&nbsp; According to him, if the Singapore healthcare system wants to have meaningful competition and be world-class, then it must provide more than just pricing information to patients.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what initiatives are in place to enhance medical standards and to publish quality indicators of our medical services in Singapore.&nbsp; With quality indicators, patients will be better able to make informed choices on where to seek treatment, and this will also provide transparent benchmarks on the <p align=left>Column: 1231</p>comparative efficiency of our healthcare providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note, Sir, that the Joint Commission in the National and American Accreditation Agency already accredits some of our public hospitals.&nbsp; Patients treated at accredited hospitals can expect more consistency in hospital processes and treatments.&nbsp; The question is: why have&nbsp;all the hospitals not achieved accreditation from this Agency, and are private hospitals covered?&nbsp; Also, in what way can the Ministry educate the public so that they can better understand the significance of quality indicators and, in this way, help them to seek better quality treatment and therefore further boost standards?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Medisave</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me come to my next point, Sir, and this is on Medisave.&nbsp; Currently, the use of Medisave is allowed only in limited areas.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to allow greater flexibility in the use of Medisave.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans' need&nbsp;for their long-term hospitalisation needs is well understood and cannot be denied. But it is difficult to explain to Singaporeans, who need cash to pay for their immediate medical needs, why they cannot make use of their Medisave savings but instead have to borrow or seek assistance from the CDCs or other places to pay for their medical bills.&nbsp; Those desperately in need of help cannot be expected to worry about future needs. But if they neglect taking medicine regularly or fail to seek regular treatment and fall seriously ill resulting in hospitalisation, that would put a serious strain on the resources of our hospitals.&nbsp; I would like to request for greater flexibility in the use of Medisave, particularly in the following areas -&nbsp;I am sure the Ministry can look into other areas as well&nbsp;-&nbsp;long-term chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and hypertension, purchase of medical <p align=left>Column: 1232</p>consumables, purchase of medical equipment, eg, ventilators, payment for medical tests, such as MRI for those already diagnosed with a serious illness, cost of home rehabilitation and step-down care.&nbsp; To prevent over-consumption and ensure prudence, the Ministry can consider imposing an annual withdrawal limit from the Medisave for these purposes or even limits based on each procedure or treatment.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry of Health and the CPF Board to allow married couples to use their Medisave to pay for IVF and any Assisted Conception Procedure (ACP).&nbsp; Couples who need ACP would like to ask for the following:<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) to allow Medisave withdrawals for up to five treatment cycles instead of the current three;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) to subsidise the cost of drugs required for assisted reproduction;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) increase the age limit for women for acceptance into ACP from the current 45 to 50 years but only if they are deemed medically fit;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) increase the number of treatment cycles for women who enter the ACP programme at above 40 years of age, from a maximum of five treatment cycles to 10 cycles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of taking a pragmatic approach, Sir, both the Ministry of Health and the CPF Board should take a more compassionate view in helping childless couples.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:&nbsp;</B> Sorry, Mr Chiam, your time is up.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>MediShield</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):&nbsp;</B> Sir, rising healthcare costs remain a concern <p align=left>Column: 1233</p>of most Singaporeans.&nbsp; At the same time, many Singaporeans feel aggrieved by the large number of foreign residents in Singapore competing for jobs.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether he has thought about expanding the coverage of the basic MediShield scheme to cover foreign employees as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the course of privatisation of MediShield Plus, whilst making basic MediShield compulsory for all insurance plans covering Singaporeans last year, the Minister for Health accepted the principle that the younger you are, the less healthcare you consume, as&nbsp;the basics of healthcare insurance.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to consider requiring all foreign talent&nbsp; -&nbsp;employment pass holders and workers&nbsp;-&nbsp;to be covered by basic MediShield insurance.&nbsp; This would expand the risk pool of basic MediShield.&nbsp; I hope that with the added injection of funds from the expansion and with the relative lower risk of the new pool in which most are in their prime of their working life, MediShield can provide better coverage for all Singaporeans.

At any one time, there will be some 8% of the elderly that require step-down care of varying levels of intensity. Currently, there are multiple service providers with minimal coordination.&nbsp; There is a need for better coordination and effective implementation of the various healthcare services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Sharing of best practices, preventing over-servicing, maximising limited resources, avoiding duplication, better integration and cutting down wasteful practices by public hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Expediting plan for Singapore to become the regional medical hub, such as integration of our healthcare clusters and sectors for better economies of scale and maximising our limited resources to compete globally and not competing internally, structured aggressive marketing on our high quality and efficiency, innovative packaging with other products, such as insurance, travel arrangements, hotel and shopping needs, to make it more attractive for consumers to come here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Better management of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, to prevent&nbsp;morbidity and mortality from such diseases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; Heart disease is the number one killer of women in Singapore.&nbsp; Women are less likely to survive heart attacks than men.&nbsp; Many women do not seek treatment as early as men, as the symptoms of heart disease are manifested differently in women.

<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I would like to urge a thorough review of our <p align=left>Column: 1238</p>ElderShield Scheme which I think can be better utilised and specifically in the following areas:&nbsp; Firstly, relax its eligibility criteria.&nbsp; The rigid definition of "disability" which requires a person not to be able to do three out of the six daily routines can result in a ridiculous situation, where even someone who is wheelchair-bound is not considered as disabled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I do not see why when a person is certified as disabled by a specialist in a public hospital, he still has to be assessed by a GP appointed by the insurance company.&nbsp; This restriction should be removed as it unnecessarily adds to the patient's cost.&nbsp; If an assessor is used, the fee should also be absorbed by the insurance company, and not the person claiming which causes hardship, as this insurance is different from motorcar or fire accident insurance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the waiting time of three months is too long and should be shortened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the restriction to five years of payment causes hardship and should be removed.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B> Sir, I thank Members for their comments and especially their suggestions on how we can improve our healthcare system.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1239</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be the first to acknowledge that our system is not perfect.&nbsp; But I think it is not bad.&nbsp;The World Health Organisation (WHO) ranked Singapore number 6 out of 191 countries on overall healthcare system performance.&nbsp; Only two Asian countries made it to the top 10 list: Singapore and Japan.&nbsp; So, obviously, we must be doing something&nbsp;quite right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans acknowledge our high medical standard but many hope that it could&nbsp;be cheaper, or even free, at least for the poor.&nbsp; I will do my best to meet their aspiration, but such heavy subsidy has to be highly targeted for the poor and not something freely available to all in a uniform way.&nbsp; Despite good intentions, cheap healthcare for the masses ends up&nbsp;being of low standard, hurting the poor and needy the most, because unlike the rich, they have no alternative.&nbsp; They cannot turn to the higher standard in the&nbsp;private&nbsp;sector.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways that a government can render healthcare free or cheap.&nbsp; One, the government pays the bills out of&nbsp;the taxes it collects from the people.&nbsp; Or the insurers pay for them out of the insurance premiums they collect from the people.&nbsp; But either way, it is the people who pay for healthcare.&nbsp; So the so-called free healthcare is actually not free.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because healthcare in such systems can sometimes appear to be free, it causes two major problems which we are familiar: the buffet lunch syndrome of over-consumption by patients; and the motorcar repair-shop syndrome of over-servicing by providers. As a result, the US spends 16% of their huge Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on healthcare,&nbsp;UK spends half of that - 8% of GDP&nbsp;- but both&nbsp;have very little difference to show in their health status.&nbsp; Instead, there were large-scale disappointments on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp; Nearly 50 million low-income <p align=left>Column: 1240</p>Americans go without medical insurance.&nbsp; In the UK, long waiting times for surgeries are very common complaints.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our health is not poorer than the Americans or the British.&nbsp; In fact, in some areas, we fare better.&nbsp; We live longer on average&nbsp;than the Americans or the British.&nbsp; Our infant mortality rate&nbsp;is much lower than in the US&nbsp;or&nbsp;UK. And we have achieved this commendable outcome at a lower cost, at only 4% of our GDP.&nbsp; This does not happen by chance.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have over the years evolved our own model of providing and funding healthcare.&nbsp;We have no ideological bias.&nbsp; On funding, we are neither in love with the British taxation-funded model, nor the American insurance-funded model.&nbsp; On delivery, we neither favour public hospitals run by civil servants, nor prefer private-for-profit models run by people like Dr Loo Choon Yong.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have forged a middle way, going for a mixed system of public and private sectors.&nbsp; In that way, we tap and incorporate the strengths of each sector and allow both to co-exist and flourish.&nbsp; Such a mixed system offers the best outcome for our people, giving them choices as public and private compete for patients, in that way&nbsp;keeping the medical standard high.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, when I read the <I>New York Times,</I> there was a&nbsp;commentary - a good one -&nbsp;on the Canadian healthcare system.&nbsp; It reported that their publicly-funded health system was "gradually breaking down", with public hospitals sending growing numbers of patients, whom they can no longer cope, to private hospitals which are cropping up despite laws against their existence.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, it is illegal to have private hospitals because no&nbsp;hospitals are allowed to charge patients for treatment they would otherwise receive free of charge in <p align=left>Column: 1241</p>a public hospital.&nbsp; But in response to public demand, private hospitals are openly defying the law.&nbsp; This is how one private hospital medical director lamented about their healthcare system: "This is a country in which dogs can get a hip replacement in under a week and&nbsp;in which humans can wait two to three years."</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadians dread the excesses of the private model that they see in their American neighbour.&nbsp; That is why they embrace the public model.&nbsp; But now, they appear to have come to the conclusion that both systems were wrong and a mixed system is more viable.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Singaporeans worry about healthcare cost.&nbsp; This is a common worry all over the world.&nbsp; I am afraid healthcare cost will continue to rise.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because new technology and new drugs will continue to come out of the research laboratories, at great cost, even as they bring about some improvements in healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is actually quite easy to run a cheap low-cost&nbsp;public healthcare system.&nbsp; There are many such examples in our neighbourhood, just compare our public hospitals with the standard of the public hospitals there.&nbsp; We can keep our hospitals cheap or low cost&nbsp;by denying our patients of medical advancements, thus pushing patients to private hospitals.&nbsp; But who can afford to go there?&nbsp; Only the middle and upper-income group.&nbsp; The poor are stuck with the public hospitals.&nbsp;I would never accept such an approach for Singaporeans, for the simple reason that the poor cannot afford the private hospitals.&nbsp; My job is to ensure that the poor and the very sick get a good standard of healthcare.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore agree with Mdm Halimah that we should not allow medical cost to escalate beyond our ability to pay.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah noted that medical inflation was 5.9% in 2004, higher than general <p align=left>Column: 1242</p>inflation rate of 1.7%.&nbsp;When it was published, I noted this figure too.&nbsp;I was personally a bit upset because this is during my watch in year 2004 and, after having made it one of my top priorities on managing medical inflation,&nbsp;I probed and&nbsp;discovered a number of things.&nbsp;Medical inflation is computed based on a basket of medical services that you get.&nbsp;It includes doctor's consultation, hospital charges, dentistry, payment to TCM, Chinese <I>sin seh, tui nai</I>, drugs, both generic as well as vitamins or supplements, perhaps even <I>tongkat ali</I>, and things like that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I probed for the year&nbsp;2004 about this sudden blip of 5.9%,&nbsp;I found the culprit&nbsp;- TCM&nbsp;consultation fees, Chinese physicians.&nbsp; It doubled&nbsp;from an average of $4 in the year 2003 to $8, average, in 2004.&nbsp; So even though TCM is a small part of our total healthcare system and the weightage is low, but because the increase is 100%, it has skewed the total calculation of medical inflation.&nbsp; If you remove TCM from the calculation, our medical&nbsp;inflation would have been 1.3%,&nbsp;lower than the general inflation of 1.7%.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah would be pleased to note that last year, 2005,&nbsp;medical inflation was 0.4%, again lower than the general inflation of 0.5%.&nbsp; I do not think&nbsp;your Health Minister has been sleeping.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some medical inflation is to be expected as medical and nursing staff, like other workers, receive some wage increases too.&nbsp;I think they&nbsp;deserve it as well.&nbsp;Last year, general wages in Singapore rose by 3.5%.&nbsp; This must, in due course, flow down&nbsp;to impact on medical inflation.&nbsp; In any case, inflation control cannot be decreed by law or achieved through moral suasion.&nbsp; It never&nbsp;works.&nbsp; The most effective way is through the market.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we should ensure that wage increases in healthcare sector keep in step <p align=left>Column: 1243</p>with general wage increases.&nbsp; Again, this cannot be decreed.&nbsp; This requires us instead to match medical manpower with demand.&nbsp; If demand rises while we restrict the supply of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and therapists, their wages are bound&nbsp;to go up sharply.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we watch over the supply and demand of doctors.&nbsp; At present, we are slightly short in some specialities although the situation is tolerable.&nbsp; But I see significant shortages going forward, if we succeed in our drive to promote Singapore as a regional medical hub.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted Dr Lily Neo's comment that we should&nbsp;move faster on SingaporeMedicine.&nbsp; I will,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I believe in that. In fact, our efforts in the last&nbsp;three years have shown very promising results.&nbsp; Foreign patients coming here for treatment in Singapore increased by an&nbsp;average&nbsp;of 20% per annum in the last three years.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;Dr Loo Choon Yong can testify to this.&nbsp; We will press on with this.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that this will increase staffing pressure on our public hospitals. But we can try to achieve both objectives, raising Singapore as a medical hub and at the same time trying to ensure that medical inflation is acceptable.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; We are ramping up the recruitment and training of medical specialists.&nbsp; The Singapore Medical Council (SMC) will be expanding the schedule of recognised medical degrees.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>Currently, we recognise 71 medical degrees, largely from the British Commonwealth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.15 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have shared my view before that all the top medical schools&nbsp;ought to be on our schedule, not just from the US and UK, but also from Europe and Japan.&nbsp; We should also include the top medical schools from India, where some of their <p align=left>Column: 1244</p>graduates have gone on to head clinical departments in the US, particularly because we have an FTA with India, where one of the commitments is to open up our medical register.&nbsp; We are not opening up yet, because there is still disagreement with India.&nbsp; India wants every medical school in India to be recognised.&nbsp; I cannot accept that, because we all know there is a wide range of standards and we cannot just open the door to every Indian medical graduate.&nbsp; But there are two, three or four very good medical schools.&nbsp; Entry is so competitive that&nbsp;one must be absolutely bright to be able to enter, and their graduates are proving themselves in the US and Europe.&nbsp; I think there is no reason why we should&nbsp;exclude these top medical schools and their graduates from coming here to help us make Singapore a regional medical hub.&nbsp; The SMC is actively reviewing the subject, and will progressively expand the list.&nbsp; I expect to make the first announcement soon.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But medical manpower is not just about doctors.&nbsp; It is also about nurses, pharmacists, radiographers, other health sciences professionals, even patient care assistants.&nbsp; We should make sure that&nbsp;supply keeps up with demand.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I agree with Dr Lily Neo and Mdm Halimah that we should push our hospitals and clinics to be more efficient.&nbsp; There is really&nbsp;no ground for inefficiencies, wastages or duplications.&nbsp; We will continue to encourage innovations and skunk works and share best practices.&nbsp; Last year, in this House, I mentioned a major skunk works in Alexandra Hospital where it partnered with Microsoft to exploit the benefits of IT.&nbsp; Within a year, they successfully computerised the operations of the A&amp;E Department.&nbsp; The software is intuitive and also very flexible, allowing&nbsp;doctors and nurses to easily make continuous process improvements.&nbsp; I want to record here&nbsp;my thanks to Microsoft for their help.&nbsp; I understand that <p align=left>Column: 1245</p>Microsoft has decided to extend their skunk works to Changi General Hospital and even enlarge the scope of their work to include the community hospitals and nursing homes that partner Changi General Hospital in providing integrated care.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospitals are expensive resources.&nbsp; To keep cost affordable, hospitals need to use their beds efficiently.&nbsp; For example, once a patient is discharged, they have to quickly get the&nbsp;bed cleaned up so that a new patient can get in. But the entire&nbsp;process is complex, involving many groups of staff.&nbsp; But&nbsp;through standardising&nbsp;policies, streamlining processes and using WiFi technology provided by Cisco Systems and Fujitsu, Alexandra Hospital has reduced the processing times by 30%.&nbsp; This means less waiting for the patients in the admission room.&nbsp; Today, half of the patients admitted to Alexandra Hospital are settled into their beds within 30 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandra Hospital and Cisco Systems are now exploring how WiFi and VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technologies can be used to reduce the time it takes for doctors and nurses to respond to medical emergencies.&nbsp; This can make a real difference in life-and-death situations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the market works best when consumers are well-informed.&nbsp; That is why, as soon as I went&nbsp;back to the Ministry of Health three years ago, I got them&nbsp;to compile and publish hospital bill sizes.&nbsp; I am very pleased with the outcome.&nbsp; I am now ready to push this initiative further, in two ways.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, I will extend the exercise to private hospitals.&nbsp; They have so far joined the initiative&nbsp;voluntarily, but the submitted data is often incomplete and sometimes misleading.&nbsp; I am considering getting their fullest participation, to disclose their hospital bills on a fully comparable basis when they submit Medisave claims on <p align=left>Column: 1246</p>behalf of their patients. &nbsp;This will be welcome by their patients, I am sure.&nbsp; Such transparency will also help convince their foreign patients that Singapore offers very competitive pricing for healthcare services.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, in response to the call by Mdm Halimah, I will expand the initiative to include qualitative outcome data, eg,&nbsp;surgery complication rates, surgery success rates, etc.&nbsp; Like the bill size exercise, I will begin with public hospitals first&nbsp;to gain sufficient experience, before extending it to private hospitals.&nbsp; Last year, I started a study&nbsp;on cataract operations,&nbsp;one of the most common surgeries done in public hospitals,&nbsp;so I wanted them to measure and track down what were the complication rates of cataracts in the various centres in Singapore.&nbsp; We are concluding a study on this,&nbsp;and the data will be released quite soon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked about quality accreditation.&nbsp; All hospitals&nbsp;must comply with the standards that we set under&nbsp;the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act.&nbsp; JCI accreditation is an added external endorsement that our local hospitals are comparable to international standards.&nbsp; All our public general hospitals are already&nbsp;accredited.&nbsp; The&nbsp;private hospitals are at various stages of this quality journey.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the market work better is the best way to help manage healthcare cost.&nbsp; When customers vote with their feet, healthcare providers will sit up and work to fight the competition.&nbsp; That was how Lasik surgery fees dropped from $2,300, on average, in 2003 to below $1,400 now, saving patients almost a thousand dollars per surgery.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must continue to remind Singaporeans to: (a) save up for their healthcare needs; and (b) insure themselves against catastrophic illnesses.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1247</p>Mdm Halimah asked if our healthcare model can cope with the ageing of our population.&nbsp; In particular, what about&nbsp;the healthcare needs of our future elderly?&nbsp; Will&nbsp;3Ms be enough?&nbsp; This is&nbsp;really a very dynamic situation with many unknowns.&nbsp; What are the&nbsp;new technologies that are coming in?&nbsp; At what cost?&nbsp; What are the&nbsp;changing population attitudes towards sickness, health, etc?&nbsp; And, of course, how much can we afford, which is economic growth?&nbsp; That is why I agree with Mdm Halimah that we need to periodically review and update our 3M system.&nbsp; And we do.&nbsp; Last year, we updated MediShield.&nbsp; This year, my focus is on Medisave.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our healthcare system is unique in the world because of Medisave.&nbsp; Medisave has now entered its 21st year.&nbsp; Every year, the average Medisave balance of Singaporeans just gets bigger.&nbsp; Among working Singaporeans, four out of 10, ie, 40% or nearly half a million Singaporeans,&nbsp;have Medisave balances exceeding $25,000.&nbsp; This happy outcome applies to low-wage workers too.&nbsp; Those nearing retirement have an average of $12,545, enough for many, many&nbsp;hospitalisations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their earlier manifestos (1994/1998), the Workers' Party wanted to abolish Medisave.&nbsp; "Phase out the Medisave Scheme as soon as possible", they said.&nbsp; Luckily, they did not succeed.&nbsp; As a result, we&nbsp;now have collectively $35 billion in our Medisave accounts, for many, many rainy days ahead.&nbsp; I am glad that the Workers' Party has since achieved some enlightenment.&nbsp; Their latest manifesto&nbsp;no longer wants to phase out Medisave.&nbsp; But they have replaced the medicine with another.&nbsp; They are now proposing that Medisave be used for "a comprehensive Public Health Insurance scheme".&nbsp;</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1248</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do allow Medisave for medical insurance.&nbsp; I believe in Medisave insurance, because pooling of risks is a very important part of healthcare financing.&nbsp; But Medisave must not unwittingly support comprehensive medical insurance which will only lead to disappointment and very high healthcare costs.&nbsp; This is not a theoretical argument.&nbsp; The argument has already been settled empirically.&nbsp; We only need to see the&nbsp;experiences of those countries with such comprehensive medical insurance schemes. &nbsp;Let us not repeat the mistakes of others.&nbsp; They are now trying to get out of that hole.&nbsp; Let us not walk into that hole.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I read the manifesto, I was reminded of a very interesting cartoon published by <I>Zaobao</I> a few days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;President Chen Sui-bian suspended the Reunification Council, so there was this cartoon that shows President Chen leading the way and there was this big manhole, with&nbsp;Taiwan&nbsp;about to walk into the manhole.&nbsp; If we go the Workers' Party's way, I see this cartoon, maybe of Mr Low Thia Khiang waving&nbsp;Singaporeans into this hole.&nbsp; And you will find this hole is crowded.&nbsp; There are many people there trying to get out.&nbsp; So, I think, let us beware.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Kiang suggested that we allow&nbsp;MediShield to include foreign workers.&nbsp; I do not think we exclude foreign workers, because&nbsp;MediShield is open to all Singaporeans and PRs.&nbsp; So, if they are PRs, they are included if they want to.&nbsp; But MediShield is not compulsory.&nbsp; So, you will have to make an effort if you want to join in, although it is opting out.&nbsp; But, as far as I know, many foreign workers may have been covered by their employers, so they may not see the need.&nbsp; But it is really up to them.&nbsp; The point about the foreign workers is that if they are non-Singaporeans,&nbsp;basic MediShield is based <p align=left>Column: 1249</p>on Class B2, which is heavily subsidised and, therefore, we keep the subsidy for Singaporeans and, in fact, at the moment, also PRs.&nbsp; But non-citizens are not included.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, just last month, there was a specific case.&nbsp; One of my residents, the maid fell down while cleaning&nbsp;windows.&nbsp; So major surgery in Tan Tock Seng.&nbsp; The bill came to $15,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;They forgot to buy insurance for the maid.&nbsp; So they came to my MPS and say, "Please help."&nbsp; But I cannot help because she&nbsp;is a foreigner.&nbsp; How can I use taxpayers' money to subsidise foreigners?&nbsp; I hope there is a lesson there, ie, employers, please make sure you buy insurance both for yourself and your loved ones, including any&nbsp;foreign domestic workers with you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am enhancing Medisave.&nbsp; From&nbsp;lst April 2006, the daily withdrawal limit will be raised from $300 to $400.&nbsp; This will particularly benefit the middle-income group and save them hundreds of dollars per admission.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first step.&nbsp; My next step is to allow Medisave to help cover costly outpatient treatments.&nbsp; But this is not straightforward.&nbsp; That is why I am taking some time to think it through carefully.&nbsp; If we are not careful, Medisave accounts will be prematurely depleted, becoming insufficient for hospitalisation.&nbsp; That would be tragic.&nbsp; However, meanwhile, I have noted Mdm Halimah's various suggestions on this subject and will take them into account.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this exercise, I will give priority to chronic diseases, a subject which I will&nbsp;discuss&nbsp;later, in the second segment of the debate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now respond to Mr Chiam's comment on the use of Medisave for IVF and various assisted reproductive technologies.&nbsp; It does.&nbsp; Medisave covers them and, in fact, as part of the Baby Bonus scheme last year,&nbsp;we&nbsp;raised the <p align=left>Column: 1250</p>quantum.&nbsp; Relying on memory here, I think you can claim up to $6,000 for IVF, which will therefore cover items like drugs, etc.&nbsp; But we made a distinct decision to limit it to three treatment cycles, and the reason is&nbsp;properly and rationally grounded.&nbsp; You can check&nbsp;the data on the success rate.&nbsp; Each time the couples repeat, it is greater and greater disappointment and, after the third cycle, the chance of a success is very, very low, and you are really throwing away a lot of money.&nbsp; Yes, maybe we are a little bit paternalistic here by saying that Medisave ought to be for other uses and therefore we limit it to three cycles.&nbsp; But it is for a very good reason.&nbsp; If we just open it up - imagine $6,000 per treatment - and&nbsp;we have, say,&nbsp;run it to five cycles, that is a lot of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave, even though it is significant for some middle-income group, there is&nbsp;an upper bound to it.&nbsp; So it is not as if it is&nbsp;a lot of money&nbsp;and you can just waste it to pursue IVF and the various techniques.&nbsp; So I hope Mr Chiam can accept that explanation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On ElderShield, I thank Mdm Halimah for her various suggestions.&nbsp; I will take note of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are bound by the contract governing ElderShield which does not allow changes for five years.&nbsp; The five-year period will run out in September next year.&nbsp; But I will begin the review process this year.&nbsp; I will certainly bear in mind</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>the various suggestions made by Mdm Halimah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew asked about means testing.&nbsp; He has always been a strong supporter of means testing and I appreciate his support.&nbsp; I believe in it and I have always felt that our 3M model would be stronger if we make it&nbsp;4M and the fourth "M" is actually means testing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But two years ago, when I started exploring this subject, I remember at that <p align=left>Column: 1251</p>time the GPC Chairman was Dr Lily Neo, and she gave me very good advice&nbsp;and a word of caution, because there are a lot of complications, as outlined by Dr Chong. She felt that I should only start working on it after we have fixed a few other things, especially MediShield reform which, at that time, I was exploring with her, and now, Medisave.&nbsp; So that is why when <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> interviewed me, I said that it&nbsp;is something that we would&nbsp;do&nbsp;next year or the year after. We cannot rush this sort of thing even though it is a good policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan Cheng Bock and&nbsp;also&nbsp;Mr Low&nbsp;spoke about the cost of drugs.&nbsp; Dr Tan quoted an example of a patient being referred to a polyclinic from NUH, thinking that it would save him money, only to find that his drug bill there cost him more.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked at the example which he handed to the Ministry of Health.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the&nbsp;nine medications in the bill, indeed, as Dr Tan noted, some were cheaper at the polyclinic but some were more expensive.&nbsp;The costlier drugs tend to be cheaper in polyclinics, in other words, the more expensive patented drugs are cheaper.&nbsp; The reason is this. First of all, the polyclinics and hospitals are different&nbsp;entities, so identical items may not attract identical prices.&nbsp; It is just like X-rays.&nbsp; There is a whole range of X-rays, but they do not coordinate -&nbsp;maybe they should -&nbsp;until every item is the same.&nbsp; But, on an overall basis, we should ensure that the total treatment cost in a polyclinic is less than that in an acute hospital for the same treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, I agree with Dr Tan that there will be no incentive for patients to move out of expensive acute hospitals.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low talked about our bulk purchase of drugs and whether we would do so not just for generic drugs but also for non-generic drugs, ie, patented drugs.&nbsp; Bulk purchase covers both, in other <p align=left>Column: 1252</p>words, so long as there&nbsp;are economies of scale&nbsp;to be&nbsp;exploited, we will go for a major tender and coordinate them.&nbsp; It is not done by the Ministry of Health because there are two clusters and they coordinate.&nbsp; There is a central procurement unit which calls tenders on behalf of both clusters.&nbsp; And, as I have said, it applies to both generic&nbsp;as well as non-generic drugs.&nbsp; In fact, the savings are a lot more in the case of non-generic drugs because generic drugs, by nature,&nbsp;are low&nbsp;cost. So whether you call bulk tenders or you call smaller tenders, the price will be low anyway.&nbsp; But even then, the benefits ought to be exploited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low also asked&nbsp;who decides on what is subsidised&nbsp;and not subsidised. Really, the question is who decides on what&nbsp;are standard drugs&nbsp;and what&nbsp;are non-standard drugs.&nbsp; I think we have explained this previously in this House. There is a panel of experts because these are clinical issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will review,&nbsp;when new drugs come in, and decide whether&nbsp;to substitute this normal drug with another drug.&nbsp; So it is a purely clinical decision.&nbsp; Of course, they take into account efficacy as well as cost to the patients.&nbsp; But it does not mean anything that is expensive is non-standard; and everything that is cheap is standard. That is not the criterion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low mentioned a unit in UK.&nbsp; Yes, there are several such efforts in various countries, because drugs are now so expensive, and for&nbsp;every new drug, before&nbsp;it comes into the market, they will evaluate the cost benefit of it.&nbsp; Should we start such similar units?&nbsp; I do not believe in doing so because our scale is small.&nbsp; Let us leverage.&nbsp;I have always advised our people&nbsp;to leverage, because why reinvent&nbsp;the wheel.&nbsp; The UK and&nbsp;US&nbsp;publish all their analysis and we just go and take a look.&nbsp; We may&nbsp;want to do some local analysis because Singapore's situation might be different.&nbsp; But that is always a good starting point, instead of trying to <p align=left>Column: 1253</p>replicate what others are doing and unwittingly push up healthcare cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Dr Lily Neo has made a number of comments on step-down care, homecare and heart diseases affecting women.&nbsp; We will respond to those points later today.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether he has updated himself with the latest copy of the Workers' Party's manifesto because, in this manifesto, we are proposing a compulsory basic hospitalisation insurance.&nbsp;He&nbsp;says it is a&nbsp;comprehensive insurance scheme.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to ask him whether he purposely distorted the Workers' Party's manifesto for political purpose to hoodwink the voters. Sir, what he has said was not what we published in the 1994 manifesto. We&nbsp;highlighted the inadequacy of Medisave, but&nbsp;we did not say that we want to abolish it.&nbsp; We believe more on risk-pooling of insurance schemes rather than the method of direct payment through Medisave, because you never know how much you need to save.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the basis on which the Workers' Party felt that insurance would be a better solution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like the Minister to clarify&nbsp;why there is a need for him, when he became Minister for Health, to look at the MediShield insurance scheme and to revamp it. That is exactly&nbsp;the same concept which the Workers' Party's manifesto has enshrined in 1994.&nbsp; It is not true when&nbsp;the Minister accused me like what the papers described as Chen Sui-bian as "pulling the people into&nbsp;a hole".&nbsp; I would say that, Sir, without the revamp of an insurance scheme, it will probably be the Ministry of Health&nbsp;that&nbsp;will have a bigger hole for the people to&nbsp;fall inside, and the hole is something which the Minister created for political purpose to pull me in.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><p align=left>Column: 1254</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Mr Chairman, I do not like to read the Workers' Party's manifesto but, unfortunately, it is my duty, as Health Minister, to also see it because I read all suggestions on healthcare, and I take a personal interest. So I read them.&nbsp; He asked whether I have updated myself. Yes, I have.&nbsp; In fact, I went to great length.&nbsp; I read their latest manifesto and also the previous one. So when I quote, I am a careful person, as you would know by now.&nbsp;When the Member used&nbsp;the words and&nbsp;claimed that I lied -&nbsp;although&nbsp;he did not want to use those words -&nbsp;it was in his Party's&nbsp;own manifesto when&nbsp;he talked about abolition of Medisave and a comprehensive public health insurance.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our business, maybe he is&nbsp;not familiar,&nbsp;"comprehensive" has a very special meaning in health insurance. "Comprehensive" means comprehensive -&nbsp;everything, first dollar coverage. That is the meaning of comprehensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot say, as he tried to explain just now, that "comprehensive" means that there is still co-payment.&nbsp; Once you have co-payment, it is no longer comprehensive.&nbsp; So I read it in that light.&nbsp; I take it at face value.&nbsp; That was in their earlier document when they talked about abolishing Medisave and&nbsp;going&nbsp;into&nbsp;comprehensive medical insurance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I must object to his use of words that I am trying to hoodwink Singaporeans. Singaporeans would have seen me by now.&nbsp; I have been in public service for many years.&nbsp; I did not enter politics to score political points.&nbsp; I entered politics because I thought that is one way to do some good for Singaporeans, and that is the way I carry my task seriously.&nbsp; I am not one who hoodwinks people.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Healthcare Infrastructure</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, it is essential that our medical services have the technology and the technical know-how <p align=left>Column: 1255</p>to properly diagnose diseases and illnesses as quickly and accurately as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, doctors wanting to know whether a patient's heart is functioning well may resort to angiography, a procedure in which a thin tube is snaked up the heart arteries through a blood vessel in&nbsp;the groin.

But you have to look at it on a total basis, ie, is your total bill in a polyclinic cheaper than your total bill in a hospital?&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, that is what counts to the patient,&nbsp;how much&nbsp;he has to pay. If&nbsp;he goes to SGH, how much will he have to pay, and if&nbsp;he goes to Toa Payoh polyclinic, how much will it cost?&nbsp; &nbsp;At the principle level, I agree with Dr Tan that we should not distort the pricing so that it becomes silly for patients, who want to downgrade, to have difficulties.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I am on the floor, let me just take one minute to explain this.&nbsp; Actually, I know the reason for the discrepancy.&nbsp; Years ago, I helped to formulate the pricing policy for polyclinics.&nbsp; Those of you, like Dr Chong, who had read the <I>Lianhe Zaobao's</I> interview of me, would know that I believe in the Robin Hood's principle in healthcare, because healthcare is so expensive that the only way to ensure healthcare is affordable is you must play Robin Hood.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; One, the rich subsidises the poor</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

And, therefore, when I looked at the pricing of drugs at that time in the polyclinics, I suggested to them - which is still the policy today -&nbsp; "Charge patients $1.40 for drugs".&nbsp; The last time it was lesser, maybe $1; now it is $1.40 per week of medication.&nbsp; In other words, regardless of the medication, cheap or expensive,&nbsp;you pay $1.40.&nbsp; In that way, patients who have minor ailments and, therefore, drugs are simpler,&nbsp;they may be actually paying&nbsp;above&nbsp;cost to the polyclinic, but&nbsp;it is still&nbsp;$1.40.&nbsp; Let us say, if&nbsp;one is unlucky and very sick, the drug may cost&nbsp;$20 per week of prescription, but you still pay $1.40.&nbsp; So, in that way,&nbsp;patients who have cheaper drugs subsidise those who&nbsp;have more expensive drugs.&nbsp; Until today, I will defend that policy.&nbsp; I think that is the correct policy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, a few years ago, I do not know when, somehow the hospitals decided to go more precise.&nbsp; So they removed this policy and they just said, "Well, let's look at the drug, if it is 20 cents charge 20 cents, 50 cents charge 50 cents and $2 charge $2, and whatever".&nbsp;So you can argue which is the more correct system.&nbsp; I believe in the Robin Hood's principle.&nbsp; I feel that the $1.40 per week, regardless of medication, is a better way for the patients.&nbsp; Maybe I should persuade the hospitals to move back to the polyclinic system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

To realise this, many governments have shifted consumption of public healthcare from the hospital to the primary <p align=left>Column: 1259</p>healthcare setting through&nbsp;apportioning of more financial resources to primary healthcare providers as well as health promotion and prevention efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I am not asking for the overall MOH operating budget to be increased, but rather to consider shifting more of the operating budget from hospital services to primary healthcare where we can achieve a bigger bang for the buck, especially if you are found to be relatively under-funding primary healthcare when compared to other developed countries due to insufficient apportionment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Sir, Mr Andy Gan asked&nbsp;whether the supply of&nbsp;our healthcare services is adequate.&nbsp; Frankly speaking, supply of healthcare&nbsp;services will never be fully adequate.&nbsp; This is because in healthcare, supply does create its own demand, particularly if that demand is heavily subsidised.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among health economists, there is a well-known observation called "Roemer's Law", which states that "a built (hospital) bed is a filled bed".&nbsp; It is, therefore, wise to keep public hospitals slightly under-supplied and run it at high occupancy rates.&nbsp; That is why, last year,&nbsp;I resisted tackling the overcrowding in&nbsp;Tan Tock Seng Hospital&nbsp;by simply allowing them to expand.&nbsp; By forcing the hospital to understand its sources of overcrowding, we then discovered outdated policies, like free treatment for foreign workers infected with chickenpox and cumbersome discharge procedures which kept patients unnecessarily in hospital.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we cannot sit on the cap forever.&nbsp; Periodically, we need to expand our facilities to meet real rising demand. That is why we are building a general hospital in Yishun. Mr Steve Chia asked for some details.&nbsp; The site has been finalised.&nbsp; It is a good site, near to Yishun MRT and bus interchange. Planning of the hospital has started.&nbsp; In fact, a design competition is ongoing, and I understand that Prof. Ho Peng Kee will soon organise&nbsp;an exhibition of the design proposals that we have received for this hospital, so that we can get some public consultations and opinions on them.&nbsp; We expect to ground-break before the next Chinese New Year <p align=left>Column: 1263</p>and, eventually, open the hospital in phases from the year 2009.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan Sze Wee asked me about&nbsp;the building of the Pathology Department at SGH.&nbsp; The project was&nbsp;a little bit a victim&nbsp;of the Asian financial crisis in 1997.&nbsp; Actually, the project was approved and funds were allocated.&nbsp; But after the Asian financial crisis, there was a review of all the capital expenditure projects&nbsp;in the public sector, and this was one of the projects that was decided to be delayed.&nbsp; In any case, those years are over, and we will get the project going again.&nbsp; We are going to rebuild it on a new site within the SGH campus.&nbsp; Planning has begun and we hope to open the new facility around 2010.&nbsp; In fact, if&nbsp;Members check the Budget book, they will see an entry on this particular project.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides buildings, we will continue to invest in new equipment.&nbsp; Mr Andy Gan has noted a rise in high-tech diagnostic machines.&nbsp; It has been so for many years and, in fact, it&nbsp;is a factor which contributes to rising healthcare cost.&nbsp; But we will pace it appropriately, balancing between inevitable cost increases and enhanced healthcare standards.&nbsp; As a principle, I prefer the public hospitals to be slightly behind the curve, but not too much behind. For example, the&nbsp;current interest in&nbsp;high-tech scanning equipment&nbsp;- &nbsp;the 64-slice CT scanner, which costs a few million dollars.&nbsp; The first unit was brought into Singapore in 2004 by the private sector.&nbsp; But soon after that, others&nbsp;also bought such scanners, including public hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By being slightly behind the curve, we allow ourselves some time to evaluate each new machine and establish its cost-effectiveness. Ultimately, it is not investment in technology for its own sake, but, really, investment in patient outcomes that matters.&nbsp; Given the high <p align=left>Column: 1264</p>cost of such equipment investment, I agree that wherever it is possible to share it with the private sector, public hospitals should do so.&nbsp; But sharing has to be done at the right price, and certainly not at the expense of public patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Andy Gan also asked about the adequacy of&nbsp; nurses to serve our patients.&nbsp; For nurses, we will continue to both train locals and recruit foreigners from abroad, and there has been a progressive increase in the nursing population in Singapore.&nbsp; Just last week, NUS announced the launch of Singapore's first local nursing degree course in NUS, for year of admission 2006.&nbsp; This is a milestone event for our nurses.&nbsp; The programme is designed to meet international standards, and the first batch of nurses will graduate in 2009.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Tan Sze Wee is worried that our&nbsp;cluster polyclinics may game on their block budget, and&nbsp; refer subsidised patients from polyclinics to hospital A&amp;E Departments of the other cluster, so as to save on cost.&nbsp; Let us look at the data.&nbsp; First of all, very few percentage of polyclinic patients&nbsp;get referred to hospital A&amp;E Departments&nbsp;-&nbsp;less than 2% each year.&nbsp; The vast majority of such referrals were within each cluster.&nbsp; So this so-called cross-cluster referral is&nbsp;tiny.&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as I can see, there is no evidence for such gaming going on.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;pleased to say that&nbsp;our doctors are&nbsp;largely ethical, and we should be&nbsp;proud of them.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now spend some time on chronic diseases, which Dr Lily Neo raised earlier and was also mentioned by Mdm Halimah and the other Members as well.&nbsp; This is a very big topic, because it&nbsp;affects a large number of patients,&nbsp;and most of them tend to be&nbsp;elderly, and it consumes a large amount of resources.&nbsp; No country has managed it well.&nbsp; There is much scope for transformation and improvement.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my personal goal to see how we can cause the transformation of the care <p align=left>Column: 1265</p>of chronic diseases,&nbsp;so that patients with chronic diseases can enjoy better care at lower cost and with less hassle.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve this goal, family physicians play a critical role.&nbsp; Recently, I visited one in Toa Payoh and I am impressed with her practice.&nbsp; She has a base of regular clientele&nbsp;- many elderly with chronic diseases.&nbsp; She knows them well, including their family members, and that is really what a good family physician ought to be.&nbsp; When one of her patients suffered a fracture and could not walk, she arranged for a physiotherapist to provide home therapy twice a week, instead of simply referring the patient to the hospital.&nbsp; The patient had so much pain that walking was not possible.&nbsp; After a month of home therapy, the patient was able to walk.&nbsp; In this way, unnecessary hospitalisation and operations were avoided, and the money saved from inpatient charges was used to engage the therapist.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When another patient was diagnosed with terminal cancer, she personally arranged a shared-care programme with the hospital oncologist&nbsp;- cancer specialist.&nbsp; This way, she was able to continue the patient's intravenous antibiotics at home.&nbsp; That was also the patient's strong preference, to spend his last few months in the company of his loved ones, rather than wasting precious time waiting in the queue in hospital clinics.&nbsp; The patient eventually passed away peacefully at home, avoiding unnecessary hospitalisation which would not have made any difference.&nbsp; His family got to spend quality time with him at home.&nbsp; When death came, this family physician was there to sign the death certificate.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what good family physicians can do to bring about better care at lower cost and less hassle for their patients, instead of simply referring them to hospital specialists.&nbsp; There are many such good family physicians in Singapore.&nbsp; But we should grow their numbers and profile them to the public, so that such care <p align=left>Column: 1266</p>would become standard best practices here.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked our hospitals and&nbsp;polyclinics to help facilitate this transformation.&nbsp; The hospitals have an interest to see this succeed.&nbsp; Many of their patients in the specialist clinics can be competently treated by family physicians, at lower cost.&nbsp; They are keen to partner with willing family physicians through shared-care programmes at the community level.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us take diabetes as an example of how this can be done.&nbsp; We already know quite a lot about diabetes.&nbsp; It is a common chronic disease, and affects one in&nbsp;11 Singaporeans.&nbsp; So it is a large number. Diabetes occurs when the body loses its ability to control the blood sugar level.&nbsp; When poorly controlled, doctors can almost predict what will happen to the patient at different stages over the next 20-30 years.&nbsp; Compared to others, diabetic patients have a higher chance of getting heart attacks, stroke, blindness, loss of limbs and kidney failure.&nbsp; In early stages, there are no symptoms, and many patients are unaware.&nbsp; Left untreated, the condition will just deteriorate over the years.&nbsp; Many suffer greatly from multiple organ failures towards the end.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many diabetic patients start treatment late, ending up going to multiple specialists for treatment of their many problems as and when each problem surfaces.&nbsp; It is not unusual for a diabetic patient to consult a cardiologist for his heart problem,&nbsp;an orthopaedic surgeon for his leg problem, an eye specialist for his eye problem, and a neurologist for his loss of sensation.&nbsp; The suffering, the time spent at each hospital clinic and the cost of treatment can be unbearable.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, that need not be and should not be the case, if their diabetic condition is detected early and managed well.&nbsp; The simple trick is to help the patients control their blood sugar, look out for early signs of complications and treat the <p align=left>Column: 1267</p>complications before they become a big problem.&nbsp; Many of the complications of diabetes can be avoided totally or, at least, delayed for many years.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, many diabetic patients are middle-aged and are better educated than their parents.&nbsp; They have the ability and&nbsp;motivation to help themselves.&nbsp; We should really re-orientate our healthcare to work with the patients and enable them to lead a long and healthy life.&nbsp; We actually have&nbsp;many success stories right here in Singapore, at helping diabetic patients live a long and healthy life.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, SGH and Alexandra Hospital, and likewise other hospitals as well as&nbsp;Kandang Kerbau and NUH, have diabetes centres to run structured disease management programmes for the patients.&nbsp; Their staff work with the community and employers to screen the population.&nbsp; Those with mild diabetes are referred to their family physicians for follow-up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those with more severe diabetes, the&nbsp;specialists&nbsp;assess the patients thoroughly at the beginning of the programme, draw up individualised treatment plans.&nbsp; Non-specialists and other team members then take over and work with the patients to control their blood sugar and to screen for complications, at appropriate intervals, under the supervision of specialists.&nbsp; Once the conditions have stabilised, they are referred back to their family physicians for routine follow-up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key is to make patients and their family members the main carers of their diabetic condition.&nbsp; Patients are taught individually and in groups, to enable them to help themselves.&nbsp; They adopt healthier eating habits with the help of dieticians.&nbsp; They exercise more and they reduce their weight.&nbsp; Many are even able to adjust their insulin dosage with help from nurses.<br></p><p align=left>Column: 1268</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcome has been very satisfying.&nbsp; Patients' blood sugar level is better controlled.&nbsp; Complications are detected earlier and treatment to prevent deterioration initiated earlier.&nbsp; Their experience suggests that one of the most feared complications of diabetes, namely, progressive kidney failure, can be stabilised with good management.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should expand such success stories widely, to benefit many more patients and also others with other chronic diseases,&nbsp;such as high blood pressure and&nbsp;asthma.&nbsp; Both hospital&nbsp;clusters are spearheading a few structured disease management programmes for their chronic patients and they already&nbsp;have good results to show.&nbsp; For example, patients under the NHG cluster's asthma programme are less likely to end up with emergency asthma attacks.&nbsp; The programme must have saved many lives and avoided unnecessary deaths due to asthma.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another disease management programme is for heart failure patients&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; patients who have survived a heart attack.&nbsp; Results are also very&nbsp;encouraging.</p><p><br>3.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very cheered by these innovations and their success stories.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

To succeed at the national level, many things will have to happen.&nbsp; Time does not permit me to elaborate, but they include successful implementation of concepts like right-siting of care&nbsp;- a topic that Dr Tan Cheng Bock mentioned just now.&nbsp; In other words, you should be treated at the right place, not in the wrong place, higher cost, more hassle and <p align=left>Column: 1269</p>unnecessary "one Singaporean, one family physician": every Singaporean,&nbsp;if you do not have a good family physician, start looking for one and make sure find one that is good, and build up that long-term relationship.&nbsp; One Singaporean, one electronic medical record&nbsp;- this can be done if we fully exploit IT.&nbsp; And we need IT so that&nbsp;electronic medical records can be&nbsp;shared with all the partners in healthcare so that we can then collectively, as a partner, look after these patients as the centrepiece.&nbsp; It also requires effective partnership between GPs and specialists, opportunistic health screening, cooperation and compliance by patients, and many more such concepts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tall order, and that is why no country has so far done it well.&nbsp; I am counting on our being small and compact and better organised.&nbsp; I think it can be done.&nbsp; I have been in healthcare for many years now and for the rest of my term as Health Minister, I want to focus on this subject.&nbsp;If we can make a significant&nbsp;difference to the way we handle the management of chronically ill, I think we can then make a major contribution to the health of Singaporeans.&nbsp; It is unglamorous, it will not attract headlines, media attention, but it will make the most crucial difference to our health status.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are building a Health Centre at Jurong West to be one focal point to deliver this transformed service for the residents there.&nbsp; If it succeeds, I will replicate it elsewhere.&nbsp; It will be a one-stop health hub, providing a range of services from, say, outpatient specialist, diagnostic and day surgery services to chronic disease management for common chronic illnesses.&nbsp; It will also be a place for health screening and health promotion.&nbsp; If we can tear down barriers between public and private, GPs and specialists, hospitals and step-down care homes, and leverage on technology, I see an opportunity for a transformation of the way we traditionally manage chronic diseases.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1270</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do it right, year by year, we will&nbsp;see improvements, not only in service standard, but also in the health status of the patients.&nbsp; Let us start with a couple of the most common chronic diseases, say, diabetes, perhaps hypertension, where there are established clinical guidelines on how such diseases should&nbsp;be managed over time, and let us get more GPs, specialists and patients to join the programme and embrace the new approach.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I said that we are studying how Medisave can be liberalised to pay for costly outpatient care.&nbsp; I therefore see an opportunity to leverage on this initiative to help nudge the profession and patients towards this direction.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Sze Wee asked for data on Government spending on primary healthcare.&nbsp; More than 60% of the Government's subsidies goes towards hospital care, 7% is spent on primary healthcare.&nbsp;This is much lower compared to the various countries he mentioned&nbsp;- Canada, UK and New Zealand - where they spend up to 30% of their health budget on primary care.&nbsp; But I must caution here that the figures are not comparable because, in their case, the primary healthcare is 100% public, whereas in our case, 80% of primary healthcare is in the private sector by GPs.&nbsp; So the spending is not captured.&nbsp; Our 6% is only on public healthcare.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me respond to Mr Low Thia Khiang's point about NKF and IPC.&nbsp; I remember I had a full discussion with Mr Steve Chia -&nbsp;unfortunately he has left -&nbsp;not too long ago, maybe last month.&nbsp; Perhaps, Mr Low was not in the Chamber, and it fully addressed&nbsp;what are the NCSS' concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;I clarified them&nbsp;and these concerns were&nbsp;properly addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Time does not permit me to go into it.&nbsp; Perhaps, I think Mr Low may want to just read up&nbsp;the <I>Hansard</I> so that we do not waste <p align=left>Column: 1271</p>everybody's time here.&nbsp; He did ask a point about who is the final authority on charities.&nbsp; There is a Commissioner of Charities who currently is also the Commissioner of Income Tax.&nbsp; But if you read the consultation paper, which is now in circulation,&nbsp;and MCYS will make a formal response to it in a few days' time, their intent now is to separate the two roles so that there will be a new Commissioner of Charities and he will be supported by the various deputies, because there are so many charities in Singapore, a few thousands of them - some in sports,&nbsp;arts and healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose, in the case of healthcare IPC, there will be a person identified and he will be the Deputy to the Commissioner of Charities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let us&nbsp;not get the impression as if NCSS was aware that there was hanky-panky going on in all those things that are now discovered by KPMG. There was none of that kind.&nbsp; The concerns raised were totally different and, frankly speaking, minor in nature, and they were addressed.&nbsp; MOH studied it, analysed it and since there were no reasons to reject the IPC, of course, they approved the IPC.&nbsp;It is easy on hindsight to say, "Hey, why didn't you do this?&nbsp; Why didn't&nbsp;you do that?"&nbsp; But, as I&nbsp;explained at that sitting&nbsp;to Mr Steve Chia,&nbsp;when a CEO, helped by a group of people, in this case, the Board of Directors or at least&nbsp;some of them,&nbsp;went all out to mislead the public, they <p align=left>Column: 1272</p>will be discovered but it does take some time.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also made a critical point which was that while KPMG&nbsp;came up with this thick report&nbsp;but&nbsp;only about a year ago, when KPMG was actually commissioned by the Ministry of Health to look into NKF, they discovered some minor things which were all fixed, but they did not&nbsp;uncover the problem that we now read in the report. So let us put this thing in perspective. On hindsight, it is easy to say, "Why didn't we do this? Why didn't we do that?" In many ways, as I told Mr Steve Chia at that time, the former CEO misled all of us, including Mr Steve Chia,&nbsp;myself and Mr Low Thia Khiang, because&nbsp;he was&nbsp;also in this Chamber for several years&nbsp;and, if&nbsp;he had known about all this,&nbsp;he could have raised it too.&nbsp; But I am quite sure&nbsp;he was&nbsp;not aware, we were not aware, all of us were misled.&nbsp; But never mind, now the problem has been uncovered, let us progressively fix them, and we are fixing them.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Dr Chong Weng Chiew, you have two cuts. Six minutes.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Mobile Healthcare Services</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I am definitely happy and glad to hear the Minister's description of the Ministry's interest and views on the chronic sick's illnesses.&nbsp; My two cuts actually&nbsp;involve the following up of the chronic sick's illnesses as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me declare my interest as I am involved in a couple of VWOs that&nbsp;provide non-institutional clinical services to needy senior citizens -&nbsp;one runs a mobile clinic and the other&nbsp;provides domiciliary homecare services for the elderly. Today, I will be emphasising about mobile clinics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our population ages, more and more senior citizens will face mobility <p align=left>Column: 1273</p>problems.&nbsp; Although the Government has started working on making our neighbourhood estates barrier-free, this process will take a few years.&nbsp; Meanwhile, a growing number of elderly, especially the chronic sick, face challenges going to nearby polyclinics, or even their GPs, for their follow-up treatments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mobile clinic concept offers an easier option for the elderly with chronic illnesses.&nbsp; They encourage them to get their illnesses examined and monitored.&nbsp; In fact, the work of the mobile clinics complements the services of our established polyclinics as well as general practitioners.&nbsp; If there is a way these two services can work together, they should, in the sharing of patient information, updating of patient conditions, treatments, and so forth. I am glad that the Minister's earlier description on IT has addressed these concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, these mobile clinics operate independently and their services are not subsidised by the Government.&nbsp; They are only able to subsidise patients with funds from donors.&nbsp; As a result, they can only cater to a small number of elderly.&nbsp; If the Government would consider subsidising their services or, more importantly, share patient information with respect to patient confidentiality for the elderly poor, such monetary as well as&nbsp;logistic support will help many VWOs to expand its capacity to service more poor chronic sick elderly in more estates.&nbsp; It would also go a long way to help ensure that the service will continue to be provided to needy, senior citizens at&nbsp;very affordable rates. I hope the Minister would consider this suggestion favourably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Home Therapy</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I will move on to&nbsp;my next cut on home therapy.&nbsp; Likewise,&nbsp;the Minister has mentioned examples on home therapy earlier on and I am sure the Minister is fully supportive of the fact that home <p align=left>Column: 1274</p>therapy does provide lots of benefits for patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My cut on home therapy would actually be particularly angled for the chronically sick, poor and those living alone. As much as we are able to, we should also do our best to help the elderly sick alleviate their sufferings, particularly in the area of therapy.&nbsp; As I have mentioned earlier in my speech on mobile healthcare services, many senior citizens have difficulties travelling even to nearby polyclinics or community rehabilitation centres for subsidised follow-up treatments.&nbsp; The case&nbsp;as mentioned by the Minister earlier on, to a great extent,&nbsp;is a good example of such&nbsp;a case where the patient would have problem travelling to specific centres for treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I would like to request the Ministry to consider extending Government subsidies to home therapy sessions for the elderly poor.&nbsp; Many of these live alone, with an elderly spouse or as "latch key" grandparents.&nbsp; Mobility is a big problem for them and many cannot afford to pay for unsubsidised home therapy sessions or domestic help and taxi fares to bring them&nbsp;for follow-up appointments.&nbsp; More often than not, they miss their follow-up therapy sessions and their conditions will start deteriorating from there.&nbsp; Then what happens, ironically, is that they will reach such a bad stage that they have to be admitted into an acute hospital where their medical fees would then be subsidised.&nbsp; But does this not lead to higher treatment costs, more given subsidies and greater suffering, all quite unnecessary since it is preventable in the first place?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand that such one-to-one home therapy sessions&nbsp;come at higher costs because they do not enjoy economies of scale, unlike sessions conducted at community rehabilitation facilities.&nbsp; However, I hope that the Ministry would be able to approve a system whereby selected cases, genuine <p align=left>Column: 1275</p>cases, with severe problems gaining access to community services, can be given the benefit of subsidies for using home therapy sessions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Financial Assistance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ang Mong Seng</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; Sir, in recent years, the Government has reformed its healthcare policies to the benefit of many Singaporeans, particularly patients in the middle and lower-income groups.&nbsp; However, very often, when the senior citizens went for treatment in the hospitals, they were not aware of the many financial assistance schemes&nbsp;provided&nbsp;by the Government to help them pay for their hospital bills. Some of them came to see me at my meet-the-people sessions and asked me to write to the hospitals to ask for assistance in the payment of their medical expenses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As a matter of fact, many&nbsp;are eligible for the assistance schemes&nbsp;provided by the Government. At the time when they sought treatment at the hospital, they could have applied and be granted the assistance on the spot, without having to wait until the hefty hospital bill comes before rushing to their Member of Parliament for help. Perhaps, it was because&nbsp;they are not well-educated, hence are ignorant of&nbsp;how to apply for such assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope that the Ministry would set up an effective system&nbsp;whereby a team of&nbsp;designated officers or department would offer the required assistance to these senior citizens on the spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also&nbsp;a way to reward the elderly&nbsp;for their past contribution to our nation building.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Mr Chairman, Sir, in 1984, the Howe Yoon Chong <p align=left>Column: 1276</p>Report on Ageing was debated in the House, and I remember the report suggested that there should be an education called Gerontological Education, ie, studies on ageing.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that&nbsp;Singaporeans must be better prepared for the impending ageing population.&nbsp; Now, 20 years have passed and I do not see that this particular education has been supported.&nbsp; I think it is time that we&nbsp;studied this particular subject again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the Howe Yoon Chong Report is actually a very good report.&nbsp; The only problem was that it got hijacked by the issue of the withdrawal of CPF monies at age 55, which spoiled the whole report.&nbsp; But there are many, many good aspects in this report.&nbsp; Let me just quote what he said:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ageing is not only a physical process but also a state of mind.&nbsp; Today, large sections of society still deem the elderly to be a group of persons who should be classified with the sick and the disabled who are no longer fit for employment or capable of being retrained or re-educated to fit into the new jobs."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a very important statement.&nbsp; And this is what he suggested, ie, that this particular education should be established to encourage the academic staff, scholars and students of the NUS to do research, studies and investigations into the field of gerontology, to include gerontology in the curriculum of sociology or social science students, and to incorporate geriatric medicine as part of the medical curriculum, and also to encourage research, investigations, studies and regular surveys to monitor the social, economic and other changes that affect the aged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This report, therefore, called for a new look at ageing by calling for&nbsp;the studying of ageing through properly structured courses to better understand this subject.&nbsp; As I said, we have not done much.&nbsp; We must not be captured by our old style of <p align=left>Column: 1277</p>managing the old.&nbsp; The new old, as I said before, are better educated and travelled, and are very knowledgeable.&nbsp; So we must quickly explore new ways and methods to meet the expectations of the new old.&nbsp; The setting up of the Gerontological Unit should not be delayed further.&nbsp; It could be in the universities or polytechnics.&nbsp; I think it is up to the Government to decide.&nbsp; It would provide courses for the care-givers and also policymakers so that they can better understand the subject.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two aspects of&nbsp;gerontological education.&nbsp; The one that Members are most familiar with is geriatrics.&nbsp; But it is the other aspect, the social aspect, which has&nbsp;not been well studied.&nbsp; And many of us assume we know a lot.&nbsp; But we will be surprised that we really do not know&nbsp;that much.&nbsp; Therefore, I am asking the Government to have a good look at this subject and incorporate it perhaps as a subject or course&nbsp;in the university and, also, maybe in the polytechnic.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Tan Sze Wee:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, together with Dr Tan before me, I would also like to ask the Minister for Health regarding the&nbsp;promotion of gerontological education in Singapore.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Government has addressed the ageing population issue for more than&nbsp;20 years.&nbsp; During this time, it has focused properly on the healthcare needs of older persons. &nbsp;The health issues of older persons are addressed by medical gerontology or geriatrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-medical issues are addressed by social gerontology. &nbsp;By this, we mean the study of the reciprocal relationship between the older person and health, family, community and society, as well as policymakers in Government whose decisions affect him or her.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Society needs to ensure the following:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; There will be sufficient healthcare for our ageing population; and</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1278</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be policies, practices and understanding to meet the social and economic challenges posed by that population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can only be ensured through gerontological education. &nbsp;It is concerned not only with the provision of healthcare for older persons but also with their development, so that they can continue to contribute to society or to find fulfillment and meaning in later life. &nbsp;It includes the promotion of knowledge and understanding about ageing and older persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, may I ask the Minister, in view of the rapidly ageing population, what are the Ministry's plans for the promotion of gerontological education in Singapore?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I&nbsp;thank Dr Chong Weng Chiew, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Tan Cheng Bock and Dr Tan Sze Wee for their questions and comments.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they have pointed out, we are an ageing population. &nbsp;There are about 300,000 senior citizens in Singapore.&nbsp; They form 9% of our citizens. &nbsp;Singaporeans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before.&nbsp; These improvements in life expectancy and freedom from disease for most of an average person's life are an achievement that our healthcare system can be proud of.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this has created new challenges.&nbsp; A good proportion of the elderly will develop a chronic illness in the last phase of their lives. &nbsp;85% of the elderly will have one or more chronic illnesses that require lifelong treatment.&nbsp; Some will develop disabilities that require daily assistance.&nbsp; At any one time, 5%-10% of the elderly population will need help with <p align=left>Column: 1279</p>their personal care and the activities of daily living.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical focus of healthcare systems, which is to manage episodes of acute illness with intensive treatment, is not well-suited to manage the medical problems of the elderly.&nbsp; The elderly usually need continuous low intensity medical or nursing care to manage their chronic illness and to enable them to live good quality lives even if they have an age-related disability.&nbsp; If this can be provided in an efficient manner away from hospitals and nursing homes, they can enjoy a higher quality of life.&nbsp; So we must focus our health services to bring care as close to the home setting as possible. &nbsp;This needs a mindset change on the part of everyone, ie,&nbsp;healthcare providers, patients and their families.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Ageing Issues, in its report, has recommended that the Government adopt a holistic family practitioner approach towards managing the healthcare needs of senior citizens.&nbsp; Over the next decade, our healthcare system will evolve in this direction.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew has quite clearly pointed out the benefits of providing home therapy and mobile healthcare&nbsp;to the elderly, and he has asked for&nbsp;subsidies for mobile healthcare and home therapy.&nbsp; We should consider this.&nbsp; Subsidies that&nbsp;channel the elderly to the hospital should be re-channelled to keep the elderly chronic sick at home, especially if this is a more efficient way of looking after the elderly sick.&nbsp; We have channelled subsidies before from inpatient to outpatient, eg, HIV treatment and chemotherapy for cancer.&nbsp; So we need to look at this again and, if we can provide more efficient care closer to the home, we should do so.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo also suggested subsidised home therapy for the needy elderly.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1280</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has tried out such schemes and launched the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS) in 2000, to help bring affordable healthcare&nbsp;to the doorstep of the needy elderly.&nbsp; Instead of having needy elderly patients travel to polyclinics, the scheme engages neighbourhood GPs to provide common outpatient treatment&nbsp;conveniently&nbsp;at polyclinic prices.&nbsp; But it was only for acute medical conditions.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a start.&nbsp; We will study our experience with the PCPS scheme and expand the programme gradually to manage chronic illness in the elderly.&nbsp; This will be&nbsp;in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Ageing Issues.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring therapy and care closer to home, MOH, together with MCYS, intends to partner the private and people sectors to develop a range of community-based nursing services and personal care services.&nbsp; In addition, we will enhance case management services in the community through tighter integration between the acute and step-down care facilities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng related cases where patients come to see him at the MPS to ask for financial help with their medical bills.&nbsp; I, too, have seen such patients in my MPS, and I asked them if they had&nbsp;seen the Medical Social Worker (MSW).&nbsp; Very often, they have not.&nbsp; And this is because the bill often comes after they are discharged, or they look at it only after they are discharged.&nbsp; One reason this happens is that our hospitals look after patients, regardless of whether the patient can afford&nbsp;to pay the bill, because they know that there are Medisave, Medifund and other assistance schemes to help the patient.&nbsp; So they treat the patient first, get the patient well, send the patient home, and then only after he is well, the patient looks at the bill.&nbsp; Very often, when they see the bill, instead of seeing the MSW, they come down to see us at our MPS <p align=left>Column: 1281</p>and we write the letters to the hospital, and then the MSW sees them.&nbsp; But, in fact, they can approach the MSW directly in the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All our public sector hospitals, national centres and polyclinics have medical social workers.&nbsp; An estimated total of 140 MSWs help look after the social and financial needs of patients.&nbsp; They help administer Medifund, the Government's safety net to help those Singaporeans who, despite Government subsidies, MediShield and Medisave coverage, are still unable to pay the balance of their bills.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Medifund, the MSWs work with the people sector and help administer a whole wide range of non-Government assistance.&nbsp; Our MSWs are highly-committed and passionate individuals who do their best to assist needy patients. &nbsp;Since they administer all the systems, they are really one-stop centres.&nbsp; The application process is kept simple to keep the administration cost down.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock and Dr Tan Sze Wee also spoke on&nbsp;the promotion of gerontological education in Singapore.&nbsp; Recently,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Singapore Action Group of Elders (SAGE) also came up with an open letter proposing the promotion of gerontological education.&nbsp; Dr Tan Cheng Bock referred to the Howe Yoon Chong Report which talked about gerontological education and the elderly.&nbsp; Twenty years ago, the problem of looking after the elderly was the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; Today, the iceberg is upon us.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp;I would go one step further.&nbsp; With an ageing population, it may not be appropriate to consider gerontology as a specialised area for a select group of healthcare and welfare workers with a specialised institution to train a few people.&nbsp; Today, the elderly population are <p align=left>Column: 1282</p>the major consumers of medical and welfare services.&nbsp; In some developed countries, more than 50% of government healthcare expenditure is directed towards the elderly.&nbsp; With care for the elderly becoming such a major part of medical and welfare services, gerontology, or the holistic study of the elderly, has to be part of the core curriculum and education of a doctor, nurse, social worker or anyone else in the medical and social services field of study.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I was quite happy to note that there were&nbsp;three university professors who were in the&nbsp;SAGE initiative to promote gerontology.&nbsp; But they were writing in their private capacity, which is a shame.&nbsp; I encourage these professors to don their university caps and, in their professional capacity as professors in the university responsible for the education of our future doctors and social workers,&nbsp;promote gerontology as part of the mainstream university core curriculum in their respective faculties.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH, for its part, will be doing more to promote gerontological education.&nbsp; Most geriatricians currently work in acute care hospitals.&nbsp; But if the elderly are to be looked after in the community, then geriatric skills must reside in the doctors looking after patients in the community.&nbsp; That means family practitioners must practise community geriatrics.&nbsp; MOH will facilitate Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses that will equip GPs with the knowledge skills needed to function as community geriatricians.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ageing issues are complex and must be tackled through an integrated and holistic approach involving Government, community agencies and the private sector.&nbsp; Much progress has been made in the last several years, though more remains to be done.&nbsp; Going forth, the collective will and efforts of all sectors, ie,&nbsp;the public, private and people sectors, will <p align=left>Column: 1283</p>contribute towards achieving "Successful Ageing for Singapore".</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

While the prevalence of smoking is down to 12.6% as of middle of last year, down from 13.8% in 2001 for some groups, it is on an uptrend, particularly for youths between the ages 16&nbsp;and 24 and for females between the ages of 18&nbsp;and 24.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in Thailand, cigarettes are cheaply and freely available, even though it has&nbsp;a bit less stringent preventive legislation like <p align=left>Column: 1286</p>Singapore in place.&nbsp; Yet, while overall youth smoking trends are rising, the group that most resembles the Singapore youth, and that is the average urban school-going middle-class youth, is not clamouring more for cigarettes.&nbsp; In fact, studies showed that youths in Thailand associate smoking with those who drop out of the mainstream education or move into the labour market early.&nbsp; So this mindset has developed despite cigarettes being so readily available.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, perhaps, our public awareness campaign or&nbsp;anti-smoking communications directed at youths may take the tack that smoking is not cool or&nbsp;something along that line.&nbsp; For the image concerned youths today, this alternative tack may bear fruit rather than just making cigarettes a forbidden fruit. This approach may leave a more lasting impression on the youth and young female smokers for which there is an uptrend. This group will, in time, stretch our health dollar that will already be stretched by our greying population and the healthcare needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Minister tell us what is in store to combat the uptrend of youth smokers?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>National Blood Programme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</B>:&nbsp; Sir, with regard to my cut on national blood programme, I am very concerned with the recurring shortage in our blood bank, particularly during our year-end festive seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December 2005 and January 2006, our supply dropped to such low levels at one point that we have only enough to last 24 hours. With only 1.5% of our population donating blood, we have one of the lowest rates amongst developed nations. An adequate supply of blood is crucial.&nbsp; Imagine what could have happened if we had a crisis during that period?&nbsp; Incidents, such as 911 in the US, <p align=left>Column: 1287</p>showed how vulnerable any country can be despite security measures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How we boost our blood bank is no longer just an health issue.&nbsp; It is also a national security issue.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry if we could re-examine our blood donation programme and identify areas for improvement.&nbsp; As we try to increase supply, we should also try to reduce demand.&nbsp; One way is to get suitable patients to use autologous blood. Patients going for elective surgeries, in particular, could be encouraged to do so. Elective surgeries account for one-third of total blood usage but only around 4.5% of such procedures use autologous blood.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, we can look at the experience of other countries.&nbsp; An article in the <I>Philadelphia Inquiry</I> on 27th January this year described the success of blood donation drive in the US. Teenagers over the age of 16 are now the fastest growing group of blood donors, contributing up to 16% of the blood supply in some places.&nbsp; I quote: "Blood banks, including the Red Cross, have aggressively marketed to teens through web pages, MTV commercials.&nbsp; Research by the Ad Council shows teens are more willing to engage in community service than many adults."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teens under the age of 18 have to get permission from their parents and many end up persuading their parents to donate&nbsp;too. Their contribution comes at a time when demand is growing due to the aging American population.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that we focus on getting blood only from our teenagers but, rather, this development in the US could be instructive. There may be elements that we could adopt. We certainly do not want to make the parents of our teenagers nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to cultural differences, our attitude towards blood donation needs <p align=left>Column: 1288</p>time to change but, sadly, we cannot afford to wait too long.&nbsp; We too have an aging population.&nbsp; The onus for blood donation remains on the adult population.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</B> Sir, I thank Mdm Halimah, Mr Andy Gan, Dr Chong Weng Chiew and Mr Arthur Fong for their questions and comments.&nbsp; Many of the medical issues brought up have been with us for a long time but one problem is new - bird flu.&nbsp; Hardly a day goes by without a news report in the media on developments related to bird flu.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Mr Andy Gan have asked about aspects of our bird flu pandemic preparations. We must be prepared to manage three types of bird flu spread: one, bird to bird spread; two,&nbsp;bird to human spread; and three,&nbsp;human to human spread.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will begin with bird to bird spread. It appears that the H5N1 virus has established itself in wild birds. It has spread relentlessly from Asia to Europe and Africa. Fortunately, our poultry population is limited and is located in farms with good bio-security.&nbsp; You have heard earlier in the House all the measures that AVA and ENV have taken to ensure that there is no bird to bird spread in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, no H5N1 influenza virus has been detected in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, there are sporadic cases of bird to human spread. This has occurred in our neighbouring countries when humans have had close contact with sick birds. We have advised Singaporeans to avoid chicken farms when travelling to other countries.&nbsp; We have also put our doctors on alert against possible human cases of Avian flu coming into Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we should be prepared for a pandemic in case the virus mutates and starts spreading from human to human. Will a pandemic occur? We do not know.&nbsp; Experts differ in their opinion. Looking <p align=left>Column: 1289</p>back at the last century provides conflicting examples. In 1978, there was concern about a swine flu pandemic occurring and 24% of the population in the United States was vaccinated.&nbsp; The pandemic never occurred and no one died of swine fever.&nbsp; But the vaccination caused 500 complications and 25 deaths. On the other hand, in 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic spread across the world and caused 25 million deaths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing a pandemic is a national exercise in science-based risk management.&nbsp; Success depends on three factors:&nbsp; a strong effective political leadership, a cooperative public who follows health advisories during the pandemic, and a&nbsp; healthcare system that is well prepared to deal with public health challenges.&nbsp; This is what we learnt from our SARS experience.&nbsp; In Singapore, we have both, an effective leadership and a cooperative public. I want to assure the House that the third factor, the healthcare system, is well-prepared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We currently have some 700,000 courses of Tamiflu and are on track to build up our national stockpile by the end of the year. We have an assured supply of pandemic vaccine if we think it is necessary to vaccinate the population.&nbsp; Public healthcare institutions have put in place plans to manage the expected surge in outpatients and in-patients in a pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also worked with other Government agencies to ensure that essential services will continue to operate during a pandemic so that there is minimal disruption to the economy and society.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through our outreach, we have given talks to MNCs, SMEs, private organisations and grassroots leaders to help them understand the nature of pandemics and the measures that they can take to be prepared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1290</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will conduct exercises in the next few months to test our pandemic preparedness. In the first stage, we will focus on all public and private acute hospitals to ensure that they are ready.&nbsp; The second stage will be a wider system-level exercise and will also involve other agencies such as CAAS and ICA, as well as the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the risk of a bird flu pandemic is a global one, we are working with WHO and the international community to do our part in containing this threat.&nbsp; In January 2006, Singapore pledged $1 million at the International Pledging Conference in Beijing to fight bird flu. This will go towards our laboratory collaboration and capacity building efforts in Indonesia. In addition to this, together with the United States, we are also working with our Indonesian counterparts on a pilot project in Avian flu surveillance and control</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>at the Tangerang Municipality just outside Jakarta.&nbsp; This is an area with a population of about one and a half million people.&nbsp; The project is expected to commence in April 2006.&nbsp; Singapore will be contributing both funds and technical expertise towards this project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Chong Weng Chiew also suggested that couples getting married attend genetic counselling and screening.&nbsp; In fact, this is indeed already happening today.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public education about inherited genetic disorders such as Thalassemia and Hemophilia has been ongoing since the late 1980s.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thalassemia is the most common inherited genetic disorder in Singapore.&nbsp; Two decades ago, about 15 babies were being born every year with Thalassemia Major. &nbsp;To address this problem, in 1991, the Ministry of Health introduced a Thalassemia prevention and screening programme for couples and pregnant mothers.&nbsp; The programme has been <p align=left>Column: 1291</p>effective. The incidence of Thalassemia Major has now declined to one case per year for the last five years.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Arthur Fong proposed that we tackle the issue of smoking amongst the young.&nbsp;&nbsp;Smokers are a diverse group requiring different strategies and educational messages to encourage them to quit smoking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's smoking prevalence rate has declined.&nbsp; The smoking rate among those aged 18-69 years declined from 15% in 1998 to 12.6% in 2004.&nbsp; This is one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp;I think we also have one of the highest taxes on tobacco in the world.&nbsp; The smoking rate among young people aged 18-29 years has also declined from 26.2% to 12.3%.&nbsp; However, there is an increase in the proportion of young female smokers in the age group between 18-29 years, and the proportion has increased from 5.2% in 1998 to 6.6% in 2004.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To curb this increasing trend in young female smokers, the Health Promotion Board has introduced targeted initiatives which are gender-specific, such as the Fresh Air For Women Programme.&nbsp; HPB&nbsp;is also exploring new outreach channels such as websites, youth blogs and chatrooms which youths frequent and are comfortable with.&nbsp; We will also take in any marketing ideas that Mr Arthur Fong has and will suggest to them on how they can reach out to the young better.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, Dr Lily Neo has expressed concern about the fact that the&nbsp;mortality rate from heart attack in women was higher as compared to men. That means that if a man gets a heart attack, as compared to a woman, he has a higher chance of recovery, and suggested that we should increase our education effort towards women so that they will be more aware of this risk.&nbsp; I was quite intrigued by the statistics.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1292</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days ago, there was a whole host of experts in Singapore for a conference on this very topic of cardiac resuscitation. So I asked them about the statistics.&nbsp; A senior cardiologist there explained to me&nbsp;that the problem was not with women, but with men.&nbsp; Because men have a lower life expectancy than women,&nbsp; they get heart attacks more often and die at a younger age. There are far more women living to an older age and so&nbsp;the average age of women suffering a heart attack is much older than a man, and so this contributes to the higher mortality rate in women.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When dealing with medical statistics, I am reminded of a saying of Mark Twain,&nbsp; "Facts are stubborn, statistics are more pliable."&nbsp; The facts are that Singaporeans have one of the longest life expectancies and women outlive men. But a single statistic like the mortality rate from heart attack is sufficiently&nbsp;pliable so that different experts can&nbsp;draw different conclusions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Ministry will consider&nbsp;new initiatives to&nbsp;lower mortality rates from heart attacks in both men and women.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Chong Weng Chiew has expressed concern about the low stocks of blood during the festive period and has made useful suggestions on how to boost donations and increase autologous transfusions.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of blood donations collected has been steadily increasing by 7%-18% and the number of donors by 3%-8% every year over the past three years.&nbsp; This is an outstanding achievement by the Transfusion Service. The national blood supply has been able to adequately meet the needs of patients in Singapore hospitals most of the time, but still faces episodic periods of blood shortage during the December to January festive months.&nbsp; The Health Sciences Authority (HSA),&nbsp;with the Singapore Red Cross, will continue with its donor recruitment <p align=left>Column: 1293</p>campaigns to increase awareness amongst Singaporeans about the need to donate blood regularly.&nbsp; These include specific programmes to increase blood donation amongst youths aged 16-25 years of age, as suggested by Dr Chong.&nbsp; In an emergency, there are contingency plans to boost blood stocks quickly.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although autologous blood transfusion is encouraged in appropriate situations, the use of autologous blood for surgery has declined due to shorter waiting times for elective surgeries and an older patient population.&nbsp; This is because to use autologous blood the patient has to donate first and then he has to wait 2-3 weeks before he goes for his surgery.&nbsp; But with patients expecting very short waiting time for their elective surgeries, there are less of them willing to give autologous blood or donate&nbsp;for autologous blood transfusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The HSA will, nevertheless, continue to work with hospitals in encouraging autologous blood transfusions.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;Health Sciences Authority will take in Dr Chong's feedback in its ongoing review of blood donation adequacy for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Sir,&nbsp;the&nbsp;liberalisation of Medisave to look after costly outpatients, particularly the chronically ill, as I explained, is not a simple subject.&nbsp; What is my worry?&nbsp; My worry is abuse, because&nbsp;the barrier to&nbsp;access for&nbsp;outpatients is very low.&nbsp; At the hospitals,&nbsp;I can at least&nbsp;control, through&nbsp;the number of beds, and it is very costly to build hospitals.&nbsp; So, therefore, there will always be a limited supply of beds, and&nbsp;access is harder.&nbsp; Whereas, for outpatients, you can just hang up a&nbsp;signboard and you are in business and patients can just walk into clinics.&nbsp; The worry about abuse, overuse and over-servicing at the outpatient level is that Medisave may then run out.&nbsp; Do not forget that 21 years ago when we started Medisave, the reason was because we worried about expensive hospitalisation.&nbsp; So I do not want, in solving one problem, to create a bigger problem of people suddenly finding themselves, when they are really old and need to be hospitalised, do not have enough money in their Medisave.&nbsp; So I am taking my time, carefully thinking it through, but it is something that I am giving priority.&nbsp; I hope I can make major announcements during this year.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, on the second topic of the mentally ill.&nbsp; It is tough being a Health Minister because there is a whole range of illnesses, diseases.&nbsp; So, at any one point in time, we can only focus on a handful of things and, as I explained earlier in the House, this year I want to pay particular attention to the chronically ill.&nbsp; But I have not neglected the mentally ill.&nbsp; Globally, good mental health programmes are also very limited.&nbsp; I am not aware of any <p align=left>Column: 1295</p>country that has really done it well.&nbsp; Last year, we formed a national Committee on Mental Health and the experts have been studying it.&nbsp; I am awaiting their report in a few months' time and then we will study their proposals.&nbsp; Part of the trigger for the review was because of gambling addiction discussed during&nbsp;the IR debate.&nbsp; That is why we get them to start thinking about&nbsp;addiction to gambling, chemicals and all sorts of other things.&nbsp; But the end result would be the same, which is, if you upgrade the capacity and the expertise within the mental health institutions, the other mentally ill patients will also benefit from it.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The aim is to help every student realise his or her full potential.&nbsp; In fact, the nature of our education system now appears to be choice, choice and more choice.&nbsp; Sir, these new initiatives are largely welcomed.&nbsp;

Sir, our education system is&nbsp;one that is respected by many countries in the world and has produced high literacy rate and a capable workforce.&nbsp; But there&nbsp;remains a group of students, albeit a small group, who are unable to thrive or perhaps even survive in our current education system which is academically biased.&nbsp; This group who dropped out of the education system would likely form the underclass of our society if they are not given an opportunity to acquire job-ready and life-long learning skills.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1297</p>Moreover, as Singapore develops and becomes more affluent there is some concern that the education system, which is supposed to be based purely on&nbsp;meritocracy may, in fact, polarise our society by inadvertently offering greater benefits to the more educated and well-off Singaporeans.&nbsp; Hence, more attention should be paid to children who do poorly in schools as many may be from the lower income families.&nbsp; Without education as an income leveller, they may remain stuck in the poverty trap.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In enhancing our VTC education, I would like to suggest that the VTC work closely with the industry and WDA to ensure that students acquire the relevant skills needed by the industry, and their VTC programme is compatible with WDA's Workforce Skills Qualification System, such that there could be mutual recognition for the two programmes.&nbsp; It would be useful for the VTC to offer apprenticeship programmes as this will allow students to have hands-on experience of what they are learning and also help them earn some income which they may sorely need.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vocational education should not be seen or marketed as a last resort for those who fail their PSLE repeatedly.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

It can do this by having more counsellors to work with the teachers to identify such at-risk children at the primary and secondary schools.&nbsp; It should also enhance its&nbsp; Learning Support Programme, extending this&nbsp; beyond Primary 1 and 2, as many of these children remain unable to cope with their studies in the upper primaries due to their family circumstance and lack of support.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; Sir, some years back, we <p align=left>Column: 1299</p>discussed the problem of heavy school bags of our primary school students, and attracted the serious attention of the Ministry of Education.&nbsp; As a result, the Ministry of Education recently introduced the concept of "teach less, learn more" with the hope of reducing the burden of the primary school students.&nbsp; This was originally a good intention on the part of the MOE, but I discovered that the situation has not improved.&nbsp; On the contrary, it has become worse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, I noticed that more and more primary school students are using the trolley-type school bags when they go to school.&nbsp; Sir, just look at these pictures [<I>Indicating</I>].&nbsp; We can see that these primary school students are dragging their bags when they go to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite different&nbsp;from the old days when we put the bags on our back.&nbsp; Now, these bags are about 6-8 kilograms each, and the students have to walk with a hunch as they find it very difficult to walk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think for these very young primary school children,&nbsp;this is too heavy and it goes&nbsp;against our basic education policy.&nbsp; I would like to ask whether the Minister for Education has taken note of this problem.&nbsp; Has the MOE any plan to resolve this matter?&nbsp; I think we could consider providing a locker in each&nbsp;classroom&nbsp;for the students&nbsp;to leave some of their stationery and textbooks&nbsp;behind, so that they do not have to carry them around everyday.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr S Iswaran) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.35 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Something I do not understand is why do we have this artificial classification between talent and non-talent.&nbsp; I am not sure that it is useful.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if we all watched Jack Neo's "I Not Stupid", we would realise that there are different children with different talents&nbsp;and&nbsp;abilities, and they all can grow up and prosper.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that our education system has become more flexible&nbsp; -&nbsp; many paths to success and many different roads to glory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the new initiative by the MOE to help children from low-income families.&nbsp; The Government has repeatedly assured that no child will be denied education because of a lack of financial support.&nbsp; To me, this is wonderful.&nbsp; However, there are other expenses that the child in school needs to bear&nbsp; -&nbsp; supplementary fees,&nbsp;enrichment&nbsp;courses, books, &nbsp;stationery, uniform, shoes, meals and, sometimes, laptop or computer for the older students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For enrichment courses&nbsp; - study tours and training&nbsp; -&nbsp; I think the child from the poor family is disadvantaged if he is not able to participate.&nbsp; I certainly hope that the Opportunity Fund will make this happen and will be put to good use so that these children can enrich their education and really develop together with the other children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also heartening to know that the MOE will be providing breakfast to some children.&nbsp; I believe this will help quite a few poor children so that they can concentrate better on the lessons instead of being distracted by the noisy and hungry stomachs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with this wonderful assistance programme offered by the Opportunity Fund, I hope that the MOE, the principals and the teachers will be very careful and <p align=left>Column: 1301</p>circumspect in its implementation, and pay attention to the following points:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The Opportunity Fund is meant to help and assist needy students.&nbsp; So we must find the best use for the money, and I would hate to see this Fund being used for generic purposes, such as buying computer for computer rooms.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The issue with regard to teachers giving their handphone numbers to parents has been&nbsp;widely debated among teachers.&nbsp; Currently, there is no specific rule passed down from the Ministry of Education with regard to this matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some schools, form teachers are strongly encouraged by the school management to provide their personal handphone numbers to parents.&nbsp; In any case, it is often a requirement for teachers to give students their mobile phone numbers when they organise field trips or external sports training.&nbsp; Therefore, their phone numbers will eventually reach the parents.&nbsp; Some schools promote the idea of giving teachers' mobile phone numbers to parents as it creates a direct link between parent and teacher.&nbsp; Most teachers are fine with this concept, but complain of the abuse of this privilege given to parents.&nbsp; Parents have been known to call teachers at night and over the weekends.&nbsp; Others call teachers during the school hours to pass their messages.&nbsp; Sometimes, parents get frustrated&nbsp;when <p align=left>Column: 1302</p>teachers do not answer their mobile phones, return calls or SMS messages.&nbsp; There have been cases where parents have complained to the school management about this.&nbsp; The current situation points towards parents believing that it is a right and not a privilege to be given the teacher's personal mobile phone number.&nbsp; Thus, there are many disgruntled teachers who have complained that constant phone calls from parents at odd hours are infringing their basic right to privacy.&nbsp; Teachers are human too.&nbsp; The job calls for dedication to the students, but not to be on 24 hours standby to answer every parent's needs.&nbsp; It will be a shame if our nation were to lose good and dedicated teachers who resign from the teaching profession over this matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spoken to a few experienced teachers who have dedicated the better part of their life to the welfare of their students in their charge.&nbsp; They are all for maintaining a link with parents, but ask for&nbsp;their basic right to privacy.&nbsp; First, the mobile phone and line are completely paid for by the teacher.&nbsp; Therefore, the decision on whether to give parents their personal phone numbers should be solely left to the teachers.&nbsp; There should be no undue pressure upon the teachers by the school management to provide parents with their private phone numbers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, if the teachers so choose to give parents their mobile phone numbers, they should be awarded their basic right to privacy.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education has to come out with guidelines to parents to prevent the abuse of this privilege.&nbsp; For example, parents should not call teachers on their mobile phones after 7.00 pm or on weekends.&nbsp; The Ministry should also educate parents that having the teacher's mobile phone number is a privilege and not a right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I speak on this because I have to treat a patient with depression because of this.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Ong Soh Khim (Nominated Member):&nbsp;</B> Sir, I declare that I am an academic at NUS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the Prime Minister that we should attract foreign R&amp;D talents.&nbsp; However, we also need to develop our own talent and give due recognition to our home-grown R&amp;D talents, in order to be able to significantly increase the percentage of local researchers in the R&amp;D scene as, currently, only one-quarter of the researchers in Singapore are Singaporeans.&nbsp; In nurturing local talents, one key aspect is to encourage locals to pursue higher research degrees, whether locally or overseas, and an R&amp;D career.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, only about 25% of university research scholarship holders are locals, and the rest are foreign students, mainly from China and India.&nbsp; Granting of US visa to foreign students and scientists has since been relaxed after the 9-11 event.&nbsp; Soon, we will not be able to attract any good foreign students and researchers to pursue research in Singapore.&nbsp; A different perspective to view this is:&nbsp; our local universities and research institutes have been training research talents for other countries.&nbsp; Thus, we need to train and develop our own talents, and address the issue of why so few Singaporeans are pursuing higher degrees and an R&amp;D career.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, the IBN director was quoted in <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> saying it is easier to bring in foreign researchers as compared to persuading local PhD scholars to return,&nbsp;and she said that one reason being that these scholars are not appreciative of the excellent local research environment.&nbsp; Perhaps this director, having spent most of her years abroad,&nbsp;does not have a good feel of why locals are not pursuing higher degrees and an R&amp;D career and the scholars are not returning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1304</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some causes why few locals are pursuing local PhD degrees, an R&amp;D career and possibly why scholars are not keen to return are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; A lack of recognition of local PhD degrees, although many undergraduates have told me that it is financially more viable to pursue PhD locally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Locals are being passed over for foreigners in research job applications, even when they have graduated from the same university.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; A lack of recognition for local researchers and home-grown talents, as the general view is that they are not world-class while the foreigners are world-class, and this seems to follow the Chinese saying that "local gingers are not hot".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; A lack of proper research career for scholars as many are deployed to perform administrative duties in the research institutes upon their return; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Little prospect of holding leadership position in research projects and institutes.&nbsp; For example, when a new research institute is set up, there will usually be an international search for the director of this institute; a local home-grown talent, at best, can only be a deputy director.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, until we can give due recognition to our home-grown talents, local researchers and our local PhD degrees, we will not be able to encourage more locals to pursue an R&amp;D career.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, a graduate at the age of 25 thinks differently from a young JC or secondary student.&nbsp; Research idols have no effect on him as, by that age, the hardship of life would have&nbsp;impressed upon him, leaving him with many personal and family considerations, namely:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1305</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Many local students work part-time to support themselves.&nbsp; Some students told me that the part-time work has affected their studies and their potential class of honours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Many graduates prefer to start work immediately so as to start repaying their study loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Many students are heavily debt-ridden upon graduation now as compared to 10 years ago, and it would take a longer time to repay their loans, as the starting pay of a graduate now is still about the same as 10 years ago and yet the university fees have increased.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;Many students need to start working to support younger siblings in their studies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Many also wish to start working early to accumulate CPF savings to buy their first HDB flat; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;They need to start working to prepare for their marriage, especially if their girlfriends are of the same age as them from JC days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are not trivial personal and family reasons, but are the real hard facts of life of many graduates from average families.&nbsp; These considerations have discouraged locals from pursuing higher degrees whether locally or overseas.&nbsp; Some of these considerations are also stopping good local students from applying for A*STAR's AGS scholarship that has attractive stipends.&nbsp; It has been reported that 15% of A*STAR scholars are foreigners.&nbsp; A student asked me, "Ma'am, does the Government understand our problems?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had made some suggestions in my motion on the R&amp;D thrusts of Singapore in a previous sitting.&nbsp; I would like to additionally propose the following suggestions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1306</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Provide more financial help and assistance to the local students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Help the local students to repay their study loans, eg, through helping them to defer the interests on their study loans should they decide to pursue higher degrees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Provide more attractive monthly scholarship stipend of more than the current $1,500 for the university research scholarships.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Provide simultaneous on-the-job working opportunities that could lead to CPF contribution for those who decide to pursue higher degrees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Allow local students to use their CPF savings to repay their study loans;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; Provide job matching for local students who have completed their higher degrees.&nbsp;

This has been hailed as something of a revolution in our education system, an enlightened approach that is sympathetic to the wide range of abilities of our generation of pupils.&nbsp; This recognition that one size cannot fit all is largely welcome.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key plank of the changes thus far is the Integrated Programme for secondary schools and JCs.&nbsp; As a <I>Straits Times'</I>&nbsp;report dated 28th December 2005 noted, there are now at least five different ways of getting a university degree, not counting the traditional route of&nbsp; taking the 'O' and 'A' levels.&nbsp;However, the changes so far still tend to concentrate on the academic route leading to a university degree. Not much change and diversity has been incorporated for students who prefer the more applied route of going from secondary schools to the polytechnics.&nbsp;There have been calls from some students themselves that it will be beneficial to allow them to take more applied modules with real life practical applications, instead of purely academic subjects, even at secondary schools.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such subjects could be offered in conjunction with the polytechnics at secondary schools, much like NUS offering some Science and Mathematics&nbsp;subjects to the NUS High School. This could enhance students' learning experience, making learning more interesting and relevant, and spur greater <p align=left>Column: 1308</p>creativity and innovation.&nbsp; It would also help students discover their interests and talent early and prevent the less academically inclined from becoming disinterested in their studies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, exposing secondary school students early to polytechnic education may give them a good idea of where their educational inclination&nbsp;and career preferences lie.&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to apply this different pathways approach all the way up and down the educational ladder.&nbsp; More diversity and richness could be incorporated into our secondary school landscape to allow for more exploratory and creative learning, by offering not just applied and practice-oriented options but also subjects like art, design and even gaming.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Mr Chiam is not speaking.&nbsp; Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> Sir, let me thank Dr Amy Khor, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Loo Choon Yong, Dr Tan Cheng Bock and Prof. Ong Soh Khim for their comments and questions.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Khor has asked how we can offer more choices to our students today&nbsp;- more choices of subjects and pathways that they can take.&nbsp; I will focus on this in my first reply.&nbsp; She also asked about how we can better engage students who are less academically inclined and how we can reduce the number of students who drop out from schools.&nbsp;Several other MPs&nbsp;had also raised this issue during the Budget debate.&nbsp; I will address these questions later - what we can do to strengthen the non-academic or vocational pathway, and to reduce drop-out rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I will also address the specific questions raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Loo and Prof. Ong Soh Khim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1309</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me address the issue of expanding choices.&nbsp; It is an important direction in education that we have been&nbsp;taking&nbsp;in the last several years. Step by step, we are introducing more choice and&nbsp;more diversity. New types of schools and&nbsp;niches of excellence in all our schools, that differentiate one school from the other.&nbsp; This diversity and differentiation of schools is essentially our strategy for developing talent&nbsp;-&nbsp;it is how we are developing all talents, not just the top talents, not just the best academic talents, but every talent. It is developing every Singaporean talent, and discovering unique strengths and abilities in all our students and taking them as far as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me say that&nbsp;the diversity&nbsp;we are bringing into our schools builds on common foundations&nbsp;- the national system that gives our school system its strengths.&nbsp;Our success in education will, in fact, continue to rely on these strong, common foundations -&nbsp;a rigorous national curriculum system, a system of meritocratic progression, well-trained teachers in all our schools who have opportunities to grow and&nbsp;advance through the system,&nbsp;and school leaders who are systematically developed, moved around the system from time to time, and held to high standards.&nbsp; All our schools provide facilities which are of a very high standard by any international comparison, and&nbsp;allow for richness of experience that is virtually unmatched.&nbsp; And our schools, importantly, also provide&nbsp;the common educational experience for Singaporeans, a common experience that was totally lacking 40 years ago, that brings each generation of Singaporeans together, and gives them a shared identity as Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will keep strengthening these common foundations and experiences, give Singapore students a high quality&nbsp;education in every school, and keep levelling up.&nbsp;This is what differentiates <p align=left>Column: 1310</p>Singapore from others.&nbsp; We avoid the huge variance in standards that we see in many of the other developed countries, particularly those which lack robust national curricula.&nbsp; In the United States, for example, the best schools in the States are exceptionally good - probably the best in the world.&nbsp; But a large proportion of their public high schools are in bad shape.&nbsp; According to the US Department of Education, less than half of all US high school graduates have Mathematics and Science proficiencies that they need to progress beyond high school.&nbsp; Reading scores for 17-year-olds have remained flat since the early 1970s, more than 30 years. So, the Bush administration&nbsp;is putting in place major reforms&nbsp;- introducing a clear set of standards for what every child should know and be able to&nbsp;do, and testing students against these standards annually from grades 3 through 8, and once again&nbsp;in high school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like what I heard Mr Khaw Boon Wan mentioned earlier this afternoon&nbsp;when he was referring to the Canadian and American health systems&nbsp;- exceptional quality in a few areas but impoverishment of standards elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have to keep a sense of balance as we go forward.&nbsp; We are shifting the balance in education towards diversity.&nbsp; We are encouraging and entrenching diversity in our schools, so that we can develop our individual talents to the fullest.&nbsp; We develop talents in every area.&nbsp; I heard Dr Loo's concern.&nbsp;We should not be embarrassed about developing talents.&nbsp; It is our strategy for taking Singapore forward, for taking all Singaporeans forward.&nbsp; But let us find every talent and take him or her as far as possible.&nbsp; It is not an elitist strategy but a national strategy to take Singapore forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we do so, we also have to ensure that we retain and improve the common <p align=left>Column: 1311</p>foundations that we have built up over the years, that give all Singaporeans, whichever schools they come from, a high quality&nbsp;education and a solid preparation for further education in our ITEs,&nbsp;polytechnics and&nbsp;universities.&nbsp; We will keep the rigour of curriculum that makes Singapore education different from the rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sense of balance is at play in our latest moves to introduce more choice in the secondary school curriculum.&nbsp; As Dr Amy Khor has raised, we will introduce a richer range of options for applied learning in secondary schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not shifting from the core curriculum that our schools provide.&nbsp; We believe that&nbsp;all our students should undergo a 10-year broad-based and comprehensive education.&nbsp; So secondary school education should not be overly specialised.&nbsp; It should provide a good foundation in the fundamentals that prepare students for further studies in the JCs,&nbsp;polytechnics and&nbsp;ITEs.&nbsp; This is why all secondary school students are required to take a core of subjects - English Language, Mother Tongue, Mathematics, one Science subject,&nbsp;one Humanities subject. Social Studies is also taken by all secondary students, to give them an appreciation of Singapore's unique circumstances as a city state.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of sense in keeping this core curriculum for secondary schools.&nbsp; But we will provide for more free play around the core curriculum to encourage students to find and develop a range of talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we are rolling out choice and diversity in the system is by allowing some schools to develop curriculum niches of their own.&nbsp; They will provide different subject choices or new modules, besides the core curriculum that they share with all schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most practical way to offer choice, rather than <p align=left>Column: 1312</p>require all or most schools to offer new subject options.&nbsp; This way too, the schools take ownership, they want to differentiate themselves, and they are most likely to deliver quality.&nbsp; It is ground-up initiative owned by the schools, with MOE providing top-down support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the choice and diversity we have introduced is highly visible. Like the introduction of the Integrated Programme (IP) in 11 schools at the secondary level, specialised schools like the Sports School, NUS High and, soon to come,&nbsp;Arts School.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is a lot that is bubbling in the mainstream. From primary schools to JCs, schools are developing niches of excellence in the whole range of areas.&nbsp;New subjects, new ways of teaching students and&nbsp;centres of excellence in the sports and arts.&nbsp; And we are giving schools more discretion to select students from their own criteria, so as to recognise a wider range of Singaporean talents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take primary schools. MOE has given 24 primary school awards over the last two years to develop quality programmes in niches of their own.&nbsp; Like Telok Kurau Primary School, which is using team-based project work from Primary&nbsp;One upwards,&nbsp;to help young children develop communication and social skills, deepen interactions between their students of different races, and to learn about Singapore through their projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other examples, Maha Bodhi School has a comprehensive aesthetics programme from Primary&nbsp;One upwards, where every kid has exposure to dance, art, song, drama and the cultures of all our ethnic groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary schools -&nbsp;19 secondary schools are now offering three new 'O' level subjects from this year - Drama, Computer Studies and Economics.&nbsp; It is part of the differentiation of the mainstream school curriculum that we <p align=left>Column: 1313</p>have been developing over the years.&nbsp; If a student wants to start dabbling seriously in computing before he leaves school, there will be a few schools offering computing as an 'O' level subject, as a niche of their own. Just like if he is good with his Malay Language and wants to go further in the culture, he can try to get into one of the schools with EMAS (Elective Programme in Malay Language for Secondary Schools).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Normal course is also seeing innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty-eight secondary schools have introduced&nbsp;a total of 135 Elective Modules (EMs)&nbsp;for Normal course students to give them exposure to practical, hands-on learning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JC students are taking a new 'A' level curriculum from this year, which is broader and more flexible, and will allow those with&nbsp;the talent or interest in a specific area to pursue it&nbsp;in greater depth.&nbsp;JCs are offering students more choice, and students are doing subjects that interest them.&nbsp; In fact, the JCs have more than doubled the number of subject choice combinations that they are offering&nbsp;this year compared to last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, some JCs are developing more advanced electives of their own, or what we call&nbsp;H3 options, in the new 'A' level curriculum that they are developing in collaboration with the universities.&nbsp; For example, VJC and NJC have tied&nbsp;up with NUS and A*STAR to offer science research programmes.&nbsp; Students from the two colleges will carry out individual science research projects in the JCs or at&nbsp;A*STAR research institutes, with NUS serving as the examining authority.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now taking another step to enrich our secondary school curriculum, by expanding the range of options for students to engage in&nbsp;applied or practice-oriented learning.&nbsp; There is growing interest in applied learning among our students. If you take Design and <p align=left>Column: 1314</p>Technology, for example, last year more than 5,000 students took the subject as one of their 'O' level subjects, compared to 4,000 just two years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong chaired the Polytechnic-School Review Committee that we set up in October last year.&nbsp; His Committee consulted a wide cross-section of people, including students, teachers, principals and parents, through group discussions and getting feedback online.&nbsp; It has made a set of significant recommendations aimed at introducing more diverse applied offerings in our secondary schools.&nbsp; The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Committee's report, which we have circulated to Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several secondary schools are working with the polytechnics to develop new applied modules and subjects in areas such as electronic product design and computer animation.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>We will also introduce a Direct Polytechnic Admissions exercise, similar to the recently introduced Direct Admission exercise for&nbsp;junior colleges and secondary schools, which will allow a certain number of students to be offered places before their O-levels, based on a range of talents, as assessed by the polytechnics.&nbsp; We will start with a small number of students, and&nbsp;expand their numbers over time as we gain experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong will spell out the changes in fuller detail later and will address specific queries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just highlight a few broader implications of these school-based, applied learning experiences that we are introducing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I want to emphasise that the introduction of new applied options is not <p align=left>Column: 1315</p>in essence about training students early in skills.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp;in essence about new specialisations, but about developing innovative minds.&nbsp; The idea is not just about providing early exposure to applied subjects like electronics or digital media, or about gearing up students who are set on going to the polytechnics to study such fields.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are really trying to do is to provide more opportunities for students to develop inventive minds by doing, ie,&nbsp;minds that are able to look for problems, invent solutions, and make them happen.&nbsp; We want to expand these opportunities for practical application of knowledge across a spectrum of schools and students.&nbsp; In fact, even schools which offer the Integrated Programme, all of whose students go on to junior college, are keen to introduce applied learning options in their curriculum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also the thinking behind the motto of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US. &nbsp;"<I>Mens et Manus</I>" in Latin, which literally means "Mind and Hand".&nbsp; MIT believes passionately in this cooperation between knowledge and practical science, ie,&nbsp;in training students who not only understand issues conceptually and at a very deep level, but who are also able to apply concepts to find practical applications and solutions.&nbsp; It is also what lies behind MIT's entrepreneurial culture, and it is&nbsp;why MIT has launched&nbsp;more than a thousand companies in the last decade alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some very good high schools abroad also provide their students with these opportunities.&nbsp; An MOE team visited a top high school in California&nbsp;this year, the "High Tech High School", which emphasised practical learning.&nbsp; For example, instead of taking an examination, students were asked to present their science projects in&nbsp;exhibitions.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 1316</p>team met one of the students who already had a patent to his name and was working on another patent for his latest invention - a glove&nbsp;which allows people to type into their computers without a keyboard.&nbsp; The glove is wired so that you can key in&nbsp;letters and symbols&nbsp;by tapping your fingers in different&nbsp;combinations&nbsp;on a surface. &nbsp;The student was confident of getting into MIT based on his inventions, without having to worry about his SAT scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Japanese schools do the same. &nbsp;I visited the Tokyo Tech High School, which collects very bright students from all over Japan.&nbsp; They made it compulsory for students to take an applied subject because, as they put it, they wanted&nbsp;students to go beyond being "book-smart". &nbsp;Some students were doing mechanical engineering, wearing factory overalls and working on lathes. &nbsp;They were not just learning new skills, but applying their minds to problems in a different way. &nbsp;The Japanese still produce top minds in technology and innovation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These benefits are&nbsp;experienced by our students in subjects like Design and Technology, not just picking up skills, but developing a knack for making things, and developing something of an innovative mind as they do so. &nbsp;We want to expand these opportunities and appeal to students with a broader range of interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another implication of the new applied subjects that some of our schools will offer is that we are allowing&nbsp;a system of school-based curriculum and assessment.&nbsp; Schools will develop the assessment methods for the subjects they introduce, jointly with the polytechnics.&nbsp; There are advantages in this, because schools will be able to assess what their students have learnt and demonstrated more authentically.&nbsp; Assessment would be shaped by what schools teach, rather than teaching being shaped by what they are&nbsp;assessed in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1317</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, MOE will ensure that&nbsp;standards are maintained.&nbsp; We will work with the polytechnics to establish an Academic Panel to ensure that the curriculum and standards of assessment for the applied subjects remain high, comparable in rigour to the existing O-level subjects. &nbsp;This framework will therefore allow schools greater autonomy to customise their curriculum to meet the interests of their students, without compromising on standards.&nbsp; It is a meaningful innovation, a way to preserve the core elements of our national system while allowing schools to develop niches of their own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third implication of these new applied modules and subjects is that they will bring new types of teachers into some of our schools. &nbsp;MOS Gan's Committee recommended allowing instructors who are trained and qualified in their specific fields to teach applied subjects in our secondary schools.&nbsp; They need not have been trained by the National Institute of Education (NIE), if they have the requisite experience, knowledge and skills, to teach the applied subjects.&nbsp; It will enrich the&nbsp;pool of teaching expertise in our schools. &nbsp;Over time, we may also see some synergies, some cross-learning, between teachers of existing subjects and the instructors who are hired by the polytechnics to teach the new applied subjects.&nbsp; It can lead to useful innovations in the way some of our existing&nbsp;subjects are taught.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, the expanded choices and opportunities that we are bringing into our schools is the way we are developing a mountain range of diverse talents amongst our young. &nbsp;Wherever there is a talent, we want to do all&nbsp;we can to&nbsp;develop it and take it to&nbsp;the fullest. &nbsp;Talents like Stefan Tseng of the Sports School -&nbsp;some of you might&nbsp;have read in&nbsp;today's news -&nbsp;just broke&nbsp;the Under-17&nbsp;triple jump record in&nbsp;at the UK Amateur Athletic Association Indoor <p align=left>Column: 1318</p>Championships over the weekend.&nbsp; In fact, he&nbsp;broke a 25-year-old&nbsp;record by 30 centimetres.&nbsp; For Members who are familiar with triple jump, 30 centimetres is quite a distance.&nbsp; In fact, he broke the Under-20 record as well by something like 12 centimetres.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the talents we will search out for, nurture, give them the best, take them as far as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it will be a mountain range of peaks where&nbsp;the foothills are also well above sea level. &nbsp;We will keep high average standards and improve the quality of education that all our&nbsp;schools provide. &nbsp;We will keep our robust national curriculum framework. &nbsp;We will preserve the core curriculum in schools while allowing them to have&nbsp;more free play around the core,&nbsp;to differentiate themselves.&nbsp; And this new balance, between what is common and what is diverse in education, will be founded on our system of meritocracy - a meritocracy that is more lively but also in many ways more authentic in the way it recognises a full range of Singaporean talents and helps them to go as far as possible.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tuition Centres</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, there has been some debate in the media on the importance that is placed on private tutors and tuition centres.&nbsp; UNESCO refers to this group as the "shadow education system".&nbsp; They provide reinforcement for what is taught in the schools and allow students to practise until a&nbsp; level where they understand and learn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Singaporeans are very generous in spending on tuition.&nbsp; A survey in 2000 revealed that actually about $70 million was spent just on Chinese tuition alone.&nbsp; Given the significant role that private tutors and tuition centres play in the education of our young Singaporeans, we have to pay heed to the rumbles from the ground about this industry.&nbsp; In a recent <p align=left>Column: 1319</p><I>Straits Times'</I> article&nbsp;titled "MOE-certified - What Does It Really Mean?", a writer lamented&nbsp;the lack of clarity on tuition centres which claim they are MOE-registered.&nbsp; My point is that MOE should make it clear what it means when a tuition centre claims that it is MOE-registered.&nbsp; As the lead agency for education, MOE must ensure that tuition centres do not misrepresent or take advantage of the lack of knowledge.&nbsp; Sometimes, it is very confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that for the tutor,&nbsp;"MOE-registered" simply means that the teacher has "qualifications beyond the levels that the school has proposed for them to teach".&nbsp; Worse still, I also understand that there is another segment of private tuition that is not being regulated, ie, private tutors from tuition&nbsp;agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I hope MOE can consider whether there is a need to certify the private tutors instead of just registering them.&nbsp; This will ensure that, by saying "MOE-registered", it actually means that the tutors have been certified to meet the minimum standard set by MOE and are actually qualified to teach the subject.&nbsp; After this certification, it will also be important to carry out regular audits and accreditation to maintain the certification, and to ensure that it is not abused.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Private Education</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, many students, especially the foreign ones, tend to perceive the registration of Private Education Organisations (PEOs) here in Singapore with MOE as an endorsement by MOE of their courses, and that MOE is responsible for the performance of such PEOs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, PEOs know that this is the misperception on the ground and, taking advantage of this link with MOE, <p align=left>Column: 1320</p>have&nbsp;been promoting themselves as "MOE of Singapore registered school", giving the impression that they have attained certain approvals, standards and requirements with this registration.&nbsp; You can see this in most of the advertisements that they put up&nbsp;in all the media,&nbsp;claiming that it is "<I>xin jia bo jiao yu bu zhu ce pi zhun de ke cheng</I>", ie, it is all approved by MOE.&nbsp; But the students do not understand that MOE only registers but does not care at all for&nbsp;these PEOs in terms of their performance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is unacceptable.&nbsp; I hope that MOE will seriously look into&nbsp;ensuring that the schools&nbsp;registered with it are truly able to perform reasonably and are not just using the MOE as the endorsement authority to promote themselves as qualified and quality schools when they are not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, we need to help students to make&nbsp;an informed choice in selecting the good schools to enrol in.&nbsp; Currently, there is no central accreditation body in Singapore.&nbsp; Today, the students, be they local or foreign, usually have to base their decision on trial and error to get the right schools to enrol in.&nbsp; There is no authority to turn to when assessing the credibility and performance of the PEOs.&nbsp; They really do not know what to do.&nbsp; Many foreign students, after having attended several sessions with the PEO, would have to switch schools, thereby incurring inconveniences and extra costs.&nbsp; It is useful if MOE could have a website to provide relevant information, such as the ranking of the PEOs in Singapore, and whether the PEOs are accredited with the various schemes.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Education (Mr Gan Kim Yong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Gan Kim Yong):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, as Singapore's economy becomes increasingly diversified and knowledge-based, our education system must also change in tandem to produce students and graduates with the right mindset, knowledge and skills to meet the manpower needs of our new economy.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1321</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has, over the years, introduced significant changes in our schools to provide greater diversity and flexibility in our education system, and we will continue to do so.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor has asked for more&nbsp;pathways and options in applied learning. &nbsp;My Minister has earlier outlined a few new initiatives that MOE will be introducing in our schools, and I will now elaborate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Polytechnic-School Review Committee was set up in October last year to look at how we can introduce greater diversity and flexibility in our secondary school landscape, by offering more options for applied learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of our study, the Committee consulted widely among the stakeholders, including principals, teachers, parents, students, as well as the industry.&nbsp; We also studied the education models of Europe and the United States.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Sweden, I visited a few upper secondary schools.&nbsp; I was impressed and inspired by the level of energy and excitement among the students in one particular school.&nbsp; This school had a special niche in Mass Communications.&nbsp; The students were highly motivated and engaged in exciting hands-on practical projects like producing television programmes, documentaries and radio shows for their schoolmates.&nbsp; They were even tasked to organise an annual film festival for the city.&nbsp; We want to similarly enthuse, engage and motivate our students, some of whom may learn better through a more practice-oriented approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we consulted students through focus group discussions, many shared with us their desire for greater exposure for applied subjects in their secondary schools.&nbsp; They found applied learning experience very interesting and practical.&nbsp; It helps make the lessons come alive.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>5.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1322</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, our secondary schools offer a robust GCE 'O' level curriculum which prepare our students for a broad range of post-secondary options. While this option has served us well, we can do more to enrich the secondary school curriculum and provide more choices for our students, especially in&nbsp;applied learning experience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee has therefore made three key recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Committee recommended the introduction of elective modules with applied content in the secondary school curriculum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The polytechnics have been working together with schools on a variety of programmes for secondary school students, such as seminars, camps, workshops and projects.&nbsp; For instance, students from&nbsp;Bishan Park Secondary School have been attending short courses in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Video Production and Food Science at Nanyang Polytechnic.&nbsp; Temasek Polytechnic conducts Aerospace workshops for students from Bedok South Secondary School and Yuying Secondary School.&nbsp; These workshops introduce students to the basic theories of Aerospace Engineering, such as propulsion&nbsp;systems and aerodynamics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can formalise&nbsp;and build on these linkages between schools and polytechnics to develop and offer Advanced Elective Modules (AEMs).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These AEMs can include topics as wide-ranging as Creative Game Design, Electronic Product Design, Entrepreneurship and Food Innovation.&nbsp;As Dr Khor pointed out, applied learning such as the AEMs, will give our students a broader and richer learning experience, help them discover their strengths and interests, and help them make better decisions on their future course of studies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1323</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The content covered in the AEMs will be of a greater rigour and depth than the existing enrichment activities and programmes, but less than that of a full GCE 'O' level subject. Each AEM will comprise about 40 hours of contact time, of which practical content such as laboratory work, projects and presentations will make up about 50%.&nbsp; Depending on the type of facilities required, AEMs could be conducted either in the secondary schools or in the polytechnic campuses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The polytechnics will recognise students' efforts in taking the AEMs.&nbsp; For example, polytechnics will take into account students' participation and performance in the AEMs if they apply through the discretionary admissions system. Students may also be given credit exemption for relevant polytechnic modules.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially, the polytechnics will work with 10 to 15 secondary schools to develop a range of AEMs customised to suit the areas of focus of the participating schools.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AEMs are meant for a wide range of students: those who are keen to go to polytechnics as well as those who wish to study in the JCs.&nbsp; The applied learning experience will benefit both groups.&nbsp; It is interesting that among the schools which have indicated interest in introducing AEMs, there are&nbsp;four Integrated Programme (IP) schools - ACS (Independent), Hwa Chong Institution,&nbsp;Nanyang Girls High School and Raffles Institution.&nbsp; The IP schools are well-positioned to introduce these modules because of the greater curriculum flexibility that they have in not having to prepare their students for the 'O' level examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The list also includes Autonomous schools like Dunman Secondary and Temasek Secondary <p align=left>Column: 1324</p>Schools, and neighbourhood schools like Bishan Park Secondary, Dunearn Secondary, Outram&nbsp;Secondary and Choa Chu Kang Secondary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We aim to roll out the first AEM from January 2007.&nbsp; As the polytechnics and schools gain more experience in offering AEMs, more schools can come on-board to offer AEMs to their students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these AEMs,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;students who are keen to take up applied subjects in greater depth. Today, there are a small number of applied subjects available at the secondary schools, such as Design and Technology, Food and Nutrition and Principles of Accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee's second recommendation is to introduce more 'O' level equivalent subjects in applied disciplines at the upper secondary level, which will be known as the Applied Graded Subjects (AGS).&nbsp; Like the AEMs, the AGS will enhance our curriculum offerings and provide more opportunities for students to pursue their interests in areas currently available only in the polytechnics, like Electronics, Creative 3D Animation and Cell and Molecular Biology.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, students taking the Creative 3D Animation course will learn how to create a 3D animation movie, from plot development and character design, to the final rendering of the animation scenes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new AGS will be equal in rigour and scope to a full GCE 'O' level subject.&nbsp; These subjects will be equivalent to the other elective subjects that students currently take at the 'O' levels. They can also be included in the computation of scores for admission into JCs/CI as well as polytechnics. Students will still be required to offer the five core subjects - English Language, Mathematics, at least one Science subject, at least one Humanities subject, and the Mother Tongue Language, to ensure a strong foundation of basic academic knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1325</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students may also be given exemptions for certain polytechnic modules if the same content has been covered in the AGS.&nbsp; We expect that AGS will initially be offered in four to five secondary schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AGS will be rolled out in 2008. To date, Ngee Ann Polytechnic has expressed interest in working with St Andrew's Secondary School, while Temasek Polytechnic will be partnering with Temasek Secondary and Dunman High Schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;The polytechnics may extend their offerings subsequently depending on students' interest and resources available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to the Committee's third key recommendation, which is the introduction of the Direct Polytechnic Admission Exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, most students apply to the polytechnics through the Joint Admissions Exercise, based on their 'O' level performance. Starting this year,&nbsp;the Joint Polytechnic Special Admissions Exercise will admit up to 5% of the enrolment based on special talents.&nbsp; Both of these admission exercises are conducted after the 'O' level results are released.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that there are some secondary school students who are interested in, and have the aptitude for, an applied education.&nbsp; Many of these students will already have decided quite earlier on that they want to study in the polytechnics, and even the specific courses that they want to&nbsp;take up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is therefore scope to put in place an additional pathway for direct admission of these students who are clearly intent on going to the polytechnics, similar to the Direct School Admission Exercise at the JC levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Direct Polytechnic Admission (DPA) exercise will allow some secondary <p align=left>Column: 1326</p>school students to obtain confirmed places in the polytechnics even before they take their 'O' levels.&nbsp; However, they will still need to sit for their GCE 'O' level examinations&nbsp;and obtain the minimum polytechnic entry requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DPA exercise will be open to all Secondary&nbsp;4 students in the Express and Normal Academic courses.&nbsp; Students can begin applying to the polytechnic courses of their choice, around May/June of their Secondary&nbsp;4 year and they will be informed of the outcome in July.&nbsp; The timing is in line with the current Direct School Admission Exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DPA exercise will allow the polytechnics to assess students in a more holistic manner. The criteria will be merit-based and transparent and may include factors such as students' interests and aptitude in the applied areas. Polytechnics may assess students through aptitude tests, school recommendations, school-based results, interviews or their participation in the applied subjects and modules such as Design and Technology, AEMs and AGS.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early confirmation of polytechnic places through the DPA will also allow students to benefit from a special preparatory programme offered by the polytechnics, which will start in January, before the commencement of the formal polytechnic calendar. This preparatory programme will help broaden students' learning experiences, and help them build a strong foundation for the polytechnic education. For instance, modules such as Communications Skills, Creative and Applied Thinking Skills and Foundational Mathematics could be covered in the programme. As some of these modules are also part of the main diploma programmes, DPA students who have taken the preparatory programme can be exempted from these courses subsequently.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1327</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a start, we target to have about 500 students admitted under the DPA exercise each year, or about 100 students per polytechnic. This is equivalent to about 2.5% of the polytechnics' annual intake,&nbsp;in addition to the 5% currently allowed under the Joint Polytechnic Special Admissions Exercise.&nbsp;Going forward, the DPA exercise may be expanded after the polytechnics gain more experience with direct admissions procedures.&nbsp; The DPA will start in 2007 for the 2008 polytechnic intake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the longer term, as the polytechnics and schools gain more experience, we can also further explore how some secondary schools can have closer tie-ups with the polytechnics.&nbsp; Some possibilities include allowing students who are very clear on their desire for polytechnic education to progress directly to the polytechnics without taking their 'O' level examinations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, our schools and polytechnics will have exciting and challenging years ahead with these new initiatives. They will help keep our education system relevant and produce students and graduates that will meet the needs of our changing economy, as well as allow every individual to develop their potential to the fullest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me now to move on to address some issues regarding private education that were raised by Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang called for greater quality control of private educational organisations (PEOs) and for more information of PEOs to be made available to assist students to make an "informed" choice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Education Act, MOE registers private schools which include tuition centres, language schools and commercial schools. These private <p align=left>Column: 1328</p>schools must meet building and fire safety requirements and have an acceptable curriculum and qualified teachers before they can be registered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuition centres have to seek MOE's permission to engage teachers. Dr Ong is right that these teachers must possess educational qualifications beyond the levels they intend to teach and have&nbsp;the knowledge related to the subject areas to be taught. For example, for secondary level subjects, teachers must have 'A' levels or above.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, some parents prefer to engage private tutors either through tuition agencies or their personal contacts; some engage their relatives and friends. Tuition agencies are commercial set-ups usually registered as&nbsp;businesses/companies with the Accounting and Corporate Regulating Authority (ACRA).&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike tuition centres, they do not come under the jurisdiction of MOE and they do not operate as a "school" per se.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For PEOs who wish to offer external degree programmes (EDPs), MOE will register these programmes if&nbsp;the foreign university offering the programme is bona fide and that degree is conferred by the foreign university.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, MOE's registration is not tantamount to the accreditation of the PEOs or endorsement of the quality and standard of the courses delivered by them.&nbsp; MOE's registration is part of a multi-agency approach involving EDB, CASE, SPRING, ICA and STB to protect students' interest as well as to encourage PEOs to work towards organisational and academic excellence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that the market is the real test for the quality of education provided by PEOs.&nbsp; Industry players should work with accreditation agencies to differentiate themselves and to raise the overall standard of PEOs in Singapore. To this end, MOE is pleased to note that various industry associations such as the <p align=left>Column: 1329</p>Association of Private Schools (APS) and the Association of&nbsp;Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) have stepped forward to help private schools upgrade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Students and parents, local or foreign, should conduct their own checks on the quality of the courses, tuition centres, schools or PEOs before enrolling in these programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Yeo and Dr Ong that we can provide more information to help students make an informed choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since February 2006, MOE has enhanced its private education website to include information on some of the checks that&nbsp;students can do when selecting institutions which offer external degree programmes. Other information available includes the CaseTrust for Education and SQC-PEO schemes and there are links to these and other relevant websites.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, MOE will continue to enhance its website to provide more information to students and parents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc.

We have produced many bright students, some of whom have made it to the top ranks of their graduating cohorts.&nbsp; At the same time, MOE has also paid attention on the slower students and the disabled.&nbsp; To date, 59 out of 330 primary and secondary schools have improved their infrastructure so that their facilities are accessible by disabled students.&nbsp; It is also heartening to note that the PCF kindergartens will be incorporating special syllabus to train autistic children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MOE has also overhauled and rebranded technical education in Singapore so as to boost the image and value of vocational and technical education.&nbsp; However, going forward, we need to go beyond academic pursuits and skills acquisition.&nbsp; A holistic approach includes instilling a sense of reality in our students and beefing up their emotional and adversity capacities.&nbsp; We also need quality learning resources to support our system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Bill Gates hit the nail on the head in a recent talk to high school students.&nbsp; He highlighted a few rules which he said students do not, and will not, learn from schools which are geared to deliver only feel-good politically-correct teachings.&nbsp; Thus, we have created a generation of <p align=left>Column: 1331</p>kids who may be lacking in the concept of reality and this could set them up for failure in the real world.&nbsp; I will quote two rules that have application in our situation.&nbsp; Rule One, "Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity".&nbsp; Grandparents call it "opportunity".&nbsp; In other words, make the best of what we have.&nbsp; Rule Two, "Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not."&nbsp; Some schools in the US have abolished failing grades and they will give as many times as you want to get the right answers.&nbsp; This is nowhere close to anything real in life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to link these rules to some observations and feedback from ITE, JC and Secondary Four students whom I&nbsp;recently&nbsp;had some conversations with.&nbsp; Their comments can be categorised under three categories on jobs.&nbsp; They are:&nbsp; how will their education land them a job when some of their middle-age parents remain unemployed?&nbsp; Why are jobs, including the lower-end ones, landing on the laps of foreigners?&nbsp; On skills and competencies,&nbsp;how can they better equip themselves to remain composed and achieve win-win outcome?&nbsp;&nbsp;On self-motivation,&nbsp;how can they be taught to&nbsp;look at a glass of water as half-full and not half-empty?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Neighbourhood Schools</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, with the recent diversification of our education system, there are now many modes of schools and paths that our children can take, each according to his or her aptitude and capability.&nbsp; They can study in a private, independent, autonomous or neighbourhood school.&nbsp; They can follow the IP, AO-level, N-level or ITE path.&nbsp; There are now more choices.&nbsp; There is, thus, no need for all the schools to have the same objectives or performance yardsticks.&nbsp; But I still hear of school children overloaded with homework, as if school is nothing more than to score good grades.&nbsp; This may not be due to the school, but a mindset issue which takes time to change.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I think the most important role of the school is to educate our young to be good human beings and citizens of Singapore and to be able to seize the many opportunities that will arise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School principals should recognise that they now have the opportunity to shape the role that their school can effectively perform to serve the community.&nbsp; The principal is the top leader in the school and has the most influence on its outcome.&nbsp; Teachers, staff and students take the cue from the principal.&nbsp; But the principal takes his or her cue from the Ministry of Education at the apex.&nbsp; Hence, it is vital that both the Ministry and the principal set the right framework for the school.&nbsp; This is especially so of our neighbourhood schools where some of the students may not be very academically-inclined.&nbsp; The school must find ways to bring out the best in the students in areas which their aptitude can do well and achieve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1333</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to a related issue - students dropping out of schools.&nbsp; There are many reasons why children drop out of school.&nbsp; Many find school boring and classes difficult to follow or nothing useful in them.&nbsp; Some are not academically-inclined, others are influenced by wayward friends, while others have personal family and financial problems.&nbsp; Most are resentful and angry and have no idea what the future&nbsp;holds for them.&nbsp; The&nbsp;hopeful part is that I have met some who have had a change of heart and sought help to return to school.&nbsp; They did well after that.&nbsp; Hence, not all are hopeless cases and they can be helped.&nbsp; Ideally for every child, we should investigate the reasons for the child dropping out and see how we can help to resolve their problems.&nbsp; In the schools and community, we should develop resources such as financial&nbsp;counselling to help our students stay in school.&nbsp; We should have the resources to detect and help the student before he or she drops out and stay in, but we must also develop resources to help bring back those who did.&nbsp; Every child who drops out of school before he or she develops his or her potential to be a useful citizen will become a lifelong burden to society.&nbsp; Besides saving a life and perhaps many others related to it as well, we can also reduce the long-term cost to society and the nation.&nbsp; Credit must be given to those principals and teachers who are prepared to give students a second chance.&nbsp; It cannot be an easy decision as the chance of misbehaviour remains.&nbsp; A lot of patience and effort have been put in to help to motivate these students.&nbsp; I have encountered several such principals and teachers.&nbsp; I am grateful to them and I know that the children and their families are grateful too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me say that the responsibility lies not only on the schools and community but also the parents and family members.&nbsp; It is only by working <p align=left>Column: 1334</p>together that we can evolve an effective solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Vocational Education</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Ong Seh Hong</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I welcome and support MOE's intention to set up a new vocational school, North Light School (NLS), in January 2007.&nbsp; To my mind, the formation of this school is a step in the right direction in reaction to the social trends in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trend, nowadays, in the job market is a preference for those with skills.&nbsp; When one grows older it is easy to lose one's job and harder to secure new employment.&nbsp; It would be even worse for those with little skill and&nbsp;no educational qualification.&nbsp; In 2005, there were 1,100 who failed to progress through mainstream education.&nbsp; When this group grows&nbsp;older, most of them would be confronted with the problem&nbsp;of making a decent living.&nbsp; Thus, the setting of the NLS is to meet this future problem head-on.&nbsp; However, I have a few comments on the NLS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, while the NLS may be well-intended with the well-being of the students in mind,&nbsp;we need to ensure that this is not another dead-end type of school and it does not become another stigma for the students.&nbsp; Therefore, if&nbsp;students in this school do well, they should be given plenty of opportunities to progress further.&nbsp; If this is not spelt out clearly in the beginning, I am afraid&nbsp;we&nbsp;may face some resistance from parents to send their children to NLS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, a good majority of these students may come from poor family background.&nbsp; Their parent's financial resources may be stretched.&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme and curriculum of NLS appear to be quite comprehensive.&nbsp; My fear is that meeting these obligations might stretch the students and their parents financially further and it might become a <p align=left>Column: 1335</p>further burden.&nbsp; I, therefore, ask the Ministry to ensure that the fee for this school&nbsp;remains affordable with a view that these are students&nbsp;coming mainly&nbsp;from low income families and also to render generous assistance whenever needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I am glad that one of the stated objectives is for the graduates to progress to an apprenticeship scheme&nbsp;with industries.&nbsp; However, if students of NLS cannot find employment after graduating, it would send a strong signal to others not to enrol in NLS.&nbsp; Would it not be better to consult with the various industries on the type of manpower needs so that the proper type of manpower training is being given?&nbsp; Better still, I would urge the school to start offering apprenticeship during their school years.&nbsp; It will serve two purposes.&nbsp; First, to&nbsp;ensure employment after graduation.&nbsp; Second, they may get some allowance from this apprenticeship during their school terms and this will greatly reduce the financial burden of those poor families and act as an incentive to attract and retain the students.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It has a draining effect on our Education budget.&nbsp; I believe that the root cause must be dealt with effectively to minimise wastage of talent and resources.&nbsp; We understand, Sir, that not all students are academically-inclined.&nbsp; Thus, our education system can sometimes be a turn-off for these students.&nbsp; They lose interest and motivation.&nbsp; Sadly, some drop out of the system.&nbsp; We need to enhance the prevention measures and put in efforts to identify these at-risk students so that they do not fall out of the system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, Sir, I would like to ask what are the drop-out rates for our primary and secondary schools.&nbsp; How effective are the LSP programmes?&nbsp; Do we have capabilities and capacities in the area of counselling to assist and guide the troubled students?&nbsp;

I would like to ask the Minister what are the prospects of graduates of technical and vocational institutes?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, Sir, need to work very closely with the industries to&nbsp;understand what they want from the technical and vocational-trained workers.&nbsp;

Hence, I would like to ask how relevant is their training?&nbsp; How do we prepare them for the challenges and new technologies?&nbsp; We need to constantly remember that we are preparing students to work in the knowledge economy.&nbsp; The educational experiences of our students need to give them the desire and drive to continue self-directed learning over a lifetime.&nbsp; Career change is a norm in a fast changing workplace.&nbsp; The ability to continue learning is a necessity.&nbsp; Hence, workers need to be equipped with a different set of competencies.&nbsp; Sir, I believe the above must be taken into consideration when planning for&nbsp;curriculum for their vocational education.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There have also been comments of how GEP students either keep to themselves or are ostracised by the non-GEP students.&nbsp; In their bid to promote interaction between GEP and non-GEP students, the MOE recently announced that mainstream secondary school students will be allowed to take some GEP enrichment subjects.&nbsp; Additionally, to increase interaction from a younger age, the MOE is also looking into letting primary school GEP students take subjects like PE and arts with their mainstream counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the introduction of the through-train integrated programme for <p align=left>Column: 1338</p>secondary schools and GEPs, many schools such as Raffles Girls School, which used to offer GEP are now offering just the IP programme as it, in fact, provides a more customised and flexible approach to developing talent.&nbsp; It is envisaged that most GEP students would choose the IP, making the GEP at secondary schools quite redundant.&nbsp; This being the case, the GEP at secondary schools could eventually be phased out.&nbsp;

Sir, language, as a means of communication for international contact and as a touch-point medium for meeting and interacting with people across countries, is very important.&nbsp; Speaking another language facilitates interaction with our neighbours, and perhaps may lead to more opportunities including business later on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not talking about cultivating people with bi-cultural values.&nbsp; How many of us can claim to be bi-cultural?&nbsp; We all, in Singapore, can probably be just cosmopolitan or plain international.&nbsp; I am only thinking of preparing ordinary mortals who, at some stage in their life, would be running around making a living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The emphasis on listening and speaking in the way of learning Mandarin that is currently being done, I think, is correct.&nbsp; It would be the same for learning any other language.&nbsp; By adopting this approach of listening and speaking, we can get many students to be interested to learn second or even third languages.&nbsp; By adopting this approach to learn languages, we will shift emphasis of learning by rote for examination to learning by speaking, by listening and by learning to read the language.&nbsp; Must the level of examination be pitched so high that so many students are put off by the learning of it?&nbsp; Language learning then comes to life when it opens up doors to opportunities and learning about people in other countries.&nbsp; And those who have stronger interest and capabilities can pursue further and develop their talents into literature and philosophy later on in their own way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe learning a foreign language is extremely useful.&nbsp; For example, most European executives can speak more than two languages, unlike the British or the Americans.&nbsp; The reason is because they come from small countries where they have to interact across borders for business and communication all round Europe and all over the world.&nbsp; And they were the leaders <p align=left>Column: 1341</p>and still are the leaders in international trade and contacts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students here are not allowed to learn a second language which is not their Mother Tongue, and not a third language unless they are permitted by the Ministry to learn French, German or Japanese, because these languages&nbsp;are considered to be good foreign&nbsp;or international languages.&nbsp; The question I want to ask is: why is Spanish, for example, not one of those foreign languages that we allow our students to learn?&nbsp; I think it is a&nbsp;more international language than French, German or Japanese, being the language of South America, south and south west US, besides Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many older Members of the House, including myself, have learnt Mandarin&nbsp;and Malay at school or as a civil servant besides English.&nbsp; How many of our younger Singaporeans know Malay besides Mandarin?&nbsp; Indonesia and Malaysia are at our doorsteps.&nbsp; They are countries with a lot of economic potential and opportunities.&nbsp; When the SAF detachment arrived in Aceh for assistance during the tsunami crisis, only a handful of Singaporean officers could communicate with&nbsp;the ordinary Indonesians.&nbsp; While English may be spoken in the big cities, speaking the local language will help a long way towards bridging and understanding, and building goodwill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I urge the Minister to allow more flexibility for students to learn the second and third languages, especially if we are to be a global city.&nbsp; And if this is recognised as important, then the time and the resources can always be found for it.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The mother said, "Yes,&nbsp;borrow money,&nbsp;pay money.&nbsp; But the pupils&nbsp;owe homework,&nbsp;pay homework."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there had been many reforms and adjustments in our Mother Tongue education, such as acceptance of the White Paper on Chinese Language Teaching in 2004, the "Chinese B" scheme, the relaxation of requirements for Mother Tongue&nbsp;for university admission in order to ensure that our next generation would continue to study Chinese.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE has said that more flexible and lively methods would be adopted to teach the language and to inculcate a love for the language among the students.&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister whether the example I quoted above is an example of "innovative" teaching.&nbsp; Are our schools making efforts to implement the recommendations embodied in the White Paper on Chinese Language Teaching reform?&nbsp; Why was the teacher still using that kind of teaching method?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether the lowering of requirement for entry into university education has led to the decrease in the number of students&nbsp;taking the Mother Tongue subject.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng--><p align=left>Column: 1343</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Ah Heng</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; Sir, whether it is for economic reasons or to enable our own culture and traditions to be sustained and developed, the Government has repeatedly stressed the importance of learning our Mother Tongue language.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education has recently reviewed its policy on the learning and teaching of the Chinese Language.&nbsp; I understand that it is also in the process of reviewing the policy on other Mother Tongue languages.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what is the progress in enhancing the learning and teaching of Mother Tongue languages in the schools.&nbsp; Is the MOE satisfied with the present progress or is there room for further improvement?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Cheng Bock--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

School buildings are important.&nbsp; They provide a sense of history, identity and attachment for&nbsp;their students.&nbsp; But, nowadays, schools seem to be torn down as fast as the new ones are being built.&nbsp; We seem to pay more attention to the building of new schools.&nbsp; I think it is very disruptive and affects students because of transport and distance from home.&nbsp; And how&nbsp;do we&nbsp;develop alumni when&nbsp;we do not have a common reference point?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my point is: why can the planners not think long term?&nbsp; It is a very expensive exercise and should be avoided, as good times do not last forever.&nbsp; I just want to caution that we should be more careful with spending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is: why is a primary school built so big?&nbsp; Sir, have you seen Henry Park Primary School?&nbsp; I am sure you would have thought that it is an industrial building, with a big ramp running across the front of the building.&nbsp; I wonder how a Primary 1 student feels, just fresh from a void deck kindergarten, when he goes to this school.&nbsp; I think he will suffer a shock.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1344</p>I am hoping that, next time,&nbsp;let us have some sense of proportion when we build primary schools.&nbsp; They are young children.&nbsp; Give them a chance to play.&nbsp; Give them a chance to be educated in a very nice environment.</p></span></div>													<!--TITLE_NAME:COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY REPORTING PROGRESS--><p align=left>Column: 1344</p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
