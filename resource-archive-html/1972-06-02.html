<div align="center"><b>WHARVES AT TANJONG PAGAR</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Reduction in usage and effects)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications if he will ascertain from the  Port

of  Singapore  Authority (a)  in  respect  of  the

Authority's  wharves  at Tanjong  Pagar,  for  the

first quarter of 1972 and the corresponding period

of 1971 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the aggregate number and tonnage of vessels

that were berthed at those wharves;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the aggregate tonnage of cargo loaded on

and off the vessels so berthed;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the aggregate revenue of the Authority

arising  from the berthing of the vessels  and

the  handling of cargo loaded on and  off  the

vessels: and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the aggregate number of man-days put in by

the  Authority's employees in relation to  the

berthing  of  the vessels and the handling  of

cargo loaded on and off the vessels; and



<br><br>(b) the explanation for the reduction in the usage

of  the Authority's wharves at Tanjong Pagar;  and

whether  the  Authority is  taking  any  steps  to

rectify  the  loss  of potential  revenue  to  the

Authority  and  to alleviate the hardship  of  the

Authority's   employees  who   have   suffered   a

reduction  in  take-home pay consequent  upon  the

reduced usage of those wharves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!--Dr Toh Chin Chye(Minister for Science and Technology, and Acting Minister for Communications)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Communications (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> The take-home pay of Port of Singapore

Authority  workers for the first quarter  of  1972

was affected slightly. The cause is partly because

of  the  new  tariffs. However,  there  are  other

factors such as the decline in trade between Japan

and the United States with the rest of the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



The  PSA is watching the position closely and will

take every measure to ensure that no hardship will

be caused to its workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In respect of the PSA wharves at Tanjong

Pagar  for  the  first quarter  of  1972  and  the

corresponding period of 1971:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 999 ships with a tonnage of 3.79 million NRT

were berthed in 1972, as compared with 1,032 ships

with 3.54 million NRT for the same period in 1971;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 2.31 million tonnes of cargo (including

general,  fuel and bulk) were loaded  on  and  off

these  vessels  in  1972, as  compared  with  2.53

million tonnes for the same period in 1971;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) total revenue, including port dues,

pilot  age  and  dock dues, wharf labour  revenue,

storage   rent,  wharf  age  and  other   revenues

connected  with  these  ships  and  cargo  handled

amounted to $34.39 million for the period  January

to  March  1972, as compared with $24.229  million

for the same period in 1971;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) PSA figures for work done by its employees

at the wharf are not kept in terms of man-days but

in  terms of gang-hours. For the first quarter  of

1972  the  total  gang-hours  worked  amounted  to

99,530,  as  compared with 131,949  for  the  same

period in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The reduction in the usage of the PSA wharves

at  Tanjong Pagar is one of the objectives of  the

new   tariffs  introduced  with  effect  from  1st

January, 1972. The new tariffs ensured that  there

will be more effective utilisation of the wharves,

less  congestion, quicker working of  cargoes  and

more expeditious turn-round time of ships. Average

turn-round time per vessel dropped from 49X  hours

in  1971 to 39 hours in 1972. Average waiting time

for a berth dropped from five hours in 1971 to one

and  a  quarter  hours in 1972.  These  are  being

achieved with no loss in revenue at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> From the

answer, it is obvious that there is a reduction in

workload  resulting  in a reduction  in  take-home

pay. Sir, can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  tell the House what concrete  steps

has  the  PSA  taken  to alleviate  this  hardship

arising out of the reduction in the take-home pay?

Also  as  a  result of the reduction of  workload,

will  there  be any redundancy in PSA amongst  the

employees?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has

been  no reduction at all in take-home pay because

of  the  improved productivity. What has happened,

of  course, is that the port workers earn  a  full

month's  wages for working 19 to 20  days  of  the

month,  and for the rest of the month they  go  on

holiday.  I  think  this is  the  reason  for  the

impression that there has been a reduced  workload

at  the  port.  However, since 1964  the  PSA  has

guaranteed its daily-rated port workers a  monthly

minimum  earning  computed under  an  arithmetical

formula  of  26  times the sum of  the  individual

worker's  daily  basic salary, plus  his  cost  of

living allowance, average shift allowance payable,

plus  30  times his daily housing allowance.  This

minimum  earning  does not include  any  incentive

bonus payment, which is dependent on productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add this further information to

assure  the  Member  for Telok  Blangah  that  the

integrated gang labour during the first quarter of

this  year  had an average of 25 days'  work,  and

most  of them earned either more or less than what

they  earned last year. For the period January  to

March  1972, as compared with the same period  for

1971,  out  of  a  total of 2,122 integrated  gang

labourers, 1,376 had increased earnings whilst 746

had  decreased  earnings. The  port  and  shipping

industry is an industry in which there can  be  no

consistent level of work. On some days, more  work

is performed above the average requirements, while

on other days there are shortfalls. It is for this

reason  that  the PSA has resorted to  a  pool  of

casual labour who could be asked to supplement the

normal  labour force on those occasions  when  the

demand for labour exceeds the supply, and who also

act as substitutes for permanent labourers who are

on leave or absent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casual labourers consist of unemployed workers

registered  with the Ministry of Labour  and  also

with the Pont Authority. The registration of these

casual labourers does not imply that the PSA  will

automatically offer them work daily. But on  those

days  when  the casual labourers report and  offer

themselves for work and should there be no work, a

payment  of  $1 is made to each worker  so  as  to

assist him to recover his travelling expenses. The

present poo1 of casual labourers has been  on  the

register since February 1971. The total number  is

about 424 as at the end of March 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of 1972, no casual

labourer  has less than 14 days' work in a  month.

In  fact, casual labourers have an average  of  19

days' work per month. However, it is the policy of

the  Port Authority to gradually ease out the pool

of  casual labourers into the general labour pool,

and  this should be so particularly at this moment

when  there  is a shortage of labour in Singapore,

and it is important that we should not keep such a

large  pool of casual labour around the port.  But

after  consultation  with representatives  on  the

Board,  we  have  agreed that the pool  should  be

eased  off  gradually so as to enable  the  casual

labourers to re-adjust themselves to another  form

of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said, Mr Speaker, points out the fact

that  the improved methods which have been adopted

at  the Port have increased productivity, and  the

fact  that the average worker is earning a month's

salary  in half the time that he used to do should

ordinarily be regarded as a boom to the  industry.

But  it  is  unfortunate that at this period  when

there  is a recession in world trade, particularly

between Japan and the United States, the slack  or

the  leisure time which should have been  occupied

in fruitful work has not been made available. I am

afraid  the Port Authority is not responsible  for

this,  as  it  is  not  in control  of  the  world

economic  situation.  However,  I  would  like  to

assure  the Member for Telok Blangah that no  gang

labour registered with the Port Authority will  be

regarded as redundant labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Just one more supplementary

question, Sir, lf, by the increased output of  the

workers, they are able to earn 20 days' wages  for

work which they would normally perform in 16 days,

as  the Minister has said just now, would the  PSA

guarantee  26  days'  wages  as  they   had   been

promised, irrespective of the fact whether work is

available  for them or not? In respect  of  easing

out  casual labourers who are just staying  behind

and doing nothing, when is it going to take place?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I have in my answer earlier, Mr

Speaker,  said that this has been going  on  since

1964,  and  the PSA has assured these  daily-rated

port  workers a monthly minimum earning which  has

been  computed 26 times the sum of the  individual

worker's   basic  salary,  plus  cost  of   living

allowance, shift allowance, housing allowance, and

so on. This is still going on.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, if the vessels

are not berthed alongside the wharves, how can the

labourer get more pay? So many vessels are in  the

outer  roads discharging cargo by putting it  into

lighters  which then take it to the wharves.  Sir,

will  the Minister take action to see that no ship

must be allowed to unload in outer roads, but must

come  alongside the wharves? Only  then  will  the

labourers get more work and more pay.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the answer to the

statement  made  by the Member  for  Anson  is  an

English quotation which says that "You can take  a

horse  to  the  water,  but you  cannot  make  him

drink". The reason why the port worker earns  more

money  is  due to the increased tariffs,  although

there are even fewer number of ships coming in.  I

think that gives him the right answer.

<div align="center"><b>PEOPLE'S ASSOCIATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sports promotion through community centres)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Culture if the People's Association will give full

support to the National Sports Promotion Board  by

mobilising  all  its resources  at  the  community

centres  in bringing about a new milieu in  sports

in the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there :s large scope for co-operation between the National Sports Promotion

Board  and the People's Association in respect  of

promoting and organising sporting activities.  The

National   Sports   Promotion   Board   has   been

established  to  encourage,  develop  and  promote

sports  on  a national basis, whilst the  People's

Association   has,  among  its   objectives, the

responsibility  of organising and promoting  group

participation in social, cultural, educational and

athletic activities for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the People's Association

cannot mobilise all its resources at the community

centres   just  for  the  promotion  of   athletic

activities,   as   the  role   of   the   People's

Association embraces a much wider scope.  However,

the  Association will be willing to contribute its

share in bringing about a new milieu in sports  in

the   Republic.  The  Director  of  the   People's

Association is currently a member of the Board  of

Directors  of the National Sports Promotion  Board

and    close   co-ordination   between   the   two

organisations can be expected.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  will the Minister indicate in what  way  can

the  People's Association contribute towards  this

objective?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> It can contribute, for

instance,  by  allowing the ordinary  use  of  the

community  centre premises. Apart from that,  very

much  depends on the sports organisations and  the

management committees of the community centres  in

the respective constituencies.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in new residential

areas,   adequate  sports  facilities  have   been

included  as  part of the overall  requirement  of

community  services. Admittedly, there  are  older

residential  areas, including  outlying  areas  of

Singapore, for which sports facilities  are  still

lacking. Both the Ministry of National Development

and  the  Ministry of Social Affairs are aware  of

the  need  to  plan for more sports facilities  in

these  areas but these must be based on  the  felt

needs of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing emphasis will be placed in the

future  in  providing more sports  and  recreation

facilities  to  meet  the  requirements  for  such

facilities as more and more people take to leisure

and  the  competitive  sports  as  spectators  and

participants. It is, therefore, proposed to set up

a  committee  comprising  representatives  of  the

Ministries of Social Affairs, National Development

and  Education  and the National Sports  Promotion

Board   to   make   an  overall  review   of   the

requirements for sports facilities in relation  to

the  Singapore  population and on  geographic  and

demographic  considerations  and  to  relate   the

results to general policy and planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a swimming pool for the Charlton Park

area,   the   Minister  for   Law   and   National

Development has indicated to me that his  Ministry

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



be  prepared  to give every due consideration  to

the  proposal, and the National Sports  Promotion

Board has been requested to look into the request

with  a view to ascertaining that there is a real

need  for the facility and that it will be  fully

utilised by the people in the area.

<div align="center"><b>(Adequacy of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Social   Affairs  (a)  what  are  the  activities

carried on in children's centres and creches; and

(b) if the number of creches presently run by his

Ministry is adequate; whether there are plans for

the  opening of new creches; and if one of  those

creches  can be situated in a locality convenient

for  the  use  of  residents in the  Tanjong  Rhu

Housing Estate.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Social

Welfare  Department is currently operating  eight

children's   centres.   These   centres   provide

elementary  education and training for non-school

going  children between the ages of five  and  15

years.   In  addition  to  classroom  work,   the

children  are  taught arts and crafts, basketry.

sewing  and  carpentry, physical training,  games

and  kindergarten activities depending  on  their

age. They are given one light meal a day and  are

provided  with regular medical and  dental  care.

The  Social Welfare Department, working in  close

liaison  with  the  Ministry of  Education, also

looks into the arrangements for the admission  of

the  children into regular schools. In 197!.  489

children have been so admitted. As the number  of

non-school  going children is on the decline  and

as  the People's Association is operating a large

number  of  kindergarten  classes,  there  is   a

diminishing  need  for  children's  centres.  The

Social Welfare Department, therefore, has no plan

to expand this programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department also operates ii creches. These

creches  offer  a  day-care  service  for   young

children so as to enable their parents to give of

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



best while at work. The nutritious meals provided

in  the  creches will help overcome  malnutrition

among  young children of working parents and  the

kindergarten  training given to  them  will  give

them a better start in life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our present needs, the 11 existing creches

and  two  more under construction -  one  in  Toa

Payoh  New  Town  Centre and  the  other  in  the

Kallang  Industrial Estate - would appear  to  be

adequate. In its long-term planning, however, the

Social   Welfare  Department  has  included   the

establishment of creches in Queenstown and  other

Housing and Development Board estates where there

is  a high concentration of working mothers.  The

Department will look into the need for setting up

a  creche  in  the Katong/Tanjong  Rhu  area  for

possible inclusion in the Housing and Development

Board's   plans  for  the  development   of   the

reclaimed land along the East Coast of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Government is encouraging the

private   sector,  particularly  the   industrial

establishments,  to provide creches  where  there

are   a  large  number  of  working  mothers   as

employees.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

can  the  Minister tell us how long it will  take

for  the long-term development plan that  he  has

described to mature in respect of the development

of more creches'? This need is especially felt in

view of our intention to encourage more women  to

join the work force.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I

cannot  tell the Member off-hand. It is  a  long-term  policy. I personally would like to see  the

creches built as soon as possible. However, there

is  the question of funds, and also other aspects

have to be considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, can I obtain from

the  Minister  a more specific assurance  that  a

creche  will be built to serve the people  living

in  the  Tanjong Rhu housing estate, because  the

sea  front  is still a couple of miles away  from

where I would personally like the creche to be?

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under Stage I

of  the  new town development, 15,000  flats  for

about 75,000 people will be built in Woodlands. A

large commercial centre with shopping facilities,

cinemas,   cooked   food  centres   and   parking

facilities   for   vehicles   awaiting    customs

clearance will be developed near the Customs  and

Immigration check point at the Causeway.  A  post

office,  a  maternity and child health centre,  a

creche,   a  Public  Utilities  Board  collection

centre,  a commercial hall and an area office  of

the  Housing and Development Board will  also  be

provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodlands New Town, to be developed by the

Housing  and Development Board over a  period  of

about 15 years, will eventually cover an area  of

about  2,500 acres. Most of the residents in  the

satellite town will be employed in the industrial

and  other economic activities within and  around

the township. Residential development will follow

the  neighbourhood principle, similar to that  in

Queenstown  and Toa Payoh. A market  and  cooked-food  centre  will be provided  in  the  shopping

centre  of each neighbourhood. Sites for  schools

will  be  set  aside for primary,  secondary  and

vocational  education.  A few  community  centres

will  be  built  in each neighbourhood,  together

with sports and recreational facilities.

Act,



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full list of all licensed chit fund companies

will   be  published  in  the  Government  Gazette

annually  in  the month of April. In  between,  my

Ministry will make periodic announcements of newly-licensed chit fund companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the present, let me say that when the Chit

Funds  Act came into force on 14th January,  1972,

the   Commissioner  of  Chit  Funds  received   89

applications from companies carrying on chit  fund

business  on  1st October, 1971, for  licences  to

conduct chit fund business under the new Act.  The

Commissioner issued provisional licences to 84  of

these    companies.   Of   the   remaining    five

applications,  three  were rejected  because  they

were  not  carrying on chit fund business  on  1st

October,  1971,  and the other two withdrew  their

applications.  The names of companies  which  were

granted provisional licences were gazetted on 28th

April, 1972.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30th March, 1972, the Commissioner directed

all chit fund companies to comply with the minimum

capital  requirements of the Chit Funds Act.  This

requires  a  chit fund company to have  a  paid-up

capital  of not less than 5200,000, half of  which

must  be deposited with the Monetary Authority  of

Singapore.   Of  the  84  companies  issued   with

provisional  licences, 49 companies which  have  a

paid-up  capital  of not less than  S200,000  have

deposited half of their paid-up capital  with  the

requirements of the law, they have conducted their

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Of course, these inspections are

from  the very detailed breakdown of the companies

that  we have made investigations into the  nature

categorised  them,  so  that  we  can  tell  which

those  which  we  have decided may  be  below  the

minimum standard.

those companies which have been fully licensed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Yes, Sir. The idea is that we

shall  inspect all these companies  from  time  to

time,  as  we  do  at  times banks  and  insurance

companies,  and  try  and get them  to  regularise

their  activities in accordance with  the  law.  I

think  the standards which we have encountered  in

inspections of these companies are very much below

the standards we expect of the other older finance

companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see no reason

to  change  our  present  policy  with  regard  to

Government officers wishing to attend local  trade

union  courses, which is to require these officers

to  use for this purpose, their available vacation

leave  and only when the leave accumulated by  the

officers is insufficient to cover the duration  of

the  course,  to  accord them full-pay  unrecorded

leave  for the remainder of the course. In effect,

the  officers  receive  full  pay  throughout  the

duration  of  the  course. This  practice  is  not

ungenerous, when considered in relation to another

regulation  for  a Government officer  wishing  to

apply  for permission to attend a course of  study

leading to a degree, diploma or other professional

technical  qualifications. If  such  a  course  is

considered  of  direct  value  to  his   Ministry,

approval  may  be  given on  the  basis  that  the

officer  must use up his vacation leave,  if  any,

and thereafter is given no-pay leave only. I would

suggest that a unionist should be prepared to make

the  small  sacrifice entailed  in  consuming  his

vacation leave in attending, by his own choice,  a

course  organised by his union. This  should  make

him  more appreciative of the value of the course.

and perhaps more critical in accepting nomination.

shall be equally generous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, it is not law. It is in

collective agreements. I can show to the  Minister

that the private sector gives better terms



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindasamy, are you starting a

debate or asking a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Minister asked

whether  I  can show the terms. I can  show  them.

Will  the  Minister consider giving civil servants

better terms than are accorded them at the moment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> My understanding is that the

private  sector is not just one body.  Perhaps  if

the  Member can show me that all employers in  the

private sector give equally generous terms,  I  am

sure I shall be able to match what has been given.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware of

the  ILO  resolution  in  1965  recommending  that

governments  accord full pay leave for  attendance

in  trade union courses? If the Minister is aware,

are we subscribing to the ILO resolution?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I am not aware of that

particular resolution. But I believe that not  all

ILO  resolutions are observed by all the countries

which attend ILO conferences.

<div align="center"><b>CROSSING AT KALLANG BASIN AND FUTURE OF THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SHIPYARDS AND INDUSTRIES IN THE AREA</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Law and National Development)</b></div>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, on hte 4th August, 1971, I stated in an oral

answer to a question by the Member for Mount-batten on the

future of the shipyards and slipways at Kallang that "It is

likely that existing shipyards and slop-ways in hte Kallang

Park Industrial Estate will have to be resited elsewhere in

five to eight years' time" [Hansard, Vol. 31, cols. 196-7].

Subsequently a petition was received from 28 shipyards in the

locality appealing for reconsideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new major traffic highway to link the City with the

eastern part of the island is now under construction along the East Coast

reclaimed land. This Expressway entails a crossing at the

entrance to the Kallang Basin to link Tanjong Rhu with the

City Centre. The Consultants, who carried out a feasibility study on

the basis of economic considerations, the construction of a three-lane

carriageways at an estimated cost of $19 million.

A section of the bridge could be opened at specific times to

allow for the passage of ships, thus enabling shipyards and

industries situated there to continue operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative proposal to constuct a dam for the proposed crossing

and to convert the Kallang Basin into a stoage reservoir cum scenic

lake has also been investigated. It has been ascertained

that the densely populated catchments of the Kallang and Geylang

Rivers yield highly polluted water which is discharged into the Kallang

Basin. Pre-treatment of the water would be neccessary before

storage in hte proposed lake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the costs fo this dam, pre-treatment and maintenance, must be added

the costs of resettling the 28 shipyards, two electrial companies,

one flour mill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



and  148  small establishments, like firewood  and

charcoal  firms,  timber  yards  and  small   boat

builders.  Their gross fixed assets are  estimated

at   $35  million,  with  their  contribution   to

Government  revenue approximating $3  million  per

year.  These industrial and commercial enterprises

together employ about 8,610 workers. Their  annual

industrial production is estimated at $73 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the heavy costs for benefits not

commensurate  to  the costs,  the  Government  has

decided  not to construct a dam to convert Kallang

Basin into a reservoir. Instead, a drawbridge will

be  built and is expected to be completed by about

1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owners of shipyards, slipways and industries

in  the  Basin will be glad to know that they  can

continue  and  even  expand their  operations  .at

their  present  sites.  They  will  be  given  the

opportunity to make representations as to how this

drawbridge will affect their operations,  so  that

the   minimum  of  hindrance  is  caused,   whilst

allowing a second East Coast highway to be built.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be given an

opportunity  to say a few words, because  some  of

the  shipbuilding and ship repairing  concerns  as

well as the other small operators are sited in  my

constituency?  I  am  sure the shipyard  operators

will  consider this a very pleasant surprise. Many

of   the   shipyard  operators,  including   local

entrepreneurs  using local capital, have  expended

many   tens   of  millions  of  dollars   on   the

establishment   of  these  shipyards   and   their

development.  In  the construction  of  the  small

ships, sophisticated lines of development too have

been    observed.   There   has   been   displayed

considerable  ingenuity  and  hard  work  in   the

exploitation of the limited space available in the

area  to build such a progressive industry as  the

shipbuilding and ship repairing industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this decision on the part of the

Government  in  regard to the continuance  of  the

industries in the Tanjong Rhu area will also imply

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



continuing  and constructive relationship  between

the  Government  and  the  shipbuilding  and  ship

repairing firms, so that further development  will

lead  to the benefit of both the community as well

as  the  entrepreneurs  there.  It  is  hoped  the

shipbuilders and ship repairers, and those  having

industries  there,  will  observe  the  rules   of

keeping  the atmosphere and the environment  clean

and  pollution free. At the same time, I am  glad,

Sir,  that  the  Government  will  look  into  the

problems  of  such  dislocating  effects  to   the

industries  at Tanjong Rhu, which may  be  brought

about  by the building of the bridge. On the other

hand,  I  hope  that the expansion of shipbuilding

and  ship  repairing activities will not adversely

affect  the development of recreational and  other

provisions in the area.

<div align="center"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>

<br><br>3.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled

"An  Act to amend the Employment Act (Chapter  122

of the Revised Edition)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Now, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency signed by the President

in respect of the Bill, laid upon the Table by the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the National Wages

Council,     a    tripartite    body    comprising

representatives  from labour, management  and  the

Government,  put  forward certain  recommendations

for  wage  increases and on bonuses.  Members  are

also aware that at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



NTUC  May  Day  Rally  held  last  month,  I   had

announced that the agreed recommendations  of  the

Council  had  been  accepted  by  the  Government.

However,  I  emphasised  in  my  speech  that  "in

accepting  the  recommendations  of  the  National

Wages  Council,  the  Government  would  like   to

underline the fact that they are guidelines.  They

are not hard and fast rules." I pointed out that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The employers' representatives represent

established medium and large size businesses.  The

unions   reflect  the  interests   of   the   NTUC

affiliates.  In  arriving at the  guidelines,  the

National   Wages  Council  has  used  the   bigger

employers  as  the  norm. Even within  this  norm,

there can be wide variations between commerce  and

industry,  and between different companies  within

the  same category. Some will be able to meet much

more  than the 8 per cent recommended. Others  may

barely be able to meet even half of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variations will be even wider in the case of the

smaller employers.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also struck a note of caution that:



`as  this  is  the first year of the work  of  the

National   Wages   Council,  many   problems   and

anomalies  may arise out of their recommendations.

They will have to be sorted out with goodwill  and

good sense also as guides.'



<br><br>To  enable  the  recommendations of  the  National

Wages   Council   to   be   implemented,   certain

amendments   to  the  Employment   Act   and   the

Industrial Relations Act would have to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, certain misunderstandings had arisen

with   regard  to  the  interpretation  of   these

recommendations   and   with   regard    to    the

Government's general acceptance of the  principles

enunciated   in   the  National  Wages   Council's

recommendations. On the 23rd of May, the  National

Wage  Council and representatives of the  Chambers

of   Commerce,  Singapore  Employers   Federation,

National     Employees'     Council,     Singapore

Manufacturers' Association and the  NTUC  met  the

Prime Minister and myself to discuss ways in which

the  recommendations of the National Wages Council

could   be   given  effect.  Hon.  Members   would

recollect  the  press statement  issued  by  these

bodies after the meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It was unanimously agreed that the

recommendations  of  the  National  Wages  Council

should not be approached in a legalistic way.  The

recommendations should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



not  be converted into legislation. Insofar as the

National   Wages   Council  recommendations   were

contrary   to   any  existing  legislation,   such

legislation should be amended, to remove any legal

impediment   to   the   implementation   of    the

recommendations.    Further,    where     enabling

provisions were necessary, for example, to make it

possible  for  an employer to opt for  either  the

13th  annual  payment and a bonus, or 13th  annual

payment and an annual wage revision, such enabling

legislation should be passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was agreed that where in any particular case

no agreement could be reached between employer and

union and a dispute was referred to the Industrial

Arbitration   Court,  the  Industrial  Arbitration

Court should take into account the recommendations

of  the  National  Wages Council and  the  special

circumstances of that particular employer,'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment (Amendment) Bill now before the

House  was  drafted in the light of the agreements

as contained in the said press statement. The Bill

had  been  commented  upon by the  National  Wages

Council whose suggestions were incorporated in the

present Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact section 46 of the Employment Act to enable

an  employee  or  a trade union  of  employees  to

negotiate  for the payment of any of the following

or a combination thereof, as is referred to in the

following paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an annual wage supplement of an amount not

exceeding the equivalent of three months' wages of

an employee;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an annual bonus of an amount not exceeding

the  equivalent  of  three  months'  wages  of  an

employee;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) annual wage increases.



<br><br>A   trade  union  of  employees  is  entitled   to

negotiate for the payment of either both an annual

wage  supplement and an annual bonus  or  both  an

annual wage supplement and annual wage

increases.  An  employer has a right  to  make  an

option between negotiating for the payment of both

an  annual wage supplement and a bonus or both  an

annual  wage supplement and annual wage increases.

An  employer who cannot afford to pay any  of  the

aforesaid combinations may offer to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



negotiate  to  pay  an annual wage  supplement  or

bonus  or  annual wage increases. An employer  who

cannot afford to pay any of these benefits is  not

compelled to pay. The provisions of the Industrial

Relations Act shall apply to these negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms "annual wage supplement" and "annual

wage  increases"  are defined  in  the  Bill.  The

annual  wage  supplement is intended to  have  the

same meaning as the 13th month payment recommended

by the National Wages Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual wage supplement that shall be payable

by  an employer who has paid annual bonuses to his

employees  prior to the commencement of  this  Act

shall  be equivalent to the average of the bonuses

paid  in respect of the last three years preceding

the commencement of this Act or to the last annual

bonus paid, whichever is the greater, subject to a

maximum  of an amount equivalent to three  months'

wages  of  his employees, except that  where  such

bonuses were based on exceptional trading results,

etc., which the employer finds have diminished  to

a  significant degree, the employer may  negotiate

for  a lower quantum of the annual wage supplement

to  be paid. If an employer has not paid any bonus

to  his employees or has paid a bonus of less than

one  month's wages before the commencement of this

Act,  the  annual wage supplement payable  by  him

shall   not  exceed  one  month's  wages  of   the

employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a notice is served under section 17 of the

Industrial Relations Act by an employer or a trade

union  of employees in respect of the annual  wage

supplement, annual bonus or annual wage  increases

referred to in subsection (I) of section 46, or  a

combination   thereof  as  is   referred   to   in

subsections  (2) and (3) of that section,  and  no

agreement is reached between the parties on any of

those   matters,  either  of  the   parties   may,

notwithstanding the provisions of  the  Industrial

Relations Act, refer the matter to the Court which

may make a decision thereon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions are inserted in the Employ, ment Act

which  enable an employer to invite a trade  union

of  employees,  and for the latter  to  invite  an

employer  to  negotiate for  the  variation  of  a

collective agreement or award made before or after

the enactment of the Bill by including a provision

for   the   payment  of  either  an  annual   wage

supplement  or  an  annual bonus  or  annual  wage

increases, or a combination thereof as is referred

to  previously.  Where  no  agreement  is  reached

between  an  employer or trade  union  to  vary  a

collective  agreement or award in accordance  with

subsection  (1)  of  section 46A,  either  of  the

parties may, notwithstanding the provisions of the

Industrial  Relations Act, apply to the  Court  to

vary  the collective agreement or award,  and  the

Court  may vary the collective agreement or  award

as the Court thinks fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any variation of a collective agreement or award

shall   be   incorporated  into   the   collective

agreement  or award, and any of the parties  bound

thereby  may  apply  to  the  Court  to  vary  the

collective agreement or award so as to give effect

to  their agreement, and the Court may accordingly

vary  the  collective  agreement  or  award.   The

collective  agreement  or award  so  varied  shall

continue in force for the period of the collective

agreement   or  award,  or  until  the  collective

agreement or award is further varied by the Court,

whichever first occurs. A collective agreement  or

award that is so varied shall have effect from the

date of the variation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, opportunity is also taken to

amend  section 38 of the Employment Act  to  raise

the  limit  imposed on overtime work by  employees

from  48  hours per month to 96 hours  per  month.

This  amendment is necessary in view of  the  near

full  employment situation in Singapore  resulting

in  serious  shortage  of  certain  categories  of

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has acknowledged time and

again  that  the present favourable state  of  the

economy  is in great measure due to the hard  work

and   effort  put  in  by  the  workers,  by   the

sacrifices  they  have made and by  the  restraint

which they have shown. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



Government  is aware of the needs and  aspirations

of  the workers and the underlying purpose of this

legislation is to ensure that workers in Singapore

may  have their fair share of the prosperity  that

has been generated by the present buoyant economic

conditions.  Employers  generally  recognise  that

workers  should  have an increased  share  in  the

profits  of their undertakings. However, all  this

does not mean that excessive and unbridled demands

should be made upon employers - such demands  must

be  tampered by reasonableness and moderation.  By

the same token, employers are expected to exercise

the  quality  of  reasonableness  in  meeting  the

claims of their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Amendment Bill now introduced by the Minister

for   Labour  has  come  about  because   of   the

recommendations  of  the National  Wages  Council.

This  has  a very important bearing on the  future

economic  growth of our industrial programme.  The

introduction of this Bill may affect the viability

of  many  companies  which have  been  established

during  the  last  few years as a  result  of  our

attractive   financial   inducements   and    good

industrial   relations,   and   other   favourable

investment factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to point out to the House that

not  all these industrial firms are making profits

and many of them are still struggling hard to keep

on  an  even keel. Therefore, it is vital that  an

opportunity should be given to employers to  study

the  Bill  more thoroughly, and at the  same  time

unions must keep a level-headed attitude in  their

demands  arising from the recommendations  of  the

National Wages Council, and not to kill the  goose

that  lays  the golden eggs. The workers  are  the

first  to  suffer if their demands are so exacting

as  to  hasten the company to become less able  to

break even, or force the company to close down and

fall  into  the  arms  of  the  receivers.  As  an

employer, I am all in favour of workers getting  a

fairer share of the cake.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of what I have said,

the   Bill  has  a  serious  implication  on   our

Republic's  economic survival. I would  move  that

the Bill be referred to a Select Committee instead

of  passing  the Bill on a Certificate of  Urgency

today so that employers may have a chance to study

the  Employment (Amendment) Bill in depth  and  in

detail.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the  Member  for River Valley only in  respect  of

sending  this Bill to a Select Committee, and  not

on   the  part  where  he  talks  of  level-headed

unionists  and  so  on  and employers  not  making

profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has been introduced on a

Certificate of Urgency. When the Minister  made  a

lengthy speech on the Second Reading, I was trying

to  make notes of his speech, and at the same time

I was thinking whether it was really necessary and

urgent that we must take this Bill through all its

stages in today's sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister was right when he said that the

National  Employees  Council,  the  Manufacturers'

Association, the NTUC, the Government, as well  as

the  Chambers of Commerce met on the 23rd May.  We

decided that, irrespective of legislative changes,

we should go ahead with the recommendations of the

National Wages Council. Sir, you must have read in

the  newspapers  that  a  number  of  unions  have

submitted claims and have invited the employers to

negotiate  on the Wages Council's recommendations.

We have not come across any hitch as yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the speech made by the Minister just

now,  Sir,  I myself, having been associated  with

trade  unions, am confused with a number of  terms

that   he  referred  to,  such  as  "annual   wage

supplement", a phrase which I hear for  the  first

time.  If  I can be confused, other union  members

will  be  more confused with such terms  as  "13th

month   wage",   "annual  bonus",   "annual   wage

increases",  and he also mentioned "a  combination

of all three".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill does not only put into effect the

recommendations of the National Wages Council, but

it  also recommends some other changes. One of the

changes   that   he  proposes  to   introduce   is

increasing the limit of overtime, from 48 hours to

96   hours  per  month.  This  will  have  further

implications.  1  have  spoken  on  at  least  two

occasions  in this Chamber about the  problems  of

limiting  overtime, especially  in  the  essential

services.  Therefore,  I support  the  Member  for

River  Valley that we submit this Bill to a Select

Committee  instead of hurrying its passage  today.

On  that  note,  Sir,  I hope  the  Minister  will

reconsider his decision to carry this Bill through

all its three stages today.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  very  glad that  the  Government  has

accepted the recommendations of the National Wages

Council. 1 believe this is in appreciation of  the

hard  work,  the sacrifices and the restraints  on

the   part  of  the  workers,  thus  helping   the

employers  to make the best possible  profits.  We

have   just  heard  from  one  of  the  employers'

representatives,   who  is  also   a   Member   of

Parliament, making recommendations that this  Bill

be sent to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers have been making a lot of sacrifices.

As  far as we are concerned, we would like to  get

the  Bill implemented as soon as possible. We  are

interested in an increase of wages for the workers

and also in a bigger bonus. We have done our part,

and we hope the employers will also do their part.

With the help from the Government side, I hope the

implementation of the Bill could be done  as  soon

as possible, without any further delay.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, flue Bill

which the Minister for Labour is introducing is  a

good  one. However, I wish to bring up some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



points

regarding  the payment of more than three  months'

bonus. Some employers are willing to pay more than

three months' bonus because of the low salaries of

their   employees.  Will  the  Minister   consider

introducing  a  minimum wage in  the  Bill?  if  a

minimum   wage  is  introduced,  the  bonus   will

probably  be  restricted  to  three  months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Minister  was  very interested about  the  private

sector.  However, nothing is being done about  the

public  sector. What does the Minister propose  to

do  about the public sector? Is he proposing  that

the  unions  should negotiate with the Government,

or  does he propose to introduce another Bill  for

the  public sector? I hope the Minister will  look

into  this  matter. It is very important  that  we

also  look after the public sector because  it  is

the  backbone of the Government. Therefore, I hope

the Minister will look into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

River Valley has expressed concern that there  may

be  many  employers who barely manage  to  survive

and, therefore, are unable to comply with some  of

the recommendations of the National Wages Council.

1  think the Government appreciates their position

and  also that of the unions and management.  That

is why representatives of the NTUC, the management

and  the  National  Wages Council  met  the  Prime

Minister  on  the 23rd May. They have agreed  that

the  recommendations of the National Wages Council

should not be translated into legislation, so that

there will be flexibility for negotiations on both

sides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has, in fact, been considered by the

National  Wages Council many times, and there  has

been  no  disagreement on the  principles  of  the

Bill.  It  is  for that reason that the  Bill  was

introduced  today  on  a Certificate  of  Urgency.

However,  since  Members have expressed  the  wish

that  they would like to have some time  to  study

the  Bill, the Government has no objection to send

the Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the public sector, I think the Member for

Anson  is  aware that the 13th month  payment  was

given to the employees in the public sector a  few

months  ago, including Members of  Parliament.  I

think  next  year  the Government  would  also  be

considering  the  conditions  of  service  in  the

public sector, if the Member for Anson will  be  a

bit more patient, the matter will be sorted out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Employment (Amendment) Bill be

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill he now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consequent to the amendments, to the

Employment Act which I have just presented to  the

House,  it has also been found necessary to  amend

certain sections of the Industrial Relations  Act,

1968.  Under  the  present  Act,  the  tenure   of

collective  agreements or awards is between  three

and  five  years. Both employers and trade  unions

represented  on  the National Wages  Council  have

expressed  the  view that this  period  is  unduly

lengthy   and  restrictive.  The  Government   has

accepted   this   representation,  and   therefore

proposes to reduce the number of years for which a

collective  agreement  or award  is  binding  from

three to five to two to three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 of the Industrial Relations Act

currently  provides  that in determining  a  trade

dispute the Industrial Arbitration Court may  have

regard  not  only to the interests of the  persons

immediately concerned but also to the interests of

the  community as a whole and, in particular,  the

condition of the economy of Singapore. It  is  now

proposed that, in addition to the above, the Court

also  pays due regard to the recommendations  made

by  the  Minister  in relation to wage  increases.

Such  recommendations, made on the advice  of  the

National Wages Council, would be published in  the

Government Gazette from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to provide that on or after

the  1st day of May, 1974, the parties bound by  a

collective  agreement or award made prior  to  the

enactment of this Bill, may make an application to

the  Industrial Arbitration Court to vary the said

agreement or award.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Employment (Amendment)

Bill  has been committed to a Select Committee,  I

shall  similarly  commit this  Bill  to  the  same

Select Committee for consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read,



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical (Therapy, Education and Research)

Act,  1965, (now Cap. 160 of the Revised  Edition)

was  passed by Parliament on 31st December,  1965,

and was brought into operation on 7th



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



January, 1966. It embodied two objectives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To allow under certain circumstances the

removal of organs or tissues or the examination of

the  body  after death. Such procedures  could  be

undertaken  when  the  person  before  death   had

expressly stated a desire that his body  at  death

be used for any of the purposes of the Act. In the

absence of any stated wishes of the person  before

death,  the  relatives could  give  the  necessary

consent for the procedures to be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To provide sufficient safeguards to ensure

that the freely expressed wishes of a person are

carried out. If there was a specific wish to

donate his eyes or an organ, this would be carried

out. Conversely, if there was a specific objection

by the person no such procedures would be carried

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safeguards, however, went further, primarily

for  goodwill,  that no such procedures  could  be

carried  out  even  if the person  had  explicitly

wanted  it  before  his death, if  there  was  any

objection by any surviving relative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost from the onset it became apparent that

there  was a conflict in the purposes of the  Act.

As  a result, it has not been as successful in its

application in promoting the purposes  of  medical

advancement.  Because of the stringent  provisions

and  ambiguities, there have been instances  where

the  hospital failed to obtain organs from a  dead

person  despite  his having given  consent  before

death  or despite consent of his relatives  having

been given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this was the result of insufficient

experience and over-caution at the time  when  the

Act   was   framed.   At  that   time   the   only

transplantation   operation  routinely   done   in

Singapore  was  the  corneal  transplant.   Kidney

transplant operations had not been quite perfected

nor   yet  undertaken  in  Singapore.  There  was,

therefore,  little experience to fall back  on  in

the  drafting  of the Act. The rapid  advances  in

medical science and technology had in the meantime

overtaken the legal provisions of the Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One defect of the Act soon became apparent. To

ensure  the  success of the transplant, the  tissue

must  be  removed  from the dead body  as  soon  as

possible  after  death.  The  legal  provisions  as

provided  by the Act do not allow this to  be  done

because of the formal procedures to be taken.  Some

of   these  provisions  are,  worse  still,   quite

ambiguous.  Another defect is that the  law  allows

any  surviving  relative to forbid a donation  with

the  result that the hospital is unable  to  comply

with  the wishes of the donor who made them  before

death. The serious defects in the Act may be listed

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is no definition of what is meant by any

"surviving relative". There is no precedent to fall

back on. Hence it could happen, even though this is

only  a theoretical possibility, that any relative,

no  matter  how far removed, could come forward  to

object  to  the  operation  being  conducted.  This

actually  occurred in the famous case of the  death

of the American authoress, Grace Metalious, who had

specifically  willed her body to a medical  school.

But  this  was  forbidden by her  next-of-kin.  The

resultant  controversy led to an amendment  to  the

law of the State of Massachusetts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) As illustrated by the example I have just

given, the properly stated wishes of the person may

be overruled by some relative at death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The phrases, that "such reasonable

enquiries  as may be practicable" must be  made  by

"the  person in lawful possession of the body of  a

deceased"  to  see  whether any  of  the  surviving

relatives (who are not defined) object to the gift,

are ambiguous. The vagueness of these provisions is

especially deplorable in view of how critical it is

that  in transplant operations the time lag between

donor's  death and the operation should be kept  as

short  as possible. A good deal of time is lost  in

going  around sounding every relative to  find  out

whether or not he or she objects to the use of  the

body for the purposes of the Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase "the person in lawful possession of the

body of a deceased" is invoked in the case where no

specific  statement has been made by  the  deceased

before death. In which case the person lawfully  in

possession  of his body can give consent.  However,

under  the  present law it is not possible  to  say

with any degree of certainty who such a person  is.

There  has,  therefore, been much debate  over  the

interpretation  of  the  words  "person  in  lawful

possession".  It  was  originally   used   by   the

draftsman of the Anatomy Act of the United  Kingdom

of  1832. This was a piece of legislation passed in

the  aftermath  of the ghoulish activities  of  the

body  snatchers of Burke and Hare. The  words  were

interpreted to include the Master of Workhouses and

likewise  the  Board of Management  of  a  hospital

where an individual dies. This appears, however, to

have  been  restricted now as not  to  include  the

hospital   management  but   executors   or   close

relatives of the deceased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, the corresponding law known

as the Human Tissue Act, 1961, on which our own Act

was  modelled  on,  had  also  been  found  to   be

inadequate.  Like our Act, it was  supposed  to  be

comprehensive  and  to provide a  charter  for  the

advancement of medicine, research and education. It

had  replaced a preceding Act known as the  Corneal

Grafting  Act of 1952 and an earlier Act  known  as

the  Anatomy  Act,  1832. It was  probably  on  the

models  of  these previous Acts that the  ambiguous

term  "person in lawful possession" had  come  down

through to our present Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this evident defect, the Health

Minister  in  the  United Kingdom in  January  1969

formed an advisory group on transplant problems  to

make recommendations on amendments, if any, to  the

Human Tissue Act, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States of America the corresponding

law is known as the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. It

is the product of three years of intensive study by

a  special committee of the National Conference  of

Commissioners  on  Uniform  State  laws.   It   had

considered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



earlier   drafts  and  reviews  by   medical   and

scientific   groups   and   also   received    the

endorsement of the American Bar Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than touch up our existing Act with

amendments  here  and there,  it  was  decided  to

repeal it and replace it with an entirely new Bill

modelled  on the United States Uniform  Anatomical

Gift Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill before the House has, therefore,

two  purposes, namely, the repeal of the  existing

Act and its re-enactment. The objectives and scope

of   its  provision  remain  the  same  while  the

operation of its provisions is now made clear  and

is without ambiguity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is designed to facilitate the donation and use

of   human   tissues  and  organs  for  transplant

operations and other medical purposes and provides

favourable legal provisions for such activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make its full beneficial impact on the

community  the  purpose for which such  anatomical

gifts  can  be  made,  the  provisions  have  been

extended  to include education and the advancement

of   dental  science.  The  existing  Act  has  no

reference to dentistry. The salient points in  the

Bill are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) It permits the removal of an organ or the

use   of  the  body  or  parts  of  the  body  for

examination  or  for  medical  education  where  a

person  has  specifically willed it in writing  or

orally in the presence of two or more witnesses. A

safeguard is provided for revocation of  the  gift

by the donor at any time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Where no specific wish has been expressed

to  make  a donation of parts of a body or  for  a

medical  examination of the dead person, authority

to  do  so  may be given by relatives  or  by  the

Director of the Medical Institution if the body is

not claimed after 24 hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safeguard here is that if it is known that

the  person  had  specifically  objected  to  such

procedures, then the procedures cannot be  carried

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Bill which differ from those

in the existing Act are as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Omission of all references to the ambiguous

expressions,   such   as   "persons   in    lawful

possession" and "having made such enquiries as may

be practicable".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) And, this is more important, that the

donor's wish takes primacy over all others. In the

existing Act, any relative may forbid the  removal

or  examination of the body and can thus veto  the

wishes of the deceased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) So as to avoid ambiguity as to which

surviving  relative or person  who  could  legally

authorise  removal  of parts  of  a  body  or  the

carrying out of a post-mortem, the Bill lists  the

relatives who may give valid consent in  an  order

of  precedence. By this, the wishes of a  relative

in a higher order in the list will take precedence

over those relatives in a lower order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, a safeguard has been written into the

provisions  in  that,  if there  be  any  conflict

between  relatives in the same order of  priority,

the  authority to examine or remove parts  of  the

body will not be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should, however, like to mention that although

it   may   be  desirable  to  make  this  law   as

comprehensive  as  possible, we have  deliberately

not touched on the point concerning the removal of

an organ from a living donor. In fact, there is no

need  to do so because within the medical services

and  profession there are codes of  conduct  which

govern  medical practice and which lay down  rules

on   determining  death,  obtaining  consent   for

donation  of  tissues and for the  examination  of

bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present stage of medical development in

Singapore, the provisions as embodied in the  Bill

together  with the safeguards should be sufficient

to  enable the use of the body or parts of a  body

for  transplants  and the advancement  of  medical

knowledge, education and research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as the

Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



Health  mentioned just now, this Bill will replace

the   present  Medical  (Therapy,  Education   and

Research) Act, 1965 (Cap. 160). Section 4  of  the

present  Act  is  incorporated in the  Bill  under

clauses  12  and  15. The present  practice  under

section  4  of the Act is that Muslim corpses  are

exempted  from post-mortem. Can the  Minister  for

Health  give an assurance that this practice  will

be continued when the Bill is passed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for Kampong Kembangan has referred to clause 15 of

the  Bill where it is provided that if a body  has

not  been  claimed for more than  24  hours  after

death, the Director may dispose of the body as  he

thinks fit. Clause 15 is, in fact, a repetition of

the old provision of section 4 of the existing Act

where it is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where the body of a deceased person has not

been  claimed  from a hospital,  nursing  home  or

other institution, maintained on public funds, for

more  than  twenty-four  hours  after  death,  the

Director  of  Medical Services may  authorise,  in

writing,  the use of the body or a specified  part

of  the body or the post-mortem examination of the

body  for  the purposes for which an authorisation

in  writing  may be given under the provisions  of

paragraph (a) or (b) of section 3.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of the Member is: what about dead

bodies   belonging  to  persons  of   the   Muslim

religion? The present practice is that if the body

of  a dead person belonging to the Muslim religion

is  not  claimed  for  more  than  24  hours,  the

Director of Medical Services would invoke  section

4  of the existing Act, which I have read out just

now,  and  get  the  Muslim Religious  Council  to

dispose  of  the  body in accordance  with  Muslim

religious  rites.  As  far  as  the  dead   bodies

belonging  to  the Muslim religion are  concerned,

they  have  not  been touched by the  Director  of

Medical  Services,  but  he  requests  the  Muslim

Religious  Council  to do so. That  has  been  the

practice  since  the existing Act  was  passed  in

1965,  and  I  can assure the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan that when this Bill is passed  the  same

practice will continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is the result of a series of mishaps

which could have been prevented, and the Bill made

unnecessary,  if some sections of the  public  had

been  co-operative and had acted with  good  sense

and  restraint. Permit me, Sir, briefly to recount

the circumstances that finally led the Government,

with  the  support of public opinion, to introduce

this  Bill, which, I do not doubt, this House will

fully endorse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firing of crackers is an ancient Chinese

custom, rooted in beliefs no longer credible among

the  better educated, but, nevertheless, remaining

an  enjoyable  way of celebrating Chinese  festive

occasions,  like  the  Chinese  New  Year.   Other

communities  have  also taken  up  the  firing  of

crackers but not the beliefs. However, the  firing

of  crackers has always presented the  problem  of

fire   hazards,  which  have  increased,  as   the

explosive  ingredients  are  improved  by   modern

scientific  knowledge.  In  addition,  hazards  of

physical injuries also have become a problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be recalled that, in February 1970,

during  the Chinese New Year festival,  there  was

indiscriminate letting off of fire-crackers. As  a

result,  there  were six deaths, 68  injured,  and

S361,000  worth of damage to property.  There  was

public  concern,  and the Parliamentary  Secretary

for  Social  Affairs announced in this Parliament,

on  the  9th of March of the same year,  that  all

firing of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



crackers  would  be prohibited in  future,  unless

permits  were  first  obtained  from  the  Police.

During  festive occasions, like Chinese New Year's

eve and Chap Goh Meh, the firing of crackers would

be  permitted for adults in certain defined areas,

and within specified hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 of the Minor Offences Act was amended

to   enforce  this  policy.  In  substance,   this

amendment  imposes  a general prohibition  on  the

discharge  of  fire-crackers  and  fireworks.  The

Deputy  Commissioner of Police, or his  authorised

representative, is empowered to lift this  general

prohibition,   either  by   way   of   a   Gazette

notification,  or  by  the issue  of  licences  to

individuals   or  public  bodies,   provided   the

discharge  of  fire-crackers  or  fireworks  takes

place  in  the areas, and within the time  limits,

stipulated by the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minor Offences (Amendment) Act, 1970, came

into operation on 19th June, 1970. Since then  the

general prohibition had been lifted for five  days

during the Chinese New Year festival of 1971,  and

for  another  five days for the same  festival  in

1972. However, sections of the public did not  co-operate or observe the conditions under which fire-

crackers  and  fireworks might be discharged.  The

result  was  further  tragedies.  In  1971,   nine

persons  were injured during the Chinese New  Year

festival.  In 1972, during the Chinese  New  Year,

members  of the public became more bold  in  their

disregard   of   the   conditions   under    which

firecrackers could be discharged. The  result  was

more  tragedies. There were 376 incidents reported

about   crackers   being  indiscriminately   fired

outside  the stipulated paces and times.  But  for

vigorous  police  action,  which  resulted  in  37

arrests,  the indiscriminate discharge of crackers

would have been far more extensive. Despite police

actions,  the  firing of crackers resulted  in  26

persons  being injured. In addition,  two  unarmed

policemen  were brutally attacked,  and  seriously

injured  when  they tried to prevent  a  group  of

persons from letting off fire-crackers unlawfully.

But for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



speedy  surgical attention, their  injuries  would

have been fatal. It is said customs die hard, but,

it  is  a  fact, they can cause deaths  and  make

cripples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the numerous breaches of the law and,

even  more  important,  the  injuries  and  deaths

resulting   from  the  indiscriminate  firing   of

crackers,  the  Government came to the  conclusion

that  the  only practicable solution  left  was  a

total ban on the possession or firing of crackers.

Public  sentiments, voiced through the newspapers,

also called for such action. The present Bill was,

therefore,  introduced  into  Parliament  on  21st

March, 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to prohibit

possession   and   discharge  or  letting-off   of

dangerous  fireworks. As defined  in  this.  Bill,

dangerous fireworks includes fire-crackers, rocket

fireworks, sand crackers, and such other fireworks

which  the  Minister may, by notification  in  the

Gazette, declare to be dangerous fireworks for the

purpose of the Bill. The prohibition of possession

of dangerous fireworks will not, however, apply to

dangerous  fireworks  brought  into  Singapore  in

transit  to  other countries. Dangerous  fireworks

brought into Singapore for this purpose will  have

to  be  stored and dealt with as the Minister  may

direct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who fails to comply with, or does any

act contrary to the provisions of the Bill will be

guilty  of an offence, and may be punished with  a

fine  not  exceeding $5,000, or with  imprisonment

for  a term not exceeding two years, or with  both

such fine and imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A police officer may arrest without warrant any

person  offending in his, view against any of  the

provisions of the Bill. Where dangerous  fireworks

are  seized by a police officer, the fireworks may

he  disposed  of as the Minister may  direct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is empowered to make regulations to

provide  for  the  better  carrying  out  of   the

provisions  of  the  Bill. The  Minister  is  also

empowered to exempt any person or class of persons

from all or any of the provisions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



Bill,  whether  absolutely  or  subject  to   such

conditions as the Minister may see fit to impose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6 of the Minor Offences Act will be

repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. Wang Lin Ken].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a `Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the

motion* standing in my name, as it appears on  the

Order Paper.



<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the reclamation of approximately 155.8

acres of the foreshore and sea-bed off

Tuas, Jurong, shown coloured orange and

marked as Stage I reclamation on the plan

marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO.

3/72" which is deposited in the Land

Office, Singapore; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the reclamation by Government of those

portions of the foreshore and sea-bed off

Tuas, Jurong, containing a total area of

818.5 acres as shown coloured purple and

marked Stage II reclamation on the same

plan.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the increasing demand for sea-front

lands  by  marine and marine-oriented  industries,

the  Jurong Town Corporation has, over the  years,

been  progressively reclaiming the  foreshore  and

seabed  at Jurong. You will recall, Sir,  that  in

1963  this House approved the reclamation of  some

214  acres of the foreshore and seabed from Sungei

Jurong  in the east to Selat Samulan in the  west.

This  reclamation  which  was  undertaken  by  the

Economic Development Board, the predecessor of the

Jurong Town Corporation, has since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



been  completed and the reclaimed land  allocated.

In  the  process,  the Board  has  in  advertently

extended the reclamation to cover the three areas,

totalling  approximately  155.8  acres,  as  shown

coloured  orange and marked as Stage I reclamation

on  the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN

NO.  3/72",  a copy of which is displayed  in  the

Library  of  this  House for  the  information  of

Members.  To regularise the position, the covering

approval  of this House, under section  4  of  the

Foreshores  Act (Chapter 270), is  now  sought  in

respect of this completed reclamation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Town Corporation also proposes to

reclaim  a  further 818.5 acres of  the  remaining

foreshore  and  seabed  off  Tuas,  Jurong,  shown

coloured purple and marked as Stage II reclamation

on  the same plan. This reclamation is expected to

be  completed by May, 1974, at an estimated  total

cost  of $19.5 million. The fill required for this

reclamation will be obtained by cutting  down  the

hills in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of this reclamation, the reclaimed

land  will  be  proclaimed as State land.  Together

with   the  adjoining  State  land  shown  coloured

yellow  on  the plan, the reclaimed  land  will  be

alienated   to   the  Corporation  on   terms   and

conditions  to be agreed with the Land  Office  for

development  for industrial, housing, institutional

and recreational purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4

of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the reclamation of approximately 155.8 acres

of the foreshore and sea-bed off Tuas Jurong, shown

coloured orage and marked as Stage I reclamation on

the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/72"

which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the reclamation by Government of those portions

of the foreshore and sea-bed off Tuans, Jurong,

containing a total area of 818.5 acres as shown coloured

purple and marked Stage II reclamation on the same plan.

<div align="center"><b>DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCES FOR EQUIPMENT USED FOR RESEARCH,</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT AND QUALITY CONTROL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for Finance to

what extent advantage has been taken of provisions whereby

accelerated depreciation can be allowed for approved

equipment used for research develpment and quality control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> No separate figures are kept for allowances

granted in respect of equipment for research, development and

quality control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special allowances for plant and machinery of industrial

enterprises (which would therefore include equipment for

research, development and quiality control) have been provided

since 1965 under the Income Tax Act at thirty-three and one-third

per cent, as against normal depreciation allowances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



of twenty per cent for other businesses. Special allowances increased from

$16,000 for two companies in 1966 to $17,574,600 for the year of

assessment 1969. Latest figures(for 1970 and 1971) are not yet

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Science and Technology has suggested that

further encouragement should be given to quality control

and research and development activiites. The Treasury considers the

provisions under the Income Tax Act already adequate as they allow for

expenditure on such activities to be fully deductible

from income, while the special allowances for

capital equipment are generous. The Treasury will, however,

be sympathetic to any further proposals which may be made.
